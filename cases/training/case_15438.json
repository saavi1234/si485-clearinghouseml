    "summary": "<p>The plaintiff in this case was a 16-year-old rising senior at the George Nelson Temper High School (Temper), which is part of the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 (KUSD), in Wisconsin. Plaintiff, who was assigned female on his birth certificate but whose gender identity is male, suffers from gender dysphoria, a <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria\">condition</a> recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. Over the course of several years, despite explanations from the plaintiff and despite receiving several signed letters from the plaintiff’s pediatrician explaining Plaintiff’s condition, KUSD officials repeatedly denied access to facilities matching Plaintiff's gender identity.</p><p>Even after hearing from a pediatrician that Plaintiff’s gender identity was male, KUSD told Plaintiff to use either the girls' restroom, or a gender-neutral, single-occupancy bathroom in the school’s office. KUSD refused to change Plaintiff’s name or gender in school records and attendance lists, and the school also initially refused to allow Plaintiff to be nominated as prom king, relenting only after petition and other protests by Plaintiff’s fellow students. </p><p>  </p><p>After learning of a lawsuit challenging a school in Virginia for denying transgender students access to bathrooms and other accommodations matching their gender identity, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14977\">G.G. v. Gloucester School Board</a>, Plaintiff began to use the boys' restrooms at school. In G.G, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) had issued a statement of interest explaining that it was the agency’s position that Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 requires that schools receiving federal funding allow transgender students to use restrooms and other single-sex, multi-occupancy facilities that match their gender identities. When confronted by KUSD officials over Plaintiff’s use of the boys’ restrooms, Plaintiff’s mother explained to them that based on the DOJ’s position, KUSD is required to allow him access to the boys’ restrooms. However, KUSD officials nevertheless maintained that Plaintiff was not allowed to use the boys’ restrooms after that meeting.</p><p>In April of 2016, Plaintiff engaged counsel who sent KUSD a letter demanding that Plaintiff be able to use the boys' restroom. When the school refused, Plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, alleging the school policy violated Title IX. Plaintiff later withdrew this complaint to file a suit on July 19, 2016, against KUSD and its superintendent in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and Title IX of the Education Amendment (20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.). </p><p>Represented by the Transgender Law Center, along with the civil-rights law firms Relman Dane & Colfax and the Robert Pledl Law Office, Plaintiff argued that KUSD’s discriminatory actions violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. He asked the court to declare that KUSD has violated Title IX and the Fourteenth Amendment and to issue a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring KUSD to take various steps to prevent further discrimination against Plaintiff.</p><p>District Judge Rudolph T. Randa was assigned to the case on July 20, 2016, but due to his unavailability, the case was reassigned on August 3, 2016, to Magistrate Judge David E. Jones. Plaintiff did not consent to have a magistrate judge enter final judgment on the matter and so the case was reassigned to Judge Pamela Pepper.</p><p>On August 15, 2016, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint using his and his mother's full names because they had already consented to the media using their names. The same day, Plaintiff also filed for a preliminary injunction, asking the court to enjoin KUSD from its discriminatory practices. Attached to the motion were various supporting statements from healthcare professionals along with the U.S. Department of Education's Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students. This Dear Colleague letter was issued on May 13, 2016, and told schools that compliance with Title IX entailed treating students consistent with their gender identity (this letter was later rescinded, on February 22, 2017, under the new Trump Administration).</p><p>KUSD filed a motion to dismiss the case on August 16, 2016, and the court heard oral arguments on that motion and the preliminary injunction. On September 21, 2016, Judge Pepper denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, and the next day she granted in part Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Pepper found that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits and enjoined the school from denying Plaintiff use of the boys' bathroom and from disciplining him in any way for using it. 2016 WL 5239829.</p><p>KUSD appealed both decisions to the Seventh Circuit on September 23, 2016, arguing that the two orders were inextricably bound and that the appeals court could not review one without the other (originally the district court had certified the order denying the motion to dismiss for immediate interlocutory appeal, but soon after revoked that certification when it concluded it had erred by including certification language in the order). In the district court, KUSD also moved to stay the preliminary injunction, arguing that it would threaten the \"constitutionally privacy interest\" of students in the school district. On October 3, 2016, Judge Pepper denied Defendants' motion to stay. 2016 WL 8846573. Litigation continued into discovery throughout the school year. Defendants requested that Plaintiff submit to an independent medical examination. Judge Pepper denied the request as moot after Plaintiff submitted his own request governing an independent medical examination.</p><p>On May 30, 2017, the Seventh Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction and denied to review the denial of the motion to dismiss, reasoning that the two issues were not inextricably bound. Notwithstanding the intervening change in position by the Trump Administration, the Seventh Circuit found that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on his Title IX discrimination claim. The court did not reach the question of whether transgender status triggered heightened scrutiny, but the Seventh Circuit did find that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on his Equal Protection Claim on a theory of sex stereotyping. The court also found KUSD's privacy argument was based on sheer conjecture and abstraction and that a \"transgender student's presence in the restroom provides no more a risk to other students' privacy rights than the presence of an overly curious student of the same biological sex.\" 858 F.3d 1034 (Williams, J.). The Defendant appealed this order to the Supreme Court on August 29.</p><p>Both parties agreed to a settlement hearing before Magistrate Judge William E. Callahan, Jr. on November 1, 2017. Despite the efforts of the parties, mediation did not result in settlement of the Plaintiff’s claims. On November 21, 2017, the case was reassigned to Judge Pamela Pepper for further pretrial proceedings, trial, and eventual entry of final judgment.</p><p>On January 22, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to approve the proposed Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment: required the Defendants to pay $800,000 to the Plaintiff for compensatory damages, attorney’s fees, and costs; permanently enjoined the Defendants from preventing the Plaintiff from using male bathrooms and from taking retaliatory actions; and required the Defendants to inform current board members, district-level administrators, and school level principals and assistant principals of the terms of the permanent injunction. The judgment was set to last for 10 years, during which the court retained jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. </p><p>The Consent Judgment was signed by Judge Pepper on January 23, 2018. The Supreme Court subsequently dismissed the writ for certiorari. 138 S. Ct. 1260. The case is administratively closed, but remains ongoing due to court enforcement. As of April 15, 2020, there has been no further action in the docket. </p>",

Whereas, Plaintiff Ashton Whitaker (“Plaintiff”)1 filed a Complaint [Dkt. No. 1] \non July 20, 2016 and Amended Complaint [Dkt. No. 9] on August 15, 2016 against Defendant \nKenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education (“Defendant”),2 bringing claims \nunder Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) and the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution challenging, inter alia, \nDefendant’s alleged policies or practices denying Plaintiff, a transgender boy, the ability to use \nrestrooms corresponding to his male gender identity at school and during school-sponsored \nactivities, Defendant’s alleged monitoring of Plaintiff’s restroom usage, and other alleged actions \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff, who was a minor at the time this action commenced, originally filed this lawsuit \nthrough his mother and next friend, Melissa Whitaker. On September 5, 2017, following \nPlaintiff’s 18th birthday, the Court issued an order granting Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to \namend the case caption to permit Plaintiff to pursue this action in his own capacity [Dkt. No. 74]. \n2 The Amended Complaint also named Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, in her official capacity as \nSuperintendent of the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1, as a defendant. On August 11, \n2017, the Parties filed a joint stipulation to dismiss Ms. Savaglio-Jarvis [Dkt. No. 72]. \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 01/22/18   Page 1 of 6   Document 91-1\n\nby Defendant in which Plaintiff was treated differently from other male students because of his \ngender identity; \n  2.  Whereas Defendant denied the majority of the allegations in the Amended \nComplaint; \n3.  Whereas, Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint sought, inter alia, preliminary and \npermanent injunctive relief, compensatory damages sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for the \nphysical, emotional, and educational injuries he suffered as a result of Defendant’s actions, and \ncompensation for his reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \n4.  Whereas, this Court entered an order denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss \nPlaintiff’s claims on September 21, 2016, as amended on September 26, 2016, and the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied Defendant’s motion for interlocutory review of \nthis Court’s denial of Defendant’s motion to dismiss on November 14, 2016 in Kenosha Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ. v. Whitaker, 841 F.3d 730, 732 (7th Cir. 2016); \n  5.  Whereas, on September 22, 2016, this Court entered a preliminary injunction \n[Dkt. No. 33] enjoining Defendant from “(1) denying [Plaintiff] access to the boys’ restrooms; \n(2) enforcing any policy, written or unwritten, against the plaintiff that would prevent him from \nusing the boys restroom during any time he is on the school premises or attending school-\nsponsored events; (3) disciplining the plaintiff for using the boys restroom during any time that \nhe is on the school premises or attending school-sponsored events; and (4) monitoring or \nsurveilling in any way [Plaintiff’s] restroom use;” \n  6.  Whereas, on May 30, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \nissued an opinion and order affirming the preliminary injunction entered by this Court and \ndenying Defendant’s motion for exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction over this Court’s \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 01/22/18   Page 2 of 6   Document 91-1\n\ndenial of Defendant’s motion to dismiss, holding that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on the \nmerits of his claims under both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, that Plaintiff would \nlikely have suffered irreparable harm without the injunction and had no adequate remedies at law \nwithout the injunction, and that the balance of harms favored Plaintiff, Whitaker v. Kenosha \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1044-55 (7th Cir. 2017); \n  7.

INTRODUCTION \nOn July 19, 2016, the plaintiff, Ashton Whitaker, filed this action against \nthe defendants, Kenosha Unified School District and Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, in \nher official capacity as the Superintendent of the Kenosha Unified School \nDistrict. Dkt. No. 1. In his complaint (amended on August 15th), the plaintiff \nalleges that the treatment he received at Tremper High School after he started \nhis female-to-male transition violated Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §1681, et seq., and the \nEqual Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dkt. Nos. 1, 12. On \nAugust 15, 2016, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. \nDkt. No. 10. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the next day. Dkt. No. \n1 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 1 of 18   Document 33\n\n14. Both motions were fully briefed by August 31, 2016. Dkt. Nos. 11, 15, 17, \n19, 21, 22. Following oral arguments on the motions on September 6, 19 and \n20, the court issued an oral ruling denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss. \nDkt. No. 28. See also, Dkt. No. 29 (order denying motion to dismiss). For the \nreasons stated at the September 20, 2016 hearing, and supplemented here, the \ncourt grants in part the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction. Dkt. No. \n10.   \nII.  BACKGROUND \nThe plaintiff, Ash Whitaker, is a student at Tremper High School, a \npublic high school in the Kenosha Unified School District (KUSD). Dkt. No. 12 \nat ¶6. The plaintiff’s mother, Melissa Whitaker, brought this action as his next \nfriend. Id. at ¶7. She is also a high school teacher at Tremper. Id.  \nThe plaintiff’s birth certificate identifies him as female, and he lived as a \nfemale until middle school. Id. at ¶21. Around seventh grade, in late 2013, the \nplaintiff asked his mother about treatment for transgender individuals. Id. at \n¶¶21-23; Dkt. 10-2 at 17. He later was diagnosed by his pediatrician with \nGender Dysphoria. Dkt. No. 12 at ¶¶15, 25. “Gender Dysphoria is the medical \nand psychiatric term for gender incongruence.” Dkt. No. 10-2 at 6. Individuals \nwith gender dysphoria suffer extreme stress when not presenting themselves \nand living in accordance with their gender identity. Id. Treatment for gender \ndysphoria consists of transitioning to living and being accepted by others as \nthe sex corresponding to the person’s gender identity. Dkt. No. 12 at ¶17. To \npursue medical interventions, a person with gender dysphoria must live in \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 2 of 18   Document 33\n\naccordance with their gender identity for at least one year. Id. at ¶18. If left \nuntreated, gender dysphoria may result in “serious and debilitating” \npsychological distress including anxiety, depression, and even self-harm or \nsuicidal ideation. Dkt. No. 10-2 at 6-7; Dkt. No. 12 at ¶15. The plaintiff \ncurrently is under the care of a clinical psychologist, and began receiving \ntestosterone treatment in July 2016. Id. at ¶25.  \nDuring the 2013-2014 school year, the plaintiff began telling close \nfriends that he was a boy, and transitioning more publicly to live in accordance \nwith his male identity. Id. at ¶23. At the beginning of his sophomore year (Fall \n2014), the plaintiff told all of his teachers and peers about his transition, and \nasked that they refer to him using male pronouns and by his male name. Id. at \n¶24. In the spring of 2015, the plaintiff asked to be allowed to use the boys’ \nrestrooms at school. Id. at ¶27. The school administrators denied the request, \nstating that the plaintiff was allowed to use only the girls’ restroom or the \nsingle-user, gender-neutral restroom in the school office. Id. The plaintiff did \nnot want to use the office restroom because it was far from his classes and only \nused by office staff and visitors. Id. at ¶28. Consequently, the plaintiff avoided \ndrinking liquids, and using the bathroom at school for fear of being stigmatized \nas different. Id. at ¶29.  During his sophomore year, the plaintiff experienced \nvasovagal syncope1, stress-related migraines, depression, anxiety and suicidal \nthoughts. Id. at ¶31.  \n                                          \n1 “Vasovagal syncope . . . occurs when you faint because your body overreacts \nto certain triggers, such as the sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. It \nmay also be called neurocardiogenic syncope.” \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 3 of 18   Document 33\n\nUpon learning, over the summer of 2015, that the US Department of \nJustice had concluded that transgender students have the right to use \nrestrooms in accordance with their gender identity, the plaintiff began using \nthe male-designated bathrooms at school starting his junior year, September \n2015. Id. at ¶35. He used the male bathroom without incident until late \nFebruary 2016. Id. at ¶36-37. Despite the lack of any written policy on the \nissue, the school informed the plaintiff, in early March, that he could not use \nthe boys’ restroom. Id. at 38. Nevertheless, to avoid the psychological distress \nassociated with using the girls’ restroom or the single-user restroom in the \noffice, the plaintiff continued to use the boys’ restrooms when necessary. Id. at \n¶42.  \nThe plaintiff and his mother met with an assistant principal and his \nguidance counselor on or about March 10, 2016 to discuss the school’s \ndecision. Id. at 44. The assistant principal told him that he could use only the \nrestrooms consistent with his gender as listed in the school’s official records, \nand that he could only change his gender in the records only if the school \nreceived legal or medical documentation confirming his transition to male. Id. \nAlthough the plaintiff’s mother argued that the plaintiff was too young for \ntransition-related surgery, the assistant principal responded that the school \nneeded medical documentation, but declined to indicate what type of medical \ndocumentation would be sufficient. Id. at 45. The plaintiff’s pediatrician sent \ntwo letters to the school, recommending that the plaintiff be allowed access to \n                                                                                                                                      \nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/home/ovc-\n20184773 (last visited September 21, 2016). \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 4 of 18   Document 33\n\nthe boys’ restroom. Id. at 46. Despite lacking a written policy on the issue, id. \nat ¶60, the school again denied the plaintiff’s request, because he had not \ncompleted a medical transition, but failing to explain why a medical transition \nwas necessary. Id. at 47.  \nThe plaintiff generally tried to avoid using the restroom at school, but \nwhen necessary, he used the boys’ restroom. Id. at 48. Consequently, the \nschool directed security guards to notify administrators if they spotted \nstudents going into the “wrong” restroom. Id. at ¶56. The school re-purposed \ntwo single-user restrooms, which previously had been open to all students, as \nprivate bathrooms for the plaintiff. Id. at ¶61. The plaintiff refused to use these \nbathrooms, because they were far from his classes and because using them \nwould draw questions from other students. Id. Despite several more \nconfrontations with the school administration, id. at ¶¶49, 51, 54, the plaintiff \ncontinued to use the boys’ restroom through the last day of the 2015-16 school \nyear. Id. at ¶54.2   \nThe plaintiff started his senior year of high school on September 1, 2016. \nAs of the date of oral argument on this motion (September 20, 2016), the \nschool still refused to allow him to use the boys’ restroom, and the plaintiff \n                                          \n2 The plaintiff alleges other instances of discrimination: that the defendants \nrefused to allow him to room with male classmates during two summer \norchestra camps, resulting in his having to room alone, id. at ¶¶33-34, 86; that \nthe defendants directed guidance counselors to give transgender students a \nbright green bracelet to wear (the defendants dispute this, and as of this \nwriting, the school has not implemented such a policy), id. at ¶¶80; and the \nschool initially refusing to allow the plaintiff to run for prom king, id. at ¶¶71-\n72. For the reasons the court discussed on the record at the September 19, \n2016 hearing, th decision decides only the request to enjoin the defendants \nfrom prohibiting the plaintiff from using the boys’ restrooms.   \n5 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 5 of 18   Document 33\n\ncontinued to avoid the restrooms generally, using the boys’ restroom when \nneeded.  \nThe plaintiff seeks the following relief: an order (1) enjoining the \ndefendants from enforcing any policy that denies the plaintiff’s access to the \nboys’ restroom at school and school-sponsored events; (2) enjoining the \ndefendants from taking any formal or informal disciplinary action against the \nplaintiff for using the boys’ restroom; (3) enjoining the defendants from using, \ncausing or permitting school employees to refer to the plaintiff by his female \nname and female pronouns; (4) enjoining the defendants from taking any other \naction that would reveal the plaintiff’s transgender status to others at school, \nincluding the use of any visible markers or identifiers (e.g. wristbands, stickers) \nissued by the district personnel to the plaintiff and other transgender students. \nDkt. No. 10 at 2.  \nAs discussed in the oral arguments before the court, this decision only \naddresses the first two requests; the court denied the orally denied the fourth \nrequest without prejudice at the September 19, 2016 hearing, and the court \ndefers ruling on the third request to allow counsel for the defendants to discuss \nwith his client recent developments, such as the plaintiff’s legal name change \nand this court’s denial of the defendants’ motion to dismiss.  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n \nA. Preliminary Injunction Standard \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary equitable remedy that is \navailable only when the movant shows clear need.” Turnell v. CentiMark Corp., \n6 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 6 of 18   Document 33\n\n796 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2015) (citing Goodman v. Ill. Dep’t of Fin. and Prof’l \nRegulation, 430 F.3d 432, 437 (7th Cir. 2005)). “[A] district court engages in a \ntwo-step analysis to decide whether such relief is warranted.” Id. (citing Girl \nScouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of USA, Inc., 549 F.3d 1079, \n1085–86 (7th Cir.2008)). The first phase requires the “party seeking a \npreliminary injunction [to] make a threshold showing that: (1) absent \npreliminary injunctive relief, he will suffer irreparable harm in the interim prior \nto a final resolution; (2) there is no adequate remedy at law; and (3) he has a \nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits.” Id. at 661-62. \nIf the movant satisfies the first three criteria, the court then considers \n“(4) the irreparable harm the moving party will endure if the preliminary \ninjunction is wrongfully denied versus the irreparable harm to the nonmoving \nparty if it is wrongfully granted; and (5) the effects, if any, that the grant or \ndenial of the preliminary injunction would have on nonparties (the ‘public \ninterest’).” Id. at 662. When balancing the potential harms, the court uses a \n‘sliding scale’: “the more likely [the plaintiff] is to win, the less the balance of \nharms must weigh in his favor; the less likely he is to win, the more it must \nweigh in his favor.” Id.   \nB. The Plaintiff Has Shown a Likelihood That His Claims Will \nSucceed on the Merits. \n“The most significant difference between the preliminary injunction \nphase and the merits phase is that a plaintiff in the former position needs only \nto show ‘a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success.’” \nMichigan v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 667 F.3d 765, 782 (7th Cir. 2011) \n7 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 7 of 18   Document 33\n\n(quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12 (1987)). \nIn the Seventh Circuit, the court “only needs to determine that the plaintiff has \nsome likelihood of success on the merits.” Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 \nF.3d 891, 896 (7th Cir. 2001). As the plaintiffs argued, this is a relatively low \nstandard. \nThe arguments the parties made on September 20, 2016 regarding the \nmotion for preliminary injunction mirror the arguments they made on \nSeptember 19, 2016 regarding the motion to dismiss. Essentially, the \ndefendants argue that gender identity is not encompassed by the word “sex” in \nTitle IX, and the plaintiff disagrees. The defendants also argue that under a \nrational basis standard of review, the plaintiffs cannot sustain an equal \nprotection claim; the plaintiffs respond that they can, and further, that the \ncourt should apply a heightened scrutiny standard.  \nThe court denied the motion to dismiss because it found that there were \nseveral avenues by which the plaintiff might obtain relief. Dkt. No. 28. The \ncourt found that, because no case defines “sex” for the purposes of Title IX, the \nplaintiff might succeed on his claim that that word includes transgender \npersons. The court found that, while the defendants raised a number of \narguments in support of their claim that the word “sex” does not encompass \ntransgender persons, much of that case law came from cases interpreting Title \nVII, a different statute with a different legislative history and purpose. The \ncourt also found that there was case law supporting the plaintiff’s position, as \n8 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 8 of 18   Document 33\n\nwell as the Department of Education’s “Dear Colleague” letter, which, the court \nfound, should be accorded Auer deference.  \nThe court also noted that the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts to \nsupport a claim of gender stereotyping, alleging that the defendants had \ndiscriminated against him because he did not fit standard stereotypes of girls \n(the sex the school insists is his).  \nThe court also found that the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts to \nsupport his claims that the defendants had violated his equal protection rights. \nWhile the court did not, at the motion to dismiss stage, and does not now have \nto decide whether a rational basis or a heightened scrutiny standard of review \napplies to the plaintiff’s equal protection claim, at this point, the defendants \nhave articulated little in the way of a rational basis for the alleged \ndiscrimination. The defendants argue that students have a right to privacy; the \ncourt is not clear how allowing the plaintiff to use the boys’ restroom violates \nother students’ right to privacy. The defendants argue that they have a right to \nset school policy, as long as it does not violate the law. The court agrees, but \nnotes that the heart of this case is the question of whether the current \n(unwritten) policy violates the law. The defendants argue that allowing the \nplaintiff to use the boys’ restroom will gut the Department of Education \nregulation giving schools the discretion to segregate bathrooms by sex. The \ncourt noted at both the September 19 and September 20 hearings that it did \nnot agree. \n9 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 9 of 18   Document 33\n\nBecause of the low threshold showing a plaintiff must make regarding \nlikelihood of success on the merits, see Cooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809, 813 \n(7th Cir.1999), and because the plaintiff has articulated several bases upon \nwhich the court could rule in his favor, the court finds that the defendant has \nsatisfied this element of the preliminary injunction test.  \nC.  The Plaintiff Has Shown that He Has No Adequate Remedy at  \n    Law. \n \nThe court observed at the September 20 hearing that neither party \nfocused much attention, either in the moving papers or at oral argument, on \nthe question of whether the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law. The \nplaintiffs argued that plaintiff Ash Whitaker has only one senior year. They \nargued that even if, at the end of this lawsuit, the plaintiffs were to prevail, no \nrecovery could give back to Ash the loss suffered if he spent his senior year \nfocusing on avoiding using the restroom, rather than on his studies, his extra-\ncurricular activities and his college application process. The defendants made \nno argument that the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law. The court \nfinds, therefore, that the plaintiffs have shown that they have no adequate \nremedy at law. \nD.  The Plaintiff Has Shown That He Will Suffer Irreparable Injury \n  If The Court Does Not Enjoin The School’s Actions. \nThe parties focused most of their arguments on the element of \nirreparable harm. While alleged irreparable harm does not need to occur before \na court may grant injunctive relief, there must be more than a mere possibility. \nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. \n10 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 10 of 18   Document 33\n\n1303 (1953); Bath Indus., Inc. v. Blot, 427 F.2d 97, 111 (7th Cir. 1970). Put \nanother way, the irreparable harm must be likely to occur if no injunction \nissues. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 21–23 \n(2008).  \nDuring the oral arguments, the plaintiff argued that the defendants’ \ndenial of access to the boys’ restroom has caused and will continue to cause \nmedical and psychological issues that his present and future health. In support \nof this argument, the plaintiff pointed to the declarations from Dr. Stephanie \nBudge and Dr. R. Nicholas Gorton, M.D., which explain gender dysphoria and \ndiscuss, both in terms specific to the plaintiff (Dr. Budge) and terms general to \npersons suffering from gender dysphoria (Dr. Gorton) the effects on persons \nwith gender dysphoria of not being allowed to live in accordance with their \ngender identity. See Dkt. Nos. 10-2, 10-3. The defendants responded that the \ncourt should grant little weight or credibility to these affidavits, because Dr. \nBudge barely knew Ash Whitaker, Dr. Gorton did not know him at all, and \nneither affidavit quantified the harms they described.3  \nRelying primarily on the plaintiff’s declaration (which the defendants did \nnot challenge at the hearing), dkt. no. 10-1, the court has no question that the \nplaintiff’s inability to use the boys’ restroom has caused him to suffer harm. \nThe plaintiff’s declaration establishes that he has suffered emotional distress \n                                          \n3 While “[a]ffidavits are ordinarily inadmissible at trial . . . they are fully \nadmissible in summary proceedings, including preliminary-injunction \nproceedings.” Ty, Inc. v. GMA Accessories, Inc., 132 F.3d 1167, 1171 (7th Cir. \n1997)(citing Levi Strauss & Co. v. Sunrise Int’l Trading Inc., 51 F.3d 982, 985 \n(11th Cir. 1995).   \n11 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 11 of 18   Document 33\n\nas a result of not being allowed to use the boys’ restrooms. While the school \nallows him to use the girls’ restrooms, his gender identity prevents him from \ndoing so. He has refused to use the single-user bathrooms, due to distance \nfrom his classes and, more to the point, the embarrassment and stigma of \nbeing singled out and treated differently from all other students. Because the \ndefendants do not allow him to use the boys’ restrooms, he has begun a \npractice of limiting his fluid intake, in an attempt to avoid having to use the \nrestroom during the school day. Lack of hydration, however, exacerbates his \nproblems with migraines, fainting and dizziness. He describes sleeplessness, \nfear of being disciplined (and having that impact his school record ahead of his \nefforts to get into college), and bouts of tearfulness and panic.  \nThe plaintiff also attested to the fact that the emotional impact of his \ninability to use the restrooms like everyone else, and his being pulled out of \nclass for discipline in connection with his restroom used, impacted on his \nability to fully focus on his studies. The Seventh Circuit has recognized that \ndiscrimination that impacts one’s ability to focus and learn constitutes harm. \nSee e.g., Washington v. Ind. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, Inc., 181 F.3d 840, 853 \n(7th Cir. 1999).  \nTo reiterate, the court finds that Ash has suffered harm. The defendants \nintimated in their arguments, however, that such harm was not irreparable, \nbecause the plaintiffs had not provided any evidence that the harm would be \nlong-lasting, or permanent. It was in this context that the defendants \nchallenged the professional declarations the plaintiffs had provided from \n12 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 12 of 18   Document 33\n\nexperts in the field of gender dysphoria and gender transition. As the court \nstated at the September 20, 2016 hearing, however, the plaintiffs are not \nrequired to prove that Ash will be forever irreversibly damaged in order to prove \nirreparable harm. The Seventh Circuit has noted that irreparable harm is harm \nthat “would [not] be rectifiable following trial.” Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, \nInc. v. Girl Scouts of U.S. of America, Inc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1088 (7th Cir. \n2008). It has held that irreparable harm is “harm that cannot be prevented or \nfully rectified by the final judgment after trial.” Roland Machinery Co. v. \nDresser Industries, Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 386 (7th Cir. 1984). \nThe plaintiff’s spending his last school year trying to avoid using the \nrestroom, living in fear of being disciplined, feeling singled out and stigmatized, \nbeing subject to fainting spells or migraines, is not harm that can be rectified \nby a monetary judgment, or even an award of injunctive relief, after a trial that \ncould take place months or years from now. The court finds that the plaintiffs \nhave satisfied the irreparable harm factor. \nE.  The Plaintiff’s Irreparable Harm Outweighs Any Harm The  \n    Defendants Might Experience and the Effects Granting the  \n    Injunction Will Have on Nonparties.  \n \nThe balancing of the harms weighs in the plaintiffs’ favor. The court has \nfound that Ash Whitaker has suffered irreparable harm, and will continue to do \nso if he is not allowed to use the boys’ restrooms. The court must balance \nagainst that harm the possible harm to the defendants. \nIn their moving papers, the defendants argued that requiring them to \nallow Ash to use the boys’ restrooms would subject them to financial burdens \n13 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 13 of 18   Document 33\n\nand facility changes. They did not identify why allowing Ash to use the boys’ \nrestrooms would create a financial burden; the court cannot, on the evidence \nbefore it, see what cost would be incurred in allowing Ash to use restrooms \nthat already exist. The defendants provided no evidence regarding any facilities \nthat they would have to build or provide. \nThe defendants also argued that a requirement that they allow Ash to \nuse the boys’ restrooms would violate the privacy rights of other students. They \nprovided no affidavits or other evidence in support of this argument. The \nevidence before the court indicates that Ash used the boys’ restroom for some \nseven months without incident or notice; the defendants prohibited him from \nusing them only after a teach observed Ash in a boys’ restroom, washing his \nhands. This evidence contradicts the defendants’ assertions that allowing Ash \nto use the boys’ restroom would violate other students’ privacy rights. \nThe defendants argued that granting the injunctive relief would deny \nthem the ability to exercise their discretion to segregate bathrooms by sex, as \nallowed by the regulations promulgated by the Department of Education. This \nargument is a red herring; the issuance of the injunction will not disturb the \nschool’s ability to have boys’ restrooms and girls’ restrooms. It will require only \nthat Ash, who identifies as a boy, be allowed to use the existing boys’ \nrestrooms. \nThe defendants argued that the injunctive relief would require the \ndefendants, in the first month of the new school year, to scramble to figure out \npolicies and procedures to enable it to comply with the order of relief. This \n14 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 14 of 18   Document 33\n\nrelief, however, does not require the defendants to create policies, or review \npolicies. It requires only that the defendants allow Ash to use the boys’ \nrestrooms, and not to subject him to discipline for doing so. \nThe court finds that the balance of harms weighs in favor of the plaintiff. \nF.  Issuance of the Injunction Will Not Negatively Impact the  \n    Public Interest. \n \nFinally, the court finds that issuance of the injunction will not harm the \npublic interest. The defendants argue that granting the injunction will force \nschools all over the state of Wisconsin, and perhaps farther afield, to allow \nstudents who self-identify with a gender other than the one reflected \nanatomically at birth to use whatever restroom they wish. The defendants \naccord this court’s order breadth and power it does not possess. This order \nmandates only that the defendants allow one student—Ash Whitaker—to use \nthe boys’ restrooms for the pendency of this litigation. The Kenosha Unified \nSchool District is the only institutional defendant in this case; the court’s order \nbinds only that defendant. The defendants have provided no proof of any harm \nto third parties or to the public should the injunction issue. \nG.  The Defendants’ Request for a Bond \nAt the conclusion of the September 20, 2016 hearing, the defendants \nasked that if the court were inclined to grant injunctive relief, it require the \nplaintiffs to post a bond in the amount of $150,000. The defendants first cited \nRule 65, and then cited the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision in Muscoda \nBridge Co. v. Worden-Allen Co., 207 Wis. 22 (Wis. 1931). The defendants \nargued that, in the event that events revealed that this court had improvidently \n15 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 15 of 18   Document 33\n\ngranted the injunction, the Muscoda case provided that the court should \nimpose a bond sufficient to reimburse the defendants’ costs and attorneys’ fees, \nand counsel estimated that those fees could reach $150,000. The plaintiffs \nobjected to the court requiring a bond, citing the plaintiffs’ limited means. \nRule 65(c) states that “[t]he court may issue a preliminary injunction or a \ntemporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that \nthe court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any \nparty found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” The rule leaves to \nthe court’s discretion the question of the proper amount of such a bond, and \ntethers that consideration to the amount of costs and damages sustained by \nthe wrongfully enjoined party. \nCounsel for the defendants argued that under Wisconsin law, “costs and \ndamages” includes the legal fees the defendants would incur in, presumably, \nseeking to overturn the injunction, and argued that those fees could amount to \nas much as $150,000. In support of this argument, he cited Muscoda Bridge \nCo. v. Worden-Allen Co., 207 Wis. 22 (Wis. 1931), which held that “[i]t is the \nestablished law of this state that damages, sustained by reason of an \ninjunction improvidently issued, properly include attorney fees for services \nrendered in procuring the dissolution of the injunction, and also for services \nupon the reference to ascertain damages.” Id. at 651. The problem with this \nargument is that Seventh Circuit law says otherwise.  \n[T]he Seventh Circuit has determined that, for purposes of Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65(c), “costs and damages” damages do not include \nattorneys’ fees. Rather, in the absence of a statute authorizing \n16 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 16 of 18   Document 33\n\nsuch fees . . . an award of attorneys’ fees is only proper where \nthe losing party is guilty of bad faith.”  \n \nMinnesota Power & Light Co. v. Hockett, 14 Fed. App’x 703, 706 (7th Cir. \n2001), quoting Coyne-Delany Co. v. Capital Dev. Bd. Of State of Ill., 717 F.2d \n385, 390 (7th Cir. 1983)). See also, Int’l Broth. Of Teamsters Airline Div. v. \nFrontier Airlines, Inc., No. 10-C-0203, 2010 WL 2679959, at *5 (E.D. Wis. July \n1, 2010). When there is a “direct collision” between a federal rule and a state \nlaw, the Seventh Circuit has mandated that federal law applies. Id. at 707. \n  The defendants did not identify any statute authorizing an award of \nattorneys’ fees should they succeed in overturning the injunction. Thus, in \norder to determine the amount of a security bond under Rule 65(c), the court \nmust consider the costs and damages the defendants are likely to face as a \nresult of being improvidently enjoined, but not the legal costs they might incur \nin seeking to overturn the injunction. It is unclear what damages or costs the \ndefendants will incur if they are wrongfully enjoined. As discussed above, the \ndefendants have not demonstrated that it will cost them money to allow Ash to \nuse the boys’ restrooms. Because it is within this court’s discretion to \ndetermine the amount of a security bond, and because the defendants have not \ndemonstrated that they will suffer any financial damage as a result of being \nrequired to allow Ash to use  the boys’ restrooms, the court will not require the \nplaintiffs to post security. \n \n   \n17 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 17 of 18   Document 33\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION   \nFor the reasons explained above, the court GRANTS IN PART the \nplaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Dkt. No. 10. The court ORDERS \nthat defendants Kenosha Unified School District and Sue Savaglio-Jarvis (in \nher capacity as superintendent of that district) are ENJOINED from \n(1) denying Ash Whitaker access to the boys’ restrooms; \n(2) enforcing any policy, written or unwritten, against the plaintiff that \nwould prevent him from using the boys restroom during any time he is on the \nschool premises or attending school-sponsored events; \n(3) disciplining the plaintiff for using the boys restroom during any time \nthat he is on the school premises or attending school-sponsored events; and \n(4) monitoring or surveilling in any way Ash Whitaker’s restroom use. \nThe court DENIES the defendants’ request that the court require the \nplaintiffs to post a bond under Rule 65(c). \nDated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 22nd day of September, 2016. \n             \n \n18 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 09/22/16   Page 18 of 18   Document 33",

The  School  District  did  not  permit  Ash  to \nenter  the  boys’  restroom  because,  it  believed,  that  his  mere \npresence  would  invade  the  privacy  rights  of  his  male  class- \nmates.  Ash brought  suit,  alleging  that  the  School  District’s  un- \nwritten  bathroom  policy?  violates  Title  IX  of  the  Education \nAmendments  Act  of  1972  and  the  Fourteenth  Amendment's \nEqual  Protection  Clause. \nIn  addition  to  filing  suit,  Ash,  beginning  his  senior  year, \nmoved  for  preliminary  injunctive  relief,  seeking  an  order \ngranting  him  access  to  the  boys’  restrooms.  He  asserted  that \nthe  denial  of  access  to  the  boys’  bathroom  was  causing  him \nharm,  as  his  attempts  to  avoid  using  the  bathroom  exacer- \nbated  his  vasovagal  syncope,  a  condition  that  renders  Ash \nsusceptible  to  fainting  and/or  seizures  if  dehydrated.  He  also \ncontended  that  the  denial  caused  him  educational  and  emo- \ntional  harm,  including  suicidal  ideations.  The  School  District \nvigorously  objected  and  moved  to  dismiss  Ash’s  claims,  argu- \ning  that Ash  could  neither  state  a  claim  under  Title  IX  nor  the \nEqual  Protection  Clause.  The  district  court  denied  the  motion \nto  dismiss  and  granted  Ash’s  preliminary  injunction  motion. \nOn  appeal,  the  School  District  argues  that  we  should  exer- \ncise  pendent  appellate  jurisdiction  to  review  the  district \n  \n1  We  will  refer  to  the  Plaintiff-Appellee  as  “Ash,”  rather  than  by  his \nlast name,  as this is how he refers  to himself throughout his brief. \n2  We  will refer  to  the  School  District’s  decision  to  deny  Ash  access  to \nthe boys’  restroom  as  a  “policy,”  although  any  such  “policy”  is unwritten \nand its  exact boundaries  are unclear. \nCase  2:16-cv-00943-PP  Filed  06/21/17  Page  2  of  39  Document  65\naesta haot  e?e   “NR\\w  aLce kLua mSeEn t  GweR OONA  SiTme SS0e 7 aa  eFe- AOIsReseS    yePasOH PeLEAQR:.5    OMeSete! e  Fs  von waranty\nNo.  16-3522  3 \ncourt’s  decision  to  deny  the  motion  to  dismiss.  However,  we \ndecline  this  invitation,  as  the  two  orders  were  not  inextricably \nintertwined  and  we  can  review  the  grant  of  the  preliminary \ninjunction  without  reviewing  the  denial  of  the  motion  to  dis- \nmiss. \nThe  School  District  also  argues  that  we  should  reverse  the \ndistrict  court’s  decision  to  grant  the  preliminary  injunction  for \ntwo  main  reasons.  First,  it  argues  that  the  district  court  erred \nin  finding  that  Ash  had  demonstrated  a  likelihood  of  success \non  the  merits because  transgender status  is neither  a  protected \nclass  under  Title  IX  nor  is  it  entitled  to  heightened  scrutiny. \nAnd,  because  the  School  District's  policy has  a  rational  basis, \nthat  is,  the  need  to  protect  other  students’  privacy,  Ash's \nclaims  fail  as  a  matter  of  law.  We  reject  these  arguments  be- \ncause  Ash  has  sufficiently  demonstrated  a  likelihood  of  suc- \ncess  on his  Tithe IX claim under  a  sex-stereotyping theory.  Pur- \nther,  because  the  policy's  classification  is  based  upon  sex,  he \nhas  also  demonstrated  that  heightened  scrutiny,  and  not  ra- \ntional  basis,  should  apply  to  his  Equal  Protection  Claim.  The \nochool  District  has  not  provided  a  genuine  and  exceedingly \npersuasive justification  for  the  classification. \nsecond,  the  School  District  argues  that  the  district  court \nerred  in  finding  that  the  harms  to  Ash  outweighed  the  harms \nto  the  student  population  arid  their  privacy  interests.  We  dis- \nagree.  The  School  District  has  tailed  to  provide  any  evidence \nof  how  the  preliminary  injuriction  will  harm  it,  or  any  of  its \nstudents  or  parents.  The  harms  identified  by  the  School  Dis- \ntrict  are  all  speculative  and  based  upon  conjecture,  whereas \nthe  harms  to  Ash  are  well-documented  and  supported  by  the \nrecord.  As  a  consequence,  we  affirm  the  grant  of  preliminary \ninjunctive  relief. \nea B«(O %  Tied ss .

BACKGROUND \nAsh  Whitaker  is  a  17  year-old  who  lives  in  Kenosha,  Wis- \nconsin  with  his  mother,  who  brought  this  suit  as  his  “next \nfriend.”>  He  is  currently  a  senior  at  George  Nelson  Tremper \nHigh  School,  which  is  in  the  Kenosha  Unified  School  District. \nHe  entered  his  senior  year  ranked  within  the  top  five  percent \nof  his  class  and  is  involved  in  a  number  of  extracurricular  ac- \ntivities  including  the  orchestra,  theater,  tennis,  the  National \nHonor  Society,  and  the  Astronomical  Society.  When not in  os- \nchool  or  participating  in  these  activities,  Ash  works  part-time \nas  an  accounting  assistant  in  a  medical  office. \nWhile  Ash’s  birth  certificate  designates  him  as  “female,” \nhe  does not identify as  one.  Rather,  in the  spring of 2013,  when \nAsh  was  in  eighth  grade,  he  told  his  parents  that  he  is \ntransgender  and  a  boy.  He  began  to  openly  identify  as  a  boy \nduring  the  2013-2014  school  year,  when  he  entered  Tremper \nas  a  freshman.  He  cut  his  hair,  began  to  wear  more  masculine \nclothing,  and  began  to  use  the  name  Ashton  and  male  pro- \nnouns.  In  the  fall  of  2014,  the  beginning  of  his  sophomore \nyear,  he  told  his  teachers  and  his  classmates  that  he  is  a  boy \nand  asked  them  to  refer  to  him  as  Ashton  or  Ash  and  to  use \nmale  pronouns. \nIn  addition  to  publicly  transitioning,  Ash  began  to  see  a \ntherapist,  who  diagnosed  him with  Gender  Dysphoria,  which \nthe  American  Psychiatric  Association  defines  as  “a  marked \nincongruence  between  one’s  experienced/expressed  gender \n  \n3  Because  Ash  is  a  minor  without  a  duly  appointed  representative, \npursuant to  Rule  17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, he may assert \nthese  claims  only through  a  “next friend”  or  guardian  ad litem. \nCase  2:16-cv-00943-PP  Filed  06/21/17  Page  4  of  39  Document  65\nCase:  16-3522  Document:  00713017988  Filed:  06/21/2017  Pages:35  (5of  39) \nNo.  16-3522  5 \nand  assigned  gender  ...  .”4  Am.

A  month  later,  he  filed  a  petition  to  legally \nchange  his  name  to  Ashton  Whitaker,  which  was  granted  in \nSeptember  2016. \nFor  the  most  part,  Ash’s  transition  has  been  met  without \nhostility  and  has  been  accepted  by  much  of the  Tremper  com- \nmunity.  At  an  orchestra  performance  in  January  2015,  for  ex- \nample,  he  wore  a  tuxedo  like  the  rest  of the boys  in  the  group. \nHis  orchestra  teacher,  classmates,  and  the  audience  accepted \nthis  without  incident.  Unfortunately,  the  School  District  has \nnot  been  as  accepting  of  Ash’s  requests  to  use  the  boys’  re- \nstrooms. \nIn  the  spring  of  his  sophomore  year,  Ash  and  his  mother \nmet  with  his  guidance  counselor  on  several  occasions  to  re- \nquest  that  Ash  be  permitted  to  use  the  boys’  restrooms  while \nat  school  and  at  school-sponsored  events.  Ash  was  later  noti- \nfied  that  the  administration  had  decided  that  he  could  only \nuse  the  girls’  restrooms  or  a  gender-neutral  restroom  that was \nin  the  school’s  main  office,  which  was  quite  a  distance  from \nhis  classrooms.  Because  Ash  had  publicly  transitioned,  he  be- \nlieved  that  using  the  girls’  restrooms  would  undermine  his \ntransition.  Additionally,  since  Ash  was  the  only  student  who \nwas  permitted  to  use  the  gender-neutral  bathroom  in  the \nschool’s  office,  he  feared  that  using  it  would  draw  further  at- \ntention  to  his  transition  and  status  as  a  transgender  student  at \n  \n4 We take judicial notice  of the  Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual pur- \nsuant to  Rule 201  of the  Federal  Rules  of Evidence. \nCase  2:16-cv-00943-PP  Filed  06/21/17  Page  5  of  39  Document  65\n~atA  TaTt  oAo.  tSy   rSdNe  Yeoank ec kimseena  tmen  te  GMtO SNONOG    sAtNT e GRPoN  OOTN  aaR eF PSAORRIoAs Ss   wBPeHOradPE  LARont  s  OMNEbNSNS   Fs   ,erPoot von waranty  ow fd the veer?\n6  No.  16-3522 \nTremper.  As  a  high  schooler,  Ash  also  worried  that  he  might \nbe  disciplined  if  he  tried  to  use  the  boys’  restrooms  and  that \nsuch  discipline  might  hurt  his  chances  of  getting  into  college. \nFor  these  reasons,  Ash  restricted  his  water  intake  and  at- \ntempted  to  avoid  using  any  restroom  at  school  for  the  rest  of \nthe  school  year. \nRestricting  his  water  intake  was  problematic  for  Ash,  who \nhas  been  diagnosed  with  vasovagal  syncope.  This  condition \nrenders Ash  more  susceptible  to  fainting  and/or seizures  if de- \nhydrated.  To  avoid  triggering  the  condition,  Ash’s  physicians \nhave  advised  him  to  drink  six  to  seven  bottles  of  water  and  a \nbottle  of  Gatorade  daily.  Because  Ash  restricted  his  water  in- \ntake  to  ensure  that  he  did  not  have  to  utilize  the  restroom  at \nschool,  he  suffered  from  symptoms  of his  vasovagal  syncope, \nincluding fainting  and  dizziness.  He  also  suffered  from stress- \nrelated  migraines,  depression,  and  anxiety because  of  the  pol- \nicy’s  imvpact  on  his  transition  and  what  he  perceived  to  be  the \nimpossible  choice  between  living  as  a  boy  or  using  the  re- \nstroom.  He  even  began  to  contemplate  suicide. \nIn  the  fall  of  2015,  Ash  began  his  junior  year  at  Tremper. \nFor  six  months,  he  exclusively  used  the  boys’  restrooms  at \nschool  without  incident.  But,  in  February  2016,  a  teacher  saw \nhim  washing  his  hands  at  a  sink  in  the  boys’  restroom  and \nreported  it  to  the  school’s  administration.  In  response,  Ash’s \nguidance  counselor,  Debra  Tronvig,  again  told  Ash’s  mother \nthat  he  was  permitted  to  only  use  the  girls’  restrooms  or  the \ngender-neutral bathroom  in  the  school’s  main  office.  The  next \nmonth,  Ash  and  his  mother  met  with  Assistant  Principal \nHolly Graf to  discuss  the school's  policy.  Like before,  Ms.  Graf \nstated  that  Ash  was  not  permitted  to  use  the  boys’  restrooms. \nHowever,  the  reason  she  gave  this  time  was  that  he  was  listed \neoy Bb at Tgse  ss RAASOAA  ARS  DrOst   pEennay r  ARPSa  ee ;  ed  yR  anees   ASR okiwh   VOY  “M|m ecnes-  \nKe  a  A  OOS  red  2  PPADS  E  RPA  2. kl  ad  :  AMY  ee  LS  A ae  Rew A  AD \n  \na etAS TaQTt  ?A  ty  rNRNw  aLorn e  La MSYETa   men  te  Owe SAONO    mANeP  oeoN  ON shaa  eF ¢ AQIRRoA  S  wMPeeO rdPp iLsAaeRto:.nt   s  CMNEeNeN!e   Fs  waranty\nNo.  16-3522  7 \nas  a  female  in  the  school’s  official  records  and  to  change  those \nrecords,  the  school  needed  unspecified  “legal  or  medical  doc- \numentation.” \nTwo  letters  submitted  by  Ash’s  pediatrician,  identifying \nhim  as  a  transgender  boy  and  recommending  that  he  be  al- \nlowed  to  use  male-designated  facilities  at  school  were \ndeemed  not  sufficient  to  change  his  designation.  Rather,  the \nschool  maintained  that  Ash  would  have  to  complete  a  surgi- \ncal  transition  ...  a  procedure  that  is  prohibited  for  someone \nunder  18  years  of  age  ...  to  be  permitted  access  to  the  boys’ \nrestroom,  Further,  not  all  transgender  persons  opt  to  com- \nplete  a  surgical  transition,  preferring  to  torgo  the  significant \nrisks  and  costs  that  accompany  such  procedures.  The  School \nDistrict  did not give  any explanation  as  to  why  a  surgical  tran- \nsition  was  necessary.  Indeed,  the  verbal  statements  made  to \nAsh's  mom  about  the  policy  have  never been  reduced  to  writ- \ning.  In  fact,  the  School  District  has  never  provided  any  written \ndocument  that  details  when  the  policy  went  into  effect,  what \nthe  policy  is,  or  how  one  can  change  his  status  under  the  pol- \nicy. \nFearing  that using  the  one  gender-neutral  restroom would \nsingle him out  and  subject him to  scrutiny from his  classmates \nand  knowing  that  using  the  girls’  restroom  would  be  in  con- \ntradiction  to  his  transition,  Ash  continued  to  use  the  boys’  re- \nstroom  for  the  rermainder  of  his  junior  year. \nThis  decision  was  not  without  a  cost.  Ash  experienced \nfeelings  of  anxiousness  and  depression.  He  once  more  began \nto  contemplate  suicide.  Nonetheless,  the  school’s  security \nguards  were  instructed  to  monitor’s  Ash’s  restroom  use  to  en- \nsure  that  he  used  the  proper  facilities.

His  classmates  and  teachers  often  asked  him  about \nthese  meetings  and  why  administrators  were  removing  him \nfrom  class. \nIn  April  2016,  the  School  District  provided  Ash  with  the \nadditional  option  of using  two  single-user,  gender-neutral  re- \nstrooms.  These  locked  restrooms  were  on  the  opposite  side  of \ncampus  from  where  his  classes  were  held.  The  School  District \nprovided  only  one  student  with  the  key:  Ash.  Since  the  re- \nstrooms  were  not  near  his  classrooms,  which  caused  Ash  to \nmuss  class  time,  and  because  using  them  further  stigmatized \nhim,  Ash  again  avoided  using  the  bathrooms  while  at  school. \nThis  only  exacerbated  his  syncope  and  migraines.  In  addition, \nAsh  began  to  fear  tor  his  safety  as  more  attention  was  drawn \nto  his  restroom  use  and  transgender  status. \nAlthough not  part  of this  appeal,  Ash  contends  that he  has \naiso  been  subjected  to  other  negative  actions  by  the  School \nDistrict,  inchiding  initially  prohibiting  him  from  rurming  for \nprom  king,  referring  to  him  with  female  pronouns,  using  his \nbirth  name,  arid  requiring  him  to  room  with  female  students \nor  alone  on  school-sponsored  trips.  Furthermore,  Ash  learned \nin  May  2016  that  school  administrators  had  considered  in- \nstructing  its  guidance  counselors  to  distribute  bright  green \nwristbands  to  Ash  and  other  transgender  students  so  that \ntheir  bathroom  usage  could  be  monitored  more  easily. \nThroughout  this  litigation,  the  School  District  has  denied  that \nit  considered  implementing  the  wristband  plan. \n  \n~atA  TaTt  oAo.  tSy   rSdNe  Yeoank ec kimseena  tmen  te  GMtO SNONOG    sAtNT e GRPoN  OOTN  aaR eF PSAORRIoAs Ss   wBPeHOradPE  LARont  s  OMNEbNSNS   Fs  waranty\nNo.  16-3522  OD \nA.  Proceedings  Below \nIn  the  spring  of  2016,  Ash  engaged  counsel  who,  in  April \n2016,  sent  the  School  District  a  letter  demanding  that  it  permit \nhim  to  use  the  boys’  restroom  while  at  school  and  during \nschool-sponsored  events.  In  response,  the  School  District  re- \npeated  its  policy  that  Ash  was  required  to  use  either  the  girls’ \nrestroom  or  the  gender-neutral  facilities.  On  May  12,  2016, \nAsh  filed  an  administrative  complaint  with  the  United  States \nDepartment  of  Education's  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  alleging \nthat  this  policy  violated  his  rights  under  Title  IX.  To  pursue \nthe  instant  litigation,  Ash  chose  to  withdraw  the  complaint \nwithout  prejudice. \nOn  July  16,  2016,  Ash  commenced  this  action  and  on  Au- \ngust  15,  he  filed  an  Amended  Complaint  alleging  that  the \ntreatment  he  received  at  Tremper  High  School  violated  Title \nIX,  20  U.S.C.  S1681,  ef  seq.,  arid  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of \nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment.  That  same  day,  Ash,  in  a  motion \nfor  preliminary  injunction,  sought  to  enjoin  the  enforcement \nof  the  School  District’s  policy  pending  the  outcome  of  the  ht- \nigation.  The  next  day,  the  School  District  filed  a  motion  to  dis- \nmiss  and  filed  its  opposition  to  the  preliminary  injunction \nshortly  thereafter. \nAfter  a  hearing  on  the  motion  to  dismiss,  the  district  court \ndenied  the  motion.  The  next  day,  it  heard  oral  arguments  on \nAsh’s  motion  for  preliminary  injunction.  A  few  days  later,  the \ndistrict  court  granted  the  motion  in  part  and  enjoimed  the \nSchool  District  from:  (1)  denyig  Ash  access  to  the  boys’  re- \nstroom;  (2)  enforcing  any  written  or  unwritten  policy  against \nAsh  that  would  prevent  him  from  using  the  boys’  restroom \nwhile  on  school  property  or  attending  school-sponsored \nevents;  (3)  disciplining Ash for using  the boys’  restroom while \neo  oBee   oToh  es eomSA  aPUN  ARRo DtO t e  Raa r!

Although  initially \nthe  district court certified  the  order  denying the  motion  to  dis- \nmuss  for  immediate  interlocutory  appeal  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C, \n§  1292(b),  it  revoked  that  certification  when  it  concluded  that \nit  had  erred  by  including  the  certification  language  in  its  ini- \ntial  order.  Therefore,  we  denied  the  School  District’s  petition \nfor  interlocutory  review  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of \njurisdiction,  See  Kenosha  Unified  Sch.  Dist.  No.  1  Bd.  of Educ.  ov. \nWhitaker,  841  F.3d  730,  731-32  (7th  Cir.  2016).  In  the  alterna- \ntive,  the  School  District  urged  this  court  to  exercise  pendent \njurisdiction  over  the  order  denying  the  motion  to  dismiss  be- \ncause  the  district  court  had  partially  granted  the  preliminary \ninjunction.  But since  we  lacked  jurisdiction  to  consider  the  pe- \ntition  for  interlocutory  appeal,  we  also  lacked  a  proper  juris- \ndictional  basis  for  extending  pendent  jurisdiction.  Id.  at  732. \nTheretore,  in  this  appeal,  the  School  District  was  directed  to \nseek  pendent  appellate purisdiction,  which  it  has  now  done. \nIT.  ANALYSIS \nThe  School  District  raises  two  issues  on  appeal.  First,  that \nthis  court  should  assert  pendent  jurisdiction  over  the  district \ncourt's  decision  to  deny  its  motion to  dismiss  and  second,  that \nthe  district  court  erred  in  granting  Ash’s  motion  for  prelimi- \nnary  itany juncti1o  n,  Wefe   wilwlill   adadddrre ss  eachc hi issue  iin n  teteu rn,\n  \n~.  eee  AA  NA  os  art \nNanrcrimant  OSVS  Ta  PaRee  Milas \nRAP SAA LSP EES SE PL  AAS  me SL.

Pendent  Jurisdiction  Is  Not  Appropriate \nOrdinarily,  an  order  denying  a  motion  to  dismiss  is  not  a \nfinal  judgment  and  is  not  appealable.  See  28  U.S.C.  §  1291 \n(providing  federal  appellate  courts  with  jurisdiction  over  ap- \npeals  from  all  final  decisions).  But,  the  School  District  again \nurges  us  to  assert  pendent  appellate  jurisdiction  to  consider \nthe  denial  of  the  motion  to  dismiss.  We  decline  the  invitation. \nPendent  appellate  jurisdiction  is  a  discretionary  doctrine. \nJones  v.  InfoCure  Corp.,  310  F.3d  529,  537  (7th  Cir.  2002).  Tt  is \nalso  a  narrow  one,  Abelesz  v.  OTP  Bank,  692  F.3d  638,  647  (7th \nCir.  2012),  which  the  Supreme  Court  sharply  restricted  in \nSwint v.  Chambers  County  Conimission,  514  US.  35  (1995).  After \nSwint,  we  noted  in  Lintted  States  v.  Board  of School  Commission- \ners  of the  City  of Indianapolis,  128  F.3d  507  (7th  Cir.  1997),  that \npendent  appellate  jurisdiction  is  a  “controversial  and  embat- \ntled  doctrine.”  Id.  at 510.  Nonetheless,  the  Supreme  Court  rec- \nognized  a  narrow  path  for  its  use  in  Clinton  v.  Jones,  520  U.S. \n681,  707  1.41  (1997),  where  it  found  that  a  collateral  order \ndenying  presidential  immunity  was  inextricably  intertwined \nwith  an  order  that  stayed  discovery  and  postponed  trial,  and \nwas  therefore,  reviewable  on  appeal. \nWhen  applicable,  the  doctrine  allows  for  review  of  an \n“otherwise  unappealable  interlocutory  order  if  it  is  inextrica- \nbly  intertwined  with  an  appealable  one.”  Montano  v.  City  of \nChicago,  375  F.3d  593,  599  (7th  Cir.  2004)  (quoting  Jones,  310 \nF.3d  at  536)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  This  requires \nmore  than  a  “close  link”  between  the  two  orders.  Id.  at  600. \nJudicial  economy  is  also  an  insufficient justification  for  invok- \ning  the  doctrine  and  disregarding  the  final-judgment  rule. \nMcCarter  v,  Ret.  Plan for Dist.

Rather,  we  must  satisfy  our- \nselves  that based  upon the specific  facts  of  this  case,  itis  “prac- \ntically  indispensable  that  we  address  the  merits  of  the  unap- \npealable  order  in  order  to  resolve  the  properly-taken  appeal.” \nMontano,  375  F.3d  at  600  (quoting  United  States  ex  rel.  Valders \nStone  & Marble,  Inc.  v.  C-Way  Constr.  Co.,  909  F.2d  259,  262  (7th \nCir,  1990))  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also Abelesz, \n692  F.3d  at  647  (“[Plendent  appellate  jurisdiction  should  not \nbe  stretched  to  appeal  normally  unappealable  interlocutory \norders  that happen  to be  related —even closely  related — to  the \nappealable order.”).  Such a high threshold  is  required because \namore  relaxed  approach would  allow  the  doctrine  to  swallow \nthe  final-judgment  rule.  Montano,  375  F.3d  at  599  (citing  Pat- \nterson  v.  Portch,  853  F.2d  1399,  1403  (7th  Cir.  1988)}. \nAs  we  discuss  below,  the  district  court  determined  that \nAsh  sutticiently  demonstrated  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the \nmerits  of his  claims  and  that  preliminary  injunctive  relief was \nwarranted.  In  doing  so,  the  district  court  referenced  its  deci- \nsion  to  deny  the  School  District's  motion  to  dismiss.  The \nSchool  District  contends  that  this  rendered  the  two  decisions \ninextricably  intertwined.  Therefore,  if  reasons  that  pendent \njurisdiction  is  appropriate  because  to  engage  in  a  meaningful \nreview  of  the  preliminary  injunction  order,  the  court  must \nalso  review  the  denial  of  the  motion  to  dismiss. \nMerely  referencing  the  earlier  decision  to  deny  the  motion \nto  dismiss,  however,  did  not  inextricably  intertwine  the  two \norders.  Certainly  the  legal  issues  raised  in  the  motions  over- \nlapped,  as both motions  challenged,  in  different ways  and  un- \nder  different  standards,  the  likely  merits  of  Ash’s  claim.  In- \nvoking  pendent  jurisdiction  simply  because  of  this  overlap \nwould  essentially  convert  a  motion  for  preliminary  injunctive \naS“ TE2A LS ASNy  GPAOAD RA  DssD   Cgedete rt  HyEeeA PFo e  Fal  %  Baa ag5    Pood ok-   my BQ   aMe rei.i  rriocne:  \nnee ade LP  Le  OAS SF  POOP  AA  WPA  a  a  Po  TAMwAsRS  AL.

For  all  practical  purposes,  this  would  mean  that  every \ntime  a motion to  dismiss  is  filed  simultaneously with a  motion \nfor  preliminary  injunction,  this  doctrine  would  apply.  This \nmakes  no  sense  and  we  do  not  see  a  compelling  reason  for \ninvoking  the  doctrine  here. \nB.  Preluminary  Injunctive  Relief  Was  Proper \nA  preliminary  injunction  is  an  extraordinary  remedy.  See \nGirl  Scouts  of Manitou  Council,  Inc.  v.  Girl  Scouts  of United  States \nof Am.,  Inc.,  549  F.3d  1079,  1085  (7th  Cir.  2008)  (noting  that  “a \npreliminary  injunction  is  an  exercise  of  a  very  far-reaching \npower,  never  to  be  indulged  in  except  in  a  case  clearly  de- \nmanding it.”)  Gnternal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted). \nIt  is  never  awarded  as  a  matter  of  right.

Ash  Likely  to  Suffer  Irreparable  Harm \nThe  moving  party  must  demonstrate  that  he  will  likely \nsuffer  irreparable  harm  absent  obtaining  preliminary  injpunc- \ntive  relief.  See  Michigan  v.  US.  Arniy  Corps  of Eng’rs,  667  F.3d \n765,  787  (7th  Cir.  2011).  This  requires  more  than  a  mere  possi- \nbility  of harm.  id.  at  788.  It  does  not,  however,  require  that  the \nharm  actually  occur  before  injunctive  relief  is  warranted.  Id. \nNor  does  it  require  that  the  harm  be  certain  to  occur  before  a \ncourt  may  grant  relief  on  the  merits.  id.  Rather,  harm  is  con- \nsidered  irreparable  ifit  “cannot be  prevented  or  fully  rectified \nby  the  final judgment  after  trial.”  Girl  Scouts  of Manitou  Coun- \ncu,  ine.,  549  F.3d  at  1089  (quoting  Roland  Mach.

Because  a  district  court’s  determination \nregarding  irreparable  harm  is  a  tactual  finding,  it  is  reviewed \nfor  clear  error.  Id.  at  1087. \nOn  appeal,  the  School District  argues  that  the  district court \nerred  in  finding  that  Ash  established  that  he  would  suffer  ir- \nreparable  harm  absent  a  preliminary  injunction.  Although \nAsh  proffered  reports  from  two  different  experts  regarding \nthe  harm  caused  to  him  by  the  School  District's  policy,  the \nSchool  District  contends  that  neither  expert  was  able  to  actu- \nally  quantify  this  harm.  Further,  the  School  District  notes  that \nAsh’s  failure  to  take  advantage  of  “readily  available  alterna- \ntives,”  namely  the  gender-neutral bathrooms,  undermines  his \nclaim  of irreparable  harm.

Meee \nNo.  16-3522  15 \nAsh’s  delay  in  seeking  injunctive  relief  as  indicative  of  the \nlack  of  irreparable  harm. \ntrict  court was  presented  with  expert  opinions  that  supported \nAsh's  assertion  that  he  would  sufter  irreparable  harm  absent \npreliminary  relief.  These  experts  opined  that  use  of  the  boys’ \nrestrooms  is  integral  to  Ash’s  transition  and  emotional  well- \nbeing.  Dr.  Stephanie  Budge,  a  psychologist who  specializes  in \nworking  with  adolescents  and  adults  who  have  Gender  Dys- \nphoria,  met  with  Ash  and  his  mother,  and  in  her  report  noted \nthat  the  treatment  Ash  faced  at  school  “significantly  and  neg- \natively  impacted  his  mental  health  and  overall  well-being.” \nDr.  Budge  also  noted  that  Ash  reported  current  thoughts \nof  suicide  and  that  his  depression  worsened  each  time  he  had \nto  meet  with  school  officials  regarding  his  bathroom  usage. \nUltimately,  she  opined  that  the  School  District’s  actions,  in- \ncluding  its  bathroom  policy,  which  identified  Ash  as \ntransgender  and  therefore,  “different,”  were  “directly  causing \nsignificant  psychological  distress  and  place  [Ash]  at  risk  for \nexperiencing  life-long  diminished  well-being  and  life-func- \ntioning.”  The  district  court  did  not  clearly  err  in  relying  upon \nthese  findings  when  it  concluded  that Ash would  suffer  irrep- \narable  harm  absent  preliminary  injunctive  relief, \nFurther,  the  School  District's  argument  that  Ash’s  harm \nwas  self-inflicted  becatise  he  chose  not  to  use  the  gender-neu- \ntral  restrooms,  fails  to  comprehend  the  harm  that  Ash  has \nidentified.  The  School  District  actually  exacerbated  the  harm, \nwhen  it  dismissed  him  to  a  separate  bathroom  where  he  was \nthe  only  student  who  had  access.  This  action  further  stigma- \ntized  Ash,  indicating  that  he  was  “different”  because  he  was \na  transgender  boy. \noPy UaAoe   sanyy   SS NOPRGI AR  AMSB  Esr ,  Si. lia.o s 3  § Pies  Fooe a va  F “a  y  iBns anc  oTeR   r. k  Bey OoN   M“s ao- eir. rricon s: \ndene  ade LP  Ae  So  ara  TF  POUR  AS  aa  le  PO  TAMxARS  aha  QP  Ago  Rear LALLA EY \n  \nVaETe  OVS  PSN Yaceo kimena te h  GOROSK OF A TRAVOONT  A  TPPN SORSas s  BHwaRE   at  Oteb  Fs \nat tat Boe Sw  de eke  se  Mt NG  ste GP  aR FARIS  POPLAR  MESS \n16  No.  16-3522 \nMoreover,  the  record  demonstrates  that  these  bathrooms \nwere  not  located  close  to  Ash’s  classrooms.  Therefore,  he  was \nfaced  with  the  unenviable  choice  between  using  a  bathroom \nthat would  further  stigmatize him  and  cause  him  to  miss  class \ntime,  or  avoid  use  of  the  bathroom  altogether  at  the  expense \nof  his  health. \nAdditionally,  Ash  alleged  that  using  the  single-user  re- \nstrooms  actually  invited  more  scrutiny  and  attention  from  his \npeers,  who  inquired  why he had  access  to  these  restrooms  and \nasked  intrusive  questions  about his  transition.  This  further  in- \ntensified  his  depression  and  anxiety  surrounding  the  School \nDistrict's  policy.  Therefore,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  harm \nwas  “self-inflicted.” \nFinally,  Ash  did  not  delay  in  seeking  injunctive  relief.  He \nhad  used  the  boys’  bathroom  for  months  without  incident, \nand  he  filed  an  administrative  complaint  with  the  Depart- \nment  of  Education  in  April  2016,  just  weeks  after  the  school \nbegan  to  enforce  its  policy  once  more.  He  made  the  decision \nto  withdraw  that  complaint  over  the  summer  and  commence \nthe  instant  Htigation  instead  so  that  he  could  pursue  injunc- \ntive  relief  prior  to  beginning  his  senior  year.  It  is  important  to \nnote  that  Ash  was  on  summer  break  and  not  subject  to  the \nschool  District’s  bathroom  policy  at  the  time  he  chose  to  pur- \nsue  the  litigation.  Therefore,  Ash’s  decision  to  seek  injunctive \nrelief  over  the  summier  rather  than  initiate  an  administrative \ncomplaint  does  not  undermine  his  argument  that  the  policy \nwas  inflicting,  and  would  continue  to  inflict,  irreparable\nharm. \n|e  PTA ss MAAGAR OE  Rdearcd  AAPA  Bane  TA  ey  BO  Moroeirrrics: \nCe  lc STA  OAS AS Sera  Gd  YORE  AS  Gl  a  PO  TAMARS  ALAS  QE  A  Rar LSS DIAG E \n  \n5-   rN\\ onao ckmenae tee e oh  OSSe y  paY P  SFee OeRye   Swaea n:  OSefs ! \nSF Ban  Se  Rw Le La  SE  we A  me  a FAIRS  POPLAR.

No  Adequate  Remedies  at  Law \nThe  moving  party  must  also  demonstrate  that  he  has  no \nadequate  remedy  at  law  should  the  preliminary  injunction \nnot  issue,  Protamek  Indus.,  Ltd.  v.  Equitrac  Corp.,  300  F.3d  808, \n813  (7th  Cir.  2002).  This  does  not  require  that  he  demonstrate \nthat  the  remedy be  wholly  ineffectual.  Foodcomm  Int'l  v.  Barry, \n328  F.3d  300,  304  (7th  Cir.  2003).  Rather,  he  must  demonstrate \nthat  any  award  would  be  “seriously  deficient  as  compared  to \nthe  harm  suffered.”  Id. \nWhile  the  School  District  focuses  the  majority  of  its  argu- \nments  on  why  Ash’s  harm  is  not  irreparable,  it  also  argues \nthat  any  harm  he  has  allegedly  suffered  can  be  remedied  by \nmonetary  damages.  We  are  not  convinced.  While  monetary \ndamages  are  used  to  compensate  plaintiffs  in  tort  actions,  in \nthose  situations  the  damages  relate  to  a  past  event,  where  the \nharm  was  inflicted  on  the  plaintiff  through  neghgence  or \nsomething  comparable.  But  this  case  is  not  the  typical  tort  ac- \ntion,  as  Ash  has  alleged  prospective  harm.  He  has  asserted  that \nthe  policy catised  him to  coritemplate  suicide,  a claim that was \ncredited by  the  expert  report of Dr.  Budge.  We  cannot say  that \nthis  potential  harm—his  suicide—can  be  compensated  by \nmonetary  damages.  Nor  is  there  an  adequate  remedy  for  pre- \nventable  “life-long  diminished  well-being  and  life-function- \ning.”  Therefore,  we  reject  the  School  District’s  analogy  to  tort \ndamages  and  fird  that  Ash  adequately  established  that  there \nwas  no  adequate  remedy  of  law  available. \n3.  Likelhood  of  Success  on  Merits \nA  party  moving  for  preliminary  injunctive  relief  need  not \ndemonstrate  a  likelihood  of absolute  success  on  the  merits.

This  is  a  low  threshold.  UWS.  Army \nCorps  of Engrs,  667  F.3d  at  782.  Ash’s  Amended  Complaint \ncontains  two  claims—one  pursuant  to  Title  IX  and  the  other \npursuant  to  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.  We  will  discuss  each  claim  in  turn. \ni.  Tithe  Ex  Claim \nTitle  DC  provides  that  no  person  “shall,  on  the  basis  of  sex, \nbe  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of, \nor  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  educational  pro- \ngram  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance  ...  .”  20 \nU.S.C.  §  1681 (a);  see  aiso  34  CFR.  §  106.31 (a).  Covered  institu- \ntions  are,  therefore,  among  other  things,  prohibited  from:  (1) \nproviding  different  aid,  benefits,  or  services;  (2)  denying  aid, \nbenefits,  or  services;  and  (3)  subjecting  any  person  to  separate \nor  different  rules,  sanctions,  or  treatment  on  the  basis  of  sex. \nSee  34  CPLR.  §  106.31(b}(2)-(4).  Pursuarit  to  the  statute’s  regu- \nlations,  an  institution  may  provide  separate,  but  comparable, \nbathroom,  shower,  and  locker  facilities.  Id.  §  106.33.  The  par- \nties  agree  that  the  School  District  receives  federal  funds  and \nis  a  covered  institution. \nThe parties’  dispute  focuses  on  the  coverage of Title IX and \nwhether  under  the  statute,  a  transgender  student  who  alleges \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  his  or  her  transgender  status \ncan  state  a  claim  of sex  discrimination.  Neither  the  statute  nor \nthe  regulations  define  the  term  “sex.”  Also  absent  from  the \nstatute  is  the  term  “biological,”  which  the  School  District \nmaintains  is  a  necessary  modifier.  Therefore,  we  turn  to  the \nSupreme  Court  and  our  case  law  tor  guidance. \naS“  T2E .

Although  not  as  often  as  some  of  our  sis- \nter  circuits,  this  court  has  looked  to  Title  VIZ  when  construing \nTitle  IX.  5ee  e.g.,  Smith  v.  Metro.  Sch.  Dist.  Perry  Twp.,  128  Fad \n1014,  1023  (7th  Cir.  1997)  (noting  that  “it  is  helpful  to  look  to \nTitle  VIL  to  determine  whether  the  alleged  sexual  harassment \nis  severe  and  pervasive  enough  to  constitute  illegal  discrimi- \nnation  on  the  basis  of  sex  for  purposes  of  Title  IX.”).  The \nSchool  District  contends  that  we  should  do  soa  here,  and  relies \non  Our  reasoning  in  Ulane  v.  Eastern  Airlines,  Inc.,  742  F.2d \n1081  (7th  Cir.  1984),  to  conclude  that  Ash  cannot  state  a  claim \nunder  Title  IX  as  a  matter  of  law.  Other  courts  have  agreed \nwith  the  School  District’s  position.  See  Efsithy  v.  Utah  Transit \nAuth.,  502  F.3d  1215,  1221  (0th  Cir.  2007)  (relying  upon  Ulane \nto  find  that  transsexuals  are  not  a  protected  class  under  Title \nVID;  Johnston  v.  Univ.  of  Pittsburgh  of  Commu.  Sys.  of Higher \nEduc.,  97 F.  Supp.  3d  657,  675-76  (W.D.  Pa.  2015)  (relying upon \nLiane  to  find  that  a  transgender  student  cannot  state  a  claim \nunder  Title  IX).  We  disagree, \nIn  Ulane,  we  noted  in  dicta  that  Title  VIl’s  prohibition  on \nsex  discrimination  “implies  that  itis  unlawful  to  discriminate \nagainst  women  because  they  are  women  arid  against  men  be- \ncause  they  are  men.”  742  F.2d  at  1085.  We  then  looked  to  the \nlack  of  legislative  history  regarding  the  meaning  of  the  term \n“sex”  in  Tithe  VOL  and  concluded  that  this  prohibition  should \nbe  “given  a  narrow,  traditional  interpretation,  which  would \naiso  exchide  transsexuals.”  Id.  at  1085-86.  This  reasoning, \nhowever,  cannot  and  does  not  foreclose  Ash  and  other \ntransgender  students  trom  bringing  sex-discrimination \nclaims  based  upon  a  theory  of  sex-stereotyping  as  articulated \nfour  years  later  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  Price  Waterhouse  v. \nHopkins,  490  0.5.  228  (1989), \n“sy  a“  2T ELS  Sy  PAGOD AA RDss   Egeedt a  HyeEe PF oe  Fal  %  Caa arn5 e  1T a  ef  BOok   Maoer oei. rrrionce : \nBR  Bae LT  Le  OAS SE  SORIA  AR  AS  a  PO  TAMwAoRS  ALA  SE  A  Rear LALLA EY \n     \n~.  oe  ASA  NAS  os  art \nNanrcrimant  OSVS  Ta  PaRee  Sian \nRw LS Re a  PS  Ph  AAS  we wt  F  APRS LS  PSSA \n20  No.  16-3522 \nIn  Price  Waterhouse,  a  plurality  of  the  Supreme  Court  and \ntwo  justices  concurring  in  the  jidgment,  found  that  the  plain- \ntiff  had  adequately  alleged  that  her  employer,  in  violation  of \nTitle  VH,  had  discriminated  against  her  for  being  too  mascu- \nline.  The  plurality  further  emphasized  that  “we  are  beyond \nthe  day  when  an  employer  could  evaluate  employees  by  as- \nsuming  or  insisting  that  they  matched  the  stereotype  associ- \nated  with  their  group.”  fd.  at  251.  Thus,  the  Court  embraced  a \nbroad  view  of Title  VIL  as  Congress  “intended  to  strike  at  the \nentire  spectrum  of  disparate  treatment  of men  and  women  re- \nsulting  from  sex  stereotypes.”  Id.;  see  also  Sprogis  v.

Oncale  v.  Sundowner  Offshore  Services,  Inc.,  523 \nU.S,  75  (1998),  where  Justice  Scalia,  writing  for  a  unanimous \nCourt,  declared  that  “statutory  prohibitions  often  go  beyond \nthe  principal  evil  to  cover  reasonably  comparable  evils,  and  it \nis  ultimately  the  provisions  of  our  laws  rather  than  the  prin- \ncipal  concerns  of  our  legislators  by  which  we  are  governed.” \nId,  at  79. \nFollowing  Price  Waterhouse,  this  court  and  others  have  rec- \nognized  a  cause  of  action  under  Title  VIL  when  an  adverse  ac- \ntion  is  taken  because  of  an  employee's  failure  to  conform  to \nsex  stereotypes.

Our  most  recent \napplication  occurred  when,  sitting  en  banc,  we  held  that  a  ho- \nmosexual  plaintiff  can  state  a  Title  VI  claim  of  sex  discrimi- \nnation  based  upon  a  theory  of  sex-stereotyping.  Hively  v.  Ivy \nTech  Cmty.  Coll.  of Ind.,  853  F.3d  339,  351-52  (7th  Cir,  2017) \n(holding  that  a  homosexual  plaintiff may  state  a  claim  for  sex- \nbased  discrimination  tinder  Title  VU  under  either  a  sex  stere- \notyping  theory  or  under  the  associational  theory). \nThe  School  District  argues  that  even  under  a  sex-stereo- \ntyping theory,  Ash cannot demonstrate  a likelihood  of success \non  his  Title DC claim  because  its  policy is  not based  on whether \nthe  student  behaves,  walks,  talks,  or  dresses  in  a  manner  that \nis  Inconsistent  with  any  preconceived  notions  of  sex  stereo- \ntypes.  Instead,  it  contends  that  as  a  matter  of  law,  requiring  a \nbiological  female  to  use  the  women’s  bathroom  is  not  sex-ste- \nreotyping.  However,  this  view  is  too  narrow. \nBy  definition,  a  transgender  individual  does  not  conform \nto  the  sex-based  stereotypes  of  the  sex  that  he  or  she  was  as- \nsigned  at  birth.  We  are  not  alone  in  this  belief.  5ee  Glenn  v. \nBrumby,  663  F.3d  1312  (ith  Cir.  2011).  In  Glenn,  the  Eleventh \nCircuit  noted  that  “[a]  person  is  defined  as  transgender  pre- \ncisely because  of the  perception  that his  or  her behavior  trans- \ngresses  gender  stereotypes.”  I.  at  1316.  The  Eleventh  Circuit \nreiterated  this  conclusion in  a per curiam  unpublished  opinion, \nnoting  that  “sex  discrimination  includes  discrimination \nagainst  a  transgender  person  for  gender  noncontformity.” \nChavez  v.

In  Smith  v.  City \nof  Salem  378  F.3d  566  (6th  Cir.  2004),  the  plaintiff  was  diag- \nnosed  with  Gender  Identity  Disorder,  a  condition  later  re- \nnamed  Gender  Dysphoria.  Born  a  male,  the  plaintiff began  to \npresent  at  work  with  a  more  feminine  appearance  and  man- \nnerisms.  He?  alleged  in  his  complaint  that  as  a  result,  his  em- \nployer schemed  to  take  action against him  and  ultimately sub- \njected  him  to  a  pretextual  suspension  in  violation  of  Title  VII. \nWhile  the  district  court  concluded  that  because  the  plaintiff \nwas  transsexual  he  was  not  entitled  to  Title  VII's  protections, \nthe  Sixth  Circuit  disagreed. \nInstead,  the  Sixth Circuit noted  that Price  Waterhouse estab- \nlished  that  the  prohibition  on  sex  discrimination  “encom- \npasses  both  the  biological  differences  between  men  and \nwomen,  and  gender  discrimination,  that  is,  discrimination \nbased  on  a  failure  to  conform  to  stereotypical  gender  norms.” \nId.  at  573  (citing  Price  Waterhouse,  490  U.S.  at  251).  If  Title  VI \nprohibits  an  employer  from  discriminating  against  a  woman \nfor  dressing  too  masculine,  then,  the  court  reasoned,  Title  VII \nlikewise  prohibits  an  employer  from  discriminating  against  a \nman  who  dresses  in  a  way  that  it  perceives  as  too  feminine.  In \nboth  examples  the  discrimination  would  not  occur  but  for  the \nvictim’s  sex,  in  violation  of  Title  VIL  Id.  at  574.  Therefore,  the \nplaintiff's  status  as  transsexual  was  not a  bar  to  his  claim. \nSeveral  district  courts  have  adopted  this  reasoning,  find- \ning  that  a  transgender  plaintiff  can  state  a  claim  under  Title \n  \n5 We  will use  the masculine pronoun  to refer  to  the  Smith  plaintiff for \nthe purpose  of clarity,  as this is how the  Sixth Circuit referred to  the  Smith \nplaintiff throughout its  opinion. \nCase  2:16-cv-00943-PP  Filed  06/21/17  Page  22  of  39  Document  65\nDeoey2e    ~ OC™~U  M{_e—N NE AT *  GVONaE  Xy  PaoTe EuN8A    PSaaE NoDR e   eo ~  UVOYaEnS    Fey  st\\  \nNe.  16-3522  23 \nVil  for  sex  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  a  sex-stereotyping \ntheory.

See  ¢.g.,  Student  Non-Discrimination  Act  of  2015  S.  439 \n114th  Cong.  (2015).  The  Supreme  Court  has  rejected  this  ar- \ngument,  stating  that  congressional  maction  “lacks  persuasive \nsignificance  because  several  equally  tenable  inferences  may \nbe  drawn  from  such  inaction,  including  the  inference  that  the \nexisting  legislation  already  incorporated  the  offered  change.” \nPension  Benefit.

Therefore,  Congressional  inaction  is  not  determi- \nnative. \nRather,  Ash can  demonstrate  a  likelihood  of success  on  the \nmerits  of his  claim because  he  has  alleged  that  the  School  Dis- \ntrict  has  denied  him  access  to  the  boys’  restroom  because  he \nis  transgender.  A  policy  that  requires  an  individual  to  use  a \nbathroom  that  does  not  conform  with  his  or  her  gender  iden- \ntity  punishes  that  individual  for  his  or  her  gender  non-con- \nformance,  which in  turn violates  Title IX.  The  School  District’s \npolicy  also  subjects  Ash,  as  a  transgender  student,  to  different \nrules,  sanctions,  and  treatment  than  non-transgender  stu- \ndents,  in  violation  of  Title  IX.  Providing  a  gender-neutral  al- \nternative  is  not  sufficient  to  relieve  the  School  District  from \nliability,  as  it  is  the  policy  itself  which  violates  the  Act.  Pur- \nther,  based  on  the  record  here,  these  gender-neutral  alterna- \ntives  were  not  true  alternatives  because  of  their  distant  loca- \ntion  to  Ash’s  classrooms  and  the  increased  stigmatization \nthey  caused  Ash.  Rather,  the  School District  only  continued  to \nthese  gender-neutral  bathrooms  because  he  was  the  only  stu- \ndent  given  access. \nAnd,  while  the  School  District  repeatedly  asserts  that  Ash \nmay  not  “unilaterally  declare”  his  gender,  this  argument  mis- \nrepresents  Ash’s  claims  and  dismisses  his  transgender  status. \nThis  is  not  a  case  where  a  student  has  merely  announced  that \nhe  is  a  different  gender.  Rather,  Ash  has  a  medically  diag- \nnosed  and  documented  condition.  Since  his  diagnosis,  he  has \nconsistently lived  in  accordance with his  gender  identity.  This \nlaw  suit  demonstrates  that  the  decision  to  do  so  was  not with- \nout  cost  or  pain.

The  Equal  Protection  Clause \nof  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  “is  essentially  a  direction  that \nall  persons  similarly  situated  should  be  treated  alike.”  City  of \nCleburne  v.

See  Vill.  of \nWillowbrook  v.  Olech,  528  U.S.  562,  564  (2000)  (per  curiam). \nGererally,  state  action  is  presumed  to  be  lawful  and  will  be \nupheld  if  the  classification  drawn  by  the  statute  is  rationally \nrelated  to  a  legitimate  state  interest.  City  of Cleburne,  473  U.S. \nat  440, \nThe  rational  basis  test,  however,  does  not  apply  when  a \nclassification  is based  upon  sex.  Rather,  a  sex-based  classifica- \ntion  is  subject  to  heightened  scrutiny,  as  sex  “frequently bears \nno  relation  to  the  ability  to  perform  or  contribute  to  society.” \nId.  at  440-41  (quoting  Frontiero  v.

This  requires  the  state  to  show \nthat  the  “classification  serves  important  governmental  objec- \ntives  and  that  the  discriminatory  means  employed  are  sub- \nstantially  related  to  the  achievement  of  those  objectives.”  Vir- \nginia,  518  US.  at  524  Gnternal  quotation  marks  omitted).

Nor  may  the \njustification  be  based  upon  overbroad  generalizations  about \nsex.  Id.  Instead,  the justification  must  be  genuine.  1d. \nIf  a  state  actor  cannot  defend  a  sex-based  classification  by \nrelying  upon  overbroad  generalizations,  it  follows  that  sex- \nbased  stereotypes  are  also  insufficient  to  sustain  a  classifica- \ntion,  See f.£.B.,  511  US.  at  138  (rejecting  the  state’s  reliance  on \nsex-based  stereotypes  as  a  defense  to  the  discriminatory  use \nof  peremptory  challenges  during  jury  selection);  see  Glenn  v. \nBrumby,  663  F.3d  1312,  1318  (ith  Cir.  2011)  (“All  persons, \nwhether  transgender  or  not,  are  protected  from  discrimina- \ntion  on.  the  basis  of  gender  stereotype.”). \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  we  must  determine  what  standard \nof  review  applies  to  Ash’s  claim.  The  Schoo!  District  urges  us \nto  apply  the  rational  basis  test,  arguing  that  transgender  sta- \ntus  is  not  a  suspect  class.  Applying  that  test,  the  School  Dis- \ntrict  contends  that  its  policy  is  presumptively  constitutional \nand  that  requiring  students  to  use  facilities  corresponding  to \ntheir  birth sex to  protect the  privacy of all students  is  a rational \nbasis  for  its  policy.  50,  the  School  District  maintains  that  Ash \ncannot  demonstrate  a  likelihood  of  success  on  his  Equal  Pro- \ntection  Claim. \nAsh  disagrees.  He  argues  that  transgender  status  should \nbe  entitled  to  heightened  scrutiny  in  its  own  right,  as \ntransgender  people  are  a  minority who  have  historically been \nPTaA  Ls.

Alternatively,  he  argues \nthat  even  if  transgender  status  is  not  afforded  heightened \nscrutiny in its  own right,  the  School District’s bathroom policy \ncreates  a  sex-based  classification  such  that  heightened  scru- \ntiny  should  apply. \nThere  is  no  denying  that  transgender  individuals  face  dis- \ncrimination,  harassment,  and  violence because  of their gender \nidentity.  According  to  a  report  issued  by  the  National  Center \nfor  Transgender  Equality,  78%  of  students  who  identify  as \ntransgender  or  as  gender  non-conformant,  report  being  har- \nassed  while  in  grades  K-12.  See Jaime  M.  Grant  et  al.,  Injustice \nat  Every  Turn:  A  Report  of the  National  Transgender  Discrimina- \ntion  Survey,  Nat'l  Center  for  Transgender  Equality,  at  33 \n(2011),  available  at  http://www-transequality.org/sites/de- \nfault/fles/docs/resources/NTDS_Report.pdf.  These  same  in- \ndividuals  in  K-12  also  reported  an  alarming  rate  of  assault, \nwith  35%  reporting  physical  assault  and  12%  reporting  sexual \nassault.  Id.  As  a  result,  15%  of  transgender  and  gender  non- \nconformant students  surveyed  made  the  decision  to  drop  out. \nld.  These  statistics  are  alarming.  But  this  case  does  not  require \nus  to  reach  the  question  of  whether  transgender  status  is  per \nse  entitled  to  heightened  scrutiny.  It  is  enough  to  stay  that, \njust  as  in  Price  Waterhouse,  the  record  for  the  preliminary  in- \njunction  shows  sex  stereotyping.  We  note  as  weil  that  there  is \nno  requirement  that  every  girl,  or  every  boy,  be  subjected  to \nthe  same  stereotyping.  It  is  enough  that  Ash  has  experienced \nthis  form  of  sex  discrimination. \nHere,  the  School  District’s  policy  cannot be  stated  without \nreferencing  sex,  as  the  School  District  decides  which  bath- \naoa“ vte  a2deP  LeeMs  heOSy O SP AtOPaD  O A 2 sHsy  Ne  hPgeaOertP ePs  %A A  PAAyASe eT SFko ee   Fal4   %  Po3a a  TPAMEItaNtRG   “aom”y  f tes  eUEt   wmy 2ae   :f aaae y ReeR L PeAeR Y  \n  \nCase:  16-3522  Document:  00713017988  Filed:  06/21/2017  Pages:  35  (28  of  39) \n28  No.  16-3522 \nroom  a  student  may  use  based  upon  the  sex  listed  on  the  stu- \ndent’s  birth  certificate.  This  policy  is  inherently  based  upon a \nsex-classification  and  heightened  review  applies.  Further,  the \nSchool  District  argues  that  since  it  treats  all  boys  and  girls  the \nsame,  it  does  not  violate  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.  This  is \nuntrue.  Rather,  the  School District  treats  transgender students \nlike  Ash,  who  fail  to  conform  to  the  sex-based  stereotypes  as- \nsociated  with  their  assigned  sex  at  birth,  differently.  These \nstudents  are  disciplined  under  the  School  District’s  bathroom \npolicy  if  they  choose  to  use  a  bathroom  that  conforms  to  their \ngender  identity.  This  places  the  burden  on  the  School  District \nto  demonstrate  that  its  justification  for  its  bathroom  policy  is \nnot  only  genuine,  but  also  “exceedingly  persuasive.”  See  Vir- \nginia,  518  U.S.  at  533.  This  burden  has  not  been  met  here. \nThe  School  District  defends  its  bathroom  policy  by  claim- \ning  it  needs  to  protect  the  privacy  rights  of  all  22,160  stu- \ndents.°  The  mere  presence  of  a  transgender  student  in  the \nbathroom,  the  School  District  argues,  infringes  upon  the  pri- \nvacy  rights  of  other  students  with  whom  he  or  she  does  not \nshare  biological  anatomy.  While  this  court  certainly  recog- \nnizes  that  the  School  District  has  a  legitimate  interest  in  en- \nsuring  bathroom  privacy  rights  are  protected,  this  interest \nmust  be  weighed  against  the  facts  of  the  case  and  not just  ex- \namined  in  the  abstract,  to  determine  whether  this justification \nis  genuine. \n  \n© We note that the School District’s reliance upon the privacy interests \nof  all  of  its  22,160  students  is  odd  given  that  the  preliminary  injunction \norder  only  pertains  to  Ash,  a  student  at  one  of its  high  schools.  Many  of \nthe  School  District’s  students  attend  schools  other  than  Tremper  and  are \ntherefore,  totally unaffected by the  district  court’s  order. \nCase  2:16-cv-00943-PP  Filed  06/21/17  Page  28  of  39  Document  65\nVET weN ey  rMN aocne timanetae   OPfUS SOE A  SVENYP   PFPOER   MiaER n:L e.

For  nearly  six  months,  Ash  used  the  boys’  bath- \nroom  while  at  school  and  school-sponsored  events  without \nincident  or  complaint  from  another  student.  In  fact,  it  was \nonly  when  a  teacher  witnessed  Ash  washing  his  hands  in  the \nrestroom  that  his  bathroom  usage  once  more  became  an  issue \nin  the  School  District’s  eyes.  And  while  at  oral  argument,  the \nSchool District asserted  that it had  received just one  complaint \nfrom  a  parent,  this  is  insufficient  to  support  its  position  that \nits  policy  is  required  to  protect  the  privacy  rights  of  each  and \nevery  student.  Counsel  for  the  School  District  cited  to  Ash's \nAmended  Complaint  for  this  assertion.  The  Amended  Com- \nplaint,  however,  states  that  “some  parents  and  other  Kenosha \nresidents  began  to  speak  out  in  opposition  to  Ash’s  right  to \nuse  the  boys’  restrooms.”  Am.  Comp.  J  77.  It  further  states \nthat  several  community  members  spoke  at  a  School  Board \nmeeting  and  voiced  their  opposition  to  a  policy  that  would \nallow  transgender  students  to  use  gender-appropriate  re- \nstrooms.  See  id.  (“One  parent  told  the  Board  that  he  was  op- \nposed  to  permitting  transgender  students  to  use  gender-ap- \npropriate  restrooms  ...  .”).  Nonetheless,  neither  party  has  of- \nfered  any  evidence  or  even  alleged  that the  School District has \nreceived  any  complaints from  other  students.  This  policy  does \nnothing  to  protect  the  privacy  rights  of  each  individual  stu- \ndent  vis-a-vis  students  who  share  similar  anatomy  and  if  ig- \nnores  the  practical  reality  of  how  Ash,  as  a  transgender  boy, \nuses  the  bathroom:  by  entering  a  stall  and  closing  the  door. \nA  transgender  student’s  presence  in  the  restroom  pro- \nvides  no  more  of  a  risk  to  other  students’  privacy  rights  than \nthe  presence  of  an  overly  curious  student  of  the  same  biolog- \nical  sex  who  decides  to  sneak  glances  at  his  or  her  classmates \naS“  T2R .

Com- \nmon  sense  tells  us  that  the  communal  restroom  is  a  place \nwhere  individuals  act in  a  discreet manner  to  protect their  pri- \nvacy  and  those  who  have  true  privacy  concerns  are  able  to \nutilize  a  stall.  Nothing  in  the  record  suggests  that  the  bath- \nrooms  at  Tremper  High  School  are  particularly  susceptible  to \nan  intrusion  upon  an  individual’s  privacy.  Further,  if  the \nSchool District’s  concern is  that a  child will be  in the bathroom \nwith  another  child  who  does  not  look  anatomically  the  same, \nthen  it  would  seem  that  separate  bathrooms  also  would  be \nappropriate  for  pre-pubescent  and  post-pubescent  children \nwho  do  not  look  alike  anatomically.  But  the  School  District \nhas  not  drawn  this  line.  Therefore,  this  court  agrees  with  the \ndistrict  court  that  the  School  District’s  privacy  arguments  are \ninsufficient  to  establish  an  exceedingly  persuasive  fustifica- \ntion  for  the  classification. \nAdditionally,  at oral  argument,  counsel  for  the  School  Dis- \ntrict  clarified  that  the  only  way  that  Ash  would  be  permitted \nto  use  the  boys’  restroom  would  be  if  he  were  to  present  the \nschool  with  a  birth  certificate  that  designated  his  sex  as  male. \nBut  itis  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  School  District  has \nnot  provided  a  written  copy  of  the  policy.  Nor  is  it  clear  that \none  even  exists.  And,  before  this  ligation,  Ash’s  mother  was \nnever  told  that  she  needed  to  produce  a  birth  certificate.  In- \nstead,  when  she  asked  the  School  District  to  permit him  to  use \nthe  boys’  restroom,  the  schoal’s  assistant  principal  told  her \nthat  Ash  could  use  the  boys’  restroom  only  if  his  sex  was \nchanged  in  the  school’s  official  records.  To  do  sa,  Ash  would \nneed  to  submit  unspecified  legal  or  medical  “documenta- \ntion.”  Despite  explaining  to  the  assistant  principal  that  Ash \naS“ TE2A LS ASNy  GPAOAD RA  DssD   Cgedete rt  HyEeeA PFo e  Fal  %  Caa ar5a    SM  a- f  my BQ  Pahe acuirrioene:  \nnee ade LP  Le OAS SF  POOP  AA  WPA  a  a  PO  TAMwAsR  AS  QE  A  Rear LALLA EY \n  \natAa TaTet  o Ao.  tSy   rSdNe  Yeoank ec kimseena  tmen  te  GMtO SNONOG    sAtNT e GRPoN  OOTN  aaR eF PSAORRIoAs Ss   wBPeHOradPE  LARont  s  OMNEbNSNS   Fs  fens vo, ool,  Lae ‘on, the Senet\nNo.  16-3522  St \nwas  too young to have  sex-reassignment surgery  and  present- \ning  the  School  District  with  two  letters  from  Ash’s  pediatri- \ncian,  Ash  was  still  not  allowed  to  use  the  boys’  restroom. \nFurther,  itis  unclear  that  the  sex  marker  on  a  birth  certifi- \ncate  can  even  be  used  as  a  true  proxy  for  an  individual's  bio- \nlogical  sex.  The  marker  does  not  take  into  account  an  individ- \nual’s  chromosomal  makeup,  which  is  also  a  key  component \nof  one’s  biological  sex.  Theretore,  one’s  birth  certificate  could \nreflect  a  male  sex,  while  the  individual’s  chromosomal \nmakeup  reflects  another.  It  is  also  unclear  what  would  hap- \npen  if  an  individual  is  born  with  the  external  genitalia  of  two \nsexes,  or  genitalia  that  is  ambiguous  in  nature.  In  those  cases, \nit  is  clear  that  the  marker  on  the  birth  certificate  would  not \nadequately  account  for  or  reflect  one’s  biological  sex,  which \nwould  have  to  be  determined  by  considering  more  than  what \nwas  listed  on  the  paper. \nMoreover,  while  it  is  true  that  in  Wisconsin  an  individual \nmay  ory  charge  his  or  her  designated  sex  on  a  birth  certifi- \ncate  after  completing  a  surgical  reassignment,  see  Wis.  Stat. \nAnn.  §  69.15(4),  this  is  not  universally  the  case.  For  example, \nas  Ash’s  counsel  pointed  out  during  oral  argument,  in  Min- \nnesota,  an  individual  may  amend  his  or  her  birth  certificate  to \nreflect  his  or  her  gender  identity  without  surgical  reassign- \nment.  See  Requirements  for  documents  submitted  to  support  the \namendment  of  a  birth  record,  MINNESOTA  DEP’T  OF  HEALTH, \nhitp:/www.health.state.mn.us/divs/chs/osr/reqdocs. hint gender \n(last  visited  May  30,  2017).  Therefore,  a  student  who  is  born \nin Minnesota  and begins his  transition there,  obtaining a  mod- \nified  birth  certificate  as  part  of  the  process,  could  move  to  Ke- \nnosha  and  be  permitted  to  use  the  boys’  restroom  in  one  of \nPyle TAeeL  ess  SSRG AS  AwL DwLe y  pReaeds t 2  OAee Lf om  TSf atty  mCy araa   SS2y7   ah  mByOe   wMee yciirrian e: \nnee ade LP  Le OAS SF  SORIA  AR  AS  a  PO  TAMeAr:R S  wa  LE  A  Rear LALLA EY \n  \nme  ee  SRA  NE  -  ren \nSYackiment  GOS  TROT  PSORss  Sa \ntan?

Rather,  the  School  District  re- \nquires  that  each  new  student  provide  either  a  birth  certificate \nor  a  passport.  5ee  Registration,  KENOSHA  UNIPIED  SCH.

This  process  does \nnot  require  that  an  individual  have  undergone  sex-reassign- \nment  surgery.  Therefore,  the  school  District’s  reliance  upon  a \nbirth  certificate’s  sex-marker  demonstrates  the  arbitrary  na- \nture  of  the  policy;  so,  Ash  has  met  the  low  threshold  of \ndemonstrating  a  probability  of  success  on  his  Equal  Protec- \ntion  Claim. \n4.  Balance  of  Harms  Favors  Ash \nHaving  already  determined  that  the  district  court  did  not \nerr in finding  that Ash will  suffer irreparable harm  absent pre- \nliminary  injunctive  relief,  we  now  must  look  at  whether \ngranting  preliminary  injunctive  relief  will  harm  the  School \nDistrict  and  the  public  as  a  whole.  Once  a  moving  party  has \nmet  its  burden  of  establishing  the  threshold  requirements  for \na  preliminary  injunction,  the  court  must  balance  the  harms \nfaced  by both  parties  and  the  public  as  a  whole.

This  is  done  on  a  “slid- \ning  scale”  measuring  the balance  of harms  against  the  moving \nparty’s  likelihood  of  success.  Turnell,  796  F.3d  at  662.  The \nmore  likely  he  is  to  succeed  on  the  merits,  the  less  the  scale \nmust  tip  in  his  favor.  Id.  The  converse,  however,  also  is  true: \nthe  less  likely he  is  to  win,  the  more  the balance  of harms  must \nweigh  in  his  favor  for  an  injunction  to  issue.  id.  Substantial \ndeference  is  given  to  the  district  court’s  analysis  of the  balanc- \ning  of  harms.  1d. \nThe  School  District  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  in \ndetermining  that  the  balance  of  the  harms  weighed  in  favor \nof  granting  the  injunction  because  it  ignored  the  fact  that  the \nharm  extends  to  22,160  students  in  the  School  District  whose \nprivacy  rights  are  at  risk by  allowing  a  transgender  student  to \nutilize  a  bathroom  that  does  not  correspond  with  his  biologi- \ncal  sex.  Granting  the  injunction,  the  School  District  continues, \nalso  irreparably harmed  these  students’  parents,  who  are  now \ndenied  the  right  to  direct  the  education  and  upbringing  of \ntheir  children.  Additionally,  the  School  District  asserts  that \nthe  injunction  harms  the  public  as  a  whole,  since  it  forces \nother school  districts nationwide  to  contemplate whether they \nmust  change  their  policies  and  alter  their  facilities  or  risk  be- \ning  found  out  of  comphance  with  Tithe  IX.  Noncompliance \nplaces  their  federal  funding  at  risk.  Based  upon  this  record, \nhowever,  we  find  the  School  District’s  arguments  unpersua- \nsive. \nThe  School District has  not  demonstrated  that  it will  suffer \nany  harm  from  having  to  comply  with  the  district  court's  pre- \nliminary  injunction  order.  Nor  has  it  established  that  the  pub- \nlicas  a whole  will suffer harm.

The  School  District  has  not  produced  any  ev- \nidence  that  any  students  have  ever  complained  about  Ash’s \npresence  in  the  boys’  restroom.  Nor  have  they  demonstrated \nthat  Ash’s  presence  has  actually  caused  an  invasion  of  any \nother  student’s  privacy.  And  while  the  School  District  claims \nthat  preliminary  injunctive  relief infringes  upon  parents’  abil- \nity  to  direct  the  education  of  their  children,  it  offers  no  evi- \ndence  that  a  parent  has  ever  asserted  this  right.  These  claims \nare  all  speculative. \nWe are  further  convinced  that  the  district  court  did  not  err \nin.  finding  that  this  balance  weighed  in  favor  of  granting  the \ninjunction  when  considering  the  statements  made  by  amici, \nwho  are  school  administrators  from  twenty-one  states  and  the \nDistrict  of  Columbia.  Together,  these  administrators  are  re- \nsponsible  for  educating  approximately  1.4  million  students. \nEach  administrator  has  experience  implementing  inclusive \nbathroom  policies  in  their  respective  schools,  and  each  has \nerappled  with  the  same  privacy  concerns  that  the  School  Dis- \ntrict  raises  here.  These  administrators  uniformly  agree  that \nthe  frequently-raised  and  hypothetical  concerns  about  a  pol- \nicy  that  permits  a  student  to  utilize  a  bathroom  consistent \nwith  his  or  her  gender  identity  have  simply  not  materialized. \nRather,  in  their  combined  experience,  all  students’  needs  are \nbest  served  when  students  are  treated  equally. \nAlthough  the  School  District  argues  that  implementing  an \ninclusive policy will result in the  demise of gender-segregated \nfacilities  in  schools,  the  amici  note  that  this  has  not  been  the \ncase.  In  fact,  these  administrators  have  found  that  allowing \ntransgender  students  to  use  facilities  that  align with their  gen- \naS“  T2R .

NO. 33) \nPENDING APPEAL (DKT. NO. 44) \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n  The plaintiff filed his complaint on July 19, 2016, Dkt. No. 1, and less \nthan a month later, filed a motion for preliminary injunction, Dkt. No. 10. A \nday after the plaintiff filed the motion for preliminary injunction, the \ndefendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Dkt. No. 15. A few days \nlater, they filed a brief in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction. \nDkt. No. 17.  \n  On September 6, 2016, the court heard oral argument on the motion to \ndismiss. Dkt. No. 26. On September 19, 2016, the court issued an oral ruling \ndenying the defendants’ motion to dismiss. Dkt. No. 28. The court scheduled a \nhearing on the motion for preliminary injunction for the following day, \nSeptember 20, 2016. Id. at 9. \n1 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 10/03/16   Page 1 of 5   Document 46\n\n  On September 20, 2016, the parties presented their oral arguments on \nthe motion for preliminary injunction. Dkt. No. 31. In considering the question \nof whether the plaintiffs had a likelihood of success on the merits, the court \nrelied in good part on its decision from the previous day denying the motion to \ndismiss.1 At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted in part2 the \nplaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, and enjoined the defendants \nfrom prohibiting the plaintiff from using the boys’ restrooms at his high school; \nfrom taking punitive action against the plaintiff for using the boys’ restrooms; \nand from taking any action to monitor his restroom usage. Dkt. No. 31 at 1. \nCounsel for the defendants asked the court to stay the injunction until October \n                                       \n1 There is a bit of a procedural morass surrounding that decision. Counsel for \nthe defendants informed the court at the end of the hearing that he would be \nsubmitting a proposed order, denying his motion to dismiss but containing the \nnecessary findings for certification of an interlocutory appeal. He did not make \nany argument in support of that proposal; the court did not elicit any, nor did \nit ask for the plaintiff’s position. The court entered the order, with the \ninterlocutory appeal certification language, on September 21. Dkt. No. 29. The \nnext day, the plaintiff filed a motion asking the court to reconsider including \nthe interlocutory appeal certification language. Dkt. No. 30. On September 23, \n2016, before the court ruled on that motion, the defendants filed a notice of \nappeal with the Seventh Circuit, appealing both the order denying the motion \nto dismiss and the order granting the preliminary injunction (an order the \ncourt had issued on September 22, 2016, Dkt. No. 33). Dkt. No. 34. On \nSeptember 25, 2016, the court issued an order granting the plaintiff’s motion \nto reconsider, Dkt. No. 36, and entered an amended order denying the motion \nto dismiss but removing the interlocutory appeal certification language, Dkt. \nNo. 35. The next day, the Seventh Circuit ordered the plaintiff to respond to the \ndefendants’ request for interlocutory appeal by October 11, 2016. \n2 The plaintiff’s complaint requests other relief: it asks the court to prohibit the \ndefendants from referring to the plaintiff by his birth name, and from using \nfemale pronouns to identify him; to require the school to allow him to room \nwith other boys on school trips; to prohibit the school from requiring the \nplaintiff to wear identifying markers, such as a colored wristband; and other \nrelief. The court did not grant injunctive relief on those requests—some were \nnot ripe, and others speculated actions that had not yet occurred. \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 10/03/16   Page 2 of 5   Document 46\n\n1, 2016, to allow the defendants time to appeal. Id. The court declined. Id. at 2. \nThe defendants also asked the court to require the plaintiff to post a bond; the \ncourt took that request under advisement. Id. \n  On September 22, 2016, the court issued its written order granting in \npart the motion for preliminary injunction. Dkt. No. 33. In particular, the court \nweighed the balance of harms, and concluded that the harms suffered by the \nplaintiff if the court did not grant the injunctive relief outweighed any potential \nharms suffered by the defendant if the court were to impose the injunction. Id. \nat 13-15. The court also found that the issuance of the injunction would not \nnegatively impact the public interest. Id. at 15. Finally, the court declined to \nrequire the plaintiff to post a bond. Id. at 15-17. \n  The defendants again have asked the court to stay the preliminary \ninjunction. Dkt. No. 44. The defendants point out that they have appealed the \ncourt’s decision to the Seventh Circuit (both appealed as of right regarding the \norder granting the motion for preliminary injunction, and sought interlocutory \nappeal regarding the court’s denial of the motion to dismiss the complaint). Id. \nat 2. They argue, as they did in their motion to dismiss, that the Seventh \nCircuit’s decision on Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081) (7th \nCircuit) mandates a ruling in their favor on the Title IX issue (despite conceding \nthat the court has not decided the precise issue in question in this case). Id. at \n1-2. They argue that they will suffer irreparable harm from the injunction, \nbecause the injunction “threatens the constitutionally protected privacy \ninterest of the approximately 22,000 students in the school district.” Id. at 2-3. \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 10/03/16   Page 3 of 5   Document 46\n\nThey argue that the plaintiff will not be harmed by staying the injunction, \nbecause a stay would maintain the status quo and would not worsen the \nplaintiff’s health. Id. at 3. Finally, they argue that the public interest would be \nserved by a stay of the injunction, because it will prevent the school district’s \nstudents and parents from being “subjected to an injunction that perpetuates a \npolicy that the federal government is unable to enforce,” citing State of Texas v. \nUnited States, Case No. 16-cv-54, 2016 WL 4426495 (N.D. Tex., August 21, \n2016).3   \n  As the defendants state in their motion, the factors a movant must \nsatisfy to obtain a stay pending appeal are similar to the factors a movant must \nsatisfy to obtain injunction relief. Hinrichs v. Bosma, 440 F.3d 393, 396 (7th \nCir. 2006) (citing Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)). The moving \nparty must demonstrate that “1) it has a reasonable likelihood of success on \nthe merits; 2) no adequate remedy at law exists; 3) it will suffer irreparable \nharm if it is denied; 4) the irreparable harm the party will suffer without relief \nis greater than the harm the opposing party will suffer if the stay is granted; \nand 5) the stay will be in the public interest.” Id. (citing Kiel v. City of Kenosha, \n236 F.3d 814, 815-16 (7th Cir. 2000)). \n                                       \n3 The defendants’ statement that Texas district court’s injunction prohibits the \nfederal government from enforcing its policies at all is overbroad. The Texas \ncourt’s order prohibits the federal government from enforcing certain \nDepartment of Education policies (relevant to this case) against the plaintiffs in \nthat case “until the Court rules on the merits of this claim, or until further \ndirection from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.” Texas v. United States, 2016 \nWL 4426495 at 17. \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 10/03/16   Page 4 of 5   Document 46\n\n  Every argument which the defendants raise in their motion for stay \npending appeal was raised in their objection to the motion for preliminary \ninjunction, and the parties argued every one of those issues at the September \n20, 2016 hearing. The court found in favor of the plaintiff, and against the \ndefendants, on each factor. The defendants give no explanation for why the \ncourt should find in their favor now, when eight days prior to their filing this \nmotion to stay, the court found against them on exactly the same issues they \nraise here.  \n  The court DENIES the defendants’ motion Civil L.R. 7(h) Expedited, Non-\nDispositive Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction.

Action No. 2:16-cv-00943 \n  v.   \n  COMPLAINT \nKENOSHA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT \nNO. 1 BOARD OF EDUCATION and SUE \nSAVAGLIO-JARVIS, in her official capacity \nas Superintendent of the Kenosha Unified \nSchool District No. 1,  \n \n      Defendants. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiff A.W., a 16-year-old boy, is a rising senior at George Nelson Tremper \nHigh School (“Tremper”) in the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 (“KUSD”) in Kenosha, \nWisconsin.  A.W. is a boy.  He is also transgender.  A.W. was assumed to be a girl when he was \nborn, and was designated “female” on his birth certificate, but has a male gender identity and \nlives as a boy in all aspects of his life.  A.W.’s family, classmates, medical providers, and others \nrecognize A.W. as a boy, respect his male gender identity, and support his right to live and be \ntreated consistent with that gender identity. \n2.  Defendants Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education (the \n“Board”), Superintendent Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, and their agents, employees, and representatives, \nhave repeatedly refused to recognize or respect A.W.’s gender identity and have taken a series of \ndiscriminatory and highly stigmatizing actions against him based on his sex, gender identity, and \ntransgender status.  The actions, as described more fully herein, have included (a) denying him \n1 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 1 of 36   Document 1\n\naccess to boys’ restrooms at school and requiring him to use girls’ restrooms or a single-\noccupancy restroom; (b) directing school staff to monitor his restroom usage and to report to \nadministrators if he was observed using a boys’ restroom; (c) intentionally and repeatedly using \nhis birth name and female pronouns, and failing to appropriately inform substitute teachers and \nother staff members of his preferred name and pronouns, resulting in those staff referring to him \nby his birth name or with female pronouns in front of other students; (d) instructing guidance \ncounselors to issue bright green wristbands to A.W. and any other transgender students at the \nschool, to more easily monitor and enforce these students’ restroom usage; (e) requiring him to \nroom with girls on an orchestra trip to Europe and requiring, as a condition of his ability to \nparticipate in a recent overnight school-sponsored orchestra camp held on a college campus, that \nhe stay either in a multi-room suite with girls, or alone in a multi-room suite with no other \nstudents, while all other boys shared multi-room suites with other boys; and (f) initially denying \nhim the ability to run for junior prom king, despite being nominated for that recognition based on \nhis active involvement in community service, instructing him that he could only run for prom \nqueen, and only relenting and allowing him to run for prom king after a protest by many of those \nsame classmates. \n3.  Through these actions, Defendants have discriminated against A.W. on the basis \nof sex, including on the basis of his gender identity, transgender status, and nonconformity to \nsex-based stereotypes, in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681, et seq., and on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Defendants’ actions \nhave denied A.W. full and equal access to KUSD’s education program and activities on the basis \nof his sex. \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 2 of 36   Document 1\n\n4.  Plaintiff, through his mother and next friend, M.W., brings this action against \nDefendants based on these unlawful and discriminatory actions. \n5.  Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive \nrelief, and damages resulting from Defendants’ discriminatory actions.   \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff A.W. is a 16-year-old boy.  He was born in 1999.  He resides in \nKenosha, Wisconsin and is a student at Tremper High School, a public high school in the \nKenosha Unified School District No. 1.  He will begin his senior year at Tremper on September \n1, 2016. \n7.  M.W. is A.W.’s mother and brings this action as his next friend.  M.W. resides in \nKenosha, Wisconsin and is employed by the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 as a high \nschool teacher at Tremper. \n8.  Defendant Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education is a seven-\nmember elected body responsible for governing the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1, a \npublic school district serving over 22,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade who reside \nin the City of Kenosha, Village of Pleasant Prairie, and Town and Village of Somers.  The Board \nderives its authority to govern KUSD directly from the Wisconsin Constitution and state statutes.  \nThe school district is a recipient of federal funds from the U.S. Department of Education, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and, as \nsuch, is subject to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex \ndiscrimination against any person in any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.  The Board designates responsibility for the administration of KUSD to its \nSuperintendent of Schools, currently Dr. Sue Sarvaglio-Jarvis, who oversees a number of \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 3 of 36   Document 1\n\ndistrict-level administrators.  KUSD operates 42 schools, including six high schools.  One of the \nhigh schools is Tremper, a 1,695-student public high school located in Kenosha, serving students \nin grades 9 through 12.  Tremper’s administration includes a principal and three assistant \nprincipals.  The Board is vicariously liable for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, and \nrepresentatives, including those of the other Defendant Savaglio-Jarvis and other Tremper \nadministrators, staff, and volunteers. \n9.  Defendant Sue Savaglio-Jarvis is the Superintendent of the Kenosha Unified \nSchool District and is sued in her official capacity.  At all times relevant to the events described \nherein, Savaglio-Jarvis acted within the scope of her employment as an employee, agent, and \nrepresentative of the Board.  In such capacity, she carried out the discriminatory practices \ndescribed herein (a) at the direction of, and with the consent, encouragement, knowledge, and \nratification of the Board; (b) under the Board’s authority, control, and supervision; and (c) with \nthe actual or apparent authority of the Board. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3), and is authorized to order declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n11.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Wisconsin under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nbecause the claims arose in the District, the parties reside in the District, and all of the events \ngiving rise to this action occurred in the District. \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 4 of 36   Document 1\n\nFACTS \nGender Identity and Gender Dysphoria \n12.  Sex is a characteristic that is made up of multiple factors, including hormones, \nexternal physical features, internal reproductive organs, chromosomes, and gender identity.  \n13.  Gender identity—a person’s deeply felt understanding of their own gender—is the \ndetermining factor of a person’s sex.  Gender identity is often established as early as two or three \nyears of age, though a person’s recognition of their gender identity can emerge at any time.  \nThere is a medical consensus that efforts to change a person’s gender identity are ineffective, \nunethical, and harmful.  A person’s gender identity may be different from or the same as the \nperson’s sex assigned at birth. \n14.  The phrase “sex assigned at birth” refers to the sex designation recorded on an \ninfant’s birth certificate.  For most people, gender identity aligns with the person’s sex assigned \nat birth, a determination generally based solely on the appearance of a baby’s external genitalia \nat birth.  For transgender people, however, the gender they were assumed to be at birth does not \nalign with their gender identity.  For example, a transgender boy is a person who was assumed to \nbe female at birth but is in fact a boy.  A transgender girl is a person who was assumed to be a \nboy at birth but is in fact a girl. \n15.  Gender Dysphoria is a condition recognized by the American Psychiatric \nAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (“DSM-5”).  It \nrefers to clinically significant distress that can result when a person’s gender identity differs from \nthe person’s assumed gender at birth.  If left untreated, Gender Dysphoria may result in profound \npsychological distress, anxiety, depression, and even self-harm or suicidal ideation.   \n5 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 5 of 36   Document 1\n\n16.  Treatment for Gender Dysphoria is usually pursuant to the Standards of Care for \nthe Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (“Standards of \nCare”), published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”) \nsince 1980.  WPATH is an international, multidisciplinary, professional association of medical \nproviders, mental health providers, researchers, and others, with a mission of promoting \nevidence-based care and research for transgender health, including the treatment of Gender \nDysphoria.  WPATH published the seventh and most recent edition of the Standards of Care in \n2011. \n17.  Consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care, treatment for Gender Dysphoria \nconsists of the person “transitioning” to living and being accepted by others as the sex \ncorresponding to the person’s gender identity.  A key stage in that process is a “social transition,” \nin which the individual lives in accordance with his gender identity in all aspects of life.  A \nsocial transition, though specific to each person, typically includes adopting a new first name, \nusing and asking others to use pronouns reflecting the individual’s true gender, wearing clothing \ntypically associated with that gender, and using sex-specific facilities corresponding to that \ngender.  Failing to recognize or respect a transgender person’s gender is contrary to established \nmedical protocols and can exacerbate an individual’s symptoms of Gender Dysphoria.  \n18.  Medical treatments, such as hormone therapy or surgical procedures, may also be \nundertaken to facilitate transition and alleviate dysphoria, typically after an individual’s social \ntransition.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care, living full-time in accordance with one’s \ngender identity in all aspects of life for at least one year is a prerequisite for any medical \ninterventions.  Medical treatments are not necessary or appropriate in all cases.  \n6 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 6 of 36   Document 1\n\n19.  A social transition requires that a transgender boy be recognized as a boy and \ntreated the same as all other boys by parents, teachers, classmates, and others in the community.  \nThis includes being referred to exclusively with the student’s new name and male pronouns, \nbeing permitted to use boys’ restrooms and overnight accommodations on the same footing as \nother male students, and having the right to keep information about the student’s transgender \nstatus private.  Singling out a transgender student and treating him differently than other boys \ncommunicates the stigmatizing message to that student and the entire school community that he \nshould not be recognized or treated as a boy, simply because he is transgender.  This undermines \nthe social transition and exposes the student to the risk of renewed and heightened symptoms of \nGender Dysphoria such as anxiety and depression.  It also frequently leads transgender students \nto avoid using school restrooms altogether, often resulting in adverse physical health \nconsequences such as urinary tract infections, kidney infections, and dehydration, and other \nconsequences such as stress and difficulty focusing on classwork. \nPlaintiff’s Background \n20.  A.W. has been a student in KUSD’s schools since kindergarten.  On September 1, \n2016, he will begin his senior year at Tremper High.  A.W. is an excellent student: he has a high \ngrade point average and is currently ranked in the top five percent of his class of over 400 \nstudents.  All of his academic classes in his junior year were either Advanced Placement or \nHonors level classes.  He is also very involved in many school activities, including the school’s \nGolden Strings orchestra, theater, tennis team, National Honor Society, and Astronomical \nSociety.  After graduation, he hopes to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison and study \nbiomedical engineering.  A.W. also works part-time as an accounting assistant in a medical \noffice. \n7 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 7 of 36   Document 1\n\n21.  A.W. is a boy. He is also transgender.  He was designated “female” on his birth \ncertificate and lived as a girl until middle school, when he recognized that he is, in fact, a boy, \nand he began to experience profound discomfort with being assumed to be a girl by others. \n22.  At the end of eighth grade, in the spring of 2013, A.W. told his parents that he is \ntransgender and a boy.  Shortly thereafter, he told his older brothers.   \n23.  During the 2013-2014 school year, A.W.’s freshman year of high school at \nTremper, A.W. began confiding to a few close friends that he is a boy.  He slowly began \ntransitioning more publicly to live in accordance with his male identity: he cut his hair short, \nbegan wearing more traditionally masculine clothing, and began to go by a typically masculine \nname and masculine pronouns.   \n24.  At the beginning of his sophomore year, in the fall of 2014, A.W. told all of his \nteachers and peers that he is a boy, requesting that he be referred to using male pronouns and his \nnew name.  On Christmas, 2014, A.W. told his extended family, including grandparents, aunts, \nuncles, and cousins, that he is a boy.     \n25.  A.W. has undertaken his gender transition under the guidance and care of \ntherapists and medical doctors.  He was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria by his pediatrician.  \nAround the time of his public transition, A.W. began seeing a gender specialist therapist to \nsupport him in his transition.  He is currently under the care of clinical psychologist, who is also \na gender specialist.  In April 2016, he began consulting with an endocrinologist at Children’s \nHospital of Wisconsin to discuss hormonal therapy, which he intends to begin in the near future.  \n26.  Since A.W.’s transition at school, he has been widely known and accepted as a \nboy by the school community.  At a Golden Strings orchestra performance at a hotel on January \n17, 2015, A.W. wore a tuxedo, just like all the other boys, with the support of his orchestra \n8 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 8 of 36   Document 1\n\nteacher, Helen Breitenbach-Cooper.  Students and teachers who did not know A.W. prior to his \ntransition did not and would not have recognized him as different from any other boy until the \ndiscriminatory events described in this complaint took place.  \nKUSD’s Refusal to Permit Plaintiff Access to Restrooms Consistent with His Gender Identity \n27.  In the spring of 2015, during A.W.’s sophomore year, A.W. and his mother had \nseveral meetings with A.W.’s guidance counselor, Debra Tronvig, during which they requested \nthat A.W. be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms at school.  The counselor spoke to the school’s \nprincipal, Richard Aiello, and one of its assistant principals, Brian Geiger, and she advocated that \nA.W. be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms.  However, at a meeting in March 2015, she \nreported back to A.W. and his mother that the school administrators had decided that A.W. \nwould only be permitted to use the girls’ restrooms or the single-user, gender-neutral restroom in \nthe school office.  Tronvig and the school administrators did not suggest or indicate any \ncircumstance under which A.W. might be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms in the future.   \n28.  After that meeting, A.W. felt overwhelmed, helpless, hopeless, and alone.  Both \nof the restroom options offered by Defendants were discriminatory, burdensome, or unworkable.  \nA.W. was deeply distressed by the prospect of using the girls’ restrooms, as it would hinder and \nbe at odds with his public social transition at school, undermine his male identity, and convey to \nothers that he should be viewed and treated as a girl.  He was also deeply distressed by the \nprospect of using the office restroom, which is located in the rear of the office, behind the office \nsecretaries’ work stations—far out of the way from most of his classes—and is only used by \noffice staff and visitors.  It is A.W.’s understanding that no other students are allowed to use the \noffice restroom.  A.W. feared the questions he would face from students and staff about why he \nwas using that particular restroom; the inconvenience of traveling long distances from (and \n9 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 9 of 36   Document 1\n\nmissing time in) his classes to use that restroom; and the fact that he would be segregated from \nhis classmates and further stigmatized for being “different.”   \n29.  At the same time, A.W. was fearful of the potential disciplinary consequences if \nhe failed to comply with the administrators’ directives not to use the boys’ restroom.  He worried \nthat such a disciplinary record could potentially interfere with his ability to get into college, as he \nhad no prior record of discipline.  As a result of that fear and anxiety, seeing no plausible \noptions, A.W. largely avoided using any restrooms at school for the rest of that school year, and, \nwhen absolutely necessary, he only used a single-user girls’ restroom near his theater classroom.  \n30.  In order to avoid using restrooms at school, A.W. severely restricted his liquid \nintake.  This was particularly dangerous because A.W. suffers from vasovagal syncope, a \nmedical condition that results in fainting upon certain physical or emotional triggers.  The \ntriggers cause a person’s heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly, reducing blood flow to \nthe brain and resulting in a loss of consciousness.  Because dehydration and stress trigger his \nfainting episodes, A.W.’s primary care doctor requires him to drink 6-7 bottles of water and a \nbottle of Gatorade daily. \n31.  In addition to vasovagal syncope, A.W. also suffers from migraines triggered by \nstress.  During his sophomore year, while avoiding using restrooms, A.W. experienced greatly \nheightened symptoms of both vasovagal syncope and stress-related migraines.  He also \nexperienced increased symptoms associated with Gender Dysphoria, including depression, \nanxiety, and suicidal thoughts.   \n32.  A.W. also worried that the emotional and physical toll caused by the school’s \ntreatment of him would lead to medical or psychological harm that would delay or make it \n10 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 10 of 36   Document 1\n\nunsafe for him to begin hormone treatment as part of his transition.  This anxiety further \nincreased his symptoms of Gender Dysphoria. \n33.  In July 2015, A.W. took a trip to Europe with his school orchestra group, Golden \nStrings.  In response to A.W.’s request to room with other boys, his orchestra teacher, \nBreitenbach-Cooper, checked with school administrators and then informed him that he would \nnot be permitted to do so.  A.W. felt hurt and embarrassed when he learned of the school’s \ndecision.  Once again, he understood the school’s decision to be based on a perception that he is \nnot really a boy, and he felt degraded and humiliated by the administrators’ continued failure to \nrecognize and respect his gender identity. \n34.  As a result of the school’s decision, A.W. was forced to share a room with a girl.  \nDuring the trip, the students were frequently grouped by gender while traveling between \ndestinations, and A.W. was consistently grouped with girls.   \n35.  In July 2015, while on the trip to Europe, feeling less scrutinized, A.W. began to \nuse male-designated bathrooms.  During that trip, A.W. saw a news story about a lawsuit against \nthe Gloucester County School District in Virginia by another transgender student who was \ndenied access to boys’ restrooms at his high school.  That story reported that the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice had concluded that transgender students have the right to use restrooms in \naccordance with their gender identity under Title IX and had filed a brief in the Virginia case, \nG.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, asserting that the school district’s policy violated \ntransgender students’ rights under Title IX.  A.W. was elated to learn that he did, in fact, have \nthe legally protected right to use the restroom consistent with his gender.  For the rest of the trip, \nA.W. exclusively used male-designated bathrooms, and he continued to do so upon returning to \nthe United States.   \n11 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 11 of 36   Document 1\n\n36.  When he returned to school for his junior year, in September 2015, A.W. \ncontinued exclusively using boys’ restrooms, including at Tremper.  He did so for the first seven \nmonths of the school year without any incident.  No other students ever made an issue of A.W. \nusing the boys’ bathroom.  A.W. did not discuss this decision with administrators or teachers, \nbecause he understood it to be his legal right. \n37.  In late February 2016, after observing A.W. using a boys’ bathroom, a Tremper \nteacher advised two assistant principals, Geiger and Wendy LaLonde, of that fact.  Geiger then \ninformed the other administrators of A.W.’s restroom use and asked them what the school’s \npolicy was.   \n38.  Aiello, LaLonde, Geiger, and the third assistant principal, Holly Graf, agreed that, \nalthough neither KUSD nor Tremper had any existing written policy on students’ restroom \nusage, the school’s policy should be that transgender students, including A.W., would not be \npermitted to use school restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.  Consistent with the \nschool’s previous decision in spring 2015, they decided that A.W. would not be permitted to use \nthe boys’ restroom and, instead, would only be permitted to use the girls’ restrooms or the single-\nuser restroom in the school office. \n39.  Following that decision, Graf emailed A.W.’s guidance counselor, Tronvig, and \nrequested that Tronvig relay the school’s restroom policy to A.W. and his mother.  Tronvig \nresponded by email that she did not know what that policy was.  Graf and Tronvig then met in \nperson and Graf explained to Tronvig that A.W. would not be permitted to use the boys’ \nrestrooms.  \n12 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 12 of 36   Document 1\n\n40.  In late February 2016, Tronvig called M.W. to inform her of the administration’s \ndecision that A.W. would only be permitted to use the girls’ restrooms or the single-user \nrestroom in the school’s main office.   \n41.  When A.W. learned about the school’s decision, in early March 2016, he was \ndistressed.  He felt humiliated and deeply uncomfortable by the idea of using a girls’ restroom, \neven more so than the previous year—because he is not a girl, he had not used female-designated \nrestrooms at school or elsewhere for a long time, and because using the girls’ restrooms as a boy \nrisked subjecting him to ridicule, scrutiny, stigma, and harassment by other students and school \nstaff.  For the reasons alleged above, he also felt deeply uncomfortable with using the single-user \nmain office restroom.  He believed that either alternative would imply his status as a transgender \nboy required him to be segregated from other students, despite the fact that he had used the boys’ \nrestrooms regularly and otherwise been treated as a boy by nearly everyone in the school \ncommunity for many months.   \n42.  A.W. was also afraid of what disciplinary consequences he might face if he failed \nto comply with the school’s policy.  Faced with two unacceptable options proposed by the school \nadministrators, A.W. continued to use the boys’ restrooms, as he had been doing already.  That \napproach was the only way A.W. felt he could mitigate the physical harm that he would suffer if \nhe refrained from all restroom use during the school day and during his after-school \nextracurricular activities.  Because of his active involvement in after-school activities, a typical \nschool day for A.W. lasts from 7 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m., i.e., 9 or 10 hours.  Some activities require \nhim to be on Tremper’s campus until as late as 10 p.m., a 15-hour day.  These long days at \nschool make avoiding restrooms altogether impossible.   \n13 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 13 of 36   Document 1\n\n43.  A.W.’s decision to use the boys’ restroom consistent with his legal right, though \nin defiance of school policy, nevertheless exacted an emotional toll.  A.W. became more \ndepressed and anxious, grew distracted from his school work, and began to have trouble \nsleeping. \n44.  On or about March 10, 2016, A.W. and his mother met with Graf and Tronvig.  \nDuring that meeting, Graf referred to A.W. exclusively by his birth name.  In that meeting, Graf \ntold M.W. that the reason A.W. could not use the boys’ restrooms was because he could only use \nrestrooms consistent with his gender as listed in the school’s official records.  Graf said that the \nonly way the school could change A.W.’s gender in its records would be if the school received \nlegal or medical documentation confirming his transition to male.   \n45.  M.W. explained that, to her knowledge, A.W. was too young for transition-related \nsurgery.  Graf repeated that the school would need some kind of medical documentation, but \ndeclined to indicate what type of medical “documentation” would be sufficient to demonstrate \nthat A.W.’s gender marker should be changed on his school records and that he could use boys’ \nrestrooms.   \n46.  In response, M.W. contacted A.W.’s pediatrician.  The pediatrician faxed a letter \nto the school on or about March 11, 2016, confirming that A.W. is a transgender boy and \nrecommending that A.W. be allowed to use male-designated facilities at school.  At M.W.’s \nrequest, the pediatrician subsequently sent the school a second letter, reiterating her \nrecommendation about A.W.’s restroom usage.  \n47.  Despite the letters from A.W.’s doctor, Aiello emailed M.W. that the school \nwould continue to deny boys’ restroom access to A.W. because he had not completed a medical \ntransition. \n14 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 14 of 36   Document 1\n\n48.  A.W. continued to use the boys’ restrooms when needed, but he mainly attempted \nto avoid using restrooms altogether by not drinking or eating while at school, in order to avoid \nthe scrutiny, fear, and humiliation he faced when he had to use a restroom at school.  His anxiety \nand depression increased further.  He also experienced increased physical symptoms relating to \nhis vasovagal syncope, including dizziness, nearly fainting, and migraines.  A.W. returned to see \nhis pediatrician in late March 2016 to have his symptoms evaluated.  The pediatrician again \ninstructed him to eat and drink regularly to avoid those symptoms.  Nonetheless, A.W. was \nunable to comply with those instructions, out of fear of using the restrooms at school.  Concerned \nabout his physical health, his mother would regularly hand him a bottle of water and tell him to \ndrink it to avoid dehydration, and he would refuse, saying that he did not want to have to use the \nrestroom.  \n49.  On or about March 17, 2016, Geiger observed A.W. as he entered a boys’ \nrestroom, and reported that fact to Graf.  Minutes later, Graf insisted that A.W. leave his acting \nclass and come to her office, and met with him alone for half an hour, lecturing him about his use \nof the boys’ restrooms.   \n50.  During that same meeting, Graf asked A.W. why he was not using the girls’ \nrestroom or single-user restroom as directed.  He informed her that the school’s policy violated \nhis rights as a transgender student under Title IX.  When A.W. made clear he could not use girls’ \nrestrooms because he is not a girl, she again asked him to compromise and use the single-user \nrestroom in the main office.  He again refused because of the humiliation, stigma, and lost class \ntime that he would face using that bathroom.  Graf then reiterated her instruction that A.W. cease \nhis use of boys’ restrooms. \n15 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 15 of 36   Document 1\n\n51.  During that March 17 meeting—as well as at virtually all other times—Graf \nconsistently referred to A.W. using his traditionally female birth name and female pronouns, \ndespite A.W.’s request that she use his new name and male pronouns.  In that meeting, when \nA.W. became upset by Graf’s restroom directive and refusal to respect his male gender, Graf \nsaid, “S------, calm down,” using his birth name.  A.W., angry and embarrassed, said, “No, I’m \nleaving,” and left the office.  \n52.  During that meeting, Graf directly threatened that A.W. would be subject to \ndisciplinary action if he continued to use the boys’ restrooms.  Specifically, she indicated A.W. \nwould have to “go down to 109 or 203”—referring to Room 109, the in-school suspension room, \nand Room 203, the school’s disciplinary office.  \n53.  Following the meeting with Graf, A.W. began to cry in the hallway.  He had \ndifficulty concentrating in his classes for the remainder of the day, holding back tears.  He \nskipped work that afternoon and did not do any homework.  Instead, he just went home after \nschool and lay in bed feeling terrible.  \n54.  When he absolutely needed to use the restroom, A.W. continued to use the boys’ \nrestrooms exclusively through June 9, 2016, the final day of the school year.  As a result, Graf \ncontinued to call A.W., his mother, or both into her office for periodic meetings.  At those \nmeetings, Graf would inquire about A.W.’s restroom use, and, when told he was still using the \nboys’ restrooms, would repeat the school’s policy that he must use the girls’ restroom or a \nsingle-user restroom.  During these meetings, Graf continued to refer to A.W. by his birth name \nand female pronouns. \n55.  A.W. grew increasingly embarrassed by Graf’s repeated inquiries about his \nrestroom use, which he felt to be an invasion of his privacy.  Since each meeting with \n16 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 16 of 36   Document 1\n\nadministrators occurred during class time, A.W. was also concerned about the effect of these \nrepeated meetings on his academic performance and feared that he would face scrutiny from \nother students and teachers about why he was being removed from class so frequently.  A.W., \nwho continued to have no disciplinary record at the school, also became more worried about the \nincreasingly real prospect of disciplinary consequences that might affect his ability to participate \nin extracurricular activities and negatively impact his college application process in the \nupcoming school year. \n56.  In April 2016, M.W. learned that school administrators had sent an email to all of \nthe school’s security guards, instructing them to notify administrators if they spotted any students \nwho appear to be going into the “wrong” restroom.  Individual security guards later told M.W. \nthat they understood the directive to be targeted at A.W. \n57.  A.W. felt very uncomfortable and distressed knowing that security guards and \nadministrators were actively monitoring his restroom use. \n58.  On April 5, 2016, M.W. was pulled out of her Tremper classroom and summoned \nto a meeting with two KUSD district-level administrators:  Dr. Bethany Ormseth, KUSD’s Chief \nof School Leadership, and Susan Valeri, KUSD’s Chief of Special Education and Student \nSupport.   \n59.  In that meeting, M.W. asked Ormseth and Valeri whether KUSD had adopted any \npolicy concerning transgender students and restroom use.  They provided no answer to M.W.’s \nquestion, other than to say that a policy was in the process of being created by a committee of the \nschool board.  M.W. responded, “You don’t need a policy—it’s a federal law.”  Later in the \nschool year, M.W. learned that Rebecca Stevens, a KUSD school board member, had \n17 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 17 of 36   Document 1\n\ncontradicted Ormseth and Valeri’s account, stating to another board member that no committee \nhad yet been formed and no policy was being written. \n60.  In fact, despite repeated requests by M.W. to see the written policy about \ntransgender students’ restroom use during the course of the 2015-2016 school year, no Tremper \nor KUSD official has ever provided such a policy.  M.W. reasonably believes no such policy \nexists.  Rather, the Tremper administration developed and enforced a school “policy” in direct \nand specific response to those administrators’ discomfort with the restroom usage of one student:  \nA.W. \n61.  The next day, on April 6, 2016, A.W. and M.W. attended a meeting with Aiello, \nGraf, and Valeri.  At that meeting, the administrators offered A.W. a further “accommodation” \nregarding his restroom use:  they informed him that he would also be allowed to use two single-\nuser restrooms located on the far opposite sides of campus.  Those restrooms had previously \nbeen available for any student’s use, but new locks had been installed and A.W. alone was given \nthe key to open them.  The stigma of being assigned personal, segregated restrooms—to which \nhe alone of all the 1,695 students in the building had a key—caused A.W. additional significant \nemotional distress.  In addition, neither of these single-occupancy restrooms was convenient to \nA.W.’s classes and would have required him to miss more class time than his peers if he used \nthose restrooms during class. \n62.  At the April 6 meeting, A.W. asked Valeri for KUSD’s rationale for prohibiting \nhis use of the boys’ restrooms. Valeri replied with a statement to the effect of, “Well, we’ve \nnever had a student who identifies as male but was born female.”  \n18 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 18 of 36   Document 1\n\n63.  A.W. replied by asserting that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex, \nwhich protects transgender students and requires schools to permit them to use restrooms \nconsistent with the student’s gender identity.  \n64.  Valeri denied that Title IX protects transgender students’ access to bathrooms \nconsistent with their gender identity.   \n65.  When A.W. asked Valeri to explain her understanding of Title IX, she refused to \ndo so, stating words to the effect of, “I don’t think I’m going to give you any reasons.” \n66.  In order to avoid disciplinary sanctions from Tremper administrators for using \nboys’ restrooms on the one hand, and the scrutiny and embarrassment that would result from \nusing individually assigned restroom facilities on the other, A.W. continued to avoid using \nschool restrooms as much as possible.  He has never used the designated locked single-user \nrestrooms, as doing so would call unwanted attention to himself by using a key to enter a \nrestroom to which no other student has access, and because of his desire not to spend \nunnecessary time out of class traveling to those inconveniently located restrooms. \n67.  As a result of the stress caused by school’s discriminatory actions, and his \nattempts to avoid using any restrooms at school, A.W.’s migraines and episodes of fainting and \ndizziness continued to worsen. His depression, anxiety, and dysphoria also deepened. He became \nseverely depressed and lethargic, and no longer wanted to get out of bed in the morning.  \n68.  Due to the serious consequences the school’s actions were having on A.W.’s \nphysical and psychological well-being, he considered withdrawing from Tremper and \ntransferring to an online school to finish high school.  He ultimately decided not to withdraw at \nthat time, due to his involvement in activities like the school orchestra that would not be \n19 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 19 of 36   Document 1\n\navailable if he were enrolled in an online school instead, and because changing schools would \nput him further behind in his classwork. \nSchool’s Refusal to Permit A.W. to Be Considered for Junior Prom King \n69.  Tremper High’s junior prom was scheduled for May 7, 2016.  In late March, the \nfaculty advisor for the junior prom, Lorena Danielson, submitted the names of candidates for the \nprom court to Aiello.  Candidates for prom king and queen are required to earn volunteer hours \nin order to participate and whoever earns the most hours is selected for prom court.  Based on his \ncommunity service hours, the junior prom advisor designated A.W. as a candidate for prom king \nand then met with Aiello to confirm the list.  \n70.  After meeting with the junior prom advisor, Aiello called M.W. in for a meeting \nwith him and Graf on or about March 22, 2016, during which he told her that A.W. could be on \nthe prom court, but could only be a candidate for prom queen, not prom king.  When A.W. \nlearned about this, he was devastated.  He was humiliated at the prospect of running for prom \nqueen, when all his classmates knew him to be a boy.  He felt deeply disrespected and angry that \nthe administrators failed to recognize how hurtful and unfair this additional form of \ndiscrimination was. \n71.  On April 4, 2016, A.W. and his friends presented a MoveOn.org petition to \nTremper administrators demanding that A.W. be allowed to run for prom king and to use the \nboys’ restrooms at school, which was signed by many members of the Tremper community and \nthousands of others around the country.  When administrators failed to respond, on April 5, \n2016, 70 students participated in a sit-in at Tremper’s main office to show their support for A.W.  \nThe students held signs expressing the view that transgender students should be treated equally, \n20 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 20 of 36   Document 1\n\nand supporting A.W.’s right to be allowed to run for prom king and to use the boys’ restrooms at \nschool. \n72.  Following the sit-in and media attention about KUSD’s treatment of A.W., in the \nApril 6, 2016 meeting referenced above, Aiello, Graf, and Valeri informed A.W. and M.W. that \nA.W. would be permitted to run for prom king. \n73.  Although A.W. was pleased to have the opportunity to run for prom king and \nheartened by the outpouring of support from his classmates, he continued to feel deeply \ndistressed as a result of the school administrators’ initial decision that he could only run for prom \nqueen and their continued pattern of refusing to recognize or respect his male gender identity. \nName and Gender in School Records \n74.  KUSD has not changed A.W.’s name on his official records and other documents, \nincluding classroom attendance rosters used by his teachers.  Although most of A.W.’s teachers \nrefer to him by his male name, substitute teachers have frequently referred to him by his birth \nname in front of his classmates because that is the name that appears on the attendance rosters.  \nIn response, and in order to avoid embarrassment or discomfort from his classmates, A.W. has \nbeen compelled to approach all of his teachers at the beginning of each term to advise them of \nhis preferred name and pronouns and request that they do not refer to him by his birth name.  He \nsimilarly must approach substitute teachers before class every time a teacher is absent.  Although \nsome teachers note his correct name on the class roster, others have not documented that name \non the roster, and occasionally substitute teachers still refer to him by his birth name in class.  \nBeing called a traditionally female name in front of all his classmates reveals that he is \ntransgender to all of his peers and makes A.W. feel embarrassed and distressed.  The practice has \n21 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 21 of 36   Document 1\n\nresulted in A.W. experiencing increased symptoms of Gender Dysphoria, including anxiety and \ndepression. \n75.  In the meetings with administrators on March 6 and March 22, M.W. requested \nthat the school change A.W.’s name and gender in its official records to avoid those problems.  \nIn both meetings, Graf told M.W. that in order to change A.W.’s name or gender in the school’s \nofficial records, the school would need to see legal or medical documentation.  The medical \ndocumentation A.W.’s pediatrician sent was deemed insufficient, although Graf and Aiello \nrefused to specify what the contents of acceptable documentation would be, despite repeated \nrequests for clarification.  They also failed to specify what type of “legal documentation” would \nbe necessary to update the school records. \n76.  Even if KUSD is unable to change A.W.’s name or gender in its official school \nrecords because A.W. has not yet obtained a legal name change, KUSD can and should take \nsteps to avoid intentional or inadvertent disclosure of A.W.’s birth name or sex assigned at birth \nto KUSD employees or students, including by modifying informal or public-facing documents, \nsuch as attendance rosters, to reflect A.W.’s male name and male gender.  \nOther Harassing and Stigmatizing Treatment Faced by A.W. at School \n77.  After news broke about the petition for A.W. to run for prom king and use boys’ \nrestrooms at school, some parents and other Kenosha residents began to speak out in opposition \nto A.W.’s right to use boys’ restrooms.  On May 10, 2016, shortly after the junior prom, at a \nmeeting of the Board, several community members spoke in opposition to allowing transgender \nstudents to use restrooms in accordance with their gender identity.  One parent told the Board \nthat he was opposed to permitting transgender students to use gender-appropriate restrooms \n22 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 22 of 36   Document 1\n\nbecause such a policy would permit sexual predators to enter women’s restrooms and put his \ndaughters at risk. \n78.  That person’s wife, who volunteers as a pianist with the school orchestra, has \ncreated and maintains a public Facebook group called “KUSD Parents for Privacy,” which \ncontains numerous posts critical of transgender students’ rights.  Several posts on that page have \nmentioned A.W. and his mother by name, accompanied by their photographs.  One post, on May \n14, 2016, linked to an article about A.W., contains a photograph of him and his mother, and \ndescribes him as a “pawn.”  \n79.  At an orchestra rehearsal at the school on May 11, 2016, the day following the \nBoard meeting at which her husband spoke, this woman approached A.W., put her hands on his \nshoulders, and said words to the effect of, “A----, honey, this isn’t about you, this is bigger than \nyou.  I’m praying for you.”  A.W. was extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed, and did not \nrespond.  M.W. and A.W. later brought this incident to Aiello’s attention.  Aiello requested that \nBreitenbach-Cooper, the orchestra teacher, call the volunteer to advise her not to talk to students \nlike that, but took no further action.  Nothing changed as a result.  She is still a regular volunteer \nwith the school orchestra and has continued to attend every rehearsal.  Her constant presence \nsubstantially diminishes A.W.’s enjoyment of an extracurricular activity that has formed an \nimportant part of his educational experience at Tremper. \nGreen Wristbands to Mark Transgender Students \n80.  In May 2016, A.W.’s guidance counselor, Tronvig, showed M.W. a bright green \nwristband that the school intended to use to mark students who are transgender.   \n81.  Branding transgender students in this way would single them out for additional \nscrutiny, stigma, and potentially harassment or violence, and violate their privacy by revealing \ntheir transgender status to others.   \n23 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 23 of 36   Document 1\n\n82.  Upon learning about the school’s proposed green wristband practice, A.W. felt \nsickened and afraid.  He was aware of the prevalence of violent attacks against transgender \npeople nationwide, and grew very afraid that the school would attempt to force him to wear the \nwristband on penalty of discipline.  If he did wear the wristband, he knew that other students \nwould likely ask him repeatedly why he was wearing it, and he would have to explain over and \nover that he is transgender.  He expected that some students would stare, and others would \noutright ridicule him.  He felt like his safety would be even more threatened if he had to wear \nthis visible badge of his transgender status. \n83.  To Plaintiff’s knowledge, the green wristband practice adopted at the end of the \nschool year is still in place, such that guidance counselors will be expected to provide these \nwristbands to transgender students in the upcoming school year. \nOvernight Accommodations at Summer Orchestra Camp \n84.  A.W. participated in a five-day, school-sponsored summer orchestra camp from \nJune 12-16, 2016.  The camp was held on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, \nand students stayed in dormitories on campus.  The dorms used for the camp were suites with \ntwo to four bedrooms and a common living room, kitchenette, and two single-occupancy \nrestrooms.  Each suite had either four separate, single-occupancy bedrooms, or two double-\noccupancy rooms.  During the evenings, school chaperones placed tape across each of the \nbedroom doorways to prevent students from leaving the bedrooms at night.  The suites were \nshared by students of the same sex. \n85.  In advance of the camp, the school allowed students to sign up for dorm rooms \nwith their friends.  A.W. had signed up to stay in a boys’ suite with one of his best friends, a \nmale student. \n24 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 24 of 36   Document 1\n\n86.  Breitenbach-Cooper, the orchestra teacher, told Aiello about A.W.’s request to \nstay in the same suite as his friend and other male students.  Aiello replied that A.W. could not \ndo so because, under Tremper’s policy, he could not stay with other boys.  Aiello told \nBreitenbach-Cooper that A.W. would have to stay in a suite with girls or alone in a suite, \nsegregated from all of his peers. \n87.  In order to participate in the orchestra camp, A.W. reluctantly agreed to stay in \ndouble-bedroom suite all alone, with no other students sharing the suite.  He rejected the \n“option” to stay in a suite with girls because he is a boy and he felt uncomfortable staying with \ngirls.   \n88.  This arrangement excluded A.W. from socializing with other students during the \nentire five-day camp.  Students were prohibited from entering other suites, and could only \nsocialize within their own suite or in common areas of the building.  Since almost all the other \nstudents remained in their suites to socialize in the evenings, A.W. stayed in his room alone each \nevening while the other students enjoyed time to socialize with their friends.  He felt lonely and \ndepressed, and disappointed that he was not able to have the same good memories of his final \nyear at camp as all the other students.  \n89.  The school’s decision to segregate A.W. from the other boys also left him feeling \nhurt and embarrassed.  He understood the school’s decision to be based on a perception that he \nmight engage in sexual activity with another boy, and he felt degraded and humiliated by the \nidea that administrators were thinking about him in those terms.  \nDistrict’s Failure to Change its Discriminatory Policies after Notice of Legal Obligations \n90.  A.W. and M.W. have repeatedly advised KUSD officials that their actions violate \nA.W.’s right to attend school free from sex discrimination, as required by Title IX and the Equal \n25 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 25 of 36   Document 1\n\nProtection Clause.  Despite being put on notice of the violations of A.W.’s statutory and \nconstitutional rights, KUSD has refused to change its policies to date. \n91.  On April 19, 2016, through his attorneys, A.W. sent a letter to Superintendent \nSavaglio-Jarvis demanding that KUSD permit him to use boys’ restrooms at school. \n92.  By letter of April 26, 2016, KUSD’s attorneys responded, acknowledging their \nawareness of U.S. Department of Education guidance documents interpreting Title IX to protect \nstudents from discrimination based on their gender identity—as well as the Fourth Circuit’s \nApril 19, 2016 opinion in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, a Title IX case brought by a \ntransgender high school student who was denied access to boys’ restrooms at school, in which \nthat appeals court deferred to the Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX and held \nthat the plaintiff student was entitled to restroom access consistent with his gender identity.  The \nletter nevertheless maintained that KUSD is not bound by these authorities and would not change \nits position on A.W.’s restroom use. \n93.  On May 12, 2016, A.W. filed an administrative complaint with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), alleging that KUSD’s actions \nviolated A.W.’s rights under Title IX.  Shortly before filing this lawsuit, Plaintiff’s attorneys \ncontacted OCR and requested to withdraw that complaint, without prejudice. \n94.  On May 13, 2016, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of \nJustice issued a joint guidance letter to all public schools, colleges, and universities in the \ncountry receiving Federal financial assistance, reiterating the federal government’s previously \nstated position that, pursuant to Title IX, all public schools are obligated to treat transgender \nstudents consistent with their gender identities in all respects, including regarding name and \npronoun usage, restroom access, and overnight accommodations. \n26 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 26 of 36   Document 1\n\n95.  Following the issuance of the federal guidance on May 13, 2016, KUSD officials \npublicly acknowledged the guidance but stated that they did not believe they were required to \ncomply with it.  KUSD issued a statement declaring, “[t]he Department of Education’s . . . letter \nis not law; it is the Department’s interpretation of the law,” suggesting that it would not change \nits policy absent a court order. \n96.  To date, the Board has not articulated or adopted any formal policy regarding \ntransgender students in KUSD’s schools. \n97.  Based on the statements and actions of KUSD officials, A.W. feels deep anxiety \nand dread about experiencing continued discrimination during his senior year and the effect that \nit will have on him during the college application process. \nINJURY TO PLAINTIFF \n98.  Through their actions described above, Defendants have injured and are \ncontinuing to injure Plaintiff. \n99.  Defendants have denied A.W. full and equal access to KUSD’s education \nprograms and activities by denying him the full and equal access to student restrooms and \novernight accommodations during school-sponsored trips offered to other male students.     \n100.  A.W. has experienced and continues to experience the harmful effects of being \nsegregated from, and treated differently than, his male classmates at school and during school-\nsponsored events, including lowered self-esteem, embarrassment, social isolation, and stigma, as \nwell as heightened symptoms of Gender Dysphoria, including depression and anxiety. \n101.  When school administrators and staff intentionally used his birth name or female \npronouns (or allowed others to do so), instructed him not to use the boys’ restrooms, instructed \nsecurity personnel to surveil his movements, and otherwise undermined his male identity and \n27 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 27 of 36   Document 1\n\nsingled him out as different from all other boys, he has felt deeply hurt, disrespected, and \nhumiliated.   \n102.  Defendants’ discriminatory actions, and the efforts A.W. has made to comply \nwith the directive not to use the boys’ restroom—limiting food and drink while at school—have \nled to a host of physical symptoms, including dehydration, dizziness, fainting, and migraines.  \nAll of those symptoms virtually disappeared once A.W. returned home from the orchestra camp \nand summer break began, and A.W. was no longer facing daily scrutiny and anxiety and could \neat and drink at a healthy level. \n103.  As a direct and continuing result of Defendants’ discriminatory actions, A.W. has \nsuffered increased and continuing emotional distress over the last six months.  He has \nexperienced escalating symptoms of depression and anxiety, and his self-esteem has suffered, as \na result of the discrimination he has experienced at school.  Although he cried very little in the \npast, he frequently cries and fights back tears.   \n104.  As a result of the depression and anxiety Defendants’ actions caused, A.W. has \nalso had difficulty eating and sleeping properly, and difficulty concentrating in classes and on his \nhomework.  \n105.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, and the feelings of fear and scrutiny he has \ngrown used to, A.W. now feels unsafe being outside of the house, afraid that he will be targeted \nfor an assault by someone who knows he is transgender.  He will typically only go out in groups \nof friends, and tries to avoid ever going out with only one other friend or alone. \n106.  A.W. has also missed significant class time due to being compelled by KUSD \nofficials to participate in repeated, lengthy meetings during class time to discuss his use of \n28 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 28 of 36   Document 1\n\nrestrooms, his name and gender in school records, and the school’s determination that he would \nbe prohibited from running for prom king. \n107.  All of the above discriminatory treatment has undermined the efficacy of the \nsocial transition component of his gender transition and heightened his symptoms of Gender \nDysphoria.  \n108.  If Defendants refuse to grant A.W. access to boys’ restrooms by the time his \nsenior year begins on September 1, 2016, he will likely experience the same social stigma, \nemotional distress, academic harm, and detrimental impediments to his gender transition \nresulting from Defendants’ conduct that he experienced during his junior year. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \nViolation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \n109.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 107 as fully set forth herein. \n110.  Under Title IX and its implementing regulations, “[n]o person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); see also 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (Department of Education Title IX \nregulations); 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31 (Department of Agriculture Title IX regulations); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 86.31 (Department of Health and Human Services Title IX regulations).  Title IX’s \nprohibitions on sex discrimination extend to “any academic, extracurricular, research, \noccupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient” of federal \nfunding.  34 C.F.R. § 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n29 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 29 of 36   Document 1\n\n111.  Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” encompasses \ndiscrimination based on an individual’s gender identity, transgender status, and gender \nexpression, including nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes. \n112.  Conduct specifically prohibited under Title IX includes, inter alia, treating one \nperson differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or \ncondition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service; providing different aid, benefits, or \nservices in a different manner; denying any person any such aid, benefit, or service; or otherwise \nsubjecting any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment.  34 \nC.F.R. § 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n113.  As a Federal funding recipient, Defendant Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 \nBoard of Education, including the academic, extracurricular, and other educational opportunities \nprovided by the Kenosha Unified School District and Tremper High School, is subject to Title \nIX’s prohibitions on sex- and gender-based discrimination against any student. \n114.  As set forth in paragraphs 28 to 98 above, Defendants, by adopting and enforcing \na policy or practice of prohibiting Plaintiff, a transgender boy, from accessing male-designated \nrestrooms at school, and requiring that he use female-designated restrooms or single-occupancy \nrestrooms, have discriminated and continue to discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of \nKUSD’s education program and activities by treating him differently from other male students \nbased on his gender identity, the fact that he is transgender, and his nonconformity to male \nstereotypes, and thereby denying him the full and equal participation in, benefits of, and right to \nbe free from discrimination in the educational opportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High \nSchool, on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX. \n30 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 30 of 36   Document 1\n\n115.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, from staying in male-designated overnight accommodations on \nschool-sponsored trips, and requiring him to stay in female-designated overnight \naccommodations or segregated accommodations on those trips, has discriminated and continues \nto discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of KUSD’s education program and activities by \ntreating him differently from other male students based on his gender identity, the fact that he is \ntransgender, and his nonconformity to male stereotypes, and thereby denying him the full and \nequal participation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the educational \nopportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High School, on the basis of sex, in violation of \nTitle IX. \n116.  Defendants have further violated Title IX by failing to recognize fully and respect \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, as a male student, including through administrators’ repeated and \nintentional use of Plaintiff’s traditionally female birth name and female pronouns to address him \nand refer to him to others; the failure to take necessary and appropriate action to update or \nmodify A.W.’s official and/or informal student records, including classroom attendance rosters, \nto prevent teachers, substitute teachers, and other school staff from referring to him by his female \nbirth name and female pronouns in the presence of other students; Tremper administrators’ initial \nrefusal to permit A.W. to run for junior prom king and directive that he run for prom queen \ninstead, withdrawn only after a student protest and media attention; and Tremper administrators’ \ninstruction to school guidance counselors to provide green wristbands to transgender students.  \nThrough these actions, individually and collectively, Defendants have and continue to exclude \nPlaintiff from participation in, deny him the benefits of, and subject him to discrimination in \nKUSD’s education programs and activities, on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX. \n31 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 31 of 36   Document 1\n\n117.  Defendants, through instructing Tremper staff to report the restroom use of any \nstudent who “appears” to be using the “wrong” restroom, operates an unlawful policy or practice \nof profiling Plaintiff and other students who are transgender and/or do not conform to sex- or \ngender-based stereotypes, and thereby deprive Plaintiff and similarly situated students of their \nrights under Title IX to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of \ngender identity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, in \nfurther violation of Title IX. \n118.  Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, injured by Defendants’ discriminatory \nconduct and has suffered damages as a result. \nSecond Cause of Action \nViolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Based on \nDeprivation of Plaintiff’s Rights under the  \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n119.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporate the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 107 as fully set forth herein. \n120.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, discrimination based on sex, including gender, gender identity, transgender \nstatus, and nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, as well as discrimination based on \ntransgender status alone, is presumptively unconstitutional and is therefore subject to heightened \nscrutiny. \n121.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, from accessing male-designated restrooms at school, and requiring \nthat he use female-designated restrooms or single-occupancy restrooms, have discriminated and \ncontinue to discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of KUSD’s education program and \nactivities by treating him differently from other male students based on his gender identity, the \n32 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 32 of 36   Document 1\n\nfact that he is transgender, and his nonconformity to male stereotypes, thereby denying him the \nfull and equal participation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the \neducational opportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High School, on the basis of sex and \ntransgender status, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n122.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, from staying in male-designated overnight accommodations on \nschool-sponsored trips, and requiring him to stay in female-designated overnight \naccommodations or segregated accommodations on those trips, has discriminated and continues \nto discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of KUSD’s education program and activities by \ntreating him differently from other male students based on his gender identity, the fact that he is \ntransgender, and his nonconformity to male stereotypes, thereby denying him the full and equal \nparticipation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the educational \nopportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High School, on the basis of sex and transgender \nstatus, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n123.  Defendants have further violated Plaintiff’s rights under the Equal Protection \nClause by failing to recognize fully and respect Plaintiff, a transgender boy, as a male student, \nincluding through administrators’ repeated and intentional use of Plaintiff’s traditionally female \nbirth name and female pronouns to address him and refer to him to others; the failure to take \nnecessary and appropriate action to update or modify A.W.’s official and/or informal student \nrecords, including classroom attendance rosters, to prevent teachers, substitute teachers, and \nother school staff from referring to him by his female birth name and female pronouns in the \npresence of other students; Tremper administrators’ initial refusal to permit A.W. to run for \njunior prom king and directive that he run for prom queen instead, withdrawn only after a student \n33 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 33 of 36   Document 1\n\nprotest and media attention; and Tremper administrators’ instruction to school guidance \ncounselors to provide green wristbands to any student who identified himself or herself as \ntransgender.  Through these actions, individually and collectively, Defendants have and continue \nto exclude Plaintiff from participation in, deny him the benefits of, and subject him to \ndiscrimination in KUSD’s education programs and activities, on the basis of sex and transgender \nstatus, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n124.  Defendants, through instructing Tremper staff to report the restroom use of any \nstudent who “appears” to be using the “wrong” restroom, operates an unlawful policy or practice \nof profiling Plaintiff and other students who are transgender and/or do not conform to sex- or \ngender-based stereotypes, and thereby deprive Plaintiff and similarly situated students of their \nrights to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of gender \nidentity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, in further \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n125.  Defendants’ discrimination against A.W. is not substantially related to any \nimportant governmental interest, nor is it rationally related to any legitimate governmental \ninterest. \n126.  Defendants are liable for their violation of A.W.’s Fourteenth Amendment rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n127.  Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, injured by Defendants’ conduct and has \nsuffered damages as a result. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff A.W., by and through his mother and next friend, M.W., \nrequests that this Court: \n34 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 34 of 36   Document 1\n\n(a)  enter a declaratory judgment that the actions of Defendants complained of herein \nare in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. and \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n(b)  issue preliminary and permanent injunctions (i) directing Defendants to provide \nPlaintiff access to male-designated restrooms at school, and otherwise to treat him as a boy in all \nrespects for the remainder of his time as a student in Defendants’ schools or until resolution of \nthis lawsuit, whichever is later; (ii) restraining Defendants, their agents, employees, \nrepresentatives, and successors, and any other person acting directly or indirectly with them, \nfrom adopting, implementing, or enforcing any policy or practice at the school or District level \nthat treats transgender students differently from their similarly situated peers (i.e., treating \ntransgender boys differently from other boys and transgender girls differently from other girls); \n(iii) directing Defendants to clarify that KUSD and Tremper’s existing policies prohibiting \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex apply to discrimination based on gender identity, transgender \nstatus, and nonconformity to sex- and gender-based stereotypes; (iv) ordering Defendants to \nprovide training to all district-level and school-based administrators in the Kenosha Unified \nSchool District on their obligations under Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause regarding the \nnondiscriminatory treatment of transgender and gender nonconforming students; and (v) \nensuring that all district-level and school-based administrators responsible for enforcing Title IX, \nincluding Defendants’ designated Title IX coordinator(s), are aware of the correct and proper \napplication of Title IX to transgender and gender nonconforming students; \n(c)  order all compensatory relief necessary to cure the adverse educational effects of \nDefendants’ discriminatory actions on Plaintiff’s education; \n35 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943   Filed 07/19/16   Page 35 of 36   Document 1\n\n(d)  award compensatory damages in an amount that would fully compensate Plaintiff \nfor the emotional distress and other damages that have been caused by Defendants’ conduct \nalleged herein; \n(e)  award Plaintiff his reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988; and \n(f)  order such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable. \n \nDated: July 19, 2016 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s Joseph J.

Action No. 2:16-cv-00943 \n   \n  v.  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \nKENOSHA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT \nNO. 1 BOARD OF EDUCATION and SUE \nSAVAGLIO-JARVIS, in her official capacity \nas Superintendent of the Kenosha Unified \nSchool District No. 1,  \n \n      Defendants. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiff Ashton (“Ash”) Whitaker, a 16-year-old boy, is a rising senior at George \nNelson Tremper High School (“Tremper”) in the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 \n(“KUSD”) in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Ash is a boy.  He is also transgender.  Ash was assumed to \nbe a girl when he was born, and was designated “female” on his birth certificate, but has a male \ngender identity and lives as a boy in all aspects of his life.  Ash’s family, classmates, medical \nproviders, and others recognize Ash as a boy, respect his male gender identity, and support his \nright to live and be treated consistent with that gender identity. \n2.  Defendants Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education (the \n“Board”), Superintendent Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, and their agents, employees, and representatives, \nhave repeatedly refused to recognize or respect Ash’s gender identity and have taken a series of \ndiscriminatory and highly stigmatizing actions against him based on his sex, gender identity, and \ntransgender status.  The actions, as described more fully herein, have included (a) denying him \n1 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 1 of 36   Document 12\n\naccess to boys’ restrooms at school and requiring him to use girls’ restrooms or a single-\noccupancy restroom; (b) directing school staff to monitor his restroom usage and to report to \nadministrators if he was observed using a boys’ restroom; (c) intentionally and repeatedly using \nhis birth name and female pronouns, and failing to appropriately inform substitute teachers and \nother staff members of his preferred name and pronouns, resulting in those staff referring to him \nby his birth name or with female pronouns in front of other students; (d) instructing guidance \ncounselors to issue bright green wristbands to Ash and any other transgender students at the \nschool, to more easily monitor and enforce these students’ restroom usage; (e) requiring him to \nroom with girls on an orchestra trip to Europe and requiring, as a condition of his ability to \nparticipate in a recent overnight school-sponsored orchestra camp held on a college campus, that \nhe stay either in a multi-room suite with girls, or alone in a multi-room suite with no other \nstudents, while all other boys shared multi-room suites with other boys; and (f) initially denying \nhim the ability to run for junior prom king, despite being nominated for that recognition based on \nhis active involvement in community service, instructing him that he could only run for prom \nqueen, and only relenting and allowing him to run for prom king after a protest by many of those \nsame classmates. \n3.  Through these actions, Defendants have discriminated against Ash on the basis of \nsex, including on the basis of his gender identity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex-\nbased stereotypes, in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681, et seq., and on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Defendants’ actions \nhave denied Ash full and equal access to KUSD’s education program and activities on the basis \nof his sex. \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 2 of 36   Document 12\n\n4.  Plaintiff, through his mother and next friend, Melissa Whitaker, brings this action \nagainst Defendants based on these unlawful and discriminatory actions. \n5.  Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive \nrelief, and damages resulting from Defendants’ discriminatory actions.   \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff Ash Whitaker is a 16-year-old boy.  He was born in 1999.  He resides in \nKenosha, Wisconsin and is a student at Tremper High School, a public high school in the \nKenosha Unified School District No. 1.  He will begin his senior year at Tremper on September \n1, 2016. \n7.  Melissa Whitaker is Ash’s mother and brings this action as his next friend.  Ms. \nWhitaker resides in Kenosha, Wisconsin and is employed by the Kenosha Unified School \nDistrict No. 1 as a high school teacher at Tremper. \n8.  Defendant Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education is a seven-\nmember elected body responsible for governing the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1, a \npublic school district serving over 22,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade who reside \nin the City of Kenosha, Village of Pleasant Prairie, and Town and Village of Somers.  The Board \nderives its authority to govern KUSD directly from the Wisconsin Constitution and state statutes.  \nThe school district is a recipient of federal funds from the U.S. Department of Education, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and, as \nsuch, is subject to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex \ndiscrimination against any person in any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.  The Board designates responsibility for the administration of KUSD to its \nSuperintendent of Schools, currently Dr. Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, who oversees a number of district-\n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 3 of 36   Document 12\n\nlevel administrators.  KUSD operates 42 schools, including six high schools.  One of the high \nschools is Tremper, a 1,695-student public high school located in Kenosha, serving students in \ngrades 9 through 12.  Tremper’s administration includes a principal and three assistant \nprincipals.  The Board is vicariously liable for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, and \nrepresentatives, including those of the other Defendant Savaglio-Jarvis and other Tremper \nadministrators, staff, and volunteers. \n9.  Defendant Sue Savaglio-Jarvis is the Superintendent of the Kenosha Unified \nSchool District and is sued in her official capacity.  At all times relevant to the events described \nherein, Savaglio-Jarvis acted within the scope of her employment as an employee, agent, and \nrepresentative of the Board.  In such capacity, she carried out the discriminatory practices \ndescribed herein (a) at the direction of, and with the consent, encouragement, knowledge, and \nratification of the Board; (b) under the Board’s authority, control, and supervision; and (c) with \nthe actual or apparent authority of the Board. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3), and is authorized to order declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n11.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Wisconsin under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nbecause the claims arose in the District, the parties reside in the District, and all of the events \ngiving rise to this action occurred in the District. \nFACTS \nGender Identity and Gender Dysphoria \n12.  Sex is a characteristic that is made up of multiple factors, including hormones, \nexternal physical features, internal reproductive organs, chromosomes, and gender identity.  \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 4 of 36   Document 12\n\n13.  Gender identity—a person’s deeply felt understanding of their own gender—is the \ndetermining factor of a person’s sex.  Gender identity is often established as early as two or three \nyears of age, though a person’s recognition of their gender identity can emerge at any time.  \nThere is a medical consensus that efforts to change a person’s gender identity are ineffective, \nunethical, and harmful.  A person’s gender identity may be different from or the same as the \nperson’s sex assigned at birth. \n14.  The phrase “sex assigned at birth” refers to the sex designation recorded on an \ninfant’s birth certificate.  For most people, gender identity aligns with the person’s sex assigned \nat birth, a determination generally based solely on the appearance of a baby’s external genitalia \nat birth.  For transgender people, however, the gender they were assumed to be at birth does not \nalign with their gender identity.  For example, a transgender boy is a person who was assumed to \nbe female at birth but is in fact a boy.  A transgender girl is a person who was assumed to be a \nboy at birth but is in fact a girl. \n15.  Gender Dysphoria is a condition recognized by the American Psychiatric \nAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (“DSM-5”).  It \nrefers to clinically significant distress that can result when a person’s gender identity differs from \nthe person’s assumed gender at birth.  If left untreated, Gender Dysphoria may result in profound \npsychological distress, anxiety, depression, and even self-harm or suicidal ideation.   \n16.  Treatment for Gender Dysphoria is usually pursuant to the Standards of Care for \nthe Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (“Standards of \nCare”), published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”) \nsince 1980.  WPATH is an international, multidisciplinary, professional association of medical \nproviders, mental health providers, researchers, and others, with a mission of promoting \n5 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 5 of 36   Document 12\n\nevidence-based care and research for transgender health, including the treatment of Gender \nDysphoria.  WPATH published the seventh and most recent edition of the Standards of Care in \n2011. \n17.  Consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care, treatment for Gender Dysphoria \nconsists of the person “transitioning” to living and being accepted by others as the sex \ncorresponding to the person’s gender identity.  A key stage in that process is a “social transition,” \nin which the individual lives in accordance with his gender identity in all aspects of life.  A \nsocial transition, though specific to each person, typically includes adopting a new first name, \nusing and asking others to use pronouns reflecting the individual’s true gender, wearing clothing \ntypically associated with that gender, and using sex-specific facilities corresponding to that \ngender.  Failing to recognize or respect a transgender person’s gender is contrary to established \nmedical protocols and can exacerbate an individual’s symptoms of Gender Dysphoria.  \n18.  Medical treatments, such as hormone therapy or surgical procedures, may also be \nundertaken to facilitate transition and alleviate dysphoria, typically after an individual’s social \ntransition.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care, living full-time in accordance with one’s \ngender identity in all aspects of life for at least one year is a prerequisite for any medical \ninterventions.  Medical treatments are not necessary or appropriate in all cases.  \n19.  A social transition requires that a transgender boy be recognized as a boy and \ntreated the same as all other boys by parents, teachers, classmates, and others in the community.  \nThis includes being referred to exclusively with the student’s new name and male pronouns, \nbeing permitted to use boys’ restrooms and overnight accommodations on the same footing as \nother male students, and having the right to keep information about the student’s transgender \nstatus private.  Singling out a transgender student and treating him differently than other boys \n6 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 6 of 36   Document 12\n\ncommunicates the stigmatizing message to that student and the entire school community that he \nshould not be recognized or treated as a boy, simply because he is transgender.  This undermines \nthe social transition and exposes the student to the risk of renewed and heightened symptoms of \nGender Dysphoria such as anxiety and depression.  It also frequently leads transgender students \nto avoid using school restrooms altogether, often resulting in adverse physical health \nconsequences such as urinary tract infections, kidney infections, and dehydration, and other \nconsequences such as stress and difficulty focusing on classwork. \nPlaintiff’s Background \n20.  Ash has been a student in KUSD’s schools since kindergarten.  On September 1, \n2016, he will begin his senior year at Tremper High.  Ash is an excellent student: he has a high \ngrade point average and is currently ranked in the top five percent of his class of over 400 \nstudents.  All of his academic classes in his junior year were either Advanced Placement or \nHonors level classes.  He is also very involved in many school activities, including the school’s \nGolden Strings orchestra, theater, tennis team, National Honor Society, and Astronomical \nSociety.  After graduation, he hopes to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison and study \nbiomedical engineering.  Ash also works part-time as an accounting assistant in a medical office. \n21.  Ash is a boy. He is also transgender.  He was designated “female” on his birth \ncertificate and lived as a girl until middle school, when he recognized that he is, in fact, a boy, \nand he began to experience profound discomfort with being assumed to be a girl by others. \n22.  At the end of eighth grade, in the spring of 2013, Ash told his parents that he is \ntransgender and a boy.  Shortly thereafter, he told his older brothers.   \n23.  During the 2013-2014 school year, Ash’s freshman year of high school at \nTremper, Ash began confiding to a few close friends that he is a boy.  He slowly began \n7 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 7 of 36   Document 12\n\ntransitioning more publicly to live in accordance with his male identity: he cut his hair short, \nbegan wearing more traditionally masculine clothing, and began to go by a typically masculine \nname and masculine pronouns.   \n24.  At the beginning of his sophomore year, in the fall of 2014, Ash told all of his \nteachers and peers that he is a boy, requesting that he be referred to using male pronouns and his \nnew name.  On Christmas, 2014, Ash told his extended family, including grandparents, aunts, \nuncles, and cousins, that he is a boy.     \n25.  Ash has undertaken his gender transition under the guidance and care of therapists \nand medical doctors.  He was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria by his pediatrician.  Around the \ntime of his public transition, Ash began seeing a gender specialist therapist to support him in his \ntransition.  He is currently under the care of clinical psychologist, who is also a gender specialist.  \nIn April 2016, he began consulting with an endocrinologist at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin \nto discuss hormonal therapy.  Ash began receiving testosterone treatment under the care of an \nendocrinologist in July 2016.  \n26.  Since Ash’s transition at school, he has been widely known and accepted as a boy \nby the school community.  At a Golden Strings orchestra performance at a hotel on January 17, \n2015, Ash wore a tuxedo, just like all the other boys, with the support of his orchestra teacher, \nHelen Breitenbach-Cooper.  Students and teachers who did not know Ash prior to his transition \ndid not and would not have recognized him as different from any other boy until the \ndiscriminatory events described in this complaint took place.  \nKUSD’s Refusal to Permit Plaintiff Access to Restrooms Consistent with His Gender Identity \n27.  In the spring of 2015, during Ash’s sophomore year, Ash and his mother had \nseveral meetings with Ash’s guidance counselor, Debra Tronvig, during which they requested \n8 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 8 of 36   Document 12\n\nthat Ash be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms at school.  The counselor spoke to the school’s \nprincipal, Richard Aiello, and one of its assistant principals, Brian Geiger, and she advocated that \nAsh be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms.  However, at a meeting in March 2015, she reported \nback to Ash and his mother that the school administrators had decided that Ash would only be \npermitted to use the girls’ restrooms or the single-user, gender-neutral restroom in the school \noffice.  Tronvig and the school administrators did not suggest or indicate any circumstance under \nwhich Ash might be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms in the future.   \n28.  After that meeting, Ash felt overwhelmed, helpless, hopeless, and alone.  Both of \nthe restroom options offered by Defendants were discriminatory, burdensome, or unworkable.  \nAsh was deeply distressed by the prospect of using the girls’ restrooms, as it would hinder and be \nat odds with his public social transition at school, undermine his male identity, and convey to \nothers that he should be viewed and treated as a girl.  He was also deeply distressed by the \nprospect of using the office restroom, which is located in the rear of the office, behind the office \nsecretaries’ work stations—far out of the way from most of his classes—and is only used by \noffice staff and visitors.  It is Ash’s understanding that no other students are allowed to use the \noffice restroom.  Ash feared the questions he would face from students and staff about why he \nwas using that particular restroom; the inconvenience of traveling long distances from (and \nmissing time in) his classes to use that restroom; and the fact that he would be segregated from \nhis classmates and further stigmatized for being “different.”   \n29.  At the same time, Ash was fearful of the potential disciplinary consequences if he \nfailed to comply with the administrators’ directives not to use the boys’ restroom.  He worried \nthat such a disciplinary record could potentially interfere with his ability to get into college, as he \nhad no prior record of discipline.  As a result of that fear and anxiety, seeing no plausible \n9 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 9 of 36   Document 12\n\noptions, Ash largely avoided using any restrooms at school for the rest of that school year, and, \nwhen absolutely necessary, he only used a single-user girls’ restroom near his theater classroom.  \n30.  In order to avoid using restrooms at school, Ash severely restricted his liquid \nintake.  This was particularly dangerous because Ash suffers from vasovagal syncope, a medical \ncondition that results in fainting upon certain physical or emotional triggers.  The triggers cause a \nperson’s heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly, reducing blood flow to the brain and \nresulting in a loss of consciousness.  Because dehydration and stress trigger his fainting episodes, \nAsh’s primary care doctor requires him to drink 6-7 bottles of water and a bottle of Gatorade \ndaily. \n31.  In addition to vasovagal syncope, Ash also suffers from migraines triggered by \nstress.  During his sophomore year, while avoiding using restrooms, Ash experienced greatly \nheightened symptoms of both vasovagal syncope and stress-related migraines.  He also \nexperienced increased symptoms associated with Gender Dysphoria, including depression, \nanxiety, and suicidal thoughts.   \n32.  Ash also worried that the emotional and physical toll caused by the school’s \ntreatment of him would lead to medical or psychological harm that would delay or make it \nunsafe for him to begin hormone treatment as part of his transition.  This anxiety further \nincreased his symptoms of Gender Dysphoria. \n33.  In July 2015, Ash took a trip to Europe with his school orchestra group, Golden \nStrings.  In response to Ash’s request to room with other boys, his orchestra teacher, \nBreitenbach-Cooper, checked with school administrators and then informed him that he would \nnot be permitted to do so.  Ash felt hurt and embarrassed when he learned of the school’s \ndecision.  Once again, he understood the school’s decision to be based on a perception that he is \n10 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 10 of 36   Document 12\n\nnot really a boy, and he felt degraded and humiliated by the administrators’ continued failure to \nrecognize and respect his gender identity. \n34.  As a result of the school’s decision, Ash was forced to share a room with a girl.  \nDuring the trip, the students were frequently grouped by gender while traveling between \ndestinations, and Ash was consistently grouped with girls.   \n35.  In July 2015, while on the trip to Europe, feeling less scrutinized, Ash began to \nuse male-designated bathrooms.  During that trip, Ash saw a news story about a lawsuit against \nthe Gloucester County School District in Virginia by another transgender student who was \ndenied access to boys’ restrooms at his high school.  That story reported that the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice had concluded that transgender students have the right to use restrooms in \naccordance with their gender identity under Title IX and had filed a brief in the Virginia case, \nG.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, asserting that the school district’s policy violated \ntransgender students’ rights under Title IX.  Ash was elated to learn that he did, in fact, have the \nlegally protected right to use the restroom consistent with his gender.  For the rest of the trip, Ash \nexclusively used male-designated bathrooms, and he continued to do so upon returning to the \nUnited States.   \n36.  When he returned to school for his junior year, in September 2015, Ash continued \nexclusively using boys’ restrooms, including at Tremper.  He did so for the first seven months of \nthe school year without any incident.  No other students ever made an issue of Ash using the \nboys’ bathroom.  Ash did not discuss this decision with administrators or teachers, because he \nunderstood it to be his legal right. \n37.  In late February 2016, after observing Ash using a boys’ bathroom, a Tremper \nteacher advised two assistant principals, Geiger and Wendy LaLonde, of that fact.  Geiger then \n11 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 11 of 36   Document 12\n\ninformed the other administrators of Ash’s restroom use and asked them what the school’s policy \nwas.   \n38.  Aiello, LaLonde, Geiger, and the third assistant principal, Holly Graf, agreed that, \nalthough neither KUSD nor Tremper had any existing written policy on students’ restroom \nusage, the school’s policy should be that transgender students, including Ash, would not be \npermitted to use school restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.  Consistent with the \nschool’s previous decision in spring 2015, they decided that Ash would not be permitted to use \nthe boys’ restroom and, instead, would only be permitted to use the girls’ restrooms or the single-\nuser restroom in the school office. \n39.  Following that decision, Graf emailed Ash’s guidance counselor, Tronvig, and \nrequested that Tronvig relay the school’s restroom policy to Ash and his mother.  Tronvig \nresponded by email that she did not know what that policy was.  Graf and Tronvig then met in \nperson and Graf explained to Tronvig that Ash would not be permitted to use the boys’ \nrestrooms.  \n40.  In late February 2016, Tronvig called Ms. Whitaker to inform her of the \nadministration’s decision that Ash would only be permitted to use the girls’ restrooms or the \nsingle-user restroom in the school’s main office.   \n41.  When Ash learned about the school’s decision, in early March 2016, he was \ndistressed.  He felt humiliated and deeply uncomfortable by the idea of using a girls’ restroom, \neven more so than the previous year—because he is not a girl, he had not used female-designated \nrestrooms at school or elsewhere for a long time, and because using the girls’ restrooms as a boy \nrisked subjecting him to ridicule, scrutiny, stigma, and harassment by other students and school \nstaff.  For the reasons alleged above, he also felt deeply uncomfortable with using the single-user \n12 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 12 of 36   Document 12\n\nmain office restroom.  He believed that either alternative would imply his status as a transgender \nboy required him to be segregated from other students, despite the fact that he had used the boys’ \nrestrooms regularly and otherwise been treated as a boy by nearly everyone in the school \ncommunity for many months.   \n42.  Ash was also afraid of what disciplinary consequences he might face if he failed \nto comply with the school’s policy.  Faced with two unacceptable options proposed by the school \nadministrators, Ash continued to use the boys’ restrooms, as he had been doing already.  That \napproach was the only way Ash felt he could mitigate the physical harm that he would suffer if \nhe refrained from all restroom use during the school day and during his after-school \nextracurricular activities.  Because of his active involvement in after-school activities, a typical \nschool day for Ash lasts from 7 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m., i.e., 9 or 10 hours.  Some activities require \nhim to be on Tremper’s campus until as late as 10 p.m., a 15-hour day.  These long days at \nschool make avoiding restrooms altogether impossible.   \n43.  Ash’s decision to use the boys’ restroom consistent with his legal right, though in \ndefiance of school policy, nevertheless exacted an emotional toll.  Ash became more depressed \nand anxious, grew distracted from his school work, and began to have trouble sleeping. \n44.  On or about March 10, 2016, Ash and his mother met with Graf and Tronvig.  \nDuring that meeting, Graf referred to Ash exclusively by his birth name.  In that meeting, Graf \ntold Ms. Whitaker that the reason Ash could not use the boys’ restrooms was because he could \nonly use restrooms consistent with his gender as listed in the school’s official records.  Graf said \nthat the only way the school could change Ash’s gender in its records would be if the school \nreceived legal or medical documentation confirming his transition to male.   \n13 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 13 of 36   Document 12\n\n45.  Ms. Whitaker explained that, to her knowledge, Ash was too young for transition-\nrelated surgery.  Graf repeated that the school would need some kind of medical documentation, \nbut declined to indicate what type of medical “documentation” would be sufficient to \ndemonstrate that Ash’s gender marker should be changed on his school records and that he could \nuse boys’ restrooms.   \n46.  In response, Ms. Whitaker contacted Ash’s pediatrician.  The pediatrician faxed a \nletter to the school on or about March 11, 2016, confirming that Ash is a transgender boy and \nrecommending that Ash be allowed to use male-designated facilities at school.  At Ms. \nWhitaker’s request, the pediatrician subsequently sent the school a second letter, reiterating her \nrecommendation about Ash’s restroom usage.  \n47.  Despite the letters from Ash’s doctor, Aiello emailed Ms. Whitaker that the \nschool would continue to deny boys’ restroom access to Ash because he had not completed a \nmedical transition. \n48.  Ash continued to use the boys’ restrooms when needed, but he mainly attempted \nto avoid using restrooms altogether by not drinking or eating while at school, in order to avoid \nthe scrutiny, fear, and humiliation he faced when he had to use a restroom at school.  His anxiety \nand depression increased further.  He also experienced increased physical symptoms relating to \nhis vasovagal syncope, including dizziness, nearly fainting, and migraines.  Ash returned to see \nhis pediatrician in late March 2016 to have his symptoms evaluated.  The pediatrician again \ninstructed him to eat and drink regularly to avoid those symptoms.  Nonetheless, Ash was unable \nto comply with those instructions, out of fear of using the restrooms at school.  Concerned about \nhis physical health, his mother would regularly hand him a bottle of water and tell him to drink it \n14 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 14 of 36   Document 12\n\nto avoid dehydration, and he would refuse, saying that he did not want to have to use the \nrestroom.  \n49.  On or about March 17, 2016, Geiger observed Ash as he entered a boys’ \nrestroom, and reported that fact to Graf.  Minutes later, Graf insisted that Ash leave his acting \nclass and come to her office, and met with him alone for half an hour, lecturing him about his use \nof the boys’ restrooms.   \n50.  During that same meeting, Graf asked Ash why he was not using the girls’ \nrestroom or single-user restroom as directed.  He informed her that the school’s policy violated \nhis rights as a transgender student under Title IX.  When Ash made clear he could not use girls’ \nrestrooms because he is not a girl, she again asked him to compromise and use the single-user \nrestroom in the main office.  He again refused because of the humiliation, stigma, and lost class \ntime that he would face using that bathroom.  Graf then reiterated her instruction that Ash cease \nhis use of boys’ restrooms. \n51.  During that March 17 meeting—as well as at virtually all other times—Graf \nconsistently referred to Ash using his traditionally female birth name and female pronouns, \ndespite Ash’s request that she use his new name and male pronouns.  In that meeting, when Ash \nbecame upset by Graf’s restroom directive and refusal to respect his male gender, Graf said, “S--\n----, calm down,” using his birth name.  Ash, angry and embarrassed, said, “No, I’m leaving,” \nand left the office.  \n52.  During that meeting, Graf directly threatened that Ash would be subject to \ndisciplinary action if he continued to use the boys’ restrooms.  Specifically, she indicated Ash \nwould have to “go down to 109 or 203”—referring to Room 109, the in-school suspension room, \nand Room 203, the school’s disciplinary office.  \n15 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 15 of 36   Document 12\n\n53.  Following the meeting with Graf, Ash began to cry in the hallway.  He had \ndifficulty concentrating in his classes for the remainder of the day, holding back tears.  He \nskipped work that afternoon and did not do any homework.  Instead, he just went home after \nschool and lay in bed feeling terrible.  \n54.  When he absolutely needed to use the restroom, Ash continued to use the boys’ \nrestrooms exclusively through June 9, 2016, the final day of the school year.  As a result, Graf \ncontinued to call Ash, his mother, or both into her office for periodic meetings.  At those \nmeetings, Graf would inquire about Ash’s restroom use, and, when told he was still using the \nboys’ restrooms, would repeat the school’s policy that he must use the girls’ restroom or a \nsingle-user restroom.  During these meetings, Graf continued to refer to Ash by his birth name \nand female pronouns. \n55.  Ash grew increasingly embarrassed by Graf’s repeated inquiries about his \nrestroom use, which he felt to be an invasion of his privacy.  Since each meeting with \nadministrators occurred during class time, Ash was also concerned about the effect of these \nrepeated meetings on his academic performance and feared that he would face scrutiny from \nother students and teachers about why he was being removed from class so frequently.  Ash, who \ncontinued to have no disciplinary record at the school, also became more worried about the \nincreasingly real prospect of disciplinary consequences that might affect his ability to participate \nin extracurricular activities and negatively impact his college application process in the \nupcoming school year. \n56.  In April 2016, Ms. Whitaker learned that school administrators had sent an email \nto all of the school’s security guards, instructing them to notify administrators if they spotted any \n16 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 16 of 36   Document 12\n\nstudents who appear to be going into the “wrong” restroom.  Individual security guards later told \nMs. Whitaker that they understood the directive to be targeted at Ash. \n57.  Ash felt very uncomfortable and distressed knowing that security guards and \nadministrators were actively monitoring his restroom use. \n58.  On April 5, 2016, Ms. Whitaker was pulled out of her Tremper classroom and \nsummoned to a meeting with two KUSD district-level administrators:  Dr. Bethany Ormseth, \nKUSD’s Chief of School Leadership, and Susan Valeri, KUSD’s Chief of Special Education and \nStudent Support.   \n59.  In that meeting, Ms. Whitaker asked Ormseth and Valeri whether KUSD had \nadopted any policy concerning transgender students and restroom use.  They provided no answer \nto Ms. Whitaker’s question, other than to say that a policy was in the process of being created by \na committee of the school board.  Ms. Whitaker responded, “You don’t need a policy—it’s a \nfederal law.”  Later in the school year, Ms. Whitaker learned that Rebecca Stevens, a KUSD \nschool board member, had contradicted Ormseth and Valeri’s account, stating to another board \nmember that no committee had yet been formed and no policy was being written. \n60.  In fact, despite repeated requests by Ms. Whitaker to see the written policy about \ntransgender students’ restroom use during the course of the 2015-2016 school year, no Tremper \nor KUSD official has ever provided such a policy.  Ms. Whitaker reasonably believes no such \npolicy exists.  Rather, the Tremper administration developed and enforced a school “policy” in \ndirect and specific response to those administrators’ discomfort with the restroom usage of one \nstudent:  Ash. \n61.  The next day, on April 6, 2016, Ash and Ms. Whitaker attended a meeting with \nAiello, Graf, and Valeri.  At that meeting, the administrators offered Ash a further \n17 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 17 of 36   Document 12\n\n“accommodation” regarding his restroom use:  they informed him that he would also be allowed \nto use two single-user restrooms located on the far opposite sides of campus.  Those restrooms \nhad previously been available for any student’s use, but new locks had been installed and Ash \nalone was given the key to open them.  The stigma of being assigned personal, segregated \nrestrooms—to which he alone of all the 1,695 students in the building had a key—caused Ash \nadditional significant emotional distress.  In addition, neither of these single-occupancy \nrestrooms was convenient to Ash’s classes and would have required him to miss more class time \nthan his peers if he used those restrooms during class. \n62.  At the April 6 meeting, Ash asked Valeri for KUSD’s rationale for prohibiting his \nuse of the boys’ restrooms. Valeri replied with a statement to the effect of, “Well, we’ve never \nhad a student who identifies as male but was born female.”  \n63.  Ash replied by asserting that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex, \nwhich protects transgender students and requires schools to permit them to use restrooms \nconsistent with the student’s gender identity.  \n64.  Valeri denied that Title IX protects transgender students’ access to bathrooms \nconsistent with their gender identity.   \n65.  When Ash asked Valeri to explain her understanding of Title IX, she refused to \ndo so, stating words to the effect of, “I don’t think I’m going to give you any reasons.” \n66.  In order to avoid disciplinary sanctions from Tremper administrators for using \nboys’ restrooms on the one hand, and the scrutiny and embarrassment that would result from \nusing individually assigned restroom facilities on the other, Ash continued to avoid using school \nrestrooms as much as possible.  He has never used the designated locked single-user restrooms, \nas doing so would call unwanted attention to himself by using a key to enter a restroom to which \n18 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 18 of 36   Document 12\n\nno other student has access, and because of his desire not to spend unnecessary time out of class \ntraveling to those inconveniently located restrooms. \n67.  As a result of the stress caused by the school’s discriminatory actions, and his \nattempts to avoid using any restrooms at school, Ash’s migraines and episodes of fainting and \ndizziness continued to worsen. His depression, anxiety, and dysphoria also deepened. He became \nseverely depressed and lethargic, and no longer wanted to get out of bed in the morning.  \n68.  Due to the serious consequences the school’s actions were having on Ash’s \nphysical and psychological well-being, he considered withdrawing from Tremper and \ntransferring to an online school to finish high school.  He ultimately decided not to withdraw at \nthat time, due to his involvement in activities like the school orchestra that would not be \navailable if he were enrolled in an online school, and because changing schools would put him \nfurther behind in his classwork. \nSchool’s Refusal to Permit Ash to Be Considered for Junior Prom King \n69.  Tremper High’s junior prom was scheduled for May 7, 2016.  In late March, the \nfaculty advisor for the junior prom, Lorena Danielson, submitted the names of candidates for the \nprom court to Aiello.  Candidates for prom king and queen are required to earn volunteer hours \nin order to participate and whoever earns the most hours is selected for prom court.  Based on his \ncommunity service hours, the junior prom advisor designated Ash as a candidate for prom king \nand then met with Aiello to confirm the list.  \n70.  After meeting with the junior prom advisor, Aiello called Ms. Whitaker in for a \nmeeting with him and Graf on or about March 22, 2016, during which he told her that Ash could \nbe on the prom court, but could only be a candidate for prom queen, not prom king.  When Ash \nlearned about this, he was devastated.  He was humiliated at the prospect of running for prom \n19 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 19 of 36   Document 12\n\nqueen, when all his classmates knew him to be a boy.  He felt deeply disrespected and angry that \nthe administrators failed to recognize how hurtful and unfair this additional form of \ndiscrimination was. \n71.  On April 4, 2016, Ash and his friends presented a MoveOn.org petition to \nTremper administrators demanding that Ash be allowed to run for prom king and to use the boys’ \nrestrooms at school, which was signed by many members of the Tremper community and \nthousands of others around the country.  When administrators failed to respond, on April 5, \n2016, 70 students participated in a sit-in at Tremper’s main office to show their support for Ash.  \nThe students held signs expressing the view that transgender students should be treated equally, \nand supporting Ash’s right to be allowed to run for prom king and to use the boys’ restrooms at \nschool. \n72.  Following the sit-in and media attention about KUSD’s treatment of Ash, in the \nApril 6, 2016 meeting referenced above, Aiello, Graf, and Valeri informed Ash and Ms. \nWhitaker that Ash would be permitted to run for prom king. \n73.  Although Ash was pleased to have the opportunity to run for prom king and \nheartened by the outpouring of support from his classmates, he continued to feel deeply \ndistressed as a result of the school administrators’ initial decision that he could only run for prom \nqueen and their continued pattern of refusing to recognize or respect his male gender identity. \nName and Gender in School Records \n74.  KUSD has not changed Ash’s name on his official records and other documents, \nincluding classroom attendance rosters used by his teachers.  Although most of Ash’s teachers \nrefer to him by his male name, substitute teachers have frequently referred to him by his birth \nname in front of his classmates because that is the name that appears on the attendance rosters.  \n20 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 20 of 36   Document 12\n\nIn response, and in order to avoid embarrassment or discomfort from his classmates, Ash has \nbeen compelled to approach all of his teachers at the beginning of each term to advise them of \nhis preferred name and pronouns and request that they do not refer to him by his birth name.  He \nsimilarly must approach substitute teachers before class every time a teacher is absent.  Although \nsome teachers note his correct name on the class roster, others have not documented that name \non the roster, and occasionally substitute teachers still refer to him by his birth name in class.  \nBeing called a traditionally female name in front of all his classmates reveals that he is \ntransgender to all of his peers and makes Ash feel embarrassed and distressed.  The practice has \nresulted in Ash experiencing increased symptoms of Gender Dysphoria, including anxiety and \ndepression. \n75.  In the meetings with administrators on March 6 and March 22, Ms. Whitaker \nrequested that the school change Ash’s name and gender in its official records to avoid those \nproblems.  In both meetings, Graf told Ms. Whitaker that in order to change Ash’s name or \ngender in the school’s official records, the school would need to see legal or medical \ndocumentation.  The medical documentation Ash’s pediatrician sent was deemed insufficient, \nalthough Graf and Aiello refused to specify what the contents of acceptable documentation \nwould be, despite repeated requests for clarification.  They also failed to specify what type of \n“legal documentation” would be necessary to update the school records. \n76.  In August 2016, Ash filed a petition in Kenosha county court seeking a court-\nordered name change, which is pending as of the date of this Amended Complaint.  Even if \nKUSD is unable to change Ash’s name or gender in its official school records because Ash has \nnot yet obtained a legal name change, KUSD can and should take steps to avoid intentional or \ninadvertent disclosure of Ash’s birth name or sex assigned at birth to KUSD employees or \n21 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 21 of 36   Document 12\n\nstudents, including by modifying informal or public-facing documents, such as attendance \nrosters, to reflect Ash’s male name and male gender.  \nOther Harassing and Stigmatizing Treatment Faced by Ash at School \n77.  After news broke about the petition for Ash to run for prom king and use boys’ \nrestrooms at school, some parents and other Kenosha residents began to speak out in opposition \nto Ash’s right to use boys’ restrooms.  On May 10, 2016, shortly after the junior prom, at a \nmeeting of the Board, several community members spoke in opposition to allowing transgender \nstudents to use restrooms in accordance with their gender identity.  One parent told the Board \nthat he was opposed to permitting transgender students to use gender-appropriate restrooms \nbecause such a policy would permit sexual predators to enter women’s restrooms and put his \ndaughters at risk. \n78.  That person’s wife, who volunteers as a pianist with the school orchestra, has \ncreated and maintains a public Facebook group called “KUSD Parents for Privacy,” which \ncontains numerous posts critical of transgender students’ rights.  Several posts on that page have \nmentioned Ash and his mother by name, accompanied by their photographs.  One post, on May \n14, 2016, linked to an article about Ash, contains a photograph of him and his mother, and \ndescribes him as a “pawn.”  \n79.  At an orchestra rehearsal at the school on May 11, 2016, the day following the \nBoard meeting at which her husband spoke, this woman approached Ash, put her hands on his \nshoulders, and said words to the effect of, “A----, honey, this isn’t about you, this is bigger than \nyou.  I’m praying for you.”  Ash was extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed, and did not \nrespond.  Ms. Whitaker and Ash later brought this incident to Aiello’s attention.  Aiello \nrequested that Breitenbach-Cooper, the orchestra teacher, call the volunteer to advise her not to \n22 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 22 of 36   Document 12\n\ntalk to students like that, but took no further action.  Nothing changed as a result.  She is still a \nregular volunteer with the school orchestra and has continued to attend every rehearsal.  Her \nconstant presence substantially diminishes Ash’s enjoyment of an extracurricular activity that \nhas formed an important part of his educational experience at Tremper. \nGreen Wristbands to Mark Transgender Students \n80.  In May 2016, Ash’s guidance counselor, Tronvig, showed Ms. Whitaker what \nappeared to be a bright green wristband (comprised of green adhesive stickers).  Tronvig told \nMs. Whitaker that a school administrator had given her these wristbands with the instruction that \nthey were to be given to any student who identified himself or herself as transgender.  Ms. \nWhitaker understood this to mean that the school intended to use the wristbands to mark students \nwho are transgender and monitor their restroom usage.  Upon information and belief, other \nguidance counselors were also provided these wristbands and instructed them to give them to \ntransgender students. \n81.  Branding transgender students in this way would single them out for additional \nscrutiny, stigma, and potentially harassment or violence, and violate their privacy by revealing \ntheir transgender status to others.   \n82.  Upon learning about the school’s proposed green wristband practice, Ash felt \nsickened and afraid.  He was aware of the prevalence of violent attacks against transgender \npeople nationwide, and grew very afraid that the school would attempt to force him to wear the \nwristband on penalty of discipline.  If he did wear the wristband, he knew that other students \nwould likely ask him repeatedly why he was wearing it, and he would have to explain over and \nover that he is transgender.  He expected that some students would stare, and others would \noutright ridicule him.  He felt like his safety would be even more threatened if he had to wear \nthis visible badge of his transgender status. \n23 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 23 of 36   Document 12\n\n83.  To Plaintiff’s knowledge, the green wristband practice proposed at the end of the \nschool year may be implemented in the new school year, such that guidance counselors will be \nexpected to provide these wristbands to transgender students in the upcoming school year. \nOvernight Accommodations at Summer Orchestra Camp \n84.  Ash participated in a five-day, school-sponsored summer orchestra camp from \nJune 12-16, 2016.  The camp was held on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, \nand students stayed in dormitories on campus.  The dorms used for the camp were suites with \ntwo to four bedrooms and a common living room, kitchenette, and two single-occupancy \nrestrooms.  Each suite had either four separate, single-occupancy bedrooms, or two double-\noccupancy rooms.  During the evenings, school chaperones placed tape across each of the \nbedroom doorways to prevent students from leaving the bedrooms at night.  The suites were \ndesignated either male or female.  \n85.  In advance of the camp, the school allowed students to sign up for dorm rooms \nwith their friends.  Ash had signed up to stay in a boys’ suite with one of his best friends, a male \nstudent. \n86.  Breitenbach-Cooper, the orchestra teacher, told Aiello about Ash’s request to stay \nin the same suite as his friend and other male students.  Aiello replied that Ash could not do so \nbecause, under Tremper’s policy, he could not stay with other boys.  Aiello told Breitenbach-\nCooper that Ash would have to stay in a suite with girls or alone in a suite, segregated from all of \nhis peers. \n87.  In order to participate in the orchestra camp, Ash reluctantly agreed to stay in \ndouble-bedroom suite all alone, with no other students sharing the suite.  He rejected the \n“option” to stay in a suite with girls because he is a boy and he felt uncomfortable staying with \ngirls.   \n24 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 24 of 36   Document 12\n\n88.  This arrangement excluded Ash from socializing with other students during the \nentire five-day camp.  Students were prohibited from entering other suites, and could only \nsocialize within their own suite or in common areas of the building.  Since almost all the other \nstudents remained in their suites to socialize in the evenings, Ash stayed in his room alone each \nevening while the other students enjoyed time to socialize with their friends.  He felt lonely and \ndepressed, and disappointed that he was not able to have the same good memories of his final \nyear at camp as all the other students.  \n89.  The school’s decision to segregate Ash from the other boys also left him feeling \nhurt and embarrassed.  He understood the school’s decision to be based on a perception that he \nmight engage in sexual activity with another boy, and he felt degraded and humiliated by the \nidea that administrators were thinking about him in those terms.  \nDistrict’s Failure to Change its Discriminatory Policies after Notice of Legal Obligations \n90.  Ash and Ms. Whitaker have repeatedly advised KUSD officials that their actions \nviolate Ash’s right to attend school free from sex discrimination, as required by Title IX and the \nEqual Protection Clause.  Despite being put on notice of the violations of Ash’s statutory and \nconstitutional rights, KUSD has refused to change its policies to date. \n91.  On April 19, 2016, through his attorneys, Ash sent a letter to Superintendent \nSavaglio-Jarvis demanding that KUSD permit him to use boys’ restrooms at school. \n92.  By letter of April 26, 2016, KUSD’s attorneys responded, acknowledging their \nawareness of U.S. Department of Education guidance documents interpreting Title IX to protect \nstudents from discrimination based on their gender identity—as well as the Fourth Circuit’s \nApril 19, 2016 opinion in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, a Title IX case brought by a \ntransgender high school student who was denied access to boys’ restrooms at school, in which \n25 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 25 of 36   Document 12\n\nthat appeals court deferred to the Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX and held \nthat the plaintiff student was entitled to restroom access consistent with his gender identity.  The \nletter nevertheless maintained that KUSD is not bound by these authorities and would not change \nits position on Ash’s restroom use. \n93.  On May 12, 2016, Ash filed an administrative complaint with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), alleging that KUSD’s actions \nviolated Ash’s rights under Title IX.  Shortly before filing this lawsuit, Plaintiff’s attorneys \ncontacted OCR and requested to withdraw that complaint, without prejudice. \n94.  On May 13, 2016, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of \nJustice issued a joint guidance letter to all public schools, colleges, and universities in the \ncountry receiving Federal financial assistance, reiterating the federal government’s previously \nstated position that, pursuant to Title IX, all public schools are obligated to treat transgender \nstudents consistent with their gender identities in all respects, including regarding name and \npronoun usage, restroom access, and overnight accommodations. \n95.  Following the issuance of the federal guidance on May 13, 2016, KUSD officials \npublicly acknowledged the guidance but stated that they did not believe they were required to \ncomply with it.  KUSD issued a statement declaring, “[t]he Department of Education’s . . . letter \nis not law; it is the Department’s interpretation of the law,” suggesting that it would not change \nits policy absent a court order. \n96.  To date, the Board has not articulated or adopted any formal policy regarding \ntransgender students in KUSD’s schools. \n26 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 26 of 36   Document 12\n\n97.  Based on the statements and actions of KUSD officials, Ash feels deep anxiety \nand dread about experiencing continued discrimination during his senior year and the effect that \nit will have on him during the college application process. \nINJURY TO PLAINTIFF \n98.  Through their actions described above, Defendants have injured and are \ncontinuing to injure Plaintiff. \n99.  Defendants have denied Ash full and equal access to KUSD’s education programs \nand activities by denying him the full and equal access to student restrooms and overnight \naccommodations during school-sponsored trips offered to other male students.     \n100.  Ash has experienced and continues to experience the harmful effects of being \nsegregated from, and treated differently than, his male classmates at school and during school-\nsponsored events, including lowered self-esteem, embarrassment, social isolation, and stigma, as \nwell as heightened symptoms of Gender Dysphoria, including depression and anxiety. \n101.  When school administrators and staff intentionally used his birth name or female \npronouns (or allowed others to do so), instructed him not to use the boys’ restrooms, instructed \nsecurity personnel to surveil his movements, and otherwise undermined his male identity and \nsingled him out as different from all other boys, he has felt deeply hurt, disrespected, and \nhumiliated.   \n102.  Defendants’ discriminatory actions, and the efforts Ash has made to comply with \nthe directive not to use the boys’ restroom—limiting food and drink while at school—have led to \na host of physical symptoms, including dehydration, dizziness, fainting, and migraines.  All of \nthose symptoms virtually disappeared once Ash returned home from the orchestra camp and \n27 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 27 of 36   Document 12\n\nsummer break began, and Ash was no longer facing daily scrutiny and anxiety and could eat and \ndrink at a healthy level. \n103.  As a direct and continuing result of Defendants’ discriminatory actions, Ash has \nsuffered increased and continuing emotional distress over the last six months.  He has \nexperienced escalating symptoms of depression and anxiety, and his self-esteem has suffered, as \na result of the discrimination he has experienced at school.  Although he cried very little in the \npast, he frequently cries and fights back tears.   \n104.  As a result of the depression and anxiety Defendants’ actions caused, Ash has also \nhad difficulty eating and sleeping properly, and difficulty concentrating in classes and on his \nhomework.  \n105.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, and the feelings of fear and scrutiny he has \ngrown used to, Ash now feels unsafe being outside of the house, afraid that he will be targeted \nfor an assault by someone who knows he is transgender.  He will typically only go out in groups \nof friends, and tries to avoid ever going out with only one other friend or alone. \n106.  Ash has also missed significant class time due to being compelled by KUSD \nofficials to participate in repeated, lengthy meetings during class time to discuss his use of \nrestrooms, his name and gender in school records, and the school’s determination that he would \nbe prohibited from running for prom king. \n107.  All of the above discriminatory treatment has undermined the efficacy of the \nsocial transition component of his gender transition and heightened his symptoms of Gender \nDysphoria.  \n108.  If Defendants refuse to grant Ash access to boys’ restrooms by the time his senior \nyear begins on September 1, 2016, he will likely experience the same social stigma, emotional \n28 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 28 of 36   Document 12\n\ndistress, academic harm, and detrimental impediments to his gender transition resulting from \nDefendants’ conduct that he experienced during his junior year. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \nViolation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \n109.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 108 as fully set forth herein. \n110.  Under Title IX and its implementing regulations, “[n]o person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); see also 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (Department of Education Title IX \nregulations); 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31 (Department of Agriculture Title IX regulations); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 86.31 (Department of Health and Human Services Title IX regulations).  Title IX’s \nprohibitions on sex discrimination extend to “any academic, extracurricular, research, \noccupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient” of federal \nfunding.  34 C.F.R. § 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n111.  Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” encompasses \ndiscrimination based on an individual’s gender identity, transgender status, and gender \nexpression, including nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes. \n112.  Conduct specifically prohibited under Title IX includes, inter alia, treating one \nperson differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or \ncondition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service; providing different aid, benefits, or \nservices in a different manner; denying any person any such aid, benefit, or service; or otherwise \n29 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 29 of 36   Document 12\n\nsubjecting any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment.  34 \nC.F.R. § 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n113.  As a Federal funding recipient, Defendant Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 \nBoard of Education, including the academic, extracurricular, and other educational opportunities \nprovided by the Kenosha Unified School District and Tremper High School, is subject to Title \nIX’s prohibitions on sex- and gender-based discrimination against any student. \n114.  As set forth in paragraphs 28 to 98 above, Defendants, by adopting and enforcing \na policy or practice of prohibiting Plaintiff, a transgender boy, from accessing male-designated \nrestrooms at school, and requiring that he use female-designated restrooms or single-occupancy \nrestrooms, have discriminated and continue to discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of \nKUSD’s education program and activities by treating him differently from other male students \nbased on his gender identity, the fact that he is transgender, and his nonconformity to male \nstereotypes, and thereby denying him the full and equal participation in, benefits of, and right to \nbe free from discrimination in the educational opportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High \nSchool, on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX. \n115.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, from staying in male-designated overnight accommodations on \nschool-sponsored trips, and requiring him to stay in female-designated overnight \naccommodations or segregated accommodations on those trips, has discriminated and continues \nto discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of KUSD’s education program and activities by \ntreating him differently from other male students based on his gender identity, the fact that he is \ntransgender, and his nonconformity to male stereotypes, and thereby denying him the full and \nequal participation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the educational \n30 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 30 of 36   Document 12\n\nopportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High School, on the basis of sex, in violation of \nTitle IX. \n116.  Defendants have further violated Title IX by failing to recognize fully and respect \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, as a male student, including through administrators’ repeated and \nintentional use of Plaintiff’s traditionally female birth name and female pronouns to address him \nand refer to him to others; the failure to take necessary and appropriate action to update or \nmodify Ash’s official and/or informal student records, including classroom attendance rosters, to \nprevent teachers, substitute teachers, and other school staff from referring to him by his female \nbirth name and female pronouns in the presence of other students; Tremper administrators’ initial \nrefusal to permit Ash to run for junior prom king and directive that he run for prom queen \ninstead, withdrawn only after a student protest and media attention; and Tremper administrators’ \ninstruction to school guidance counselors to provide green wristbands to transgender students.  \nThrough these actions, individually and collectively, Defendants have and continue to exclude \nPlaintiff from participation in, deny him the benefits of, and subject him to discrimination in \nKUSD’s education programs and activities, on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX. \n117.  Defendants, through instructing Tremper staff to report the restroom use of any \nstudent who “appears” to be using the “wrong” restroom, operates an unlawful policy or practice \nof profiling Plaintiff and other students who are transgender and/or do not conform to sex- or \ngender-based stereotypes, and thereby deprive Plaintiff and similarly situated students of their \nrights under Title IX to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of \ngender identity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, in \nfurther violation of Title IX. \n31 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 31 of 36   Document 12\n\n118.  Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, injured by Defendants’ discriminatory \nconduct and has suffered damages as a result. \nSecond Cause of Action \nViolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Based on \nDeprivation of Plaintiff’s Rights under the  \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n119.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporate the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 108 as fully set forth herein. \n120.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, discrimination based on sex, including gender, gender identity, transgender \nstatus, and nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, as well as discrimination based on \ntransgender status alone, is presumptively unconstitutional and is therefore subject to heightened \nscrutiny. \n121.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, from accessing male-designated restrooms at school, and requiring \nthat he use female-designated restrooms or single-occupancy restrooms, have discriminated and \ncontinue to discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of KUSD’s education program and \nactivities by treating him differently from other male students based on his gender identity, the \nfact that he is transgender, and his nonconformity to male stereotypes, thereby denying him the \nfull and equal participation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the \neducational opportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High School, on the basis of sex and \ntransgender status, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n122.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender boy, from staying in male-designated overnight accommodations on \nschool-sponsored trips, and requiring him to stay in female-designated overnight \n32 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 32 of 36   Document 12\n\naccommodations or segregated accommodations on those trips, has discriminated and continues \nto discriminate against Plaintiff in his enjoyment of KUSD’s education program and activities by \ntreating him differently from other male students based on his gender identity, the fact that he is \ntransgender, and his nonconformity to male stereotypes, thereby denying him the full and equal \nparticipation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the educational \nopportunities offered by KUSD and Tremper High School, on the basis of sex and transgender \nstatus, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n123.  Defendants have further violated Plaintiff’s rights under the Equal Protection \nClause by failing to recognize fully and respect Plaintiff, a transgender boy, as a male student, \nincluding through administrators’ repeated and intentional use of Plaintiff’s traditionally female \nbirth name and female pronouns to address him and refer to him to others; the failure to take \nnecessary and appropriate action to update or modify Ash’s official and/or informal student \nrecords, including classroom attendance rosters, to prevent teachers, substitute teachers, and \nother school staff from referring to him by his female birth name and female pronouns in the \npresence of other students; Tremper administrators’ initial refusal to permit Ash to run for junior \nprom king and directive that he run for prom queen instead, withdrawn only after a student \nprotest and media attention; and Tremper administrators’ instruction to school guidance \ncounselors to provide green wristbands to any student who identified himself or herself as \ntransgender.  Through these actions, individually and collectively, Defendants have and continue \nto exclude Plaintiff from participation in, deny him the benefits of, and subject him to \ndiscrimination in KUSD’s education programs and activities, on the basis of sex and transgender \nstatus, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n33 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 33 of 36   Document 12\n\n124.  Defendants, through instructing Tremper staff to report the restroom use of any \nstudent who “appears” to be using the “wrong” restroom, operates an unlawful policy or practice \nof profiling Plaintiff and other students who are transgender and/or do not conform to sex- or \ngender-based stereotypes, and thereby deprive Plaintiff and similarly situated students of their \nrights to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of gender \nidentity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, in further \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n125.  Defendants’ discrimination against Ash is not substantially related to any \nimportant governmental interest, nor is it rationally related to any legitimate governmental \ninterest. \n126.  Defendants are liable for their violation of Ash’s Fourteenth Amendment rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n127.  Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, injured by Defendants’ conduct and has \nsuffered damages as a result. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Ash Whitaker, by and through his mother and next friend, \nMelissa Whitaker, requests that this Court: \n(a)  enter a declaratory judgment that the actions of Defendants complained of herein \nare in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. and \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n(b)  issue preliminary and permanent injunctions (i) directing Defendants to provide \nPlaintiff access to male-designated restrooms at school, and otherwise to treat him as a boy in all \nrespects for the remainder of his time as a student in Defendants’ schools or until resolution of \n34 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 34 of 36   Document 12\n\nthis lawsuit, whichever is later; (ii) restraining Defendants, their agents, employees, \nrepresentatives, and successors, and any other person acting directly or indirectly with them, \nfrom adopting, implementing, or enforcing any policy or practice at the school or District level \nthat treats transgender students differently from their similarly situated peers (i.e., treating \ntransgender boys differently from other boys and transgender girls differently from other girls); \n(iii) directing Defendants to clarify that KUSD and Tremper’s existing policies prohibiting \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex apply to discrimination based on gender identity, transgender \nstatus, and nonconformity to sex- and gender-based stereotypes; (iv) ordering Defendants to \nprovide training to all district-level and school-based administrators in the Kenosha Unified \nSchool District on their obligations under Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause regarding the \nnondiscriminatory treatment of transgender and gender nonconforming students; and (v) \nensuring that all district-level and school-based administrators responsible for enforcing Title IX, \nincluding Defendants’ designated Title IX coordinator(s), are aware of the correct and proper \napplication of Title IX to transgender and gender nonconforming students; \n(c)  order all compensatory relief necessary to cure the adverse educational effects of \nDefendants’ discriminatory actions on Plaintiff’s education; \n(d)  award compensatory damages in an amount that would fully compensate Plaintiff \nfor the emotional distress and other damages that have been caused by Defendants’ conduct \nalleged herein; \n(e)  award Plaintiff his reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988; and \n(f)  order such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable. \n   \n35 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-00943-PP   Filed 08/15/16   Page 35 of 36   Document 12\n\nDated: August 15, 2016 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n  /s Joseph J.
