    "summary": "<p>On October 8, 2013, three Catholic non-profit 501(c)(3)s and a trustee for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor, Department of Treasury, and their respective Secretaries in their official capacities. Plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, and Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, alleged that the government violated their statutory rights (including RFRA and the APA) and First Amendment right to freedom of religion by mandating that they subsidize, facilitate, and or provide coverage for various reproductive health services for their employees. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees. The suit was related to a previous lawsuit, brought by plaintiffs in the same court in May of 2012. That suit was dismissed by the same court, without prejudice, upon the government's assurance that the mandate at issue would not be enforced against plaintiffs, and that the regulations at issue were to be amended.</p>\r\n<p>On October 8, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an expedited preliminary injunction. The motion was considered in conjunction with a similar motion from Zubik v. Sebelius. Judge Arthur J. Schwab issued an order, which applied to both suits, granting the motions for expedited preliminary injunctions. The plaintiffs in both cases then filed unopposed motions for permanent injunctions, and Judge Schwab granted those motions on December 20, 2013. On February 11, 2014, the cases were formally consolidated on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit along with Geneva College v. Sebelius. See summary of <a href=\"../../../../case/13465/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zubik v. Sebelius</a> for details covering the injunctions granted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 11, 2015, the Third Circuit reversed the injunction in an order that applied to all the consolidated cases, holding that the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate does not significantly burden the religious expression of the nonprofit entities affiliated with the churches in this case. 778 F.3d 422. The plaintiffs then filed a petition for rehearing en banc, which was denied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court granted cert in Zubik on the issue of whether notifying the federal government by signing a form identifying the employer as a religious nonprofit that objected to the contraceptive services mandate violated the RFRA, or, rather, satisfies that statute's standard as the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest. 577 U.S. 971. See summary of Zubik v. Sebelius for details on the Court&rsquo;s remand. The Court then remanded to the Third Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>The parties in this case were included in the settlement of Zubik after remand to the Third Circuit. Accordingly, on October 16, 2017, the parties filed a joint motion to voluntarily dismiss the case, which the court so ordered on Oct. 20. See summary of <a href=\"../../../../case/13465/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zubik v. Sebelius</a> for details of the settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

NO. 4; 13-CV-0303E: DOC. NO. 6) \n \n   \n\nI.  Introduction  \n  Presently before the Court are two cases which challenge the application of provisions of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”).  These cases present the Court with the \nissue of whether the Dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie, which are exempt from provisions of the \nACA requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptive products, \nservices, and counseling (“the contraceptive mandate”), are divisible from their nonprofit, \nreligious affiliated/related charitable and educational organizations which, under the current \nprovisions, will be compelled to facilitate/initiate coverage of contraceptive products, services, \nand counseling, beginning January 1, 2014, in violation of their sincerely-held religious beliefs.1   \n  On October 8, 2013, in the Pittsburgh division of the United States District Court of the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania, Plaintiffs: Most Reverend David A. Zubik, as Trustee of the \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, a charitable trust; the Roman Catholic Diocese of \nPittsburgh, as the Beneficial Owner of the Pittsburgh series of the Catholic Benefits Trust; and \nCatholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Inc. (“Pittsburgh Plaintiffs”), filed a Complaint \nin which they assert eight causes of action against Defendants: United States Departments of \nHealth and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury, and their respective Secretaries.  Zubik v. \nSebelius, Civil Action 2:13-cv-1459 (W.D. Pa. 2013).  Pittsburgh Plaintiffs simultaneously filed \na Motion for Expedited Preliminary Injunction, asking this Court to issue a preliminary \n                                                           \n1  Generally, the three most relevant sincerely-held religious beliefs of the Catholic faith at issue in these \ncases are: (1) the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death; (2) unity of worship, faith, and \ngood works (“faith without good works is dead”); and (3) the facilitation of evil is as morally odious as \nthe proliferation of evil.  See Hearing testimony: Bishop Zubik, pg. 21, lines 12-14, pg. 28, lines 17-20, \npg. 35, lines 17-18, pg. 42, lines 21-25; Bishop Persico, pg. 73, lines 7-9,  pg. 75, lines 16-19, pg. 79, \nlines 24-25, pg. 80, lines 6-8, pg. 83, lines 6-9.  These three sincerely-held religious beliefs and their \nintersection with the ACA will be more thoroughly discussed, infra. \n2 \n \n\ninjunction to enjoin the issuance, application, and enforcement of the contraceptive mandate, as \ncodified in 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv).  Doc. No. 4.   \n  Also, on October 8, 2013, in the Erie division of this District Court, Plaintiffs: Most \nReverend Lawrence T. Persico, as Trustee of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, a charitable \ntrust; the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie; St. Martin Center, Inc.; Prince of Peace Center, Inc.; \nand Erie Catholic Preparatory School (“Erie Plaintiffs”), filed a Complaint in which they assert \nthe same eight causes of action against the same Defendants (“the Government”) related to the \nimplementation of the contraceptive mandate of the ACA.  Persico v. Sebelius, Civil Action \n1:13-cv-303 (W.D. Pa. 2013).  Erie Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Expedited Preliminary \nInjunction asking the Court to issue a preliminary injunction to enjoin the issuance, application, \nand enforcement of the contraceptive mandate, as codified in 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv).  \nDoc. No. 6.   \n  Plaintiffs allege that the contraceptive mandate, as applied via the “accommodation,” \nrequires them to facilitate/initiate the process for providing health insurance coverage for \nabortion-inducing drugs, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related educational and \ncounseling services (“contraceptive products, services, and counseling”).  The Dioceses, as \n“religious employers,” are exempt from these provisions.  See generally Stipulations of Fact,       \n¶ 31; 13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 1, ¶ 44-46.  A safe harbor for non-grandfathered, non-exempt \norganizations (including Plaintiffs: Catholic Charities, St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, \nand Erie Catholic) from enforcement of these provisions has been extended until December 31, \n2013.  Additional Stipulated Facts, ¶ 7, citing 77 Fed. Ref. 8725, 8727 (Feb. 15, 2012).  Non-\nexempt Plaintiffs in both cases must comply with the contraceptive mandate on or before January \n3 \n \n\n1, 2014, or potentially face substantial governmental penalties.  13-cv-303, Doc. No. 1, ¶ 164; \nDeclaration of David Murphy2 (P-91), ¶ 9.   \nPlaintiffs allege that facilitating/initiating the process for providing health insurance \ncoverage for contraceptive products, services, and counseling would cause immediate and \nirreparable injury to their fundamental rights and religious liberties, in violation of the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.3    \nDoc. No. 4, 2.   \n  This Memorandum Opinion will address both cases because the cases (although not \nconsolidated) involve: similar facts (including the same religious tenets), the same counsel, the \nsame causes of action advanced against the same Defendants, and the same legal tests apply to \nthe Motions for Expedited Preliminary Injunction.   \n  After consideration of Plaintiffs’ Motions (13-cv-0303: Doc. No. 6; 13-cv-1459: Doc. \nNo. 4), the Parties’ submissions, the testimony presented during an evidentiary hearing, the \nhearing Exhibits, and an amici curiae brief,4 Plaintiffs’ Motions for Expedited Preliminary \nInjunction will be GRANTED. \n \n \n                                                           \n2 David Murphy is employed as the Chief Financial Officer of the Diocese of Erie.  P-91, ¶ 2.   \n \n3 Plaintiffs also assert violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), Count VII, and erroneous \ninterpretation of the exemption with respect to multi-employer plans, Count VIII.  13-cv-303, Doc. No. 1, \n¶¶ 240-264; Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 255-279.  For the purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, the Court will focus \nits analysis on Plaintiffs’ arguments related to alleged violations of the RFRA and the First Amendment \nof the United States Constitution.   \n \n4 The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of \nPennsylvania have filed a brief of Amici Curiae in Opposition to Pittsburgh Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nExpedited Preliminary Injunctions.  13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 29. \n \n4 \n \n\nII.  Findings of Fact5  \nA.  Plaintiffs  \nThe Pittsburgh Plaintiffs in Zubik v. Sebelius are: (1) the Most Reverend David A. Zubik, \nBishop and Trustee of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh (“the Bishop” or “Bishop \nZubik”); (2) the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, a Pennsylvania Charitable Trust (“the \nDiocese” or “the Diocese of Pittsburgh”); and (3) Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, \nInc. (“Catholic Charities”), an affiliate nonprofit corporation of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.  Doc. \nNo. 1, 4.   \nThe Pittsburgh Plaintiffs are interrelated because of their affiliation with the Catholic \nChurch and their shared sincerely-held religious beliefs and mission.  Bishop Zubik is the \nspiritual leader of the Diocese and is responsible for the spiritual, charitable, and educational \narms of the Diocese.  Catholic Charities is a nonprofit corporation affiliated with the Diocese and \n                                                           \n5 The Government does not challenge Plaintiffs’ factual contentions as set forth in Declarations in \nSupport of the Motions for Expedited Preliminary Injunction or the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ religious \nbeliefs as set forth in the Complaints.  Stipulations of Fact (filed in 13-cv-303, Doc. No. 39 and 13-1459, \nDoc. No. 43), ¶¶ 52-56, 114-117; Doc. No. 16, ¶ 5(a)-(b); Declarations re-filed as part of the record as 13-\ncv-303, Doc. Nos. 54-50-54-56; 13-cv-1459, Doc. Nos. 55-86-55-56.  Plaintiffs’ Exhibits P-1-P-36, P-46, \nP-51, P-75, P-79, P-85, P-86-P-92 were admitted without objection (the same Exhibits and Exhibit \nnumbers were used in reference to both cases).  The Parties also filed Additional Stipulated Facts.  13-cv-\n303, Doc. No. 58; 13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 59. \n \nThe Court appreciates the Parties’ efficient, thorough, and extensive Stipulations of Fact, and the \nprofessionalism of counsel throughout this entire matter.  Throughout the Opinion, the Court will cite to \nthe Parties’ Joint Stipulations, Plaintiffs’ respective Complaints, hearing Exhibits, and where possible, to \nDeclarations in Support and hearing testimony.   \n \nThe burdens imposed on Plaintiffs by the contraceptive mandate, the Government’s stated compelling \ninterest, and potential alternatives to the contraceptive mandate, are not agreed upon by the parties, \nbecause the Government is unwilling to stipulate to these matters.  13-cv-303, Doc. No. 30, (II)(2)(b); 13-\ncv-1459, Doc. No. 25, (II)(2)(b).   \n \nThe Findings of Fact also are founded upon credibility determinations made by this Court based upon the \nCourt’s observation of the witnesses.   \n \nFor ease of reference, when discussing the case pending in Erie, documents referenced are filed in 13-cv-\n303; for the case pending in Pittsburgh, all documents are filed in 13-cv-1459.   \n5 \n \n\nwith a principal place of administration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh \nand Catholic Charities are organized exclusively for charitable, religious, and educational \npurposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Doc. No. 1,     \n¶¶ 11-13. \nThe Plaintiffs in Persico v. Sebelius are: (1) the Most Reverend Lawrence T. Persico, \nBishop and Trustee of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie (“the Bishop” or “Bishop Persico”); \n(2) St. Martin Center, Inc. (“St. Martin Center”), a nonprofit corporation affiliated with Catholic \nCharities, with its principal place of business in Erie, Pennsylvania; (3) Prince of Peace Center, \nInc. (“Prince of Peace Center”), a nonprofit corporation affiliated with Catholic Charities, with \nits principal place of business in Farrell, Pennsylvania; and (4) Erie Catholic Preparatory School \n(“Erie Catholic”), a nonprofit corporation, with its principal place of business in Erie, \nPennsylvania.  Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 11-14.   \nThe Erie Plaintiffs are interrelated because of their affiliation with the Catholic Church \nand their shared sincerely-held religious beliefs and mission.  St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace \nCenter, Erie Catholic, and the Diocese of Erie are organized exclusively for charitable, religious, \nand educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  \nDoc. No. 1, ¶¶ 11-14.   \n \nB.  Immediate Harm Claimed by Plaintiffs \nThe Dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie provide health insurance coverage to employees of \ntheir nonprofit, religious affiliated/related entities (such as Catholic Charities, St. Martin Center, \nPrince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic) which are directed by the Dioceses to implement the \nspiritual, charitable, and educational mission of the Dioceses.   \n6 \n \n\n1.  Immediate Harm as to the Dioceses  \nBased upon the credible testimony of Bishop Zubik and Bishop Persico, as Trustees for \nthe Plaintiff nonprofit, religious affiliated/related organizations, the practical results of the \napplication of the contraceptive mandate, via the “accommodation,” would be that the Dioceses \nwould be required to either:   \n(a) provide their nonprofit, religious affiliated/related organizations with a separate \ninsurance policy that covers contraceptive products, services, and counseling (which \nthe Dioceses refuse to do, according to the trial testimony).  Hearing Testimony, \nBishop Zubik, pg. 43, lines 2-10; Hearing Testimony Bishop Persico, pg. 80, lines 1-\n8, pg. 82, lines 14-16, pg. 91, lines 7-9; or  \n(b) decline to continue offering health coverage to their nonprofit, religious \naffiliated/related organizations.  This would force the nonprofit, religious \naffiliated/related organizations to enter into their own arrangements with a health \ninsurance provider that would arrange no-cost coverage of contraceptive products, \nservices, and counseling.  13-cv-303, Doc. No. 1, ¶ 118; Doc. No. 1, ¶ 159; \nDeclaration of Susan Rauscher6 (P-86),7 ¶¶ 13-15; Declaration of David S. Stewart8 \n(P-87), ¶ 18.   \n                                                           \n6 Susan Rauscher is employed as the Executive Director of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of \nPittsburgh.  P-86, ¶ 2.   \n \n7 All Declarations in these cases were originally filed as attachments to Plaintiffs’ Motions for Expedited \nPreliminary Injunctions.  13-cv-303, Doc. Nos. 9-8, 9-9, 9-10, 9-11; 13-cv-1459, Doc. Nos. 4-10, 4-11, 4-\n12.  During the hearing on Plaintiffs’ pending Motions, the Declarations were assigned Exhibit numbers \nand admitted into evidence.  P-86-P-92.  The Court will cite to Declarations by the relevant Exhibit \nnumbers.  These documents have been filed and can be found at: 13-cv-303, Doc. Nos. 54-50 through 54-\n56 and 13-cv-1459, Doc. Nos. 55-50 through 55-56.   \n \n8 David Stewart is employed as the Risk/Benefits Manager of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.  P-87, ¶ 2.   \n7 \n \n\n  The contraceptive mandate would be unequally applied to Plaintiffs and would result in \nsome schools, organizations, etc., being exempt from the mandate, while other organizations \nwould not.  13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 1, ¶ 31.  The result would cause a division between the \nDioceses and their nonprofit, religious affiliated/related spiritual/charitable/educational \norganizations which fulfill portions of Dioceses’ mission.  Id.

Hearing \nTestimony, Mary Maxwell, pg. 115, lines 9, 11-13, 16.   \n \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Employee Health Insurance Coverage  \n1.  Religious Components of Employee Health Care  \nThe sanctity of human life from conception to natural death and the dignity of all persons \nare central tenets of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  Hearing Testimony, Bishop Persico, \npg. 75, lines 16-19.  The Catholic Church believes that health care is a basic right because of the \nsanctity and dignity of human life.  See Cardinal Dolan Deposition (13-cv-303, Doc. No. 52; 13-\ncv-1459, Doc. No. 53), pg. 28, lines 19-23; Hearing Testimony, Bishop Zubik, pg. 38, lines 23-\n24; Hearing Testimony, Bishop Persico, pg. 73, lines 23-25; Declaration of Father Scott Detisch, \nPh.D. (P-92), ¶ 25; Declaration of Father Ronald P. Lengwin (P-88), ¶ 34.   \nThe Catholic Church also believes that contraception and abortion are prohibited, and \nCatholics cannot facilitate/initiate, directly or indirectly, the provision of abortions.  Cardinal \nDolan Deposition (13-cv-303, Doc. No. 52; 13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 53), pg. 25, lines 15-19, 23-\n25, pg, 26, lines 1-12; Hearing Testimony, Bishop Zubik, pg. 28, lines 16-22; Declaration of \nFather Ronald P. Lengwin (P-88), ¶¶ 12-13; Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 2 “Ethical and Religious \nDirectives for Catholic Health Care Services, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops \nNovember 17, 2009,” ¶¶ 45, 52 (“Abortion (that is, the directly intended termination of \npregnancy before viability or the directly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never \npermitted.  Every procedure whose sole immediate effect is the termination of pregnancy before \nviability is an abortion, which, in its moral context, includes the interval between conception and \nimplementation of the embryo.  Catholic health care institutions are not to provide abortion \n21 \n \n\nservices, even based upon the principle of material cooperation.  In this context, Catholic health \ncare institutions need to be concerned about the danger of scandal15 in any association with \nabortion providers.”).   \nThis belief necessarily prohibits providing, subsidizing, initiating, or facilitating \ninsurance coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related \neducational and counseling services.  Declaration of Father Ronald P. Lengwin (P-88),  ¶ 10; \nPlaintiffs’ Exhibit 2, pg. 28, ¶ 52 (“Catholic health institutions may not promote or condone \ncontraceptive practices but should provide, for married couples and the medical staff who \ncounsel them, instruction both about the Church’s teaching on responsible parenthood and in the \nmethods of natural family planning.”).    \n2.  Diocese of Pittsburgh and the Catholic Benefits Trust (Self-\nInsured Health Plan) – Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 34-40 \n \n The Diocese of Pittsburgh provides health insurance to its employees through a self-\ninsured health plan through the Catholic Benefits Trust (“Trust”).  Declaration of David S. \nStewart (P-87), ¶ 4.  The Trust was formed in June 2013 by an agreement between the Diocese of \nPittsburgh, the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, and the Diocese of Greensburg (the “Trust \nAgreement”), in an effort to pool resources with regard to health benefits.  Stipulations of Fact,   \n¶ 133.  The Trust was formed by the Diocese of Pittsburgh converting its Catholic Employers \nBenefits Plan Delaware Trust to a Delaware statutory trust and expanding the Trust to include \nthe Dioceses of Altoona-Johnstown and Greensburg.  Doc. No. 1, ¶ 34.   \nThe three Dioceses are the Beneficial Owners of the Trust, which is split into three series:  \nthe Pittsburgh series, the Altoona-Johnstown series, and the Greensburg series.  Each Diocese is \n                                                           \n15 Per testimony, “scandal,” within the Catholic faith, means cooperating with an objectionable practice \nthat goes against the faith, or “teaching one thing and behaving in another manner.”  Hearing Testimony, \nBishop Zubik, pg. 35, lines 20-23; Hearing Testimony, Bishop Persico, pg. 81, lines 18-20.   \n22 \n \n\nthe sole “Beneficial Owner” and sole beneficiary of its respective series.  Thus, Plaintiff Diocese \nof Pittsburgh is the sole Beneficial Owner and sole beneficiary of the Pittsburgh series of the \nTrust.  Declaration of David S. Stewart (P-87), ¶ 5.   \nThe Diocese itself provides health insurance coverage to approximately 200 individuals \nwho are its direct employees and their beneficiaries.  Declaration of David S. Stewart (P-87), ¶ 6.  \nThe offered plans are self-insured through the Catholic Benefits Trust and administered by \nTPAs.  Id.  Consistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church, all of the Diocesan plans \noffered through the Trust, including those for its nonprofit, religious affiliated/related \norganizations, such as Catholic Charities, do not cover abortion-inducing drugs, contraceptives, \nor sterilization, except when medically necessary.  Declaration of Susan Rauscher (P-86), ¶ 19; \nDeclaration of David S. Stewart (P-87), ¶ 9.  In the past, the Diocese has notified its TPAs that it \nwould not cover contraceptive products, services, and counseling.  Declaration of David S. \nStewart (P-87), ¶ 14.     \nThe Catholic Benefits Trust also provides coverage to “Diocesan Entit[ies],” defined in \nthe Trust Agreement as “an Agency, Parish, School, seminary or other similar entity subject to \nthe supervision, or administrative and pastoral care, of a Diocese.”  Stipulations of Fact, ¶ 134; \nDoc. No. 1, ¶ 36.  Presently, approximately 230 Catholic organizations, including the Diocese of \nPittsburgh, Catholic Charities, all of the parishes and schools with the Diocese, and several other \nentities affiliated with the Diocese of Pittsburgh, along with the Dioceses of Altoona-Johnstown \nand Greensburg and affiliated entities within those Dioceses, participate in the Trust.  Within \nthese organizations, approximately 3,100 employees and 5,000 participants receive their health \ninsurance through the Trust.  This structure allows organizations to benefit from “economies of \n23 \n \n\nscale,” to be self-insured, and to spread their risks.  As a result, each religious organization can \noffer its employees better benefits at lower costs.  Doc. No. 1, ¶ 36.  \nThe three Dioceses do not contract with a separate insurance company that pays for the \nemployee health plans sponsored by the Trust.  Instead, the Trust functions as the insurance \ncompany underwriting the covered employee’s medical costs, with all funding coming from each \nrespective Diocese and its covered affiliates.  The health plans sponsored by the Trust are \nadministered by TPAs, who are paid a flat fee for each covered individual for administering the \nplans but who do not pay for any services received by covered employees.  The Trust sponsors \none set of group health plans for the Diocese of Pittsburgh and the majority of Diocesan-\naffiliated entities within the Diocese of Pittsburgh (the “Diocesan Health Plan”).  Doc. No. 1,        \n¶ 39.   \nThe Diocesan health plans offered – except to Catholic Charities – are “grandfathered” \nand therefore are exempt from the requirements of the contraceptive mandate.  Doc. No. 1,          \n¶ 166.   The Diocese has included a statement describing its “grandfathered” status in plan \nmaterials, as required by 26 C.F.R. §54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii).  Id.  \nThe Trust sponsors separate group health plans for Plaintiff Catholic Charities of the \nDiocese of Pittsburgh.  Catholic Charities provides health insurance coverage to approximately \n80 full-time employees and their dependents (300 individuals).  Declaration of Susan Rauscher \n(P-86), ¶ 7.  The plan offered to employees of Catholic Charities is not a “grandfathered” health \nplan, and as such, it did not include a statement describing its “grandfathered” status in plan \nmaterials, as required by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(1)(ii) for “grandfathered” plans.  Doc. No. \n24 \n \n\n1, ¶ 44; Declaration of David S. Stewart (P-87), ¶ 10.16  The next Diocesan Health Plan year \nbegins on January 1, 2014.  Declaration of Susan Rauscher (P-86), ¶¶ 7-10; Declaration of David \nS. Stewart (P-87), ¶ 12.  Many Diocesan-affiliated entities currently insured through the Trust \nlikely do not qualify for the religious employer exemption and would be subjected to the \naccommodation after that date.  Doc. No. 1, ¶ 44.   \n3.  Trust Agreement – See Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 47-50 \nThe Trust Agreement provides that “each Director” of the Board of Directors of the Trust \nshall be “appointed by the Bishop of each Diocese that is or becomes a Beneficial Owner” of the \nTrust.  The Board of Directors is then responsible for “[t]he management of the Trust[.]” \nWhile “all powers to manage the business and affairs of the Trust and each Series shall be \nexclusively vested in the Board and the Board may exercise all powers of the Trust[,]” “a \nmajority of the Beneficial Owners may amend [the Trust] Agreement in writing at any time and \nthereby broaden or limit the Board’s power and authority[.]”  The Diocese, through the Bishop, \n                                                           \n16 The distinction between plans that are “grandfathered” and those that are not is important because as \ndefined in federal regulations, plans that are “grandfathered” do not have to provide coverage without cost \nsharing of “preventive health services.”  45 C.F.R. § 147.140; 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-125T; and 29 C.F.R. § \n2590.7151251.  A plan is “grandfathered” if: (1) at least one person was enrolled on March 23, 2010; (2) \nthe plan continuously covered at least one individual since that date; (3) the plan provides annual notice \nof its grandfathered status; and (4) the plan has not been subject to significant changes as outlined in the \nregulations.  See 42 U.S.C. § 18011; 26 C.F.R. §§54.9815-1251T(a), (g); 29 C.F.R. §§ 2590.715-1251(a), \n(g); 45 C.F.R. §§147.140(a)(g).  A plan may maintain its grandfathered status so long as, if, compared to \nits existence on March 23, 2010, it does not: eliminate all or substantially all benefits to diagnose or treat \na particular condition; increase a percentage cost-sharing requirement; significantly increase a fixed-\namount cost-sharing requirement; significantly reduce the employer’s contribution; or impose or tighten \nan annual limit on the dollar value of any benefits.  Additional Stipulated Facts, ¶ 3, citing 26 C.F.R. § \n54.9815-1251T(a), (g)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a), (g)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a), (g)(1).   \n \nIn July 2013, the Government announced that it will provide an additional year before the ACA \nmandatory employer and insurer reporting requirements begin.  Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 93, Doc. No. 63-1, pg, \n2.  As of February 2012, 1,200 employers had been granted waivers for certain coverage requirements.  \nId. \n25 \n \n\nhas ultimate decision-making authority and has the power to manage, oversee, and direct the \nTrust.  Doc. No. 1, ¶ 46.   \nAdditionally, the Diocese decides whether an entity may participate in the Trust.  The \nTrust Agreement provides that “[e]ach Beneficial Owner may allow such Diocesan Entities to \nbenefit in such Series in respect of which such Beneficial Owner is the holder of the sole interest \nin accordance with the terms and conditions established by such Beneficial Owner in \nconsultation with its advisors.”  The Diocese, as sole beneficial owner, also is responsible for the \nliability and other costs of the Trusts – “[a] particular Series shall be charged with the liabilities \nof that Series, and all expenses, costs, charges and reserves attributable to any particular Series \nshall be borne by such Series.”  Doc. No. 1, ¶ 50.     \n4.  Diocese of Erie  \nThe Diocese of Erie operates a self-insured health plan (“the Diocesan health plan”) by \nwhich it functions as the insurance company in underwriting the medical costs of its employees \nand the employees of its affiliated organizations.  Doc. No. 1, ¶ 36.  As such, the Diocese does \nnot contract with a separate health insurance company.  Id.  The Diocesan health plan is \nadministrated by a TPA.  Id.  The plan provides benefits for approximately 774 employees and \n980 individuals, including those who are employed directly by the Diocese as well as by schools \nand charitable agencies of the Diocese (approximately 280 insured employees are employed by \nnonexempt entities).  Declaration of David Murphy (P-91), ¶¶ 6, 27.  Employees of St. Martin \nCenter, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic (approximately 90 employees) are insured \nunder the Diocesan health plan.  Id. at ¶¶ 43, 51, 63; Declaration of Father Scott Jabo (P-89), ¶ 5.  \nEmployees, regardless of the specific employer within the plan, are provided three \noptions for health plans.  Declaration of David Murphy (P-91), ¶ 18.   Consistent with the tenets \n26 \n \n\nof the Catholic faith, none of these plans cover abortion-inducing drugs, contraceptives, or \nsterilization, except when “medically necessary.”  Declaration of David Murphy (P-91), ¶ 40.  \nThe Diocese has previously notified its TPA that it would not cover contraceptive products, \nservices, and counseling, and has never designated the TPA to provide those products, services, \nor counseling.  Declaration of David Murphy (P-91), ¶ 15.  Such actions never triggered the \nprovision of contraceptive products, services, or counseling.  Id.  \n  The next administrative year for the health plan (the date which all benefits for the July 1, \n2014, plan year must be implemented) begins on January 1, 2014.  Declaration of David Murphy \n(P-91), ¶¶ 9, 25.  The plan does not meet the ACA’s definition of a “grandfathered” plan and \ntherefore is not exempt from provisions of the ACA.  Declaration of David Murphy (P-91), ¶ 9.  \nAs such, the Diocesan health plan must comply with the provisions of the ACA on or before \nJanuary 1, 2014 (after the safe harbor provision has elapsed and first date of next administrative \nyear for the plan).  Id.   \n \nF.  Plaintiffs’ Religious Beliefs as to the Contraceptive Mandate  \nAs previously noted, a tenet of the Catholic faith is the belief that human life must be \npreserved from conception through natural death.  See generally Hearing Testimony, Bishop \nZubik, pg. 28, lines 16-20.   \nThe ACA includes the provision that eight categories of preventative services for women \nmust generally be covered by group health plans without cost sharing.  Additional Stipulated \nFacts, ¶ 15, citing HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines (Aug. 1, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines; 13-cv-303, Doc. No. 54-49; 13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 55-\n49.  Plaintiffs object to only one of the eight categories, “contraceptive methods and counseling,” \n27 \n \n\nthat covers FDA approved “contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient \neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  Additional Stipulated \nFacts, ¶¶ 16-17.  Plaintiffs object to the “contraceptive methods and counseling” category \nbecause such products, services, and counseling violate their belief in the sanctity of human life.  \nSee generally Hearing Testimony, Bishop Zubik, pg. 28, lines 16-20.   \nCompleting the self-certification form required by the contraceptive mandate’s \n“accommodation” also violates that tenet.  Hearing Testimony, Bishop Zubik, pg. 33, lines 19-21 \n(“ . . . we are being asked to violate a tenet or belief that’s important to us and a matter of \nconscience.”).  Completing the self-certification also would burden the signer’s exercise of \nreligion.  Hearing Testimony, Mary Maxwell, pg. 113, lines 15-17.   \nCompletion of the self-certification form would be akin to cooperating with/facilitating \n“an evil” and would place the Diocese “in a position of providing scandal” because “it makes it \nappear as though [the Diocese] is cooperating with an objectionable practice that goes against \n[Church] teaching.”  Hearing Testimony, Bishop Zubik, pg. 35, lines 17-18, 20-23, pg. 37, lines \n7-9; Hearing Testimony, Bishop Persico, pg. 79, lines 24-25, pg. 80, lines 6-8; Hearing \nTestimony, Father Jabo, pg. 96, lines 4-5.  Completing the self-certification form would violate \npersonal religious beliefs and cause “eternal” “ramifications.”  Hearing Testimony, Father Jabo, \npg. 97, lines 2-4; Hearing Testimony, Bishop Persico, pg. 81, line 25.   \nBishop Zubik will not complete the self-certification form and would instruct the head of \nCatholic Charities not to complete the self-certification form.  Hearing Testimony, Bishop Zubik, \npg. 43, lines 2-10.  Bishop Persico stated: “I would have a real moral issue in signing [the self-\ncertification form] because I would be afraid of giving scandal to the faithful” and “I would have \na very difficult time in [directing the heads of St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, or Erie \n28 \n \n\nCatholic to complete the self-certification form].  I don’t see how I could.”  Hearing Testimony, \nBishop Persico, pg. 80, lines 1-8, pg. 82, lines 14-16, pg. 91, lines 7-9.     \n \nIII.  Statutory and Regulatory History \nThe applicable statutory and regulatory history, as set forth by the parties in the \nStipulations of Fact  (¶¶ 1-49) and Addition Stipulations of Fact (as cited), is:  \nA.  Introduction  \nIn March 2010, Congress enacted the ACA.  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nPub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), and the Health Care and  Education Reconciliation \nAct, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010).    \nThe ACA established new requirements for “group health plan[s],” broadly defined as \n“employee welfare benefit plan[s]” within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that “provide[] medical care . . . to employees or \ntheir dependents.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1). \nSection 1001 of the ACA requires all group health plans and health insurance issuers that \noffer non-grandfathered, non-exempt group or individual health coverage to provide coverage for \ncertain preventive services without cost-sharing, including, “[for] women, such additional \npreventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration [(“HRSA”)].”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \nThe ACA provides that certain of its provisions apply to “grandfathered health plans” and \ncertain of its provisions, including 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13, do not apply to “grandfathered health \nplans.”  42 U.S.C. § 18011.  The contraceptive mandate does not apply to qualifying \n29 \n \n\n“grandfathered” plans, and such plans are not required to comply with the preventive services \ncoverage requirement of 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13 .  Additional Stipulated Facts, ¶¶ 1-2.   \n \nB. Regulatory Background \n1.   Rulemaking from July 2010 to March 2012 \nOn July 19, 2010, Defendants issued interim final rules, incorporating the statutory \nrequirement that group health plans provide coverage for women’s “preventive care.”  75 Fed. \nReg. 41,726 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4)).  These initial rules did not define “preventive \ncare,” noting that “[t]he Department of HHS is developing these guidelines and expects to issue \nthem no later than August 1, 2011.”  Id. at 41,731.  At that time, there were no existing HRSA \nguidelines relating to preventive care and screening for women.  \nThe Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) tasked the Institute of Medicine \n(“IOM”), a non-governmental organization, with “review[ing] what preventive services are \nnecessary for women’s health and well-being and should be considered in the development of \ncomprehensive guidelines for preventive services for women.”  IOM Report at 2.  On July 19, \n2011, the IOM Committee released a report entitled “Clinical Preventive Services for Women: \nClosing the Gaps 19-20, 109 (2011) (“IOM Report”).  The IOM Report recommended that the \nHRSA guidelines include, among other things, “the full range of [FDA]-approved contraceptive \nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with \nreproductive capacity” (“Preventive Services”).  IOM Report at 10-12.  FDA-approved \ncontraceptive methods include diaphragms, oral contraceptive pills, emergency contraceptives \n(such as Plan B and Ella), and intrauterine devices (“IUDs”).  See id. at 105.  The IOM Report \nincluded a dissent from Committee member Anthony Lo Sasso. \n30 \n \n\nOn August 1, 2011, HHS issued a press release announcing that it would adopt the \nrecommendations of the IOM Report.  U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, “Affordable \nCare Act Ensures Women Receive Preventive Services at No Additional Cost,” available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110801b.html. \nAlso, on August 1, 2011, HRSA adopted guidelines consistent with IOM’s \nrecommendations, encompassing all FDA-approved “contraceptive methods, sterilization \nprocedures, and patient education and counseling,” as prescribed by a health care provider, \nsubject to an exemption relating to certain religious employers authorized by regulations issued \nthat same day (the “2011 amended interim final regulations”).  See HRSA, Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines (“HRSA Guidelines”). \nIn August 2011, the Government issued interim final rules implementing the statutory \nrequirement that group health plans provide coverage for women’s “preventive care and \nscreenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by [HRSA].”  76 Fed. \nReg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011). \nThe August 2011 interim final rules also amended the July 19, 2010 interim rules to \nprovide HRSA additional discretion to exempt “religious employers” from the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement.  Id.  To qualify for the religious employer exemption contained in the \n2011 amended interim final regulations, an employer had to meet the following criteria: \na.  The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization; \nb.  The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of \nthe organization; \nc.  The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of \nthe organization; and \n31 \n \n\nd.  The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) \nand section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended [i.e., an organization exempted from filing IRS Form 990].  \nId. at 46,623.  The Government sought “to provide for a religious accommodation that respects \nthe unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.”  \nId. \nIn February 2012, the Government “finalize[d], without change,” the “religious \nemployer” exemption as originally proposed in the August 2011 interim final rules.  77 Fed. Reg. \nat 8,729 (Feb. 15, 2012).  In February 2012, the Government also created a “one-year safe harbor \nfrom enforcement” for non-grandfathered group health plans sponsored by certain nonprofit \norganizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726-\n28 (Feb. 15, 2012).  The Government undertook a new rulemaking during the safe harbor period \nto adopt new regulations applicable to non-grandfathered nonprofit religious organizations with \nreligious objections to covering Preventive Services.  Id. at 8728. \nOn March 21, 2012, the Government issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n(“ANPRM”) that stated it was part of the Government’s effort “to develop alternative ways of \nproviding contraceptive coverage without cost sharing in order to accommodate non-exempt, \nnonprofit religious organizations with religious objections to such coverage.”  77 Fed. Reg. \n16,501, 16,503 (Mar. 21, 2012). \n2.   Rulemaking from February to July 2013 \nOn February 1, 2013, the Government issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n(“NPRM”), setting forth a proposal that stated it was to “amend the criteria for the religious \nemployer exemption to ensure that an otherwise exempt employer plan is not disqualified \n32 \n \n\nbecause the employer’s purposes extend beyond the inculcation of religious values or because \nthe employer serves or hires people of different religious faiths,” and to “establish \naccommodations for health coverage established or maintained by eligible organizations, or \narranged by eligible organizations that are religious institutions of higher education, with \nreligious objections to contraceptive coverage.”  See 78 Fed. Reg. 8456 (Feb. 6, 2013). \nDefendants received over 400,000 comments (many of them standardized form letters) in \nresponse to the proposals set forth in the NPRM.  78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,872 (July 2, 2013). \nOn June 28, 2013, the Government issued final rules adopting and/or modifying \nproposals in the NPRM.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870 (“Final Rule”).  The regulations challenged \nhere (the “2013 final rules”) include the new regulations issued by the Government and \napplicable to non-grandfathered, nonprofit religious organizations with religious objections to \ncovering Preventive Services.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870; see also 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 \n(ANPRM); 78 Fed. Reg. 8456 (NPRM). \na.  The 2013 Final Rules’ “Religious Employer” Exemption  \nThe Final Rule states that it “simplify[ied] and clarify[ied] the definition of “religious \nemployer.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,871.  Under the new definition, an exempt “religious employer” \nis “an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”  78 Fed. \nReg. 39874 (codified at 45 CFR § 147.131(a)).  The groups that are “refer[red] to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code,” are:  \n(i) churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations \nof churches, and \n*  *  * \n(iii) the exclusively religious activities of any religious order. \n   \n33 \n \n\n26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii).  Section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code addresses \nwhether and when nonprofit entities that are exempt from paying taxes under the Code must file \n“annual information [tax] return[s].”  26 C.F.R. § 1.6033-2(a). \nThe new definition of “religious employer” does “not expand the universe of religious \nemployers that qualify for the exemption beyond that which was intended in the 2012 final \nregulations.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874 (citing 78 Fed. Reg. 8461).  Entities that are included in \nSection 6033(a)(3)(A) are exempt from filing an annual Form 990 with the IRS.17  \n                                                           \n17 The IRS has developed a non-exhaustive list of fourteen facts and circumstances that may be \nconsidered, in addition to “any other facts and circumstances that may bear upon the organization’s claim \nfor church status,” in assessing whether an organization is a “church” under section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) of \nthe Internal Revenue Code.  See Foundation of Human Understanding v. United States, 88 Fed. Cl. 203, \n220 (Fed. Cl. 2009); Internal Revenue Manual 7.26.2.2.4.   The list of fourteen facts and circumstances \nincludes the following: \n(1) a distinct legal existence;  \n(2) a recognized creed and form of worship; \n(3) a definite and distinct ecclesiastical government; \n(4) a formal code of doctrine and discipline;  \n(5) a distinct religious history; \n(6) a membership not associated with any church or denomination; \n(7) an organization of ordained ministers;  \n(8) ordained ministers selected after completing prescribed studies; \n(9) a literature of its own; \n(10) established places of worship; \n(11) regular congregations; \n(12) regular religious services; \n(13) Sunday schools for the religious instruction of the young; and \n(14) schools for the preparation of its ministers. \nId.    \n \nIn 26 C.F.R. § 1.6033-2(h), the Treasury Regulations provide a 3-factor test to determine whether a group \nis an “integrated auxiliary” under section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code.  According to \nthe Treasury Regulation, the term “integrated auxiliary of a church” means an “organization that is: (i) \n[d]escribed in both sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a)(1), (2), or (3);  (ii) [a]ffiliated with a church or a \nconvention or association of churches; and (iii) [i]nternally supported.”  26 C.F.R. § 1.6033-2(h)(1). \n \nAn organization is “internally supported” for purposes of subparagraph (h)(1)(iii), above, of this section, \nunless it both,   \n(i) Offers admissions, goods, services or facilities for sale, other than on \nan incidental basis, to the general public (except goods, services, or facilities sold \nat a nominal charge or for an insubstantial portion of the cost); and   \n34 \n \n\nThe 2013 final rules’ amendments to the religious employer exemption apply to group \nhealth plans and group health insurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after August 1, \n2013.  See id. at 39,871. \nb.  The 2013 Final Rules’ “Accommodation”  \n \nThe 2013 final rules establish regulations regarding the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement for group health plans established or maintained by “eligible organizations.”  78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,875-80; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). \nAn “eligible organization” is an organization that satisfies the following criteria: \n(1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any \ncontraceptive services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on \naccount of religious objections. \n \n(2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity. \n \n(3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization. \n \n(4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by the \nSecretary, that it satisfies the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of \nthis section, and makes such self-certification available for examination \nupon request by the first day of the first plan year to which the \naccommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(ii) Normally receives more than 50 percent of its support from a \ncombination of governmental sources, public solicitation of contributions, and \nreceipts from the sale of admissions, goods, performance of services, or \nfurnishing of facilities in activities that are not unrelated trades or businesses.  \n \nAn entity’s eligibility for exemption as a religious employer is determined on an employer-by-employer \nbasis.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,886.  \n \nAn entity that offers a health plan to its employees that is administered by a qualified religious employer \nmust independently qualify for the religious employer exemption to be exempt.  78 Fed. Reg. 39,886; see \nalso 78 Fed. Reg. at 8456, 8463. \n \n35 \n \n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874-75.  The 2013 final rules state that an \neligible organization is not required “to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive \ncoverage” to which it has religious objections.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874. \nTo be relieved of the obligations that otherwise apply to non-grandfathered, non-exempt \nemployers, the 2013 final rules require that an eligible organization complete a self-certification \nform, certifying that it is an eligible organization, sign the form, and provide a copy of that self-\ncertification to its insurer or TPA.  Id. at 39,878-79. \nFor self-insured organizations, the self-certification “will afford the [TPA] notice of [its] \nobligations” under the 2013 final rules, “and will be treated as a designation of the third party \nadministrator(s) as plan administrator and claims administrator for contraceptive benefits \npursuant to section 3(16) of ERISA.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,879.  Section 3(16) of ERISA provides \nthe definition of “administrator” under ERISA.  29 U.S.C. § 1002(16). \nUnder the 2013 final rules, in the case of an eligible organization with a self-insured \ngroup health plan, the organization’s TPA, upon receipt of the self-certification, will provide or \narrange separate payments for contraceptive services for participants and beneficiaries in the plan \nwithout cost-sharing, premium, fee, or other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries, or to the  \neligible organization or its plan.  See id. at 39,879-80; 26 C.F.R. § 54.9816-2713A(b)(2), (c)(2).   \nUnder the 2013 final rules, costs incurred by TPAs relating to the coverage of Preventive \nServices for employees of eligible organizations will be reimbursed through an adjustment to \nFederally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) user fees.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880.  The payments for \nPreventive Services required by the challenged regulations applicable to employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance plans are available to an employee only while the employee is on an \norganization’s health plan.  29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B). \n36 \n \n\nSelf-insured religious employers and eligible organizations are prohibited from “directly \nor indirectly, seek[ing] to influence the[ir] third party administrator’s decision” to provide or \nprocure Preventive Services.  26 C.F.R. § 54.9815–2713. \nThe 2013 final rules’ “accommodation” applies to group health plans and health \ninsurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.  See id. at 39,872. \n \nIV.  Summation of Findings of Fact  \n  Based upon testimony presented at the Injunction Hearing, credibility determinations of \nthe witnesses by this Court, and the sum of evidence presented in various forms, the Court finds \nin summary that:  \n(1) Plaintiffs hold sincerely to the religious beliefs of the Catholic faith that:  \n      (a) human life is sacred from conception to natural death;  \n      (b) worship, faith, and good works are essential and integral to the practice \n            of Catholicism (“faith without good works is dead”); and  \n      (c) the facilitation of evil is as morally odious as the proliferation of evil.  \n(2) Plaintiffs will refuse to provide, directly or indirectly, employee health \ninsurance coverage for contraceptive products, services, or counseling, because doing so \nwould violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs.  \n(3) The nonprofit, religious affiliated/related Plaintiffs (Catholic Charities, St. \nMartin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic) will not complete the self-\ncertification form.  These Plaintiffs will partake in this act of civil disobedience because \nto do otherwise – meaning signing the self-certification form – will initiate (“cause a \nprocess of action to begin”) and facilitate coverage of contraceptive products, services, \n37 \n \n\nand counseling by a TPA or health insurer.  The act of signing the self-certification form \nwill violate these Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held religious beliefs.  Hearing Transcript, \nNovember 13, 2013, pg. 54, lines 23-25, pg. 55, lines 1-9.  Further, the Bishops will \ndirect these Plaintiffs not to complete the self-certification form.  Hearing Testimony, \nBishop Zubik, pg. 43, lines 2-10; Hearing Testimony, Bishop Persico, pg. 80, lines 1-8, \npg. 82, lines 14-16, pg. 91, lines 7-9.     \n(4) The nonprofit, religious affiliated/related Plaintiffs will be subject to \nsubstantial fines/penalties/“taxes” and other coercive governmental sanctions.  \n(5) The effect of the imposition of these fines/penalties/“taxes” will gravely \nimpact Plaintiffs’ spiritual, charitable, and educational activities, and the individuals who \nrely on the Catholic Church’s nonprofit, religious affiliated/related organizations for the \nbasic needs of food, shelter, and education, as well as other charitable programs.  \nCardinal Dolan Deposition, (13-cv-303, Doc. No. 52; 13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 53), pg. 29, \nlines 5-21.  The fines/penalties/“taxes” also will negatively affect Plaintiffs’ financial \nsituation as donors to these spiritual/charitable/educational organizations may not wish to \ndonate funds when the funds could be diverted to the Government in the form of \nfines/penalties/“taxes.”  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \n\nV.  Conclusions of Law  \n \nA.  Overview \n \nAs far as this Court is aware, the facts presented by these two cases make them one of \nfirst-impression.  As of this writing, no appellate court has rendered a decision on the merits of a \nnon-secular, nonprofit organization’s rights under the RFRA, as impacted by the ACA’s \ncontraceptive mandate, and the “religious employer exemption” and “accommodation” which \nrelate to that mandate.18   \nIn reaching its decision in these two cases, this Court has found the recent decisions \npertaining to secular, for-profit organizations to be instructive.  See Korte v. Sebelius, --- F.3d ---, \n2013 WL 5960692 (7th Cir.  Nov. 8, 2013) (granting preliminary injunction to secular, for-profit \ncorporations finding them to be “persons” who could assert claims under the RFRA alleging that \nthe ACA’s contraceptive mandate placed substantial burden on their exercise of religion); \n                                                           \n18  In Liberty University, Inc. v. Lew, 733 F.3d 72 (4th Cir. 2013), the Court of Appeals upheld the \nconstitutionality of two provisions of the ACA – the “individual mandate,” which requires individuals to \npurchase a minimum level of health insurance coverage, and the “employer mandate,” which requires \ncertain employers to offer such coverage to their employees and their dependents.  Following a remand by \nthe United States Supreme Court, and while on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, \nLiberty University, for the first time, challenged as abortifacients all forms of FDA-approved \ncontraception that “may act after fertilization,” including emergency contraceptive pills and intra-uterine \ndevices.  733 F3.d at 103.  Because this claim had never been raised before, the Court of Appeals refused \nto “consider an issue not passed upon below” and declined to rule on the merits of this claim.  Id.  Thus, \nassuming Liberty University is a non-secular, nonprofit educational institution, the appellate court did not \nreach the merits of its “contraceptive mandate” claim.  \nThe Court further notes that there are other United States District Courts addressing whether the \ncontraceptive mandate applies to non-secular, nonprofit organizations via the “accommodation.”  See, i.e., \nGeneva College v. Sebelius, --- F.Supp.2d ----, 2013 WL 3071481 (W.D. Pa. June 18, 2013) (granting \npreliminary injunction preliminary injunction to religious college, protecting it from complying the \nACA’s contraceptive mandate), notice of appeal filed, United States Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit, Case Number 13-2814; and the recently re-opened East Texas Baptist University v. Sebelius, \nCivil Action No. H–12–3009 (S.D. Tex). \n39 \n \n\nGilardi v. U.S. Dept. Health and Human Services, --- F.3d ----, 2013 WL 5854246 (C.A. D.C. \nNov. 1, 2013) (holding secular, for-profit entity was not a “person” capable of religious exercise, \nbut individual owners were); Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation v. Secretary of U.S. Dept. \nof Health and Human Services, 724 F.3d 377 (3d Cir. July 26, 2013) (a secular, for-profit \ncorporation could not assert claim under Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment); and Hobby \nLobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. June 27, 2013) (in moving for a \npreliminary injunction, secular, for-profit corporations showed a substantial likelihood of success \non the merits as to the substantial-burden element of their claim under the RFRA).  \nThe Court begins its analysis by considering the four criteria Plaintiffs must prove in \norder to obtain a preliminary injunction.   \n \nB.  Preliminary Injunction Test   \nThe primary purpose of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the status quo until a \ndecision on the merits of the case is rendered.  University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, \n395 (1981).  “Given this limited purpose, and given the haste that is often necessary if those \npositions are to be preserved, a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of \nprocedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits.” \nId.   \n “Four factors determine whether a preliminary injunction is appropriate: ‘(1) whether the \nmovant has a reasonable probability of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant will be \nirreparably harmed by denying the injunction; (3) whether there will be greater harm to the \nnonmoving party if the injunction is granted; and (4) whether granting the injunction is in the \npublic interest.’” B.H. ex rel. Hawk v. Easton Area School Dist., 725 F.3d 293, 301-2 (3d Cir. \n40 \n \n\n2013) (quoting Sypniewski v. Warren Hills Reg’l Bd. of Educ., 307 F.3d 243, 252 (3d Cir. 2002) \nquoting Highmark, Inc. v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 276 F.3d 160, 170 (3d Cir. 2001)).  \n“A plaintiff seeking an injunction must meet all four criteria, as ‘[a] plaintiff’s failure to \nestablish any element in its favor renders a preliminary injunction inappropriate.’” Conestoga \nWood Specialties Corp. v. Secretary of U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Svcs., 724 F.3d 377, 382 \n(3d Cir. 2013) (quoting NutraSweet Co. v. Vit–Mar Enters., Inc., 176 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir. \n1999)); accord, Duraco Products, Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enterprises, Ltd., 40 F.3d 1431, 1438 (3d \nCir. 1994) ( “The injunction should issue only if the plaintiff produces evidence sufficient to \nconvince the district court that all four factors favor preliminary relief.”). \nAs to the first criterion, the movant bears the burden of proving a reasonable probability \nof success on the merits.  “[O]n an application for preliminary injunction, the plaintiff need only \nprove a prima facie case, not a certainty that he or she will win.”  Highmark, Inc., 276 F.3d at \n173, citing 11A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL \nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2948.3 (Civil 2d ed. 1995). \nThe second criterion requires the movant prove that “irreparable injury is likely in the \nabsence of an injunction” – the mere “possibility” of such irreparable harm “is too lenient.”  \nWinter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “While the burden \nrests upon the moving party to make these [first] two requisite showings, the district court \n‘should take into account, when they are relevant, (3) the possibility of harm to other interested \npersons from the grant or denial of the injunction, and (4) the public interest.’” Acierno v. New \nCastle County, 40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994), quoting Delaware River Port Auth. v. \nTransamerican Trailer Transp., Inc., 501 F.2d 917, 919–20 (3d Cir. 1974) (footnote omitted).  \n41 \n \n\nIn order to satisfy the third criterion, this Court must find “that the party seeking the \ninjunction would suffer more harm without the injunction than would the enjoined party if it \nwere granted.”  Pittsburgh Newspaper Printing Pressmen’s Union No. 9 v. Pittsburgh Press Co.  \n479 F.2d 607, 609 -610 (3d Cir. 1973).   In Winter, the Supreme Court of the United States noted \nthat although it did “not question the seriousness of [the movant’s] interests, . . . the balance of \nthe equities and consideration of the overall public interest in this case tip[ped] strongly in favor \nof the [non-moving party].”  555 U.S. at 26.  Thus, this criterion requires this Court to employ a \nbalancing test that compares the harms the movant and non-movant would suffer and then \nweighs them to discern which party would be more greatly harmed by the Court’s grant or denial \nof the injunction.  \nThe fourth and final criterion is closely tied to the third in that it requires this Court to \ndetermine if the public’s interest will be furthered or harmed by the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction.  See Trefelner ex rel. Trefelner v. Burrell School Dist., 655 F.Supp.2d 581, 597-8 \n(W.D. Pa. 2009) (“With regard to the public interest prong, the court finds that granting the \ntemporary restraining order is in the public interest.  The focus of this prong is ‘whether there are \npolicy considerations that bear on whether the order should issue,’” citing 11A CHARLES ALAN \nWRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE § 2948.4 (Civil 2d ed. 1995)). “‘The grant or \ndenial of a preliminary injunction is committed to the sound discretion of the district judge, who \nmust balance all of these factors in making a decision.’”  Spartacus, Inc. v. Borough of McKees \nRocks, 694 F.2d 947, 949 (3d Cir. 1982), quoting Penn Galvanizing Co. v. Lukens Steel Co., 468 \nF.2d 1021, 1023 (3d Cir. 1972).   \n  Turning to the instant matter, Plaintiffs in these cases have requested that this Court grant \nthem a preliminary injunction, arguing that the ACA and the religious employer \n42 \n \n\n“accommodation,” which requires them to facilitate/initiate compliance with the contraceptive \nmandate, violates their rights under the RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause of the First \nAmendment. \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n \na.  Background  \nPlaintiffs’ Motions for Expedited Preliminary Injunction ask this Court to enjoin the \nissuance, application, and enforcement of a federal regulation, specifically 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv), arguing that they are likely to succeed on their RFRA and First Amendment  \nclaims. 13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 4; 13-cv-303, Doc. No. 6.   \nAs noted in Section “III. B. 2.” above, 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) is the regulation that \nallows HRSA to “establish exemptions” from group health plans maintained by “religious \nemployers” with respect “to any requirement to cover contraceptive services[.]”  See 45 C.F.R.    \n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(A); see also Gilardi, supra, 2013 WL 5854246, *1 (C.A. D.C. Nov. 1, \n2013).  \nAfter receiving hundreds of thousands of comments from the public, including religious \nindividuals and entities, concerning the definition of “religious employer” for the benefit of \nreceiving an “exemption” from the contraceptive mandate, the “final rule” promulgated by \nHRSA defined a “religious employer” as “an organization that is organized and operates as a \nnonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue \nCode . . . .”  45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a).  \n  Again, as noted in Section “III. B. 2.” above, the nonprofit entities included in the \nrelevant portion of Section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code are:   \n43 \n \n\n(i) churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations \nof churches,  \n*  *  * \n(iii) the exclusively religious activities of any religious order. \n \n26 U.S.C.A. § 6033(a)(3)(A).   \nGiven this description, Plaintiffs in the instant cases (the nonprofit, religious \naffiliated/related entities) fail to meet the definition of a “religious employer” entitled to the \n“exemption.”  As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted in Korte:  \nThe religious-employer exemption did not leave room for the \nconscientious religious objectors other than houses of worship, their \nintegrated affiliate organizations, and religious orders acting as such.  In \nother words the definition of ‘religious employer’ was so circumscribed \nthat it left out religious colleges and universities; religious hospitals and \nclinics; religious charities and social-service organizations; other faith-\nbased nonprofits; and for-profit, closely held businesses managed in \naccordance with a religious mission or creed. \n \nKorte, 2013 WL 5960692, *3.  Plaintiffs in the instant cases are akin to the Korte plaintiffs in \nthat the instant Plaintiffs are entities to which the religious employer “exemption” does not \napply.  If HRSA had stopped here, non-secular, nonprofit entities such as Plaintiffs would have \nbeen required to directly provide for contraceptive products, services, and counseling pursuant to \nthe contraceptive mandate.   \nHowever, in response to concerns that the application of the religious employer \n“exemption” was too narrow, and instead of broadening the “exemption,” a second regulation \nwas enacted that allowed for non-secular, nonprofit employers to receive an “accommodation,” \nwhereby these entities could self-certify that they were “eligible organizations” and thereby \navoid directly providing contraceptive products, services, and counseling.    \nAs noted above, this “accommodation” is limited to “eligible organizations” which:      \n(1) oppose providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services required to be \n44 \n \n\ncovered under the contraceptive mandate “on account of religious objections[;]” (2) are \norganized and operate as a nonprofit entity; (3) hold themselves out as a religious organization; \nand (4) “self-certify,” in a form and manner specified by the Secretary, that it satisfies the criteria \nin (1) through (3) above.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874-75.  “The \nself-certification must be executed by a person authorized to make the certification on behalf of \nthe organization, and must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention \nrequirements under section 107 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.”  Id. \n    Since the non-secular, nonprofit Plaintiffs in the instant cases meet the first three criteria \nof the “accommodation,” they need to “self-certify,” as required by the fourth criterion, to be \ndeemed an “eligible organization” and thus, entitled to obtain the religious employer \n“accommodation.”   It is the fourth criterion of the religious employer “accommodation” which \nPlaintiffs contend violates their rights under the RFRA and the First Amendment.19   \nIn order to qualify for the religious employer “accommodation,” and thus avoid directly \nproviding or paying for contraceptive products, services, and counseling through their own \nhealth plans, Plaintiffs in these cases must self-certify that they: (1) oppose providing such \ncontraceptive coverage on account of their religious objections; (2) are organized and operate as \nnonprofit entities; and (3) hold themselves out as a religious organization.  This Court found as \nfact that Plaintiffs’ self-certification forms must be executed by the Bishop of Pittsburgh (with \nrespect to the Pittsburgh Plaintiffs in 13-cv-1459) and by the Bishop for the Diocese of Erie \n(with respect to the Erie Plaintiffs in 13-cv-303), or at their directive. \n                                                           \n19 Notably, subpart “(c)” of same regulation provides that entities who meet all four criteria, thereby \nentitles them to an “accommodation,” and will not have to pay for the contraceptive products, services, \nand counseling.  A third party will.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c). \n45 \n \n\nb.  Substantial Burden20 under RFRA   \ni.  The RFRA \nPlaintiffs assert that by requiring self-certification and thereby facilitating or initiating the \nprocess of providing contraceptive products, services, and counseling, via a third party, the \n“accommodation,” violates their rights under the RFRA.   \nThe RFRA provides, in pertinent part, as follows:  \na) In general \n \nGovernment shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of \nreligion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, \nexcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section. \n \n(b) Exception \n \nGovernment may substantially burden a person’s exercise of \nreligion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the \nperson-- \n \n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and  \n \n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n \n42 U.S.C.A. § 2000bb-1.   \nAs noted by the Government, under the “substantial burden test,” this Court must look to \nwhat is meant by “substantial burden” under the RFRA.  As the Court of Appeals for the Seventh \nCircuit recently noted in Korte, “[a]t a minimum, a substantial burden exists when the \ngovernment compels a religious person to ‘perform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental \ntenets of [his] religious beliefs.’”  2013 WL 5960692 at *22, citing Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. \n205, 218 (1972).  Korte further instructs that “a burden on religious exercise also arises when the \n                                                           \n20 The Government declined to stipulate to the “substantial burden” portion of this test.  13-cv-303, Doc. \nNo. 30, 4; 13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 25, 4.   \n46 \n \n\ngovernment ‘put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his \nbeliefs.’” Id., citing Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Division, 450 U.S. 707, \n718 (1981).  “An inconsequential or de minimis burden on religious practice does not rise to this \nlevel, nor does a burden on activity unimportant to the adherent’s religious scheme.” \nKaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718 \n(1981)).  \nThe Government argues that the “accommodation” merely requires the Pittsburgh and \nErie Bishops (or their designees) to sign the self-certification form on behalf of their respective \nnonprofit, religious affiliated/related entities, and does not rise to the level of a “substantial \nburden,” as that term has been defined in connection with the RFRA.  The Government argues \nthat any impact on Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held religious beliefs created by Plaintiffs’ self-\ncertification is too attenuated to rise to the level of creating a substantial burden on Plaintiffs. \nThe Government acknowledges that the act of self-certification will require the Plaintiff-\nentities to sign the self-certification and supply a third party with the names of the Plaintiffs’ \nrespective employees so that the third-party may provide (and/or pay for) contraceptive products, \nservices, and counseling.  The Government also concedes that Plaintiffs have sincerely-held \nreligious beliefs with respect to: (1) the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death; \n(2) unity of worship, faith, and good works (“faith without good works is dead”); and (3) the \nfacilitation of evil is as morally odious as the proliferation of evil.   \nGiven these concessions, the Court disagrees with the Government that Plaintiffs’ ability \nor inability to “merely sign a piece of paper,” and thus comport with the “accommodation,” is all \nthat is at issue here.  Again, as stated by the Court of Appeals in Korte:  \n47 \n \n\n. . . the test for substantial burden does not ask whether the claimant has \ncorrectly interpreted his religious obligations. See Lee, 455 U.S. at 257; \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 715–16.  Indeed, that inquiry is prohibited.  “[I]n this \nsensitive area, it is not within the judicial function and judicial competence \nto inquire whether the [adherent has] . . . correctly perceived the \ncommands of [his] . . . faith.  Courts are not arbiters of scriptural \ninterpretation.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716.  It is enough that the claimant \nhas an “honest conviction” that what the government is requiring, \nprohibiting, or pressuring him to do conflicts with his religion. \n \nKorte at *22.   \nHere, the issue is whether Plaintiffs, being non-secular in nature, are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of proving that their right to freely exercise their religion has been substantially \nburdened by the “accommodation” which requires the Bishops of two separate Dioceses (or their \ndesignees) to sign a form which thereby facilitates/initiates the provision of contraceptive \nproducts, services, and counseling.  \nii.  The “Accommodation” Creates a New Substantial \nBurden \n  \nThe Government contends that the affirmative acts of: (1) signing the self-certification \nform stating Plaintiffs’ religious objections; (2) compiling a list of Plaintiffs’ employees; and \n(3) providing those items to the health insurer or TPA, does not place a substantial burden on \nPlaintiffs.  The Government further argues that these same acts have been undertaken by \nPlaintiffs in the past.  In response, Plaintiffs concede that they have provided similar information \nin the past to their TPA, and that the physical acts themselves are not onerous.  However, in the \npast, such actions barred the provision of contraceptive products, services, or counseling.  Now, \nthis type of information previously submitted to an insurer or TPA will be used to \nfacilitate/initiate the provision of contraceptive products, services, or counseling – in direct \ncontravention to their religious tenets.   \n48 \n \n\nPlaintiffs liken this result by analogy to a neighbor who asks to borrow a knife to cut \nsomething on the barbecue grill, and the request is easily granted.  The next day, the same \nneighbor requests a knife to kill someone, and the request is refused.  It is the reason the \nneighbor requests the knife which makes it impossible for the lender to provide it on the second \nday.   \nThe same is true here.  In all prior instances where the Government, an insurer, or a TPA \nhas requested employee names or other information from Plaintiffs, the reason the information \nwas sought was of no moment to Plaintiffs.  Now, under the “accommodation,” the reason the \ndocumentation is required is so that contraceptive products, services, and counseling can be \nprovided in direct contravention of Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held religious beliefs.  The Government \nis asking Plaintiffs for documentation for what Plaintiffs sincerely believe is an immoral purpose, \nand thus, they cannot provide it.   \nIn sum, although the “accommodation” legally enables Plaintiffs to avoid directly paying \nfor the portion of the health plan that provides contraceptive products, services, and counseling, \nthe “accommodation” requires them to shift the responsibility of purchasing insurance and \nproviding contraceptive products, services, and counseling, onto a secular source.  The Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have a sincerely-held belief that “shifting responsibility” does not \nabsolve or exonerate them from the moral turpitude created by the “accommodation”; to the \ncontrary, it still substantially burdens their sincerely-held religious beliefs. \niii. The “Accommodation” and the “Exemption” Divide   \nthe Catholic Church which Creates a Substantial \nBurden \n \nThe Government, by enacting the religious employer “exemption,” allowed certain \nreligious employers (i.e., the Dioceses and “houses of worship”) to freely exercise the religious \n49 \n \n\nbelief that “contraception violates the sanctity of human life,” by completely exempting them \nfrom the contraceptive mandate.  Thus, the “exempt” religious employers do not have to directly \nprovide contraceptive products, services, and counseling through their own health plans, nor do \nthey have to provide a list of their employees to a third party and thereby indirectly provide \ncontraceptive products, services, and counseling through that same third party.  However, the \nreligious employer “accommodation” separates the “good works (faith in action) employers” \nfrom the “houses of worship employers” within the Catholic Church by refusing to allow the \n“good works employers” the same burden-free exercise of their religion.   \nUnder the “accommodation,” Plaintiffs here (i.e., the “good works (faith in action) \nemployers”) will be forced to facilitate/initiate the provision of contraceptive products, services, \nand counseling, through a third party, despite the fact that the sincerity of their religious beliefs – \n“contraception violates the sanctity of human life” and “facilitation of evil is as morally odious \nas the proliferation of evil” – are not in question.   \nSimply put, the Court is constrained to understand why all religious employers who share \nthe same religious tenets – (1) the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death; \n(2) unity of worship, faith, and good works (“faith without good works is dead”); and (3) the \nfacilitation of evil is as morally odious as the proliferation of evil – are not exempt; or \nconversely, why all religious employers do not fall within the confines of the “accommodation.”  \nThe Court made the factual determination that Plaintiffs sincerely believe that the “good works, \nor faith-in-action” arms of the Catholic Church implement a core and germane guiding principle \nin the exercise of their religious beliefs.  Why should religious employers who provide the \ncharitable and educational services of the Catholic Church be required to facilitate/initiate the \n50 \n \n\nprovision of contraceptive products, services, and counseling, through their health insurers or \nTPAs, when religious employers who operate the houses of worship do not?  \nTo this question, the Government does not provide a direct answer.  Rather, the \nGovernment takes the position that Plaintiffs cannot use the RFRA as a sword to prevent the \nGovernment from creating “alternate mechanisms” to essentially protect the rights of employees \nand to make sure that they are receiving the mandated health services.  However, the \nGovernment, through its “exemption” regulation, allows the religious employers who operate the \nhouses of worship to do just that, while denying the same benefit to the religious employers who \noperate on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Catholic Church.  \nWhat this Court finds equally problematic with the Government’s position is that the \nBishops of these two Dioceses may freely exercise those same three religious tenets referred to \nabove, as long as they espouse them within the confines of a “house of worship.”  When they \nprovide health insurance for the employees who work for the houses of worship, they are not in \nany moral danger of directly or indirectly providing contraceptive products, services, and \ncounseling.  However, these same two individuals, as the spiritual leaders for the Plaintiffs at \nissue in these cases, must personally take at least three affirmative actions (sign a self-\ncertification form, compile a list of employees, and provide these to an insurer or TPA) in order \nto escape directly providing contraceptive products, services, and counseling to the employees of \nthe charitable and educational agencies, while knowingly facilitating/initiating the process for the \nprovision of contraceptive services, products, and counseling through a third party.  The Bishops, \ngiven their three sincerely-held religious beliefs, while wearing their “house-of-worship” hats, \nare not in any moral peril; yet, when they wear their “head-of-the-‘good works’-agencies” hats, \n51 \n \n\nthey must take affirmative actions which facilitate/initiate the provision of contraceptive \nproducts, services, and counseling in violation of their religious tenets.    \nThus, the practical application of the two distinct regulations (one an “exemption” and \none an “accommodation”) allows the same members of the same religion to completely adhere to \ntheir religious beliefs at times (when the “exemption” applies), while other times, forces them to \nviolate those beliefs (when the “accommodation” applies).  Stated another way, even though \nPlaintiffs here share identical, religious beliefs, and even though they share the same persons as \nthe religious heads of their organizations, the heads of Plaintiffs’ service organizations may not \nfully exercise their right to those specific beliefs, when acting as the heads of the charitable and \neducational arms of the Church.  The Court finds this enigmatic.    \nFurthermore, the Court is constrained to understand why religious employers such as \nCatholic Charities and Prince of Peace Center– which were borne from the same religious faith, \nand premised upon the same religious tenets and principles, and operate as extensions and \nembodiments of the Church, but are not subsidiaries of a parent corporation – would not be \ntreated the same as the Church itself with respect to the free exercise of that religion.  If the \ncontraceptive mandate creates such a substantial burden on the Dioceses’ exercise of religion so \nas to require the religious employer “exemption,” the contraceptive mandate obviously creates \nthe same substantial burden on the nonprofit, religious affiliated/related organizations like \nPlaintiffs (i.e., Catholic Charities, Prince of Peace Center, et al.), which implement the “good \nworks” of the Dioceses. \nThe Court concludes that the religious employer “exemption” enables some religious \nemployers to completely eliminate the provision of contraceptive products, services, and \ncounseling through the Dioceses’ health plans and third parties; while the religious employer \n52 \n \n\n“accommodation” requires other religious employers (often times the same member with the \nsame sincerely-held beliefs) to take affirmative actions to facilitate/initiate the provision of  \ncontraceptive products, services, and counseling – albeit from a third-party.   \nThe application of these two regulations – one an exemption and one an accommodation \n– has the effect of dividing the Catholic Church into two separate entities.  Now, one regulation \n(the “exemption”) applies to the worship arm of the Catholic Church and thus applies to all of \nthose employees who work inside a church’s walls.  While the other regulation (the \n“accommodation”) applies to the “good works” arms of the Catholic Church, and thus applies to \nthose who stand on the church steps and pass out food and clothes to the needy.  The Court \nconcludes that by dividing the Catholic Church in such a manner with the enactment of these two \nregulations, the Government has created a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ right to freely \nexercise their religious beliefs. \niv. Conclusion re: Substantial Burden \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that the religious employer \n“accommodation” places a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ right to freely exercise their religion \n– specifically their right to not facilitate or initiate the provision of contraceptive products, \nservices, or counseling.  Thus, Plaintiffs have met their burden of proving that complying with \nthe “accommodation” provision of the contraceptive mandate is a substantial burden on their free \nexercise of religion. \nc.  Compelling Governmental Interest under the RFRA \n \nGiven that the Court has concluded (for purposes of these Motions for Expedited \nPreliminary Injunction) that the “accommodation” places a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ free \nexercise of religion under the RFRA, the Court will now consider whether the RFRA’s exception \n53 \n \n\nhas been met.  Accordingly, the Court must determine whether the contraceptive mandate, as \napplied to Plaintiffs via the “accommodation”: (1) furthers a compelling governmental interest, \nand (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.  42 \nU.S.C.A. § 2000bb-1.   \nAs to the compelling interest test, the Court of Appeals in Korte stated: \nThe compelling-interest test generally requires a “high degree of \nnecessity.” Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. Ass’n, ––– U.S. ––––, ––––, 131 \nS.Ct. 2729, 2741, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011). The government must “identify \nan ‘actual problem’ in need of solving, and the curtailment of [the right] \nmust be actually necessary to the solution.” Id. at 2738 (citations omitted). \nIn the free-exercise context, “only those interests of the highest order and \nthose not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free \nexercise of religion.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215. “[I]n this highly sensitive \nconstitutional area, only the gravest abuses, endangering paramount \ninterests, give occasion for permissible limitation . . . .” Sherbert, 374 U.S. \nat 406 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). The regulated \nconduct must “pose[ ] some substantial threat to public safety, peace[,] or \norder.”  Id. at 403. Finally, “a law cannot be regarded as protecting an \ninterest of the highest order . . .  when it leaves appreciable damage to that \nsupposedly vital interest unprohibited.”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 547 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n \nKorte, 2013 WL 5960692, *25. \nThe “compelling governmental interests” identified by the Government in this case are \ntwo-fold: (1) “the promotion of public health,” and (2) “assuring that women have equal access \nto health care services.”  13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 23, 20-21; 13-cv-303, Doc. No. 28, 20.  \nWhile the Court agrees that these two interests are certainly important governmental \ninterests, the Court concludes that these two interests, as so broadly stated,21 are not “of the \n                                                           \n21  This Court further notes that, the Court of Appeals in Korte took great offense to the Government’s \nidentification of its two “compelling” interests stating:  \n \nThe government identifies two public interests—“public health” and “gender equality”—\nand argues that the contraception mandate furthers these interests by reducing unintended \npregnancies, achieving greater parity in health-care costs, and promoting the autonomy of \n54 \n \n\nhighest order” such that “those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free \nexercise of religion.”  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215.   \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court first notes that the existence of a religious \nemployer “exemption” is an acknowledgment of the lack of a compelling governmental interest \nas to religious employers who hire employees for their “houses of worship.”  Simply put, as \nstated more fully above, the religious employers who qualify for the “exemption” do not have to \ndirectly provide, nor indirectly facilitate/initiate, the provision of any contraceptive products, \nservices, and counseling.  At a minimum, the existence of the “exemption” is an indication that \nthe Government found its compelling interests to (1) promote public health, and (2) assure that \nwomen would have equal access to health care services, could not “overbalance the legitimate \nclaims to the free exercise of religion” asserted by some religious employers – i.e., the houses of \nworship.  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215; see also Geneva College, 2013 WL 3071481 at *10. \nThus, the Government’s argument that its two stated compelling interests will not \noverbalance the exact same legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion (at times being \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nwomen both economically and in their reproductive capacities.  This argument seriously \nmisunderstands strict scrutiny.  By stating the public interests so generally, the \ngovernment guarantees that the mandate will flunk the test.  Strict scrutiny requires a \nsubstantial congruity—a close “fit”—between the governmental interest and the means \nchosen to further that interest.  Stating the governmental interests at such a high level of \ngenerality makes it impossible to show that the mandate is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering them.  There are many ways to promote public health and gender equality, \nalmost all of them less burdensome on religious liberty.  Other Courts have deemed these \nto be too broad to be held to be compelling.   \n \n2013 WL 5960692 at *25.   \n \nSee also Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita, 546 U.S. 418, 420 (2006) in which the Supreme Court of \nthe United States held that Courts must look beyond “broadly formulated interests” justifying the \napplication of Government mandates and scrutinize the asserted harm of granting specific \nexemptions to particular religious claimants.  Invocation of general characteristics “cannot carry \nthe day.”  Id.  \n \n55 \n \n\nraised by the same individuals – i.e., Bishop Zubik  in the Pittsburgh case 13-cv-1459) when \nasserted on behalf of a different religious affiliated/related employer fails.  If the Court were to \nconclude that the Government’s stated interests were sufficiently “compelling” to outweigh the \nlegitimate claims raised by the nonprofit, religious affiliated/related Plaintiffs, the net effect (as \nnoted above) would be to allow the Government to cleave the Catholic Church into two parts: \nworship, and service and “good works,” thereby entangling the Government in deciding what \ncomprises “religion.”  Accordingly, for purposes of reaching a decision on Plaintiffs’ Motions \nfor Expedited Preliminary Injunction, the Court refuses to conclude that the Government has \ncompelling interests which overbalance the legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion \nraised by the nonprofit, religious affiliated/related Plaintiffs.   \nThe Court also notes that the “exemption” itself (which dictates that certain religious \nemployers can legally decline to directly and indirectly facilitate the provision of contraceptive \nproducts, services, and counseling) was not predicated upon a “public health” basis to meet the \ntwo purported compelling interests.  Instead, a religious employer’s qualifications for the \n“exemption” is predicated upon the unrelated question of whether that religious employer files \nthe IRS Form 990.  45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) (August 1, 2013). \nIf there is no compelling governmental interest to apply the contraceptive mandate to the \nreligious employers who operate the “houses of worship,” then there can be no compelling \ngovernmental interest to apply (even in an indirect fashion) the contraceptive mandate to the \nreligious employers of the nonprofit, religious affiliated/related entities, like Plaintiffs in these \ncases.    \nDespite the fact that the Government contends this analysis is “perverse” (see 13-cv-\n1459, Doc. No. 29, 24), the only argument it offers to support its position is that “[h]ouses of \n56 \n \n\nworship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious \ngrounds are more likely than other employers, including organizations eligible for the \naccommodation [i.e., Plaintiffs in the instant cases], to employ people of the same faith who \nshare the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely to use contraceptive services \neven if such services were covered under their plan.”  The Court finds this statement speculative, \nand unsubstantiated by the record and, therefore, unpersuasive.   \nNext, the portions of the Administrative Record offered into evidence by the Government \nsuggest that “women who receive their health coverage through employers like plaintiffs would \nface negative health and other outcomes . . . .”  77 Fed. Reg. at 8728; 78 Fed. Reg., at 39, 887 \n(emphasis added).   Despite this assertion, the Government has failed to offer any testimony or \nother evidence during the Injunction Hearing to support the Government’s claim that employees \nof these Plaintiffs have, in fact, suffered in the past, or will in the future, any “negative health or \nother outcomes,” without the enforcement of the contraceptive mandate.  In fact, the evidence \nwas to the contrary.   \nFinally, as stated above, whether intended or not, the application of two distinct \nregulations (one providing a complete “exemption,” the other merely providing an \n“accommodation”) to religious employers who hold the same basic religious tenets unnecessarily \n– and in direct contravention to the RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \n– entangles the Government into determining what constitutes “religion.”  By having these two, \nseparate regulations “on the books,” the Government has essentially detached worship and faith \nfrom “good works” and has determined that a religious employer’s complete freedom to exercise \nreligion ends at the church doors.  Once outside the church doors, that employer’s religious \nbeliefs must take a back seat to the stated compelling governmental interests.  The Government \n57 \n \n\nthus seeks to restrict the Right to the Free Exercise of Religion set forth in the First Amendment \nto a Right of Worship only.   \n   For all of the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that the Government has failed, \nfactually and legally, to establish that its two stated governmental interests are “of the highest \norder” such that “those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free \nexercise of religion.”  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215.   \nd.  Least Restrictive Means under the RFRA \n \nGiven that Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that the “accommodation” creates \na substantial burden on their free exercise of religion, and given that the Government has failed \nto meet its burden of proving that it had a compelling interest to apply the contraceptive \nmandate, via the “accommodation,” to Plaintiffs, the Court need not consider whether the \n“accommodation” was the least restrictive means of meeting the stated compelling interests.  \nNevertheless, the Court also concludes that the Government failed to adduce evidence that \ndefinitively establishes that it used the least restrictive means to meet the stated compelling \ngovernment interests.  \nFirst, the Government proffers that the “accommodation” was not only the “least \nrestrictive means,” but the “only possible means” of furthering the two compelling governmental \ninterests to: (1) promote public health, and (2) assure that women would have equal access to \nhealth services.  The Government’s position is simply that this “accommodation” (i.e., the acts of \nsigning a self-certification form and gathering/delivering employee list(s) to their health insurer \nor TPA) was the “least” and the “only possible means,” of furthering the two stated compelling \ngovernmental interests. \n58 \n \n\nIf the Government is correct that the entire fundamental statutory scheme set forth in the \nACA will fail, without the participation in the contraceptive mandate by nonprofit, religious \naffiliated/related Plaintiffs and others like them (i.e., food pantries, homeless shelters, etc.), \nwhich operate under the authority of an already exempt religious body (i.e., Plaintiff Erie \nDiocese), then the foundation of the “statutory scheme” is certainly troubled.   \nUnder the RFRA, the “accommodation” must be the “least restrictive means” to further \nthe two stated compelling governmental interests.  The Government neither at the Injunction \nHearing, nor in the Administrative Record, offered any evidence concerning: (1) the identity of \nall other possible “least restrictive means” considered by the Government; (2) the analysis of \neach of the “means” to determine which was the “least” restrictive; (3) the identity of the \nperson(s) involved in the identification and evaluation of the alternative “means”; or \n(4) “evidence-based” analysis as to why the Government believes that the “accommodation” is \nthe “least restrictive means.”   \n  Instead, the Government argues that all the “accommodation” requires is a signature on a \npiece of paper.  Once the signed document is received by the insurer or TPA, the contraceptive \nproducts, services, and counseling will then be made part of the nonprofit, religious \naffiliated/related Plaintiffs’ health care plan at no cost to the Plaintiffs – except, of course, for the \nincalculable cost of the loss of their rights to freely exercise their religion.   \nAs noted throughout this Opinion, this Court has found that the Government conceded \nthat Plaintiffs’ beliefs are sincerely-held.  Despite these concessions, the Government trivializes \nthese sincerely-held beliefs of Plaintiffs throughout its Brief in Opposition, to wit, the \n“accommodation”: (1) “requires virtually nothing of Plaintiffs” (13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 23, 9-10; \n13-cv-303, Doc. No. 28, 9-10, 20); (2) “certainly does not require Plaintiffs to modify their \n59 \n \n\nbehavior in any meaningful way” (id.); (3) is “no more than a de minimis burden” (id.); (4) \nrequires Plaintiffs to “do next to nothing” (id.); and (5) Plaintiffs “need only fulfill the self-\ncertification requirement and provide the completed self-certification to their issuers and TPAs”  \n(13-cv-1459, Doc. No. 23, 21).  Further, there is nothing in the record to establish, or even hint, \nthat a broader “religious employer” exemption, to include Plaintiffs (i.e., Catholic Charities, \nPrince of Peace Center, et al.), would have any impact at all on “the entire statutory scheme.” \nDuring the Injunction Hearing, the Court specifically asked the Government about its \nstated compelling interests and the means it took to advance them.  The Government directed the \nCourt’s attention to a precise section of the Administrative Record which reads, in pertinent part: \nFifth, some commentators asserted that the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement [the contraceptive mandate] is not the least restrictive means \nof advancing those compelling interests, and proposed various alternatives \nto these regulations. All of these proposals were considered, and it was \ndetermined that they were not feasible and/or would not advance the \ngovernment’s compelling interests as effectively as the mechanisms \nestablished in these final regulations and the preventative services \ncoverage more generally.    \n \n78 Fed.Reg. 39888 (July 2, 2013).   \n  As to this “argument,” the Court first notes that it is not the commentators’ responsibility \nto draft the regulations employing the least restrictive means – that obligation rests with the \nGovernment.  Second, the regulation itself clearly announces that the alternatives to the current \nregulations – including the contraceptive mandate – would not advance the Government’s \ninterests “as effectively as” the contraceptive mandate and the “accommodation.”  Greater \nefficacy does not equate to the least restrictive means.   \nThus, the Court concludes that the Government failed to present any credible evidence \ntending to prove that it utilized the least restrictive means of advancing those interests.    \n60 \n \n\ne.  Conclusion – Likelihood of Success  \n \nAfter hearing the testimony of Cardinal Dolan, Bishop Zubik, Bishop Persico, and all of \nthe other witnesses for Plaintiffs, the Court made the factual determination that Plaintiffs possess \na sincerely-held belief that the burden imposed by the execution of the self-certification form is \nnot de minimis.  Plaintiffs sincerely believe that by signing the self-certification form, required \nby the “accommodation,” they will facilitate/initiate the provision of contraceptive products, \nservices, and counseling.  Plaintiffs also sincerely believe that this facilitation/initiation is no \ndifferent than if Plaintiffs directly provided those same products, services, and counseling.  The \nCourt concludes that the “accommodation,” in effect, causes these Plaintiffs to comply with the \ncontraceptive mandate which violates their sincerely-held religious beliefs – that “the sanctity of \nhuman life which begins at conception,” and “facilitation of evil is the same as proliferation of \nevil” – and thus, places a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ ability to exercise their religion.  The \nCourt also concludes that the Government has, thus far, in this litigation, failed to show these \nregulations meet a compelling governmental interest and are sufficiently narrowly-tailored to \nmeet those interests, and/or to demonstrate that the “accommodation” is the least restrictive \nmeans to meet those stated interests.    \nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \nthe merits, and thus, they have met the first element of the preliminary injunction test.   \n2.  Irreparable Harm to Plaintiffs  \n \n In the context of a preliminary injunction, irreparable harm is harm that cannot be \nadequately compensated at a later date in the ordinary course of litigation.  Acierno v. New \nCastle Cnty. 40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994) (In general, to show irreparable harm a plaintiff \nmust demonstrate potential harm which cannot be redressed by a legal or an equitable remedy \n61 \n \n\nfollowing a trial.)  The Supreme Court of the United States has held “[t]he loss of First \nAmendment freedoms,” which implicates the Free Exercise Clause as protected by the RFRA, \n“for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).   \nRecently, in a First Amendment-free speech case, the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit held that a ban preventing students in a school from exercising their right to \nfree speech, “unquestionably constitute[d] irreparable injury,” where “[a]n after-the-fact money \njudgment would hardly make up for their lost opportunity” to exercise their right to free speech.  \nB.H. ex rel. Hawk v. Easton Area School Dist., 725 F.3d 293, 323 (3d Cir. 2013).   \n  Turning to the instant matter, Plaintiffs need to decide by December 31, 2013, whether or \nnot to sign the self-certification form thereby by violating their sincerely-held religious beliefs.  \nPlaintiffs will not drop health coverage as of January 1, 2014, for their employees – because they \nbelieve that health care is a basic human right.

Lengwin (P-88), ¶ 34.  \nPlaintiffs cannot sign the self-certification form knowing that their signatures will \nfacilitate/initiate the provision of the contraceptive products, services, and counseling which \nviolate their sincerely-held beliefs.   \n  Plaintiffs also have provided credible testimony and evidence which support their \ncontentions that they will provide health coverage, but will conscientiously object to the \ncontraceptive mandate and the “accommodation” by refusing to sign the self-certification form, \nthereby potentially suffering financial penalties which would negatively impact those entities \n62 \n \n\nthat provide services to individuals who depend upon Plaintiffs for food, shelter, educational, and \nother basic services.  Hearing Testimony, Susan Rauscher, pg. 61, lines 17-18, pg. 62, lines 21-\n25; Hearing Testimony Father Jabo, pg. 99, lines 8-10; Hearing Testimony of Mary Maxwell, pg. \n115, lines 23-25; Declaration of Mary Maxwell (P-90), ¶ 20; Declaration of Father Scott Detisch, \nPh.D. (P-92), ¶ 32.  In addition, Plaintiffs’ failure to sign the self-certification form by December \n31, 2013, places them in a situation where they may be faced with enforcement proceedings such \nas liens on their property, and possible execution on those liens.   \nGiven the evidence presented by Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that the harm to \nPlaintiffs, and the ripple effect of that harm impacting members of the public who depend upon \nPlaintiffs for food, shelter, educational, and other basic services, is such that Plaintiffs could \nnever be adequately compensated at a later date in the ordinary course of this litigation.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes Plaintiffs stand to suffer irreparable harm if the injunction \nwere not granted.   \n3.  Greater Harm to the Government  \n \nConversely, the Court concludes that there will be no irreparable harm to the Government \nif the preliminary injunction is granted.22  In reaching this conclusion, the Court notes that \ndespite the Government’s two stated  interests: (1) “the promotion of public health,” and (2) \n“assuring that women have equal access to health care services”), any employers with fifty (50) \nor less employees do not have to provide their employees with any health care coverage at all.  \n26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2)(A).  In addition, religious employers who can meet the criteria for an \n“exemption” have to provide health coverage to their employees, but do not have to offer \n                                                           \n22 Plaintiffs seek narrowly-tailored injunctive relief – only as to one of the eight categories of preventive \nservices for women required by the ACA and its implementing regulations.  Additional Stipulations of \nFact, ¶¶ 15-17.   \n63 \n \n\ncontraceptive products, services, and counseling.  They do not have to “sign a form” thereby \nfacilitating/initiating the provision of contraceptive products, services, and counseling through a \nthird party.  Finally, there are “innumerable” employers who have “grandfathered” health \ncoverage plans which may or may not provide for all of the components required under the \nACA, including the contraceptive products, services, and counseling required by the \ncontraceptive mandate.   \nThe Court concludes that the combined nationwide total of all of those employers who \nfall within an exclusion, an exemption, or whose plans are “grandfathered” (approximately 100 \nmillion individuals are on “grandfathered” health plans) creates such an “underinclusiveness” \nwhich demonstrates that the Government will not be harmed in any significant way by the \nexclusion of these few Plaintiffs.  Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246, at * 13; Geneva College, 2013 \nWL 3071481, at * 10; Additional Stipulated Facts, ¶¶ 4, 6.  This conclusion again weighs in \nfavor of the Court granting a preliminary injunction, keeping the parties at status quo while the \nsignificant issues involved in these cases are resolved in a thoughtful and orderly manner.   \n4.  Public Interest  \n \nLastly, granting the preliminary injunction furthers the public interest.  As noted above, \nthe Court concludes that it is in the public interest to have the issues presented herein, considered \nin a thoughtful and orderly manner.  These issues include whether the Government will be \npermitted to sever the Catholic Church into two parts (i.e., worship and faith, and “good works”) \n– in other words, whether the Government will be successful in restricting the Right to the Free \nExercise of Religion as set forth in the First Amendment to a Right to Worship only.  This \nreflective consideration as to nonprofit, religious affiliated/related entities, including Plaintiffs, is \nall the more in the public interest, because the Free Exercise of Religion is a fundamental right.    \n64 \n \n\nThe public interest also is best served if Plaintiffs (non-profit, affiliated/related \norganizations) can continue to provide needed educational and social services, without the threat \nof substantial fines for non-compliance with the contraceptive mandate as imposed upon them \nvia the “accommodation.”  As previously noted, such fines would impede the provision of those \nservices to thousands of individuals who have no other means of obtaining necessary food, \nshelter, and other basic assistance.  Hearing Testimony of Mary Maxwell (re: St. Martin Center \nand Prince of Peace Center), pg. 115, lines 23-25 (fines “would be devastating for all of our \nclients, the poor - - these are single women, children.”) \n[I]t would be drastic if- if these fines had to be dealt with.  \n . . . [P]eople would lose jobs.  Our community in Erie counts on \nthe St. Martin Center.  It – it would be devastating for all \nconcerned, for our church.  It just – it – it isn’t something that we \ncould cope with.   \nId. at pg. 116, lines 5-10.  A preliminary injunction, preserving the status quo, prevents \nany reduction in those services and thus is in the best interests of the public.   \n \nVI.  Conclusion \nBased upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and cited legal \nauthority, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have met their burden of proving all four criteria of \nthe preliminary injunction test, and thus, for the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiffs’ Motions for \nExpedited Preliminary Injunction will be GRANTED.    \n              s/ Arthur J.

This case is a continuation of Plaintiffs’ prolonged fight for their religious \nfreedom.  Federal law (the “U.S. Government Mandate”) has required religious organizations \nsuch as Plaintiffs to provide services that violate their long-standing teachings on abortion and \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 2 of 59\n \nthe sanctity of human life by subsidizing, providing, and/or facilitating coverage for abortion-\ninducing drugs, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services (also \nreferred to herein as the “objectionable services”).   \n2.  In 2011, Defendants first issued regulations which violated Plaintiffs’ long and \nsincerely-held religious beliefs in an unprecedented manner.  Since issuing those regulations, \nthe Government has consistently promised that changes were coming and that these changes \nwould accommodate Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held religious beliefs. \n3.  Two years later, it is clear that these promises were empty words.  The \nGovernment ignored the views of religious organizations like Plaintiffs by promulgating a \nfinal rule that is more damaging than the initial regulations.   \n4.  Despite repeated promises to protect Plaintiffs’ religious freedom, the \nGovernment has chosen not to do so.  For example, after the Government issued its proposed \nrule, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh (the “Diocese of Pittsburgh”) submitted \nextensive public comments outlining how “the proposed rule continue[d] the surprising recent \ndetour into requiring religious objectors to fund or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, \ncontraception, sterilization, and related education and counseling.”   \n5.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh’s comments were bolstered by a report from a \nrenowned healthcare economist, whose report explained that “the accommodation will not \noperate as the Government claims it will” and that the scheme proposed by the Government \nwould result in religious organizations funding and/or facilitating coverage of the \nobjectionable services.  In its comments, the Diocese of Pittsburgh “offer[ed] two proposals \nthat could alleviate some or all of the issues raised in [its] comment[s.]”  These proposals \nwere ignored. \n  2   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 3 of 59\n \n6.  Despite the Diocese of Pittsburgh’s comments, over 400,000 additional public \ncomments, repeated requests from Church leaders, and repeated promises from the \nGovernment that it would fix the problem, the Government has not changed the core principle \nof the U.S. Government Mandate.  On June 28, 2013, the Government issued its Final Rule, \nwhich still requires Plaintiffs to subsidize and/or facilitate the provision of abortion-inducing \ndrugs, contraception, sterilization, and related education and counseling, in violation of their \nreligious beliefs.   \n7.  The Government, through the U.S. Government Mandate, is forcing Plaintiffs \nto violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs.  Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Inc. (“St. Martin \nCenter”), Prince of Peace Center, Inc. (“Prince of Peace Center”), and Erie Catholic \nPreparatory School are forced to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate.  Plaintiffs Most \nReverend Lawrence T. Persico (the “Bishop”) and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie (the \n“Diocese”) are forced to facilitate coverage of the objectionable services because the Diocese \nis the plan sponsor for the health insurance plans of Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of \nPeace Center, and Erie Catholic Preparatory School, as well as many other Diocesan-affiliated \nentities subject to the U.S. Government Mandate. \n8.  Not only is the Government continuing to attack Plaintiffs’ religious liberties, \nbut it waited right up until the expiration of the safe harbor to announce its Final Rule.   \nAlthough the Government extended the safe harbor until December 31, 2013, the Government \nstill is forcing parties such as Plaintiffs, on a highly-compressed schedule, to choose between \nviolating their faith, paying massive fines, or discontinuing their health plans for their \nemployees. \n  3   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 4 of 59\n \n9.  The Government’s violation of religious freedom is irreconcilable with the \nFirst Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), and other laws.  The Government has not demonstrated any \ncompelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to \nabortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception.  Nor has the Government \ndemonstrated that the U.S. Government Mandate is the least restrictive means of advancing \nany interest it has in increasing access to these services, which are already widely available \nand which the Government could make more widely available without conscripting Plaintiffs \nas vehicles for the dissemination of products and services to which they so strongly object.   \n10.  The Government cannot justify its decision to force Plaintiffs to provide, pay \nfor, and/or facilitate access to these services in violation of their sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the U.S. Government Mandate cannot \nlawfully be applied to Plaintiffs, an injunction barring its enforcement, and an order vacating \nthe U.S. Government Mandate. \nI.  PRELIMINARY MATTERS  \n11.  Plaintiff Bishop Lawrence T. Persico is Trustee for Plaintiff The Roman \nCatholic Diocese of Erie, a nonprofit Pennsylvania Charitable Trust with a principal place of \nadministration in Erie, Pennsylvania.  The Diocese is organized exclusively for charitable, \nreligious, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code.   \n12.  Plaintiff St. Martin Center is a nonprofit corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in Erie, Pennsylvania.  It is an affiliate corporation of Catholic Charities.  It is \norganized exclusively for charitable, religious, and educational purposes within the meaning \nof Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.   \n  4   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 5 of 59\n \n13.  Plaintiff Prince of Peace Center is a nonprofit corporation with its principal \nplace of business in Farrell, Pennsylvania.  It is an affiliate corporation of Catholic Charities.  \nIt is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, and educational purposes within the \nmeaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.      \n14.  Plaintiff Erie Catholic Preparatory School is a nonprofit corporation with its \nprincipal place of business in Erie, Pennsylvania.  It is organized exclusively for charitable, \nreligious, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code.   \n15.  Defendant Kathleen Sebelius is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services (“HHS”).  She is sued in her official capacity.   \n16.  Defendant Thomas Perez is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.  He \nis sued in his official capacity.  \n17.  Defendant Jacob J. Lew is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury.  He is sued in his official capacity.     \n18.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is an executive \nagency of the United States within the meaning of RFRA and the APA.   \n19.  Defendant U.S. Department of Labor is an executive agency of the United \nStates within the meaning of RFRA and the APA.   \n20.  Defendant U.S. Department of the Treasury is an executive agency of the \nUnited States within the meaning of RFRA and the APA.   \n21.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. \n  5   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 6 of 59\n \n22.  An actual, justiciable controversy currently exists between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants.  Absent a declaration resolving this controversy and the validity of the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs will be required to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to \nobjectionable products and services in contravention of their sincerely-held religious beliefs, \nas described below. \n23.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n24.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343(a)(4), and 1346(a)(2). \n25.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nB.  The Bishop, the Diocese, and the Diocesan Self-Insured Health Plan \n26.  The Diocese encompasses thirteen counties in Northwestern Pennsylvania. \n27.  The Diocese carries out its Christ-centered mission in three mains ways:  by \neducating children within the Diocese, by promoting spiritual growth, and through community \nservice.   \n28.  The Diocese operates thirty elementary schools, three middle schools, and six \nsecondary schools, which educate over 6,400 students.  The Diocese educates students of all \nreligions and offers tuition assistance for students who otherwise would have no alternative to \nthe public school system.  This determination is based solely on financial need.      \n29.  As for its role in promoting spiritual growth, the Diocese consists of 117 \nparishes serving a thirteen-county region, including a Catholic population of approximately \n187,500 people.  Geographically, it is the largest diocese in Pennsylvania.   \n30.  Bishop Persico publishes FAITH Magazine of the Catholic Diocese of Erie, the \nlargest family publication in Northwestern Pennsylvania.  FAITH Magazine is mailed to \n  6   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 7 of 59\n \napproximately 62,000 households in all thirteen counties of Northwestern Pennsylvania and \nfocuses on religious issues, but also on other international, national, and local news.  “The \nmagazine is designed to touch the hearts of people both within and outside of the faith.”  \nAbout Us, FAITH Magazine, available at http://www.eriercd.org/faithabout.asp.    \n31.  In addition to providing spiritual care to its Catholic residents through its \nparishes and providing education to Catholic and non-Catholic students, the Diocese serves \nmany more thousands of Northwestern Pennsylvania residents through its social service arms.   \n32.  Many Northwestern Pennsylvania residents are served by the Diocese’s prison \nministry, family ministry, disability ministry, international Diocesan missions, various respect \nlife organizations, pregnancy counseling services, work with new mothers, and the numerous \nsecular and religious charities that receive the Diocese’s financial support, including: \na)  St. Elizabeth Center, a food pantry, thrift store, and clothing shop for low-\nincome individuals; \nb)  The Good Samaritan Center, a shelter for homeless men and provider of \nan emergency one-family apartment and other emergency assistance; \nc)  Better Homes for Erie, a provider of affordable housing to low-income \nfamilies; and \nd)  Catholic Charities Counseling and Adoption Services, a provider of \nprofessional counseling, adoption counseling, pregnancy counseling, and \nrefugee resettlement services. \n  7   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 8 of 59\n \n33.  These social service programs, which receive support from the Diocese, \nprovide aid to approximately 56,000 people per year.  The provision of these social services is \na central tenet of the Catholic faith.   \n34.  Many of the individuals being served through these charitable programs are not \nbeing adequately served by the Government and without the support of the Diocese, would be \nwithout food, shelter, and other necessary services.   \n35.  The Diocese would not be able to provide all of these social services without \nthe financial contributions of its donors and the work of its numerous volunteers.  \n36.  Finally, the Diocese operates a self-insured health plan (the “Diocesan health \nplan”).  That is, the Diocese does not contract with a separate insurance company that \nprovides health care coverage to its employees and the employees of its affiliated \ncorporations.  Instead, the Diocese itself functions as the insurance company underwriting the \nmedical costs of its employees and the employees of its affiliated corporations.   \n37.  The Diocesan health plans are administered by Third Party Administrators \n(‘TPAs”).  The TPAs do not provide any of the funds used to pay health care providers. \n38.  The next Diocesan plan year begins on July 1, 2014.  However, the next \nadministrative year for the Diocesan health plan—which is the date by which all benefits for \nthe July 1, 2014 plan year must be implemented—begins on January 1, 2014.   \n39.  The Diocesan health plan does not meet the Affordable Care Act’s definition \nof a “grandfathered” plan.  The Diocese did not include a statement describing its \ngrandfathered status in plan materials, as required by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii) for \ngrandfathered plans.   \n  8   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 9 of 59\n \n40.  Consistent with Church teachings, the Diocesan health plan does not cover \nabortion-inducing drugs, contraceptives, or sterilization, except when medically necessary.   \nC.  St. Martin Center, Inc.  \n41.  Plaintiff St. Martin Center is a nonprofit, social service organization which has \nbeen providing individuals and families with resources to gain self-sufficiency for the last 50 \nyears.  Plaintiff provides the following services to the needy in the greater Erie, Pennsylvania \ncommunity, regardless of religion: \na)  Social services:  an in-house pantry; vouchers for clothing items; \nassistance for rent, mortgage, and utility payments; assistance for \nobtaining life-sustaining prescriptions; vouchers for bus passes and \ngasoline; and guidance for creating a budget.  Also, through St. Martin’s \nBishop’s Breakfast Program, the needy in the community receive a hot \nbreakfast every weekday.    \nb)  Housing services:  counseling for potential homebuyers; fair housing and \npredatory lending education; lead paint education; and foreclosure \nprevention counseling.  Also, through the HOME Investment Partnership \nProgram, first-time homebuyers can receive funds to bring a home into \ncompliance with building codes. \nc)  An Early Learning Center, which serves as a preschool and provider of \nbefore and after school care.  Childcare tuition assistance is available at \nthe Early Learning Center. \nd)  Hospitality Industry Training to teach workforce kitchen skills to the \nunderemployed, unemployed, and many resettled refugees.  St. Martin \n  9   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 10 of 59\n \nCenter provides hands-on experience to such individuals through its \ncatering program, Catering on Parade; and \ne)  PA WORKWEAR, a provider of men’s clothing for interviewing and \nentering the workforce. \n42.  Many of the individuals being served through the programs of St. Martin \nCenter are not being adequately served by the Government and without the support of these \nprograms, would be without food and other necessary services which enable them to live a \nself-sufficient life.   \n43.  St. Martin Center would not be able to provide all of these social services \nwithout the financial contributions of its donors and the work of its numerous volunteers.  \n44.  St. Martin Center employees are insured under the Diocesan health plan.   \n45.  St. Martin Center does not currently qualify as an entity described in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Accordingly, St. Martin Center likely \ndoes not currently qualify as a “religious employer” under the exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate.    \n46.  St. Martin Center is an affiliated corporation of the Diocese.  The Diocese \ndirectly oversees the management of St. Martin Center.    \nD.  Prince of Peace Center, Inc. \n47.  Plaintiff Prince of Peace Center is a nonprofit, social service organization \nwhich provides various social and self-sufficiency services to the needy in the greater Mercer \nCounty  community.   \n48.  The services offered by Prince of Peace Center include:   \na)  Family support services through the HOPE Advocacy program (Help and \nOpportunity for Personal Empowerment) and Project RUTH (Resources, \n  10   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 11 of 59\n \nUnderstanding, Training, and Homes).  HOPE Advocacy is a long term \nsupport program (for up to 24 months) for individuals and families \nstruggling with poverty.  Project RUTH is a transitional housing program \nfor single parents and their children, who meet the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development’s definition of homeless.  All of the \nindividuals served by HOPE Advocacy and Project RUTH are given the \nopportunity to learn basic life skills necessary for self-sufficiency and \nfamily stability through intensive case management and monthly support \ngroups.  The case managers work closely with all participants and offer \neducational, supportive, and advocacy services.   \nb)  Emergency Assistance programs, which provide food, clothing, furniture, \nappliances, and more to those in need at little to no cost.  Prince of Peace \nCenter’s Emergency Assistance programs are funded by private donations.  \nThrough such donations, Prince of Peace Center is able to offer over \n$50,000 yearly to help the needy pay utility bills and offer any other \nnecessary support to ensure that family units remain intact.  As part of its \nEmergency Assistance Program, Prince of Peace Center runs a program \nentitled AWESOME (Assistance With Education, Shelter, Organization, \nMoney management, and Employment).  The AWESOME program is \ngeared towards single men and women who have children and wish to \nattain self-sufficiency.  The AWESOME program classes cover a variety \nof topics, including proper nutrition, decision making, and financial \n  11   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 12 of 59\n \nplanning.  Anyone who attends the AWESOME program classes is \neligible for an emergency stipend towards payment of a utility bill.   \nc)  Mission Thrift Store (“the Thrift Store”), which provides items such as \nclothing and furniture to the community at a low cost.  The Thrift Store \ndoes not turn away anyone in need and supplies items to such individuals \nat no cost.  The Thrift Store operates at a significant loss each year, but the \nmission of the store is to serve all in need, not to focus on sales or money.   \nd)  PA WORKWEAR, a program which provides the needy with clothing, \naccessories, and training to prepare for job interviews.  Those who \nsuccessfully obtain employment are entitled to receive five additional days \nof work appropriate attire so that they can continue to present a \nprofessional image at their job.  \ne)  Neighborhood Meal, a soup kitchen, which provides two meals per week \nto the needy.  The soup kitchen serves approximately 5,700 individuals \nper year.  The needy can come to the soup kitchen for Thanksgiving and \nChristmas dinner.  Also, Prince of Peace Center sponsors Food Day, a \nprogram where the needy receive a monthly food distribution of groceries \nto supplement food stamps.  An average of approximately 700 individuals \nreceive food through this program each month.   \nf)  Computer classes for adults and seniors.  Students who pass the class \nreceive a free donated and refurbished computer.   \ng)  Various programs and charity drives for disadvantaged children in the \nMercer County community are held throughout the year, including a \n  12   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 13 of 59\n \nChristmas toy drive, Easter egg hunt, and school supplies and school \nclothing drive.   \n49.  The majority of the individuals served by Prince of Peace Center are below the \npoverty line and are not being adequately served by the Government.  Without the services of \nPrince of Peace Center, these individuals would be without food and shelter.   \n50.  Prince of Peace Center would not be able to provide all of these social services \nwithout the financial contributions of its donors and the work of its numerous volunteers.  \n51.  Prince of Peace Center employees are insured under the Diocesan health plan.   \n52.  Prince of Peace Center does not currently qualify as an entity described in \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Accordingly, Prince of Peace \nCenter likely does not currently qualify as a “religious employer” under the exemption to the \nU.S. Government Mandate.    \n53.  Prince of Peace Center is an affiliated corporation of the Diocese.  The Diocese \ndirectly oversees the management of Prince of Peace Center.   \nE.  ERIE CATHOLIC PREPARATORY SCHOOL \n54.  Erie Catholic Preparatory School was formed in 2010 by a merger between the \nformerly co-educational, but now all-female Villa Maria Academy and the all-male Cathedral \nPreparatory School.  Villa Maria Academy and Cathedral Preparatory School, which together \nform Erie Catholic Preparatory School, have separate single-sex campuses. \n55.  In the early 1890’s, Father Thomas Casey donated property for a school for \nfemales to be operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph.  This institution soon became known as \nVilla Maria Academy.  Villa Maria Academy is the oldest of the three Catholic high schools \nin Erie.   \n  13   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 14 of 59\n \n56.  The original Cathedral Preparatory School for Boys was formed in 1921 by \nBishop John Mark Gannon recognizing that “[m]any Catholics, although highly intelligent \nand deserving, were denied the chance to receive a preparatory education because they were \npoor.” \n57.  Erie Catholic Preparatory School’s mission is to “form a Christ-centered, co-\ninstitutional, college preparatory Catholic school of the Diocese of Erie.  With a foundation of \nfaith, family, excellence, and tradition, we develop men and women of vision in spirit, mind, \nand body.”  Its vision is “[s]teeped in Gospel values and the mission of the Catholic Church, \nCathedral Preparatory School and Villa Maria Academy will excel as a teaching and learning \ncommunity fostering service, strong moral character, global leadership, and esteemed \nacademic success.” \n58.  As part of the spiritual life at Erie Catholic Preparatory School, mass is \ncelebrated daily.  Students of Erie Catholic Preparatory School are required to take four years \nof Theology.  Also, each year, students are required to complete a service project including \nverification of 25 hours of qualified community service and a reflection component.  \nExamples of qualified community service include:  (i) service to the school and parish \ncommunity; (ii) service related to justice for the young; (iii) service related to justice for \nadults in poverty; and (iv) service related to justice for the sick and elderly.   \n59.  Additionally, Erie Catholic Preparatory School offers religious retreats and \npublicizes volunteer opportunities for its students.  \n60.  Erie Catholic Preparatory School currently has approximately 870 students, \nwith approximately 550 students attending Cathedral Preparatory School and approximately \n320 students attending Villa Maria Academy.   \n  14   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 15 of 59\n \n61.  In 2013, 100 percent of Cathedral Preparatory School’s 143 graduates were \naccepted to four-year colleges.  In the past two years, 96 percent of Villa Maria Academy \ngraduates enrolled in a college or university.  \n62.  The Diocese offers financial aid to students of Erie Catholic Preparatory \nSchool through the Bishop Assistance plan and the STAR Foundation.   \n63.  Erie Catholic Preparatory School employees are insured under the Diocesan \nhealth plan.  Currently, approximately 80 employees of Erie Catholic Preparatory School are \ninsured under that plan.  \n64.  Erie Catholic Preparatory School does not currently qualify as an entity \ndescribed in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code, however, it is \nexempt from tax reporting obligations under 26 C.F.R. § 1.6033-2(g)(1)(vii).  Accordingly, \ndespite being exempt from tax reporting obligations, Erie Catholic Preparatory School likely \ndoes not currently qualify as a “religious employer” under the exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate.    \n65.  Erie Catholic Preparatory School is an affiliated corporation of the Diocese.  \nThe Diocese directly oversees the management of Erie Catholic Preparatory School.   \nII.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \n66.  Plaintiffs are now at the end of a long-running regulatory saga, dating back to \n2011, when the Government began its historically unprecedented violation of the core \nconstitutional right to religious freedom.  Since that time, the Government has bobbed and \nweaved around various legal challenges by (i) saying whatever it needed to get by the \nmoment, (ii) promising courts around the country on record that it would resolve the concerns \nthat Plaintiffs have raised over the years, and (iii) inviting public comments and representing \nthat it would take these comments seriously.  But, despite all that it said, and all that has \n  15   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 16 of 59\n \nhappened, the Government has now finalized a rule that respects nothing, resolves nothing, \nand attempts to confine what constitutes one’s practice of faith to the four corners, bricks and \nmortar of a house of worship. \nA.  Statutory Background \n67.  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct,  Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), and the Health Care and Education \nReconciliation Act, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010)  (collectively, the “Affordable \nCare Act” or the “Act”).  The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for \n“group health plan[s],” broadly defined as “employee welfare benefit plan[s]” within the \nmeaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), \nthat “provide[] medical care . . . to employees or their dependents.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-\n91(a)(1).     \n68.  As relevant here, the Act requires an employer’s group health plan to cover \ncertain women’s “preventive care.”  Specifically, it indicates that “[a] group health plan and a \nhealth insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a \nminimum[,] provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . . . \nwith respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in \ncomprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \npurposes of this paragraph.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).  Because the Act prohibits “cost \nsharing requirements,” the health plan must pay for the full costs of these “preventive care” \nservices without any deductible or co-payment. \n69.  “[T]he Affordable Care Act preserves the ability of individuals to retain \ncoverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which the individual was \nenrolled on March 23, 2010.”  Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health \n  16   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 17 of 59\n \nInsurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,731 (July 19, 2010) (“Interim Final \nRules”); 42 U.S.C. § 18011.  These so-called “grandfathered health plans do not have to meet \nthe requirements” of the U.S. Government Mandate.  75 Fed. Reg. at 41,731.  HHS estimates \nthat “98 million individuals will be enrolled in grandfathered group health plans in 2013.”  Id. \nat 41,732.     \n70.  Federal law provides several mechanisms to enforce the requirements of the \nAct, including the U.S. Government Mandate.  For example: \na.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain employers who fail to offer \n“full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum \nessential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan” will be exposed to \nsignificant annual fines of $2,000 per full-time employee.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), \n(c)(1). \nb.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, group health plans that fail to provide \ncertain required coverage may be subject to a penalty of $100 a day per affected \nbeneficiary.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b); see also Jennifer Staman & Jon Shimabukuro, \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700, Enforcement of the Preventative Health Care Services \nRequirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2012) (asserting that \nthis applies to employers who violate the “preventive care” provision of the Affordable \nCare Act).   \nc.  Under ERISA, plan participants can bring civil actions against insurers for \nunpaid benefits.  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700.   \n  17   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 18 of 59\n \nd.  Similarly, the Secretary of Labor may bring an enforcement action against \ngroup health plans of employers that violate the U.S. Government Mandate, as \nincorporated by ERISA.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1132(b)(3); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL \n7-5700 (asserting that these penalties can apply to employers and insurers who violate the \n“preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).   \n71.  Several of the Act’s provisions, along with other federal statutes, reflect a clear \ncongressional intent that the executive agency charged with identifying the “preventive care” \nrequired by § 300gg-13(a)(4) should exclude all abortion-related services.   \n72.  For example, the Weldon Amendment, which has been included in every HHS \nand Department of Labor appropriations bill since 2004, prohibits certain agencies from \ndiscriminating against an institution based on that institution’s refusal to provide abortion-\nrelated services.  Specifically, it states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this Act [to \nthe Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be made \navailable to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or government subjects \nany institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the health \ncare entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 \nStat. 786, 1111 (2011).  The term “health care entity” is defined to include “an individual \nphysician or other health care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, a \nhealth maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care \nfacility, organization, or plan.” Id. § 507(d)(2) (emphasis added). \n73.  The legislative history of the Act also demonstrates a clear congressional intent \nto prohibit the executive branch from requiring group health plans to provide abortion-related \n  18   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 19 of 59\n \nservices.  For example, the House of Representatives originally passed a bill that included an \namendment by Congressman Bart Stupak prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion \nservices.  See H.R. 3962, 111th Cong. § 265 (Nov. 7, 2009).  The Senate version, however, \nlacked that restriction.  S. Amend. No. 2786 to H.R. 3590, 111th Cong. (Dec. 23, 2009).  To \navoid a filibuster in the Senate, congressional proponents of the Act engaged in a procedure \nknown as “budget reconciliation” that required the House to adopt the Senate version of the \nbill largely in its entirety.  Congressman Stupak and other pro-life House members, however, \nindicated that they would refuse to vote for the Senate version because it failed to adequately \nprohibit federal funding of abortion.  In an attempt to address these concerns, President \nBarack Obama issued an executive order providing that no executive agency would authorize \nthe federal funding of abortion services.  See Exec. Order No. 13535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 \n(Mar. 24, 2010).   \n74.  The Act, therefore,  was passed on the central premise that all agencies would \nuphold and follow “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” and to prohibit federal \nfunding of abortion.  Id.  That executive order was consistent with a 2009 speech that \nPresident Obama gave at the University of Notre Dame, in which he indicated that his \nAdministration would honor the consciences of those who disagree with abortion, and draft \nsensible conscience clauses. \nB.  Regulatory Background – Defining “Preventive Care” and the Narrow Exemption \n75.  In a span of less than two years, Defendants promulgated the U.S. Government \nMandate, subverting the Act’s clear purpose to protect the rights of conscience.  The U.S. \nGovernment Mandate immediately prompted intense criticism and controversy, in response to \nwhich the Government has undertaken various revisions.  None of these revisions, however, \nalleviates the burden that the U.S. Government Mandate imposes on Plaintiffs’ religious \n  19   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 20 of 59\n \nbeliefs.  To the contrary, these revisions have resulted in a final rule that is significantly worse \nthan the original one.  \n(1)  The Original Mandate and Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n76.  On July 19, 2010, Defendants issued interim final rules addressing the statutory \nrequirement that group health plans provide coverage for women’s “preventive care.”  75 Fed. \nReg. 41,726 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4)).  Initially, the rules did not define \n“preventive care,” instead noting that “[t]he Department of HHS is developing these \nguidelines and expects to issue them no later than August 1, 2011.”  Id. at 41,731. \n77.  To develop the definition of “preventive care,” HHS outsourced its \ndeliberations to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), a non-governmental “independent” \norganization.  The IOM in turn created a “Committee on Preventive Services for Women,” \ncomposed of 16 members who were selected in secret without any public input.  At least eight \nof the Committee members had founded, chaired, or worked with “pro-choice” advocacy \ngroups (including five different Planned Parenthood entities) that have well-known political \nand ideological views, including strong animus toward Catholic teachings on abortion and \ncontraception.   \n78.  Unsurprisingly, the IOM Committee invited presentations from several “pro-\nchoice” groups, such as Planned Parenthood and the Guttmacher Institute (named for a former \npresident of Planned Parenthood), without inviting any input from groups that oppose \ngovernment-mandated coverage for abortion, contraception, and sterilization.  Instead, \nopponents were relegated to lining up for brief open-microphone sessions at the close of each \nmeeting. \n79.  At the close of this process, on July 19, 2011, the IOM issued a final report \nrecommending that “preventive care” for women be defined to include “the full range of Food \n  20   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 21 of 59\n \nand Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and \npatient education and counseling for [all] women with reproductive capacity.”  Inst. Of Med., \nClinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps,” at 218-219 (2011). \n80.  The extreme bias of the IOM process spurred one member of the Committee, \nDr. Anthony Lo Sasso, to dissent from the final recommendation, writing: “[T]he committee \nprocess for evaluation of the evidence lacked transparency and was largely subject to the \npreferences of the committee’s composition.  Troublingly, the process tended to result in a \nmix of objective and subjective determinations filtered through a lens of advocacy.”  Id. at \n232. \n81.  At a press briefing the next day, the chair of the IOM Committee fielded a \nquestion from a representative of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops regarding the \n“coercive dynamic” of the U.S. Government Mandate, asking whether the Committee \nconsidered the “conscience rights” of those who would be forced to pay for coverage that they \nfound objectionable on moral and religious grounds.  In response, the chair illustrated her \ncavalier attitude toward the religious-liberty issue, stating bluntly: “[W]e did not take into \naccount individual personal feelings.”  See Linda Rosenstock, Chair, Inst. Of Med. Comm. On \nPreventive Servs. For Women, Press Briefing (July 20, 2011), available at http://www.iom \n.edu/Reports/2011/Clinical-Preventive-Services-for-Women-Closing-the-Gaps.aspx.  The \nchair later expressed concern to Congress about considering religious objections to the \nMandate because to do so would risk a “slippery slope” that could occur by “opening up that \ndoor” to religious liberty.  See Executive Overreach: The HHS Mandate Versus Religious \nLiberty:  Hearing Before the H. Comm. On the Judiciary, 112th Cong. (2012) (testimony of \nLinda Rosenstock, Chair, Inst. Of Med. Comm. On Preventive Servs. For Women).   \n  21   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 22 of 59\n \n82.  Less than two weeks after the IOM report, without pausing for notice and \ncomment, HHS issued a press release on August 1, 2011, announcing that it would adopt the \nIOM’s definition of “preventive care,” including all “FDA-approved contraception methods \nand contraceptive counseling.”  See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, “Affordable \nCare Act Ensures Women Receive Preventive Services at No Additional Cost,” available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110801b.html.  HHS ignored the religious, \nmoral and ethical dimensions of the decision and the ideological bias of the IOM Committee \nand stated that it had “relied on independent physicians, nurses, scientists, and other experts” \nto reach a definition that was “based on scientific evidence.”  Under the final “scientific” \ndefinition, the category of mandatory “preventive care” extends to “[a]ll Food and Drug \nAdministration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient \neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  See “Women’s \nPreventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines,” \nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines.  \n83.  The Government’s definition of mandatory “preventive care” also includes \nabortion-inducing products.  For example, the FDA has approved “emergency contraceptives” \nsuch as the morning-after pill (otherwise known as Plan B), which can prevent an embryo \nfrom implanting in the womb, and Ulipristal (otherwise known as HRP 2000 or ella), which \nlikewise can induce abortions. \n84.  Shortly after announcing its definition of “preventive care,” the Government \nproposed a narrow exemption from the U.S. Government Mandate for a small category of \n“religious employers” that met all of the following four criteria: “(1) The inculcation of \nreligious values is the purpose of the organization”; “(2) The organization primarily employs \n  22   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 23 of 59\n \npersons who share the religious tenets of the organization”; “(3) The organization serves \nprimarily persons who share the religious tenets of the organization”; and “(4) The \norganization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) and section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”  76 Fed. Reg. at \n46,626 (Aug. 3, 2011) (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B)).  \n85.  As the Government itself admitted, this narrow exemption was intended to \nprotect only “the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in \nministerial positions.”  Id. at 46,623.  It provided no protection for religious universities, \nelementary and secondary schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations. \n86.  The sweeping nature of the U.S. Government Mandate was subject to \nwidespread and withering criticism.  Religious leaders from across the country protested that \nthey should not be punished or considered less religious simply because they chose to live out \ntheir faith by serving needy members of the community who might not share their beliefs.  As \nCardinal Wuerl later wrote, “Never before has the government contested that institutions like \nArchbishop Carroll High School or Catholic University are religious.  Who would?  But \nHHS’s conception of what constitutes the practice of religion is so narrow that even Mother \nTeresa would not have qualified.” \n87.  Despite such pleas, the Government at first refused to reconsider its position.  \nInstead, the Government “finalize[d], without change,” the narrow exemption as originally \nproposed.  77 Fed. Reg. at 8,729 (Feb. 15, 2012).  At the same time, the Government \nannounced that it would offer a “a one-year safe harbor from enforcement” for religious \norganizations that remained subject to the U.S. Government Mandate.  Id. at 8,728.  As noted \n  23   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 24 of 59\n \nby Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the “safe harbor” effectively gave religious groups “a year to \nfigure out how to violate our consciences.” \n88.  A month later, under increasing public pressure, the Government issued an \nAdvance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”) that, it claimed, set out a solution to \nthe religious-liberty controversy created by the U.S. Government Mandate.  77 Fed. Reg. \n16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012).  The ANPRM did not revoke the U.S. Government Mandate, and in \nfact reaffirmed the Government’s view at the time that the “religious employer” exemption \nwould not be changed.  Id. at 16,501-08.  Instead, the ANPRM offered hypothetical “possible \napproaches” that would, in the Government’s view, somehow solve the religious-liberty \nproblem without granting an exemption for objecting religious organizations.  Id. at 16,507.  \nAs the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops soon recognized, however, any semblance of \nrelief offered by the ANPRM was illusory. Although it was designed to “create an appearance \nof moderation and compromise, it [did] not actually offer any change in the Administration’s \nearlier stated positions on mandated contraceptive coverage.” See Comments of U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, at 3 (May 15, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/comments-on-advance-\nnotice-of-proposed-rulemaking-on-preventive-services-12-05-15.pdf.    \n(2)  Plaintiffs’ First Lawsuit and the Government’s Promise of Non-Enforcement \n89.  The first lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs the Diocese, St. Martin Center, and Prince \nof Peace Center challenging the U.S. Government Mandate was dismissed by this Court, \nwithout prejudice, based on the Government’s express promises that it would never enforce \nthe then-current regulations against Plaintiffs and the Government’s commitment to amend \nthe regulations at issue to accommodate the concerns of entities with religious objections like \nPlaintiffs.   \n  24   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 25 of 59\n \n90.  Specifically, Plaintiffs’ first lawsuit was filed on May 21, 2012 in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint sought to enjoin \nthe U.S. Government Mandate on the grounds that, among other things, it violated their rights \nof religious conscience under RFRA and the First Amendment.  See Most Rev. Persico, et al \nv. Sebelius et al., Docket No. 1:12-cv-00123 (W.D. Pa.).  In response to this and similar \nlitigation, the Government promised this Court that “these regulations almost certainly will \nnever be enforced against plaintiffs.”  (Gov’t Reply Br. in Supp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 37 at 11). \n91.  In their motion to dismiss, Defendants further represented that the Government \n“ha[d] initiated a rulemaking to amend the challenged regulations to accommodate religious \norganizations’ religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage, like plaintiffs.’”  \n(Gov’t Mem. in Supp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 18 at 9); see also id. at 23 (“the forthcoming \namendments are intended to address the very issue that plaintiffs raise here by establishing \nalternative means of providing contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing while further \naccommodating religious organizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive \nservices.”).    \n92.  Defendants also asserted their “commitment” “to amend the regulations as they \nrelate to organizations like plaintiffs” was demonstrated by their “initiation of the amendment \nprocess, and opportunities for plaintiffs to participate in that process.”  (Gov’t Reply Br. in \nSupp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 37 at 15-16).   \n93.  Based on Defendants’ representations, this Court granted without prejudice the \nGovernment’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing and ripeness.  See Most. Rev. Persico v. \nSebelius, No. 1:12-cv-00123, 2013 WL 228200 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 22, 2013).  Importantly, the \nCourt relied on the safe harbor and Defendants’ commitment to amend the U.S. Government \n  25   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 26 of 59\n \nMandate to accommodate Plaintiffs’ core religious beliefs.  See id. at *12 (“Defendant have \nrepeatedly stated their intent to amend the Mandate, well before January 1, 2013, for the \nexpress purpose of accommodating the Plaintiffs’’ religiously motivated objections to the \nregulation.”).  The Court noted that “Defendants have gone so far as to plainly state that the \nMandate in its current form will never be enforced against the Plaintiffs. . . . .”  Id. at *12.  \nThe Court relied on these representations as “good faith statements of [Defendants’] true \nintent[.]”  Id.  \n(3)  The Government’s Final Offer of an Empty “Accommodation” and Issuance \nof the “Final Rule” \n94.  On February 1, 2013, the Government issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n(“NPRM”), setting forth in further detail its proposal to “accommodate” the rights of Plaintiffs \nand other religious organizations.  Contrary to the Government’s previous assurances, the \nNPRM adopted the objectionable proposals contained in the ANPRM.   \n95.  Despite opposition from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Plaintiffs, \nand various other commenters, as described below, on June 28, 2013, the Government \nfinalized the U.S. Government Mandate, adopting the core proposals in the NPRM.  See 78 \nFed. Reg. 39870 (July 2, 2013) (“Final Rule”).  \n96.  The Final Rule makes three changes to the U.S. Government Mandate.  As \ndescribed below, none of these changes relieves the unlawful burdens placed on Plaintiffs and \nother religious organizations.  Indeed, one of them significantly increases that burden by \nsignificantly increasing the number of religious organizations subject to the U.S. Government \nMandate.  \n97.  First, the Final Rule makes what the Government concedes to be a non-\nsubstantive, cosmetic change to the definition of “religious employer.”  In particular, it \n  26   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 27 of 59\n \neliminates the first three prongs of that definition, such that, under the new definition, an \nexempt “religious employer” is simply “an organization that is organized and operates as a \nnonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986, as amended.”  78 Fed. Reg. 39874 (codified at 45 CFR § 147.131(a)).  As the \nGovernment has admitted, this new definition does “not expand the universe of employer \nplans that would qualify for the exemption beyond that which was intended in the 2012 final \nrules.”  78 Fed. Reg. 8456, 8461 (Feb. 6, 2013).  Instead, it continues to “restrict[]the \nexemption primarily to group health plans established or maintained by churches, synagogues, \nmosques, and other houses of worship, and religious orders.”  Id.  In this respect, the Final \nRule mirrors the intended scope of the original “religious employer” exemption, which \nfocused on “the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in \nministerial positions.”  76 Fed. Reg. at 46,623.  Religious organizations that have a broader \nmission are still not, in the Government’s view, “religious employers.”   \n98.  The “religious employer” exemption, moreover, creates an official, \nGovernment-favored category of religious groups that are exempt from the U.S. Government \nMandate, while denying this favorable treatment to all other religious groups.  The exemption \napplies only to those groups that are “referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the \nInternal Revenue Code.”  This category includes only (i) “churches, their integrated \nauxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches,” and (iii) “the exclusively religious \nactivities of any religious order.”  The IRS has adopted an intrusive 14-factor test to determine \nwhether a group meets these qualifications.  See Foundation of Human Understanding v. \nUnited States, 88 Fed. Cl. 203, 220 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  Among these 14 factors is whether the \ngroup has “ a recognized creed and form of worship,” “a definite and distinct ecclesiastical \n  27   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 28 of 59\n \ngovernment,” “a formal code of doctrine and discipline,” “a distinct religious history,” “an \norganization of ordained ministers” “a literature of its own,” “established places of worship,” \n“regular congregations, “regular religious services,” “Sunday schools for the religious \ninstruction of the young,” and “schools for the preparation of its ministers.” Id.  Not only do \nthese factors favor some religious groups at the expense of others, but they also require the \nGovernment to make intrusive judgments regarding religious beliefs, practices, and \norganizational features to determine which groups fall into the favored category.  Similar \nproblems arise in evaluating whether an organization is an “integrated auxiliary” under \nTreasury Regulations that assess, among other things whether an organization “shares \ncommon religious doctrines, principles, disciplines, or practices with a church,” or “receives \nmore than 50% of its support” from non-church sources.  See 26 C.F.R. § 1.6033-2(h). \n99.  Second, the Final Rule establishes an illusory “accommodation” for certain \nnonexempt objecting religious entities that qualify as “eligible organizations.”  To qualify as \nan “eligible organization,” a religious entity must (1) “oppose[] providing coverage for some \nor all of [the] contraceptive services,” (2)  be “organized and operate[] as a non-profit entity”; \n(3) “hold[] itself out as a religious organization,” and (4) self-certify that it meets the first \nthree criteria, and provide a copy of the self-certification either to its insurance company or, if \nthe religious organization is self-insured, to its TPA.  26 CFR § 54.9816-2713A(a).  The \nprovision of this self-certification then automatically requires the insurance issuer or TPA to \nprovide or arrange “payments for contraceptive services” for the organization’s employees, \nwithout imposing any “cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a \ndeductible).”  Id. § 54.9816-2713A(b)(2), (c)(2).  The objectionable coverage, moreover, is \ndirectly tied to the organization’s health plan, lasting only as long as the employee remains on \n  28   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 29 of 59\n \nthat plan.  See 29 CFR § 2590.715-2713; 45 CFR § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B).  In addition, self-\ninsured organizations are prohibited from “directly or indirectly, seek[ing] to influence the[ir] \nthird party administrator’s decision” to provide or procure contraceptive services.  26 CFR § \n54.9815–2713.   \n100.  This so-called “accommodation” fails to relieve the burden on religious \norganizations.  Under the original version of the U.S. Government Mandate, a nonexempt \nreligious organization’s decision to offer a group health plan resulted in the provision of  \ncoverage for abortion-inducing products, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling.  \nUnder the Final Rule, a nonexempt religious organization’s decision to offer a group health \nplan still results in the provision of coverage—now in the form of “payments”—for abortion-\ninducing products, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling.  Id. § 54.9816-\n2713A(b)-(c).   \n101.  In both scenarios, Plaintiffs’ decision to provide a group health plan triggers \nthe provision of “free” contraceptive coverage to their employees in a manner contrary to \nPlaintiffs’ beliefs.  The provision of the objectionable products and services is directly tied to \nPlaintiffs’ insurance policies, as the objectionable “payments” are available only so long as an \nemployee is on the organization’s health plan.  See 29 CFR § 2590.715-2713 (for self-insured \nemployers, the TPA “will provide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services . . . \nfor so long as [employees] are enrolled in [their] group health plan”); 45 CFR \n§ 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B) (for employers that offer insured plans, the insurance issuer must \n“[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services . . . for plan participants and \nbeneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan”).   \n  29   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 30 of 59\n \n102.  For self-insured organizations, like Plaintiffs, the self-certification constitutes \nthe religious organization’s “designation of the third party administrator(s) as plan \nadministrator and claims administrator for contraceptive benefits.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,879 \n(emphasis added).  Thus, employer health plans offered by nonexempt religious organizations \nare the vehicle by which “free” abortion-inducing products, contraception, sterilization, and \nrelated counseling are delivered to the organizations’ employees. \n103.  This shell game does not address Plaintiffs’ fundamental religious objection to \nimproperly facilitating access to the objectionable products and services.  As before, Plaintiffs \nare coerced, through threats of crippling fines and other pressure, into facilitating access to \ncontraception, abortion-inducing products, sterilization, and related counseling for their \nemployees, contrary to their sincerely-held religious beliefs.   \n104.  The so-called “accommodation,” moreover, requires Plaintiffs to cooperate in \nthe provision of objectionable coverage in other ways as well.  For example, in order to be \neligible for the so-called “accommodation,” Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace \nCenter, and Erie Catholic Preparatory School must provide a “certification” to Plaintiffs’ TPA \nsetting forth their religious objections to the U.S. Government Mandate.  The provision of this \n“certification,” in turn, automatically triggers an obligation on the part of the TPA to obtain \nthe objectionable coverage for the employees of St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, \nand Erie Catholic Preparatory School.  A religious organization’s self-certification, therefore, \nis a trigger and but-for cause of the objectionable coverage.  \n105.  Moreover, the Bishop and Diocese are forced to facilitate coverage for the \nobjectionable services through accommodated entities currently participating in the health \nplan sponsored by the Diocese.   \n  30   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 31 of 59\n \n106.  The Bishop is further forced to facilitate coverage of the objectionable services \nin his role on the Membership Boards of Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, \nand Erie Catholic Preparatory School.   \n107.  As pointed out in the Diocese of Pittsburgh’s public comments and the expert \nreport submitted with these comments, described below, the U.S. Government Mandate also \nrequires religious organizations such as Plaintiffs to subsidize the objectionable services. \n108.  For organizations that procure insurance through a separate insurance provider, \nthe Government asserts that the cost of the objectionable products and services will be “cost \nneutral” and, therefore, that these organizations will not actually be paying for it, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the organizations’ premiums are the only source of funding that \ntheir insurance providers will receive for the objectionable products and services.   \n109.  The Government’s “cost-neutral” assertion, however, is based on smoke and \nmirrors.  It rests on the unproven (and implausible) assumption that cost “savings” from \n“fewer childbirths” will be at least as large as the direct costs of paying for contraceptive \nproducts and services and the costs of administering individual policies.  78 Fed. Reg. at \n8,463.  Some employees, however, will choose not to use contraception notwithstanding the \nU.S. Government Mandate.  Others would use contraception regardless of whether it is being \npaid for by an insurance company.  And yet others will shift from less expensive to more \nexpensive products once coverage is mandated and cost-sharing is prohibited.  Consequently, \nthere can be no assurance that cost “savings” from “fewer childbirths” will offset the cost of \nproviding contraceptive services. \n110.  More importantly, even if the Government’s “cost-neutral” assertion were true, \nit is irrelevant.  The so-called “accommodation” is nothing more than a shell game.  Premiums \n  31   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 32 of 59\n \npreviously paid by the objecting employers to cover, for example, “childbirths,” will now be \nredirected to pay for contraceptive products and services.  Thus, the objecting employer is still \nrequired to pay for the objectionable products and services. \n111.  For self-insured organizations, like Plaintiffs, the Government’s “cost-neutral” \nassumption is likewise implausible.  The Government asserts that TPAs required to provide or \nprocure the objectionable products and services will be compensated by reductions in user \nfees that they otherwise would pay for participating in federally-facilitated health exchanges.   \nSee 78 Fed. Reg. 39,882.  Those TPAs that are willing to participate in this regime are likely \nto increase fees charged to the self-insured organizations.   \n112.  Either way, as with insured plans, self-insured organizations, like Plaintiffs, \nlikewise will be required to subsidize contraceptive products and services notwithstanding the \nso-called “accommodation.” \n113.  For all of these reasons, the U.S. Government Mandate continues to require \nPlaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion-inducing products, \ncontraception, sterilization, and related education and counseling, in violation of their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs. \n114.  Third, the Final Rule actually increases the number of religious organizations \nthat are subject to the U.S. Government Mandate.  Under the Government’s initial “religious \nemployer” definition, if a nonexempt religious organization “provided health coverage for its \nemployees through” a plan offered by a separate, “affiliated” organization that was “exempt \nfrom the requirement to cover contraceptive services, then neither the [affiliated organization] \nnor the [nonexempt entity would be] required to offer contraceptive coverage to its \nemployees.”  77 Fed. Reg. 16,501, 16,502 (Mar. 21, 2012).     \n  32   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 33 of 59\n \n115.  For example, the Diocese, operates a self-insurance plan that covers not only \nthe Diocese itself, but other affiliated Catholic organizations within the Diocese, like Plaintiffs \nSt. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic Preparatory School.  Under the \nreligious employer exemption that was originally proposed, if the Diocese was an exempt \n“religious employer,” then these other organizations under the Diocesan plan would have \nreceived the benefit of that exemption, regardless of whether they independently qualified as a \n“religious employer,” since they could continue to participate in the plan offered by the \nDiocese.  These affiliated organizations, therefore, could benefit from the Diocese’s \nexemption even if they, themselves, could not meet the Government’s unprecedentedly \nnarrow definition of “religious employer.”   \n116.  The Final Rule eliminates this safeguard.  Instead, it provides that “each \nemployer” must “independently meet the definition of eligible organization or religious \nemployer in order to take advantage of the accommodation or the religious employer \nexemption with respect to its employees and their covered dependents.”  78 Fed. Reg. 39,886.  \nSee also 78 Fed. Reg. at 8467 (NPRM).   \n117.  In this respect, the U.S. Government Mandate seeks to divide the Catholic \nChurch.  The Church’s faith in action, carried out through its charitable and educational arms, \nis every bit as central to the Church’s religious mission as is the administration of the \nSacraments.  In the words of Pope Benedict, “[t]he Church cannot neglect the service of \ncharity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the Word.”  Yet the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate seeks to separate these consubstantial aspects of the Catholic faith, \ntreating one as “religious” and the other as not.  The U.S. Government Mandate therefore \ndeeply intrudes into internal Church governance.     \n  33   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 34 of 59\n \n118.  Moreover, since nonexempt organizations including Plaintiffs St. Martin \nCenter, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic Preparatory School are part of the Diocesan \nhealth plan, the Diocese is now required by the U.S. Government Mandate to consider:  \n(1) providing the employees of these organizations with a separate insurance policy that \ncovers abortion-inducing drugs, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling, or (2) \nexpelling these organizations from the Diocesan health plan and thereby force these \norganizations to enter into an arrangement with another insurance provider that will, in turn, \nprovide the objectionable coverage.  Either alternative violates the Diocese’s sincerely-held \nreligious beliefs, and will jeopardize the ability of the Diocese to continue to operate in its \ncurrent fashion of providing affordable, quality health insurance.   \n119.  Expelling nonexempt organizations from the Diocesan health plan may well \nresult in increased costs for the Diocese and the expelled organizations, including Plaintiffs \nSt. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic Preparatory School because each \norganization would be pooling financial resources in a smaller group.  \n120.  In sum, the Final Rule not only fails to alleviate the burden that the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate imposes on Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs; it in fact makes that burden \nsignificantly worse by increasing the number of religious organizations that are subject to the \nU.S. Government Mandate and jeopardizes the continued operation of Plaintiffs’ health plans.  \nThe U.S. Government Mandate, therefore, requires Plaintiffs to act contrary to their sincerely-\nheld religious beliefs. \n(4)  The Government Ignored Opposition to the Proposed Rule   \n121.  The NPRM, like the Government’s previous proposals, was once again met \nwith strenuous opposition, including over 400,000 comments.  For example, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops stated that “the ‘accommodation’ still requires the objecting \n  34   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 35 of 59\n \nreligious organization to fund or otherwise facilitate the morally objectionable coverage.  \nSuch organizations and their employees remain deprived of their right to live and work under \na health plan consonant with their explicit religious beliefs and commitments.”  Comments of \nU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishop, at 3 (Mar. 20, 2013), available at \nhttp://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/2013-NPRM-Comments-3-\n20-final.pdf.    \n122.  Additionally, the Diocese of Pittsburgh submitted extensive public comments \non the NPRM on April 8, 2013.  Public Comments and Expert Opinion submitted by the \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, (April 8, 2013), available at \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CMS-2012-0031-160262.   \n123.  In its public comments, the Diocese of Pittsburgh asserted that the proposed \n“religious employer” exemption draws indefensible and unconstitutional distinctions between \nequally religious Diocesan affiliates.  Specifically, the exemption uses corporate formalities to \nrestrict religion to worship alone, when religious service is an essential part of the Catholic \nfaith.  Id. \n124.  Additionally, the Diocese of Pittsburgh explained that the now-final exemption \nwill needlessly increase insurance costs.  The exemption could require Dioceses, like the \nDiocese of Pittsburgh and Diocese of Erie, to alter the structure of their health plans since they \nwill no longer be able to insure nonexempt entities.  Expelling nonexempt entities would \ndecrease the pooled financial resources which currently enable the Diocese of Pittsburgh and \nto the Diocese of Erie to offer comprehensive health coverage to their employees and to \nemployees of affiliated religious entities.  Id. \n  35   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 36 of 59\n \n125.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh asserted that the proposed “accommodation” \nviolates its religious beliefs by requiring accommodated entities to pay for and facilitate \nimmoral acts.  Action by these entities will trigger the U.S. Government Mandate requirement \nto provide the objectionable coverage, including:  (i) signing the self-certification form that \ntriggers the TPA’s duties to provide the coverage; (ii) providing the names of covered \nindividuals that the TPA will contact for coverage; and (iii) providing the self-certification of \ntheir objections to their TPA will trigger coverage for the objectionable services.  Id. \n126.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh also demonstrated that the proposed \n“accommodation” will not, in practice, work as currently written.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh \nengaged Dr. Scott E. Harrington, the Alan B. Miller Professor in Health Care Management, \nInsurance and Risk Management, and Business Economics and Public Policy at the Wharton \nSchool of the University of Pennsylvania, a renowned healthcare economist, to determine how \nthe proposed rule will work.   \n127.  Dr. Harrington’s expert opinion detailed that the proposed rule, in application:  \n(i) will likely make obtaining health insurance more costly for both fully-insured and self-\ninsured eligible organizations; (ii) will require fully-insured eligible organizations to directly \nfund coverage of the objectionable services; (iii) puts in place a regulatory scheme which will \nlimit the insurance market available to self-insured eligible organizations; and (iv) on its face \nrequires self-insured eligible organizations to facilitate coverage without funding the \nobjectionable services, but in application may result in these organizations funding such \nservices as it may be difficult if not impossible to ensure that administrative fees paid by these \norganizations are not contributing to such coverage.  Id. \n  36   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 37 of 59\n \n128.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh offered solutions on how the Government could \nprotect religious liberty with revisions to the proposed rule.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh \nadvanced two proposals:  (i) The Departments should broaden the religious employer \nexemption to include Diocesan-affiliated organizations, which do good, religious works under \nthe guidance and leadership of their Bishops; or (ii) The Departments should delay \nenforcement of any new rule so that there is time to adjudicate the substantive rights of \nreligious organizations.  Id. \n129.  Thus, despite all of its promises and representations that the Government had \nnot in fact fixed the problem, the Government adopted the core proposals in the NPRM and \nissued the Final Rule. \nIII.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE IMPOSES A SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN  \nON PLAINTIFFS’ RELIGIOUS LIBERTY \nA.  The U.S. Government Mandate Substantially Burdens Plaintiffs’ Religious Beliefs \n130.  Responding to the U.S. Government Mandate, Cardinal Wuerl has declared \nthat “what is at stake here is a question of human freedom.”  And indeed it is.  Since the \nfounding of this country, our law and society have recognized that individuals and institutions \nare entitled to freedom of conscience and religious practice.  Absent a compelling reason, no \ngovernment authority may compel any group or individual to act contrary to their religious \nbeliefs.  As noted by Thomas Jefferson, “[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer \nto man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of civil \nauthority.”  \n131.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates Plaintiffs’ rights of conscience by \nforcing them to participate in an employer-based scheme to provide insurance coverage to \nwhich they strenuously object on moral and religious grounds.   \n  37   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 38 of 59\n \n132.  It is a core tenet of Plaintiffs’ religion that abortion, contraception, and \nsterilization are serious moral wrongs.   \n133.  Plaintiffs’ Catholic beliefs therefore prohibit them from providing, paying for, \nand/or facilitating access to abortion-inducing products, contraception, or sterilization.   \n134.  As a corollary, Plaintiffs’ Catholic beliefs prohibit them contracting with an \ninsurance company or TPA that will, as a result, provide or procure the objectionable services \nfor Plaintiffs’ employees. \n135.  Moreover, the manner in which the U.S. Government Mandate achieves the \ncost-savings necessary for it to operate effectively is predicated on the Government’s \nprediction of a decrease in the number of births due to a predicted increase in the number of \nindividuals utilizing the objectionable services.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus forces \nPlaintiffs to not only directly facilitate access to objectionable products and services, but also \nto participate in a Government scheme specifically designed to thwart the transmission of life \ncontrary to Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs.  \n136.  Plaintiffs’ beliefs are deeply and sincerely held.   \n137.  The U.S. Government Mandate, therefore, requires Plaintiffs to do precisely \nwhat their sincerely-held religious beliefs prohibit—provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access \nto the objectionable services or else incur crippling sanctions.   \n138.  The U.S. Government Mandate therefore imposes a substantial burden on \nPlaintiffs’ religious beliefs. \n(1)  The Narrow “Religious Employer” Exemption \n  38   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 39 of 59\n \n139.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s exemption for “religious employers” does not \nalleviate the burden.   \n140.  The “religious employer” exemption likely does not apply to Plaintiffs St. \nMartin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic Preparatory School. \n141.  Additionally, the “religious employer” exemption does not work as the \nGovernment claims it will and instead seeks to divide the Catholic church.  For example, the \nU.S. Government Mandate exempts an arbitrary subset of religious organizations that qualify \nfor tax-reporting exemptions under Section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code.  However, the \nhigh schools within the Diocese, including Plaintiff Erie Catholic Preparatory School, are \nspecifically exempt from these tax-reporting requirements under 26 C.F.R. § 1.6033-\n2(g)(1)(vii), and yet, because these high schools are separately incorporated and not run \ndirectly through the Diocese, they likely are not exempt from the U.S. Government Mandate.    \n142.  There is no rational basis for exempting Diocesan high schools, like Plaintiff \nErie Catholic Preparatory School, from tax-reporting requirements and yet subjecting these \nhigh schools to the U.S. Government Mandate.  The Government’s proposal of equating a \n“religious employer” to an employer exempt from tax-reporting requirements does not work.  \n(2)  The So-Called “Accommodation” \n  39   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 40 of 59\n \n143.  Notwithstanding the so-called “accommodation,” Plaintiffs are still required to \nprovide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to the objectionable products and services. \n144.  Plaintiffs’ Catholic beliefs do not simply prohibit them from using or directly \npaying for the objectionable coverage. Their beliefs also prohibit them from facilitating access \nto the objectionable products and services in the manner required by the U.S. Government \nMandate.     \n145.  Starting January 1, 2014, Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, \nand Erie Catholic Preparatory School will be forced to facilitate coverage of the objectionable \nservices for their employees.  In reality, however, Plaintiffs must implement all benefit \nchanges to the Diocesan health plan, including changes required by the U.S. Government \nMandate, in advance of the January 1, 2014 administrative year.    \n146.  Although the Diocese is a “religious employer,” the U.S. Government Mandate \nstill burdens its sincerely-held religious beliefs by requiring it to consider either:  (1) \nproviding Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, Erie Catholic Preparatory \nSchool and other affiliated Catholic organizations with insurance coverage for the \nobjectionable services, (2) or else expelling these affiliates from the Diocesan health plan, \nthereby forcing them into an arrangement with another insurance provider that will, in turn, \nprovide or procure the objectionable products and services.  Expelling these accommodated \nentities would require significant restructuring of the Diocesan health plan and would affect \nthe pooling of resources which enables the Diocese to offer comprehensive and affordable \nhealth benefits.   \n147.  Both of these alternatives violate the Diocese’s sincerely-held religious beliefs.   \n  40   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 41 of 59\n \n148.  The Bishop is forced to facilitate coverage of the objectionable services in his \nrole on the Membership Boards of Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and \nErie Catholic Preparatory School.   \n149.  The so-called “accommodation” does not alleviate the burden on Plaintiffs’ \nsincerely-held religious beliefs.   \n150.  Finally, the Plaintiffs cannot avoid the U.S. Government Mandate without \nincurring crippling fines.  If they eliminate their employee health plans, they could be subject \nto annual fines of $2,000 per full-time employee.  If Plaintiffs St. Martin Center and Erie \nCatholic Preparatory School keep their health plans but refuse to provide or facilitate the \nobjectionable coverage, they could be subject to daily fines of $100 a day per affected \nbeneficiary.   \n151.  In short, while the President claims to have “found a solution that works for \neveryone” and that ensures that “religious liberty will be protected,” his promised \n“accommodation” does neither.  Unless and until this issue is definitively resolved, the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate does and will continue to impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs. \nB.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not a Neutral Law of General Applicability  \n152.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability.  It \noffers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health plans include or \nfacilitate coverage for abortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraception, and related \neducation and counseling.  It was, moreover, implemented by and at the behest of individuals \nand organizations who disagree with Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs regarding abortion and \ncontraception, and thus targets religious organizations for disfavored treatment. \n  41   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 42 of 59\n \n153.  For example, the U.S. Government Mandate exempts all “grandfathered” plans \nfrom its requirements, thus excluding tens of millions of people from the mandated coverage.  \nAs the government has admitted, while the numbers are expected to diminish over time, “98 \nmillion individuals will be enrolled in grandfathered group health plans in 2013.”  75 Fed. \nReg. 41726,41732 (July 19, 2010).  Elsewhere, the government has put the number at 87 \nmillion.  See “Keeping the Health Plan You Have” (June 14, 2010), \nhttp://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2010/06/keeping-the-health-plan-you-have-\ngrandfathered.html.  And according to one district court last year, “191 million Americans \nbelong[ed] to plans which may be grandfathered under the ACA.”  Newland v. Sebelius, 881 \nF. Supp. 2d 1287, 1291 (D. Colo. 2012). \n154.  Similarly, small employers (i.e., those with fewer than 50 employees) are \nexempt from certain enforcement mechanisms to compel compliance with the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate.  See 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980D(d) (exempting certain small employers from \npenalties imposed for failing to provide the objectionable services), 4980H(a) (exempting \nsmall employers from the assessable payment for failure to provide health coverage).  \n155.  In addition, the U.S. Government Mandate exempts an arbitrary subset of \nreligious organizations that qualify for tax-reporting exemptions under Section 6033 of the \nInternal Revenue Code.  The Government cannot justify its protection of the religious-\nconscience rights of the narrow category of exempt “religious employers,” but not of \nPlaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic Preparatory School, \nespecially since Erie Catholic Preparatory is exempt from tax-reporting requirements.  \n156.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, was promulgated by Government \nofficials, and supported by non-governmental organizations, who strongly oppose certain \n  42   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 43 of 59\n \nCatholic teachings and beliefs.  For example, on October 5, 2011, Defendant Sebelius spoke \nat a fundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice America.  Defendant Sebelius has long supported \nabortion rights and criticized Catholic teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and \ncontraception.  NARAL Pro-Choice America is a pro-abortion organization that likewise \nopposes many Catholic teachings.  At that fundraiser, Defendant Sebelius criticized \nindividuals and entities whose beliefs differed from those held by her and the other attendees \nof the NARAL Pro-Choice America fundraiser, stating: “Wouldn’t you think that people who \nwant to reduce the number of abortions would champion the cause of widely available, widely \naffordable contraceptive services?  Not so much.”  In addition, the U.S. Government Mandate \nwas modeled on a California law that was motivated by discriminatory intent against religious \ngroups that oppose contraception. \n157.  Consequently, Plaintiffs allege that the purpose of the U.S. Government \nMandate, including the narrow exemption, is to discriminate against religious institutions and \norganizations that oppose abortion and contraception. \nC.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not the Least Restrictive Means of Furthering a \nCompelling Governmental Interest \n158.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n159.  The Government has no compelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to violate their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs by requiring them to participate in a scheme for the provision \nof abortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraceptives, and related education and \ncounseling.  The Government itself has relieved numerous other employers from this \nrequirement by exempting grandfathered plans and plans of employers it deems to be \nsufficiently religious.  Moreover, these services are widely available in the United States.  The \n  43   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 44 of 59\n \nU.S. Supreme Court has held that individuals have a constitutional right to use such services.  \nAnd nothing that Plaintiffs do inhibits any individual from exercising that right.   \n160.  Even assuming the interest was compelling, the Government has numerous \nalternative means of furthering that interest without forcing Plaintiffs to violate their religious \nbeliefs.  For example, the Government could have provided or paid for the objectionable \nservices itself through other programs established by a duly enacted law.  Or, at a minimum, it \ncould have created a broader exemption for religious employers, such as those found in \nnumerous state laws throughout the country and in other federal laws.  The Government \ntherefore cannot possibly demonstrate that requiring Plaintiffs to violate their consciences is \nthe least restrictive means of furthering its interest. \n161.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, would simultaneously undermine \nboth religious freedom—a fundamental right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution—and access \nto the wide variety of social and educational services that Plaintiffs provide.  The Diocese \neducates inner-city children whose families want an alternative to the public school system \nand Plaintiffs St. Martin Center and Prince of Peace Center provides a range of social services \nto the citizens of Northwestern Pennsylvania.  Plaintiff Erie Catholic Preparatory School \ninstills the value of community service in its students.  As President Obama acknowledged in \nhis announcement of February 10, 2012, religious organizations like Plaintiffs do “more good \nfor a community than a government program ever could.”  The U.S. Government Mandate, \nhowever, puts these good works in jeopardy.  \n  44   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 45 of 59\n \n162.  That is unconscionable.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate cannot lawfully be applied to Plaintiffs, an injunction barring its \nenforcement, and an order vacating the U.S. Government Mandate. \nIV.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE THREATENS PLAINTIFFS WITH \nIMMINENT INJURY THAT SHOULD BE REMEDIED BY A COURT \n163.  The U.S. Government Mandate is causing serious, ongoing hardship to \nPlaintiffs that merits relief now. \n164.  On June 28, 2013, Defendants finalized the U.S. Government Mandate, \nincluding the narrow “religious employer” exemption and the so-called “accommodation” \nproposed in the NPRM.  By the terms of the Final Rule, Plaintiffs must comply with the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate by the beginning of the next plan year on or after January 1, 2014.   \n165.  While Plaintiffs’ next plan year begins on July 1, 2014, the next administrative \nyear for Plaintiffs’ health plans—that is the date by which all benefits for the July 1, 2014 \nplan year must be implemented—begins on January 1, 2014. \n166.  Defendants have indicated that they intend to enforce the essential provisions \nof the U.S. Government Mandate that impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ rights for \nPlaintiffs’ next plan year.  Consequently, absent the relief sought herein, Plaintiffs will be \nrequired to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to contraception, abortion-inducing \nproducts, sterilization, and related education and counseling, in violation of their sincerely-\nheld religious beliefs. \n167.  The U.S. Government Mandate is also harming Plaintiffs in other ways.   \n168.  Health plans do not take shape overnight.  A number of analyses, negotiations, \nand decisions must occur each year before Plaintiffs can offer a health benefits package to \n  45   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 46 of 59\n \ntheir employees.  For example, an employer that is self-insured—like the Diocese—after \nconsulting with its actuaries, must negotiate with its TPA.    \n169.  Under normal circumstances, Plaintiffs must begin the process of determining \ntheir health care package for a plan year at least one year before the plan year begins and must \nmake benefit determinations in advance of open enrollment for the January 1, 2014 \nadministrative year.  The multiple levels of uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Government \nMandate have made this already lengthy process even more complex and promulgation of the \nFinal Rule on June 28, 2013 has forced this complex process into an extremely compressed \ntimeframe.  \n170.  Restructuring the Diocesan health plan to expel nonexempt entities would \nrequire significant lead time.   \n171.  In addition, if Plaintiffs St. Martin Center and Erie Catholic Preparatory School \ndo not comply with the U.S. Government Mandate, they may be subject to government fines \nand penalties, which will in turn affect the Diocese as plan sponsor for the employees of \nSt. Martin Center and Erie Catholic Preparatory School.  Plaintiffs require time to budget for \nany such additional expenses.   \n172.  Additionally, the U.S. Government Mandate will impact donations in that a \nsignificant numbers of donors give to Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and \nErie Catholic Preparatory School because of their Catholic mission and will no longer donate \nif these organizations are forced to stray from that mission by providing coverage for the \nobjectionable services. \n173.  Plaintiffs therefore need judicial relief now in order to prevent the serious, \nongoing harm that the U.S. Government Mandate is already imposing on them. \n  46   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 47 of 59\n \nV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise  \nin Violation of RFRA \n174.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint.  \n175.  RFRA prohibits the Government from substantially burdening an entity’s \nexercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the \nGovernment demonstrates that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is \nthe least restrictive means of furthering that interest.  \n176.  RFRA protects organizations as well as individuals from Government-imposed \nsubstantial burdens on religious exercise. \n177.  RFRA applies to all federal law and the implementation of that law by any  \nbranch, department, agency, instrumentality, or official of the United States. \n178.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate access to products, services, practices, and speech that are contrary to their religious \nbeliefs.  \n179.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n180.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs \nto comply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n181.  Requiring Plaintiffs to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate is not the \nleast restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  \n182.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate against \nPlaintiffs, Defendants have violated RFRA.  \n  47   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 48 of 59\n \n183.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n184.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT II \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise in Violation of  \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \n185.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint.  \n186.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government \nfrom substantially burdening an entity’s exercise of religion. \n187.  The Free Exercise Clause protects organizations as well as individuals from \nGovernment-imposed burdens on religious exercise. \n188.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to their religious beliefs. \n189.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n190.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability, \nbecause it is riddled with exemptions for which there is not a consistent, legally defensible \nbasis.  It offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health plans \ninclude or facilitate access to abortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraception, and \nrelated education and counseling. \n191.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability \nbecause it was passed with discriminatory intent. \n  48   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 49 of 59\n \n192.  The U.S. Government Mandate implicates constitutional rights in addition to \nthe right to free exercise of religion, including, for example, the rights to free speech, free \nassociation, and freedom from excessive government entanglement with religion. \n193.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs \nto comply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n194.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n195.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate, the \nGovernment has burdened Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of the Free Exercise \nClause of the First Amendment.  \n196.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n197.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT III \nCompelled Speech in Violation of  \nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \n198.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint. \n199.  The First Amendment protects against the compelled affirmation of any \nreligious or ideological proposition that the speaker finds unacceptable. \n200.  The First Amendment protects organizations as well as individuals against \ncompelled speech. \n201.  Expenditures are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. \n202.  The First Amendment protects against the use of a speaker’s money to support \na viewpoint that conflicts with the speaker’s religious beliefs. \n  49   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 50 of 59\n \n203.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to provide health care \nplans to their employees that include or facilitate access to products and services that violate \ntheir religious beliefs.   \n204.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to subsidize, promote, \nand facilitate education and counseling services regarding these objectionable products and \nservices. \n205.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to issue a certification \nof its beliefs that, in turn, would result in the provision of objectionable products and services \nto Plaintiffs’ employees. \n206.  By imposing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants are compelling \nPlaintiffs to publicly subsidize or facilitate the activity and speech of private entities that are \ncontrary to their religious beliefs, and compelling Plaintiffs to engage in speech that will result \nin the provision of objectionable products and services to Plaintiffs’ employees. \n207.  The U.S. Government Mandate is viewpoint-discriminatory and subject to \nstrict scrutiny. \n208.  The U.S. Government Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest.  \n209.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n210.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n211.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT IV \nProhibition of Speech  \nin Violation of the First Amendment \n  50   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 51 of 59\n \n212.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint. \n213.  The First Amendment protects the freedom of speech, including the right of \nreligious groups to speak out to persuade others to refrain from engaging in conduct that may \nbe considered immoral. \n214.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates the First Amendment freedom of \nspeech by imposing a gag order that prohibits Plaintiffs from speaking out in any way that \nmight “influence,” “directly or indirectly,” the decision of a TPA to provide or procure \ncontraceptive products and services to Plaintiffs’ employees. \n215.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n216.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT V \nOfficial “Church” Favoritism and Excessive Entanglement with Religion  \nin Violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \n217.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint. \n218.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government \nfrom adopting an official definition of a “religious employer” that favors some religious \ngroups while excluding others. \n219.  The Establishment Clause also prohibits the Government from becoming \nexcessively entangled in the affairs of religious groups by scrutinizing their beliefs, practices, \nand organizational features to determine whether they meet the Government’s favored \ndefinition. \n  51   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 52 of 59\n \n220.  The “religious employer” exemption violates the Establishment Clause in two \nways.   \n221.  First, it favors some religious groups over others by creating an official \ndefinition of “religious employers.”  Religious groups that meet the Government’s official \ndefinition receive favorable treatment in the form of an exemption from the Mandate, while \nother religious groups do not. \n222.  Second, even if it were permissible for the Government to favor some religious \ngroups over others, the “religious employer” exemption would still violate the Establishment \nClause because it requires the Government to determine whether groups qualify as “religious \nemployers” based on intrusive judgments about their beliefs, practices, and organizational \nfeatures.  The exemption turns on an intrusive 14-factor test to determine whether a group \nmeets the requirements of section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the \nInternal Revenue Code.  These 14 factors probe into matters such as whether a religious group \nhas “a distinct religious history” or “a recognized creed and form of worship.”  But it is not \nthe Government’s place to determine whether a group’s religious history is “distinct,” or \nwhether the group’s “creed and form of worship” are “recognized.”  By directing the \nGovernment to partake of such inquiries, the “religious employer” exemption runs afoul of the \nEstablishment Clause prohibition on excessive entanglement with religion.  Similar problems \narise in evaluating whether an organization is an “integrated auxiliary,” an inquiry governed \nby Treasury Regulations that assesses, among other things whether an organization “shares \ncommon religious doctrines, principles, disciplines, or practices with a church,” or “receives \nmore than 50% of its support” from non-church sources.  See 26 C.F.R. § 1.6033-2(h). \n223.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n  52   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 53 of 59\n \n224.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT VI \nInterference in Matters of Internal Church Governance in Violation of  \nthe Religion Clauses of the First Amendment \n225.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint. \n226.  The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause and the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act protect the freedom of religious organizations to decide for \nthemselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of \nfaith and doctrine.     \n227.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, ministers, \nor doctrine.   \n228.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the \norganization itself. \n229.  Plaintiffs are religious organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic \nChurch.   \n230.  The Catholic Church views abortion, sterilization, and contraception as \nintrinsically immoral, and prohibits Catholic organizations from condoning or facilitating \nthose practices.     \n231.  Plaintiffs have abided and must continue to abide by the decision of the \nCatholic Church on these issues.     \n  53   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 54 of 59\n \n232.  The Government may not interfere with or otherwise question the final \ndecision of the Catholic Church that its religious organizations must abide by these views.       \n233.  Plaintiffs have therefore made the internal decision that the health plans they \noffer to their employees may not cover, subsidize, or facilitate abortion, sterilization, or \ncontraception. \n234.  The Diocese has further made the internal decision that its affiliated religious \nentities, including Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and Erie Catholic \nPreparatory School, should offer their employees health-insurance coverage through the \nDiocesan health plan, which allows the Diocese to ensure that these affiliates do not offer \ncoverage for services that are contrary to Catholic teaching. \n235.  The U.S. Government Mandate interferes with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \nconcerning their structure and mission by requiring them to facilitate practices that directly \nconflict with Catholic beliefs. \n236.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s interference with Plaintiffs’ internal \ndecisions affects their faith and mission by requiring them to facilitate practices that directly \nconflict with their religious beliefs.   \n237.  Because the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with the internal decision-\nmaking of Plaintiffs in a manner that affects Plaintiffs’ faith and mission, it violates the \nEstablishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act. \n238.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n239.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \n  54   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 55 of 59\n \nCOUNT VII \nIllegal Action in Violation of the APA \n240.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint.  \n241.  The APA requires that all Government agency action, findings, and \nconclusions be “in accordance with law.”   \n242.  The U.S. Government Mandate, its exemption for “religious employers,” and \nits so-called “accommodation” for “eligible” religious organizations are illegal and therefore \nin violation of the APA.   \n243.  The Weldon Amendment states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this \nAct [to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be \nmade available to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or government \nsubjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 \nStat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n244.  The Affordable Care Act contains no clear expression of an affirmative \nintention of Congress that employers with religiously motivated objections to the provision of \nhealth plans that include coverage for abortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraception, \nor related education and counseling should be required to provide such plans. \n245.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires employer-based health plans to \nprovide coverage for abortion-inducing products, contraception, sterilization, and related \neducation.  It does not permit employers or issuers to determine whether the plan covers \n  55   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 56 of 59\n \nabortion, as the Act requires.  By issuing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants have \nexceeded their authority, and ignored the direction of Congress. \n246.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates RFRA.  \n247.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates the First Amendment. \n248.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not in accordance with law and thus violates \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n249.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n250.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n251.  Defendants’ failure to act in accordance with law imposes an immediate and \nongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT VIII \nErroneous Interpretation of the Exemption with Respect to Multi-Employer Plans \n252.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this \nComplaint.  \n253.  The U.S. Government Mandate explicitly exempts “group health plan[s] \nestablished or maintained by a religious employer (and health insurance coverage provided in \nconnection with a group health plan established or maintained by a religious employer)” from \n“any requirement to cover contraceptive services.”  45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \n254.  In the ANPRM, Defendants acknowledged that the religious employer \nexemption was “available to religious employers in a variety of arrangements.”  77 Fed. Reg. \nat 16,502.   \n  56   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 57 of 59\n \n255.  Specifically, Defendants indicated that a nonexempt entity could “provide[] \nhealth coverage for its employees through” a plan offered by a separate, “affiliated” \norganization that is a “distinct common-law employer.”  Id.   \n256.  In such a situation, Defendants stated that if the “affiliated” organization was \n“exempt from the requirement to cover contraceptive services, then neither the [affiliated \norganization] nor the [nonexempt entity would be] required to offer contraceptive coverage to \nits employees.”  Id.   \n257.  This reading is consistent with the text of the regulation, which by its plain \nterms exempts “group health plan[s]” so long as they are “established or maintained by a \nreligious employer.”    \n258.  Nonetheless, when issuing the Final Rule, the Defendants reversed course, \nrejecting a “plan-based approach” and adopting an “employer-by-employer approach” \nwhereby “each employer [must] independently meet the definition of religious employer . . . \nin order to avail itself of the exemption.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,886. \n259.  An employer-based approach contradicts the plain text of the regulation, which \nexempts “group health plan[s],” not individual employers. \n260.  The Diocese meets the U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of a religious \nemployer, and therefore, the group health plan it has “established or maintained” is exempt \nfrom providing coverage for abortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraception, and \nrelated education and counseling. \n261.  The Defendants erroneous interpretation of the religious employer exemption, \nhowever, precludes the Diocese’s affiliated entities, including Plaintiff Catholic Charities, \n  57   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 58 of 59\n \nfrom obtaining the benefit of the exemption by participating in the exempt group health plan \nestablished and maintained by the Diocese. \n262.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n263.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n264.  Defendants’ erroneous interpretation  imposes an immediate and ongoing harm \non Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court:   \n1.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiffs’ rights under RFRA; \n2.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiffs’ rights under the First Amendment; \n3.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  was \npromulgated in violation of the APA; \n4.  In  the  alternative,  enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants  have \nerroneously interpreted the scope of the religious employer exemption, and that \nnonexempt  organizations  may  obtain  the  benefit  of  the  religious  employer \nexemption if they provide insurance through a group health plan established \nand maintained by a religious employer. \n5.  Enter  an  injunction  prohibiting  the  Defendants  from  enforcing  the  U.S. \nGovernment Mandate against Plaintiffs; \n6.  Enter an order vacating the U.S. Government Mandate; \n  58   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 1   Filed 10/08/13   Page 59 of 59\n \n7.  Award Plaintiffs attorneys’ and expert fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n8.  Award all other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \nRespectfully submitted, this the 8th day of October, 2013. \n           \n_/s/ Paul M. Pohl________________________ \nPaul M.

NO. 18 IN 13cv1459 AND DOC. NO. 23 IN 13cv0303) \n \nPresently before the Court are Defendants’ Motions for Reassignment filed in the above-\ncaptioned cases which contend that these cases are not related to case number 13cv0930, the \nFOIA case assigned to the undersigned, and thus, the two above-captioned cases should be \nrandomly reassigned.  See doc. no. 23 in case number 13cv0303, and doc. no. 18 in case number \n13cv1459. \nWhen counsel for Plaintiffs filed the two above-captioned cases, counsel indicated on the \ncivil cover sheets that these cases were related to “2:13-cv-930; 1:12-cv-123” and “2:13-cv-930; \n2:12-cv-676.” See doc. no. 1-1 in case number 13cv303, and doc. no. 1-1 in case number 13-\n1459, respectfully.   \nCase number 13cv0930 (an open civil case) is assigned to the undersigned, case number \n12cv0123 (a closed case) was assigned to former Chief Judge Sean J. McLaughlin, and case \nnumber 12cv0676 (a closed civil case) was assigned to Judge Terrence F. McVerry.    \nFormer Chief Judge McLaughlin is no longer an active United States District Court \nJudge, and thus, was not eligible to be assigned either or both of the above-captioned cases.  \nJudge McVerry recently took Senior Status, and as a Senior Judge of the Western District, he \nexercised his option to decline to be assigned any additional civil cases until (at least) January1, \n2014.  Accordingly, given the notations made by Plaintiffs on their civil cover sheets, the Clerk’s \nOffice assigned the case to the undersigned. \nDefendants’ Motions claim that the two above-captioned cases are not related to \n13cv0930, and contend that these two cases should have been randomly assigned when filed, and \nnow, randomly reassigned to another Judge.  The undersigned referred this matter to the \n-2- \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00303-AJS   Document 29   Filed 10/30/13   Page 3 of 3\nStanding Committee of the Board of Judges responsible for “Clerk’s Office/Assignment.”  Said \nCommittee, after deliberation, decided that the undersigned should decide Defendants’ Motions.   \nThis Court finds that these two cases are related to 13cv0930, in that 13cv0930 “involves \nthe same issues of fact” and/or “grows out of the same transactions.”  See Local Rule 40(D)(2).  \nAll three cases (the FOIA case and the two above-referenced cases) generally relate to Plaintiffs’ \nobjections to the regulations promulgated by The United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services pursuant to the Affordable Care Act.   \nFurther, this Court has already held an extensive Status Conference with counsel on the \ntwo above-captioned cases, established an agreed-to briefing schedule, and will conduct the \nExpedited Preliminary Injunction Hearing on November 12 and 13, 2013, with a decision to \npromptly follow, thereby enabling any aggrieved party to file an appeal to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit before the January 1, 2014, the effective date of said \nregulations.   \nTherefore, Defendants’ Motions for Reassignment (doc. no. 18 in 13cv1459 and doc. \nno. 23 in 13cv0303) are hereby DENIED. \n \n \n          SO ORDERED, this 30th day of October, 2013 \n \n          s/ Arthur J.

Hargan,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services; R. Alexander  Acosta, in \nhis official capacity as Secretary of Labor; Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Treasury; the United States Department of Health and Human Services; \nthe United States Department ofLabor; and the United States Department of the Treasury \n(the \"Government\" or the \"Departments\") (collectively, the \"Parties\"). \nRECITALS \nWHEREAS,  there  is  now  pending a  series of  lawsuits  listed  in  Exhibit  B \n(collectively, the \"Litigation'\") in which Plaintiffs allege that the Government has, among \nother things,  violated  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act  (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb-I  et seq., by  promulgating and enforcing regulations  pursuant to 42  U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13 that required Plaintiffs to take actions that facilitated the  provision, through \nor in connection with their  health  plans, of Food and Drug Administration-approved \ncontraceptive methods and abortifacients, as wel I as sterilization procedures and related \npatient education and  counseling to which Plaintiffs object on religious grounds (\"the \nObjectionable Coverage\").

Reg. 8,351 (Jan. 20, 2017). \nWHEREAS, after years of litigation, the Supreme Court considered the claims \nm  these cases and, instead of resolving the legal issues, remanded the cases to allow the \nparties  to \"resolve any outstanding issues between them.\"  Zubik v.  Burwell, 136 S. Ct. \n1557, 1560(2016). \nWHEREAS, the Supreme Court's remand orders provided that \"the Government \nmay not impose taxes or penalties on [Plaintiffs] for failure to provide the ...  notice\" \nrequired by the Regulations.  Id. at 1561. \nWHEREAS, the  new regulations, the Supreme Court's remand order, and the \nPresident's Executive Orders have placed this litigation in an extraordinary posture. \nWHEREAS,  it is the desire of the  Parties to resolve finally and permanently all \ndisputes, asserted or unasserted, arising out of, or related to the matters set forth, alleged, \nembraced by, or otherwise referred to in  the Litigation. \nNOW THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the  Recitals and  mutual  promises \ncontained herein, including the discontinuation of the pending Litigation, and for other \ngood and valuable consideration hereby deemed received, the Parties agree as follows: \nTERMS OF AGREEMENT \nI.  The  Paities agree  that, under the Supreme Court's decision  in  Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), the Affordable Care Act's \"contraceptive \nmandate.\" if applied as set out in 26 C.F.R. § 54.98 l 5-27 l 3(a)(l )(iv) (July 19, 2010),  29 \nC.F.R. §2590.715- 2713(a)(l)(iv) (July 19, 2010), and 45 C.F.R.  §  147.130(a)(l)(iv) (July \n3of10 \n\n19, 2010), would .. impose(] a substantial burden on [Plaintiffs'] exercise of religion,\" id. \nat  2779, and  \"violate[]  RFRA,\" id.  at  2785. The Government therefore agrees that the \n\"contraception mandate\" as described  in  Hobby lobby cannot be  legally enforced. under \nRFRA, against Plaintiffs or their health plans. \n2.  The Government agrees, with respect to all  Plaintiffs, to abide by the terms of \nthe permanent injunction in Zubik v.  Sebelius, 13-cv-1459,  l 3-cv-303. 2013 WL  6922024 \n(W.D.  Pa. Dec.  20, 2013),  as  it  relates to the Objectionable  Coverage.  The Government \naccordingly will treat Plaintiffs and their health plans, including their insurance issuers and/or \nthird  party  administrators  in  connection  with  those  health  plans,  as  exempt  from  the \nRegulations or any materially similar regulation or agency  policy.  A materially similar \nregulation or agency policy includes any requirement that Plaintiffs, their insurance issuers, or \ntheir third-pa11y  administrators provide any of the Objectionable Coverage through or in \nconnection with Plaintiffs' health plans, which means: \na.  Plaintiffs (and their insurers and third-party administrators acting in connection \nwith  Plaintiffs'  health  plans)  may  provide  health  coverage  without  the \nObjectionable  Coverage,  and  no  procedure  for  providing  any  of  the \nObjectionable Coverage may require any action by Plaintiffs; \nb.  If the Objectionable Coverage is provided, it may not be provided as part of any \nhealth plan sponsored by Plaintiffs,  but instead must be  provided through a \nseparate and distinct health plan or other arrangement that is separate and distinct \nfrom Plaintiffs' health plan; \n4of10 \n\nc.  Plaintiffs or their health plans may not be required to pay for the provision of the \nObjectionable Coverage, either directly or indirectly (though Plaintiffs are not \nexcused from paying generally applicable taxes); \nd.  An insurance or health plan card issued in conjunction with Plaintiffs' health \nplans may not be used by any person to obtain any of the products or services \nincluded  within  the  Objectionable  Coverage,  or payment  or  reimbursement \ntherefor: \ne.  No  person  may  receive  the  Objectionable  Coverage  as  an  automatic \nconsequence of enrollment in any health plan sponsored by Plaintiffs; \nf.  If the Government seeks to provide the Objectionable Coverage to individuals \nparticipating  in  Plaintiffs' health plans,  such  provision may  only be through \nseparate enrollments by those individuals in a separate and distinct health plan \nor other separate and distinct arrangement to obtain the Objectionable Coverage; \nand \ng.  Any  communications  regarding  the  Objectionable  Coverage,  other  than \ndisclosures in plan documents required by federal  law that the Objectionable \nCoverage is not covered by the plan or notice provided for in footnote I of this \nagreement, must be separate from communications relating to Plaintiffs' health \nplans. \n3.  The Government further agrees to withdraw any  letters sent to Plaintiffs· \nissuers and/or third-party administrators. pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §2590.715-2713A and 45 \n5 of I 0 \n\nC.F.R.  § 147.131, as  they  relate to  the  provision of any of the Objectionable Coverage \nwithin 14 days of the effective date of this agreement.1 \n4.  The Government further agrees, in  light of interim relief ordered  by several \ncourts. including the Supreme Court  in  Zubik, that neither Plaintiffs that are  party to  this \nAgreement nor their health plans, insurers, or third-party administrators acting in connection \nwith Plaintiffs' health plans shall be subject to any penalties or other adverse consequences, \nsince August 2011, as a result of their non-comp Ii ance with any law or regulation requiring the \nprovision of the Objectionable Coverage that the government is prohibited from enforcing by \nthe terms of this agreement. \n5.  Notwithstanding this Agreement, the Plaintiffs retain their full  legal rights to \nchallenge any new law, regulation, or other requirement that the government may enact or \nimpose relating to the provision of Objectionable Coverage and to challenge or defend against \nsuch action on any grounds they choose (including the Constitution, federal law, and/or this \nAgreement). Nothing herein shall  be construed as an admission or indication that any law, \nregulation, or other requirement would be lawful or unobjectionable to Plaintiffs. \n6.  The Parties agree to resolve all  proceedings identified above and to file such \npapers as are necessary to terminate the Litigation.  In all cases where appeals are currently \npending, the parties will file dismissals of appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure \n1 The  effective  date  of the withdrawal  may  be contingent on proper  notice  being  given  to \nparticipants. If contraception coverage  is currently  being  offered  by  an  issuer or third-party \nadministrator. the cessation of coverage would be effective no sooner than the first day of the first \nplan year that begins thirty days after the date of this Settlement Agreement (to allow for the \nprovision of notice to plan participants in cases where contraceptive benefits will no longer be \nprovided). Alternatively, sixty-days advance notice may be given pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 300gg \nl 5(d)(4) if applicable. \n6of10 \n\n42(b). After the appeals are dismissed, the parties agree that they will jointly file stipulations of \ndismissal or motions for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 (a), except in cases \nwhere there is a final judgment in the district court. This agreement shall not be effective until \nthe Parties file dismissals of all appeals currently pending. \n7.  The Government agrees to pay Plaintiffs $3 million in costs and fees. \n8.  The Parties agree that this Agreement constitutes a good-faith settlement of the \nLitigation for good and valuable consideration and acknowledge that it is entered into freely \nand voluntarily. \n9.  The Parties further agree that this Agreement has been fully read and understood \nby them, and that each of them has received independent legal advice from their respective \nattorney(s) as to the effect and  import of its provisions. The Parties  further agree that this \nAgreement is being entered into for the express purpose and intention of making and entering \ninco a full and final compromise, adjustment, and settlement of all claims which were or could \nhave been asserted in the Litigation, whether or not referred to therein. \nI 0.  This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between Plaintiffs and \nthe Government. and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and discussions between \nthe Parties with respect to the subject matter covered hereby. It is expressly understood and \nagreed that this Agreement may not be  altered, amended, waived, modified, or otherwise \nchanged except by writing, duly executed by authorized representatives of Plaintiffs and the \nGovernment, respectively. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that they will make no \nclaim at any time or place that this Agreement has been orally supplemented, modified, or \naltered. \n7of 10 \n\n11.  A II signatories represent that they have authority to enter into this Agreement on \nbehalf of their respective clients. \n12.
