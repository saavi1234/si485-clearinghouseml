    "summary": "<p>On August 11, 2016, the Women's Liberation Front (\"WoLF\") - an unincorporated association of radical feminists dedicated to the total liberation of women and fighting to end male violence, regain reproductive sovereignty for women, and preserve women-only spaces - filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. The plaintiff sued the Department of Justice, alleging that the Department's May 13 Guidance, which required schools to provide restrooms and locker rooms on the basis of sex, but allowed transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity, violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1872, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the May 13 Guidance violated the express terms of Title IX, which provides women with their own facilities, by expanding the definition of \"sex\" beyond its biological definition, and equating its definition with the definition of \"gender identity.\"</p><p>On October 24, 2016, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On October 31, 2016, WoLF filed a motion to stay, which was granted by Magistrate Judge William P. Lynch on November 2, 2016, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14977\">Gloucester County School Board v. G.G.</a>, which was expected to address the proper interpretation of Title IX and its coverage of trans students. However, on January 20, 2017, Donald Trump became President of the United States. His administration refused to support the previous DOJ's efforts to protect trans students from discrimination. Therefore, before the Supreme Court could hear <i>Gloucester County School Board v G.G.</i>, the Department of Justice withdrew the May 13 Guidance. </p><p>With the defendant's withdrawal of the May 13 Guidance, the plaintiff no longer had a legal claim in this suit. So, on March 16, 2017, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its complaint. Because voluntary dismissals are without prejudice, the plaintiff can file another case case if the Department of Justice were to reinstate the May 13 Guidance.</p>",

KING, JR., \nin his official capacity as United States   \nSecretary of Education,       \n             \n    Defendants. \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis action arises out of Defendants’ May 13, 2016 “Guidance document” mandating \nthat every public school and university in the United States unconditionally admit men to \nwomen’s bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms and other facilities, in violation of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, and \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. \nPARTIES \n \n1. Plaintiff Women’s Liberation Front (“WoLF”) is an unincorporated association of \nradical feminists dedicated to the total liberation of women fighting to, among other \nthings, end male violence, regain reproductive sovereignty for women, and preserve \nwomen-only spaces.  Defendants’ actions injure WoLF because Defendants’ policies \nwill result in WoLF members having to share with men restrooms, locker rooms, \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 2 of 15\nchanging areas, and other private spaces that Congress mandated shall be exclusively \nfor use by women.      \n2. Defendant United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is an executive agency of the \nUnited States government and is responsible for the enforcement of Title IX of the \nEducational Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688 (“Title IX”), and its \nimplementing regulations. \n3.  Defendant Loretta E. Lynch is the Attorney General of the United States, and is \nresponsible for the operation and management of DOJ.  Defendant Lynch is sued in her \nofficial capacity only. \n4. Defendant Vanita Gupta is Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General at DOJ, and \nacting head of the Civil Rights Division of DOJ. She is responsible for enforcing Title IX. \n28 C.F.R. § 42.412. She is sued in her official capacity only. \n5. Defendant United States Department of Education (“DOE”) is an executive agency of \nthe United States government and is responsible for the administration and enforcement \nof Title IX, and promulgation, administration and enforcement of its implementing \nregulations. \n6. Defendant John B. King, Jr., is the United States Secretary of Education and is \nresponsible for the operation and management of DOE.  Defendant King is sued in his \nofficial capacity only. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1683 and 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1361. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 3 of 15\n8.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the United \nStates, several of its agencies, and several of its officers in their official capacity are \nDefendants and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s \nclaims occurred in this District. \nFACTS \nTitle IX \n9.  Title IX provides, with specific exceptions, that “No person in the United States shall, \non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance”.  20 U.S.C. § 1681.1 \n10.  Congress enacted Title IX (Pub. L. 92-318) in order to reverse decades of \npervasive and invidious discrimination against women at every level of the U.S. \neducational system.  \n11. Title IX explicitly allows institutions to provide separate facilities for men and women, \ne.g., “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, nothing \ncontained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving \nfunds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.” \n20 U.S.C. § 1686.  As Senator Birch Bayh, who had introduced this legislation, \nexplained, “What we are trying to do is provide equal access for women and men \n                                                            \n1 Unless otherwise noted, Plaintiff uses the term “male,” “female” and “sex” to indicate \none’s genetic sex as determined by one’s chromosomes, birth anatomy, gametes, and \nreproductive system.  See, e.g., Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) (“DSM-5”) (“[S]ex and sexual refer to the \nbiological indicators of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive \ncapacity), such as in sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous \ninternal and external genitalia.”).  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 4 of 15\nstudents to the educational process and the extracurricular activities in a school, where \nthere is not a unique facet such as football involved. We are not requiring that \nintercollegiate football be desegregated, nor that the men’s locker room be \ndesegregated.” 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971) (emphasis added). \n12.  Senator Bayh was equally clear as to the scope of Title IX’s grant of authority to \nfederal agencies, “These regulations would allow enforcing agencies to permit \ndifferential treatment by sex only . . . such as in classes for pregnant girls or emotionally \ndisturbed students, in sports facilities or other instances where personal privacy must be \npreserved.”   118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (1972) (emphasis added). \n13. Congress knows full well how to extend federal protections based on gender \nidentity, and uses just that phrase when doing so.  For example, in 2009 Congress \nincluded “gender identity” as one of the motivations that constituted a hate crime (Public \nLaw 111-84; 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2)).  And in using “gender identity” for the first time, \nCongress did so as a separate, defined term: “the term ‘gender identity’ means actual or \nperceived gender-related characteristics.”   16 U.S.C. § 249(c)(4).   \n14. In 2013 Congress added the term “gender identity” (and explicitly incorporating the \ndefinition in the 2009 statute) to the list of impermissible bases for discrimination under \nthe Violence Against Women Act. Public Law 113-4; 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A).  \nCongress could have amended the VAWA to define “sex” to include “gender identity”.  \nBut Congress did not do so: once again, it added “gender identity” as a separate item in \naddition to “sex”: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of actual or perceived race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity (as defined in paragraph \n249(c)(4) of title 18), sexual orientation, or disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 5 of 15\nany program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available \nunder the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 [etc.].   42 U.S.C. § \n13925(b)(13)(A)(emphases added). \n \n And immediately after subsection (b)(13)(A) came subsection (b)(13)(B), entitled \n“Exception”: \n \nIf sex segregation or sex-specific programming is necessary to the essential \noperation of a program, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent any such program \nor activity from consideration of an individual’s sex. In such circumstances, \ngrantees may meet the requirements of this paragraph by providing comparable \nservices to individuals who cannot be provided with the sex-segregated or sex-\nspecific programming. \n \nThus, Congress could not have been any clearer that the term “gender identity”, did not \nmean the same thing as “sex”.    \n15.  In addition to its positive enactments, Congress has repeatedly affirmed that “sex” \nas used in Title IX means only biological sex, as evidenced by repeated attempts to \nexpand the protections of Title IX and other civil rights laws to include various \nformulations beyond biological “sex”.  For example, in 2013 and 2015, proposals were \nspecifically made to add “gender identity” to Title IX as a protected category. H.R. 1652, \n113th Cong. (2013); S.439, 114th Cong. (2015). Each of these proposals was based on \nthe explicit understanding that as used in Title VII, Title IX, and other civil rights laws \nthat “sex,” as a protected class, referred only to biological sex: “While federal civil rights \nstatutes clearly address discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, \ndisability, and national origin, they do not explicitly include sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.”  Statement of Senator Al Franken, sponsor of S.439. \n16. Congress rejected each of these attempts to add “gender identity” protections to the \nvarious civil rights laws, including Title IX. \nDOE’s Title IX Regulations \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 6 of 15\n17. DOE has promulgated and amended its Title IX regulations seven times since it was \nenacted in 1972.  Not once, in any regulatory preamble, did DOE even mention the \nconcept of “gender identity”, let alone equate it with the term “sex” as used either in the \nstatute or in DOE’s own regulations.   See, 45 FR 30955, May 9, 1980; 45 FR 37426, \nJune 3, 1980; 45 FR 86298, Dec. 30, 1980; 47 FR 32527, July 28, 1982; 65 FR 68056, \nNov. 13, 2000; 71 FR 62530, October 26, 2006; 71 FR 62542, October 25, 2006.   \n18. DOE’s own regulations recognize the binary nature of “sex”, e.g., that separate, sex-\nsegregated “toilet, locker room, and shower facilities” are appropriate, so long as “such \nfacilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided \nfor students of the other sex” (34 C.F.R. § 106.33) and “A recipient may make \npreemployment inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for employment, but only if such \ninquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such \ninquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by this part” (34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.60(b)).    \n19. Indeed, DOE explicitly recognizes that sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification \nin terms of who may be employed in locker rooms and toilet facilities: \nA recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by this subpart provided it is \nshown that sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for that action, such that \nconsideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful \noperation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action \npursuant to this section which is based upon alleged comparative employment \ncharacteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon \npreference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, \nbut nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an \nemployee’s sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used \nonly by members of one sex.  \n \n34 C.F.R. § 106.61 (emphasis added).  \n \nThe May 13 Guidance \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 7 of 15\n20. Notwithstanding the undisturbed understanding that both Congress in its statutes \nand DOE in its regulations did not mean “sex” to include “gender identity”, on May 13, \n2016, Defendants issued “guidance” that summarizes, “a school’s Title IX obligations \nregarding transgender students and explains how the U.S. Department of Education \n(ED) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) evaluate a school’s compliance with \nthese obligations” (the “May 13 Guidance”).  21. The May 13 Guidance announced that \nTitle IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination also “encompasses discrimination based on a \nstudent’s gender identity, including discrimination based on a student’s transgender \nstatus”.   The May 13 Guidance mandates that, “Unless expressly authorized by Title IX \nor its implementing regulations, a school may not segregate or otherwise distinguish \nstudents on the basis of their sex, including gender identity, in any school activities or \nthe application of any school rule.” \n22. Of specific concern to WoLF is the May 13 Guidance’s requirement that for \nrestrooms and locker rooms, “A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of \nsex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their \ngender identity.” \n23. According to the May 13 Guidance, “when a student or the student’s parent or \nguardian, as appropriate, notifies the school administration that the student will assert a \ngender identity that differs from previous representations or records, the school will \nbegin treating the student consistent with the student’s gender identity.”  The May 13 \nGuidance does not state when it is “appropriate” for a guardian -- as opposed to the \nstudent -- to make this notification, nor what form this notification must take.  Nor does \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 8 of 15\nthe May 13 Guidance place any temporal bounds on such notification: A student is \nutterly free to change such “gender identity” on a daily – or even hourly – basis.  \n24. Even more frightening – if possible -- the May 13 Guidance does not require any \nnotification at all to the school for school administrators, teachers, or visitors to use \nfacilities consistent with their “gender identity”.  Without even notice to the women and \ngirls who use a school or university restroom, locker room, etc., with the stroke of a pen \nDefendants have now mandated that men are simply free to use those places. \n25. By equating “sex” with “gender identity”, the May 13 Guidance overturned the \nexpress language of Title IX, the intent and expectation of Congress as set out in Title \nIX, and the language and intent expressed in the Title IX regulations that “sex” \nexclusively meant biological sex.   Moreover, the May 13 Guidance does this without \nciting to an administrative record or any other factual support or evidence, or indeed, \ngiving any explanation at all of how Defendants reached the conclusion that “sex” is the \nsame as “gender identity”.  Defendants’ unilateral decree that women are not, as has \nbeen understood since the dawn of time, people who are biologically female, but \nanyone who, for any reason or no reason at all, choose to so describe themselves at \nany given time, is an arbitrary and breathtakingly irresponsible action that denies every \nfemale’s biological and social reality.        \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 9 of 15\nThe Impact of the May 13 Guidance on WoLF’s Members \n26.  AB is 15 years old, and attends a public school in New Mexico.2  AB has been a \nWoLF member since June, 2016.  AB’s parent (“AB’s Mother”) has been a WoLF \nmember since February, 2015. \n27. According to DOE, New Mexico elementary and secondary schools received \napproximately $355 million in federal funding in 2015, and DOE estimates that they will \nreceive approximately $368 million in such funding in 2016.  AB’s school reports that it \nreceives federal funding “every year”.  \n28. Because of AB’s school federal funding, Defendants insist that AB’s school \nimplement the May 13 Guidance or face legal sanctions.  On information and belief, \nAB’s school will implement the May 13 Guidance, or be ordered to implement the May \n13 Guidance by appropriate New Mexico education officials, in order to avoid loss of \nthose federal funds. \n29. Because the May 13 Guidance allows any male student (based solely on a \ndeclaration that he “identifies” as female), and any male teacher, administrator, or visitor \ncompletely free, unfettered and unsupervised access to women’s restrooms, locker \nrooms, or other areas (such as overnight accommodations and theatrical changing \nrooms), both AB and AB’s Mother have a well-founded fear that AB will be compelled to \nshare such facilities with people who are biologically male.   \n30. Because of her biology and bodily functions, AB has different requirements for, and \nexpectations of, privacy and safety in restrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, etc., as \n                                                            \n2 “AB” are not her actual initials; use of her actual initials would place her privacy and \npersonal security at risk.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 10 of 15\ncompared to men.  As a female she is more vulnerable to assault or rape (including \nimpregnation) when she is in isolated or closed areas with men.  As a result, AB and \nAB’s Mother value the privacy and safety offered by restrooms, changing rooms, locker \nrooms, and other spaces specifically designated for women.  \n31. The May 13 Guidance has materially increased AB’s risk of such assault not only by \nallowing men free and unfettered access to these spaces, but also by essentially \nrepealing the New Mexico criminal statutes that protect women in these places and \nproviding a complete defense for any man who previously would have been guilty of \neither “Indecent exposure” (“knowingly and intentionally exposing his primary genital \narea to public view” (NMS 30-9-14(A)), or  “Voyeurism” (“to view . . . the intimate areas \nof another person without the knowledge and consent of that person . . . while the \nperson is in the interior of a bedroom, bathroom, changing room, fitting room, dressing \nroom or tanning booth or the interior of any other area in which the person has a \nreasonable expectation of privacy” (NMS 30-9-20(A)(1)).  \n32.  AB and AB’s Mother do not want men sharing such facilities with AB.  They fear not \nonly the increased risk of sexual assault on AB, but the embarrassment, humiliation, \nanxiety, and loss of personal dignity because they will have to share such intimate \nspaces with men while in various stages of undress.  Each of AB’s injuries is imminent, \ntraceable to the May 13 Guidance and redressable by this Court. \n33. AB’s Mother attends a public university in New Mexico. \n34. According to DOE, New Mexico post-secondary educational institutions received \napproximately $205 million in federal funding in 2015, and DOE estimates that they will \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 11 of 15\nreceive approximately $203 million in 2016. AB’s Mother’s university reports receiving \nmillions of dollars of that federal funding in 2015. \n35.   Because of this federal funding, Defendants insist that the university implement the \nMay 13 Guidance or face legal sanctions.  On information and belief, AB’s Mother’s \nuniversity will implement the May 13 Guidance, or be ordered to implement the May 13 \nGuidance by appropriate New Mexico education officials, in order to avoid loss of those \nfederal funds. \n36. Because the May 13 Guidance allows any male student (based solely on a \ndeclaration that he “identifies” as female), and any male teacher, administrator, or visitor \ncompletely free, unfettered and unsupervised access to women’s restrooms, locker \nrooms, or other areas (such as theatrical changing rooms) AB’s Mother has a well-\nfounded fear that she will be compelled to share such facilities with people who are \nbiologically male. \n37. Because of her biology and bodily functions, AB’s Mother has different requirements \nfor, and expectations of, privacy and safety in restrooms, locker rooms, changing \nrooms, etc., as compared to men.  As a female she is more vulnerable to assault or \nrape (including impregnation) when she is in isolated or closed areas with men.  As a \nresult, AB’s Mother values the privacy and safety offered by restrooms, changing \nrooms, locker rooms, and other spaces specifically designated for women. \n38. The May 13 Guidance has materially increased AB’s Mother’s risk of such assault \nnot only by allowing men free and unfettered access to these spaces, but also by \nessentially repealing New Mexico criminal statutes that protect women in these places \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 12 of 15\nand providing a complete defense for any man who previously would have been guilty \nof either “Indecent exposure” (NMS 30-9-14(A)), or “Voyeurism” (NMS 30-9-20(A)(1)). \n39. AB’s Mother does not want men sharing such facilities with her.  She fears not only \nthe increased risk of sexual assault, but the embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, and \nloss of personal dignity that she will endure because she will have to share such \nintimate spaces with men while in various stages of undress. Each of AB’s Mother’s \ninjuries is imminent, traceable to the May 13 Guidance and redressable by this Court. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act: \n Rulemaking Without Required Procedure \n \n40. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-39 as if fully set forth herein. \n41. The May 13 Guidance is final agency action in the form of a legislative rule that \nDefendants adopted without the required notice and comment procedure required by 5 \nU.S.C. § 553, and thus was thus agency action taken without observance of procedure \nrequired by law, in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nCOUNT TWO \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act:  \nAgency Action in Excess of Statutory Authority \n \n42. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-41 as if fully set forth herein. \n43. By compelling women to share restrooms, locker rooms, and other similar areas \nwith men, the May 13 Guidance is final agency action that violates the express terms, \nplain meaning and legislative intent of Title IX, which is to provide women with their own \nfacilities, and was thus promulgated in excess of statutory authority and limitations, in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 13 of 15\nCOUNT THREE \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act:  \nAgency Action in Excess of Statutory Authority \n \n44. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1- 43 as if fully set forth herein. \n45. By expanding the scope of the term “sex” as used in Title IX and its implementing \nregulations beyond the biological definition of “sex” by equating “sex” with “gender \nidentity”, the May 13 Guidance is final agency action that is contrary to the express \nterms, and plain meaning, of the statute and was thus promulgated in excess of \nstatutory authority and limitations in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \nCOUNT FOUR \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act:  \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n \n46. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-45 as if fully set forth herein. \n47. Because there is no factual record or other basis from which Defendants could \nconclude that “sex” is the same as “gender identity”, the May 13 Guidance is arbitrary \nand capricious final agency action in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nCOUNT FIVE \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act:  \nAgency Action in Excess of Statutory Authority \n \n48. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-47 as if fully set forth herein. \n49. New Mexico criminal law makes both “Indecent exposure” (“knowingly and \nintentionally exposing his primary genital area to public view” (NMS 30-9-14(A)), and \n“Voyeurism” (“to view . . . the intimate areas of another person without the knowledge \nand consent of that person . . . while the person is in the interior of a bedroom, \nbathroom, changing room, fitting room, dressing room or tanning booth or the interior of \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 14 of 15\nany other area in which the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy” (NMS 30-\n9-20(A)(1)) crimes.   \n50. By mandating that biological males be given free and unfettered access to women’s \nprivate spaces (including the very spaces listed in the Voyeurism statute), the May 13 \nGuidance is final agency action that overrides New Mexico criminal law, creates an \nabsolute defense to any criminal charges under these statutes, and deprives WoLF’s \nmembers of the protection of these laws.  Because nothing in Title IX allows Defendants \nto do so, the May 13 Guidance was thus promulgated in excess of statutory authority \nand limitations, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \nCOUNT SIX \nViolation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments: \nViolation of the Constitutional Guarantees of Bodily Privacy \n \n51.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-50 as if fully set forth herein. \n52.  The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee certain fundamental rights, \nincluding the right to bodily privacy.   \n53.  By mandating that schools must allow men access to women’s restrooms, locker \nrooms, changing rooms, and similar spaces reserved for women, Defendants have \nviolated the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of the fundamental right to bodily privacy and \nare compelling the State of New Mexico to violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nguarantee of the fundamental right to bodily privacy. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief: \nA. Declare that the May 13 Guidance was agency action taken without observance of \nprocedure required by law; \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00915-WPL-KBM   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   Page 15 of 15\nB. Declare that the May 13 Guidance was agency action promulgated in excess of \nstatutory authority and limitations; \nC.  Declare that the May 13 Guidance violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ \nguarantees of the fundamental right to bodily privacy; \nD. Temporarily and permanently enjoin the Defendants from implementing, applying, or \nenforcing the May 13 Guidance;  \nE. Award Plaintiff its attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses; and \nF.
