    "summary": "<p>On June 21, 2016, individuals who had been subject to a $50 \"extension fee\" for inability to pay their monetary penalties in full, under threat that they would otherwise go to jail for non-payment of court fines and costs, brought this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued the Bogalusa City Court and the sole judge who sits on the Bogalusa City Court for violations of their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They claimed that the defendants: systematically jailed and threatened to jail individuals who cannot pay fines and court costs that were used to fund expenditures of the city court; and have created an illegal extension fee to generate additional revenue. </p><p>Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, as well as to certify a class and subclass for equitable relief and a separate class for damages. The class for equitable relief was to be defined as \"all individuals who will appear in the Bogalusa City Court for criminal cases or who have unpaid fines and costs assessed by and opened by the City Court. The Subclass was to be defined as \"all individuals who were or will be adjudicated guilty in the Bogalusa City Court, who have been worn will be given a future date by which to return to City Court, and who have not paid the assessed fines and costs in full prior to returning to City Court.\" The class seeking damages included those individuals who paid an extension fee between June 22, 2015 to the time of the complaint. </p><p>In a June 23, 2016 order, U.S. District Court Judge Ivan L.R. Lemelle denied the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, and held their request for a preliminary injunction in abeyance. Shortly thereafter, the parties agreed to explore a possible settlement.</p><p>As settlement negotiations were getting under way, the parties reached an interim agreement, which they filed on June 27, 2016. Once approved by the Court, it was to govern the next 75 days. During this time period, the defendant judge agreed not to incarcerate any Bogalusa City Court defendant on the sole basis of nonpayment of fines or costs or contempt fee, nor assess or collect (i) any court cost authorized by La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899; (ii) any “extension fees” or similar payments required by the City Court to allow a defendant additional time to pay court debt; or (iii) any contempt fees that are retained by the City Court and deposited into the City Court’s judicial expense account.</p><p>In addition, for the same interim time period, the defendant judge agreed to provide to the plaintiffs’ counsel a copy of daily jail logs for the Bogalusa City Jail, and an up-to-date copy of the Bogalusa City Court’s “Criminal Account-Citizens Income Statement.” Both parties agreed to submit a joint written status report in 45 days to report on the status of settlement discussions and the parties’ respective positions on how the Court should proceed with the pending motions for preliminary injunction and class certification. This agreement was repeatedly renewed through motions to continue until the parties reached a full settlement on September 5, 2017.</p><p>On June 28, 2016, Judge Lemelle granted the joint motion and further ordered that the plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class and their Motion for Preliminary Injunction to be dismissed without prejudice. </p><p>On January 17, 2017, plaintiffs amended their complaint with allegations that defendants, without the authorization of state law and after agreeing to halt the $50 dollar “extension fee,” began assigning community service as a sanction for non-payment, instead of jail-time, and established a $25 “enrollment fee” for individuals to complete community service.</p><p>On June 7, 2017, a partial settlement agreement was reached. The defendants agreed to issue $50 dollar refunds to all parties who paid the “extension fee” on and after June 21, 2015. The plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the fifth claim for relief of their first amended complaint, which sought compensatory damages for the payment of the extension fee, and agreed to dismiss defendant Bogalusa City Court from the suit. </p><p>On June 21, 2017, plaintiff’s motion for class certification was dismissed without prejudice.</p><p>On September 5, 2017, a full settlement was reached. Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their lawsuit against the defendant. In exchange, the defendant agreed, for a period of thirty months, to stop jailing indigent individuals for failure to pay court debt solely due to their inability to pay the debt, agreed to discontinue use of any extension fees except as explicitly authorized by state law, and agreed to discontinue use of an enrollment fee for community service. The defendant also agreed to implement warrant amnesty days that would enable individuals with arrest warrants for failure to comply with an order to appear, subpoena, or summons to appear at the city court to receive a new hearing date and clear any warrants. </p><p>The defendant also permanently agreed to no longer collect or assess any court costs that would be deposited into an account controlled directly by the city court. Instead, these costs or fees would be deposited into a special account maintained by the City of Bogalusa, who would have control of the account and any disbursements made therefrom. The court was also required to submit a yearly budget request to fund operations of the city court, which the mayor and city council must approve in accordance with the city charter. The City of Bogalusa would maintain discretion to allocate funds from the special account to the court to fund operations of the court.</p><p>Finally, the defendant agreed to a six-month reporting period wherein the defendant would notify the plaintiff’s counsel when any city court defendant was being placed in jail for nonpayment of a fine, costs, or failure to complete a form of alternative payment.</p><p>The court maintained jurisdiction over the case. There has been no action on the docket since September 5, 2017.</p>",

Appointment of Counsel/Evaluation for Indigency:\nAt the beginning of Court, all defendants will be advised of the right to the assistance of\ncounsel  and  to  an  indigency  determination  at  arraignment.    The  Court  will  appoint\ncounsel for any indigent defendant charged with an offense punishable by imprisonment,\nunless the Court obtains a valid waiver of counsel.  The Court will also evaluate every\ndefendant for indigency at or before the time of sentencing.\na. Waiver of Counsel: Before a defendant may validly waive her right to counsel, a\ndefendant must sign the attached waiver of counsel form.1 The Court will make\nthe  form  available  at  the  beginning  of  arraignment  and  direct  anyone  with\nquestions to talk to the public defender.  If a defendant signs the form, the Court\nwill conduct an individualized inquiry on the record to determine whether the\nwaiver is made knowingly and intelligently under the circumstances.2\nb. Counsel for direct contempt charges: Indigent defendants facing charges of\ndirect contempt will be represented by appointed counsel if counsel has already\nbeen appointed to represent them in the underlying case.  If the direct contempt\nproceedings will occur on the same day as the arraignment on the underlying\ncharge(s) and counsel has not yet been appointed, the Court will first determine\nwhether the individual is entitled to appointed counsel under this Paragraph and if\nthe defendant is so entitled, will appoint the defendant counsel (or obtain a valid\nwaiver of counsel) before proceeding with the direct contempt proceedings.\n2. Determination of Indigency:\nThe Court will use the attached form3 and any additional verbal testimony that the Court,\nin  its  discretion,  determines  is  necessary  to  determine  indigency.    The  Court’s\ndetermination of indigence or non-indigence —and, in the case of a finding of non-\nindigence, the reasons for this finding—will be made part of the record of the proceeding\nand the form will become part of the defendant’s case file. Any finding of non-indigence\nmust be made on the record before the Court may require a defendant to serve time in jail\nfor non-payment of a fine, court costs, and fees.\nThe Court will follow La. R.S. 15:175 in making a determination of indigence.\n1 Attached as Form 1. \n2 Attached as Form 2. \n3 Attached as Form 3. \n11 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 113-1   Filed 09/01/17   Page 15 of 27\nExhibit A \na.

R.S. 15:175, a person will be presumed “indigent” for purposes of\nappointed counsel and the imposition of fines and court costs if she (1) receives\npublic  assistance,  such  as  Food  Stamps,  Temporary  Assistance  for  Needy\nFamilies, Medicaid, Disability Insurance; (2) resides in public housing; (3) earns\nless than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guideline; or (4) is currently serving\na sentence in a correctional institution or is housed in a mental health facility.\nb. Whether or not a defendant is presumptively indigent pursuant to the provisions\nof subparagraph(a), the Court may consider other factors, including the following,\nto determine whether the defendant has the ability to hire her own attorney or pay\nthe amount owed without substantial financial hardship: income or funds from\nemployment  or  any  other  source,  including  public  assistance,  to  which  the\ndefendant is entitled, property owned by the defendant or in which she has an\neconomic interest, outstanding obligations, the number and ages of dependents,\nemployment and job training history and efforts to gain employment, and level of\neducation.\n3. Imposition of default time, community service and/or jail time:\nThe Court will post in a public location in the courtroom and at the Clerk’s payment\nwindow,  and  make  available  copies  at  the  Clerk’s  payment  window,  a  Notice  to\nDefendants Regarding Fines, Court Costs, and Community Service4 that reflects these\nagreed-upon procedures.\nIf imposing a fine, the Court will determine indigency based on La. R.S. 15:175 and the\nprocedures outlined in Paragraph 2.  No defendant who is found indigent following an\nindigence determination may be sentenced to a fine and court costs with a default jail\nsentence.\nNothing in this settlement agreement shall be construed to prevent the imposition of jail time on\nany defendant at initial sentencing if the court determines such sentence is appropriate in order to\nmeet the State’s interest in punishment and deterrence. However, a jail sentence may not be\nimposed solely because the person is deemed indigent.\nThe imposition of a jail sentence must not be based on an indigent defendant’s inability\nto pay a fine, court costs, or any other amount of money to the Court.\nThose defendants who have been found indigent for purposes of appointed counsel will\nbe  considered  indigent  for  purposes  of  sentencing.  However,  because  indigence\ndeterminations may be reviewed by the Court at any stage of the proceedings, it is within\nthe Court’s discretion to review a defendant’s indigence again at a later date.\na. Payment Options for Indigent Defendants. If the Court finds it appropriate to\nimpose a fine and court costs (a “monetary sentence”) for an indigent defendant,\nthe Court will not impose a default jail sentence.\n4 Attached as Form 4. \nExhibit A – Page 2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 113-1   Filed 09/01/17   Page 16 of 27\nExhibit A \nPartial payments from indigent (and non-indigent) defendants will be accepted in \nperson via cash or a money order on Wednesdays or Thursdays at the window of \nthe Office of the Clerk of Court. A defendant may also mail a money order or \ncashier’s check to the Court.  Under no circumstances will a person be charged \nadditional court costs or fees, including late fees, for making partial payments. \nb. Payment Options for Non-indigent Defendants. If the Court determines that the\ndefendant is not indigent and further determines that the defendant is unable to\npay her fines and court costs in full at sentencing, the defendant will be permitted\nto make partial payments before the next court date with no minimum amount\nrequired, pursuant to the manner outlined in Paragraph 3(a).\nThe  Court  will  further  provide  written  notice  included  on  the  summons5\nconsistent with the language required by the Financial Obligations for Criminal\nOffenders Act No. 260, Art. 895.5 (2017).\nc. Show Cause Hearing. The Court will schedule a Show Cause Hearing for a date\nno sooner than two months after sentencing for any defendant ordered to pay a\nfine and court costs.  Any defendant who has not paid her fine and court costs in\nfull before this date will be expected to appear in person at the Show Cause\nHearing.\ni. If the defendant appears at the Show Cause Hearing, the Court will inquire\nas to the reasons for nonpayment, including whether the defendant was\nunable to pay the amount owed.  The public defender will represent an\nindigent defendant at the Show Cause Hearing unless the Court obtains a\nvalid waiver of counsel.\nThe Judge will proceed as follows:\n1. For all defendants previously found indigent, the Judge shall\nconsider (1) waiving or reducing the amount of the fine and costs\nowed  based  on  the  defendant’s  financial  situation,  good-faith\nefforts to make payments to the best of her ability, and any other\nfactors the Court finds relevant to establish that the defendant has\ntaken to reform and improve herself; (2) giving the defendant an\nextension of time to make any payment(s) owed; or (3) imposing\nthe  community  service  sentence  in  lieu  of  payment  with  a\nproportional  decrease  in  the  default  time  based  on  any  partial\npayments  made,  pursuant  to  the  rate  calculation  set  forth  in\nParagraph 3(d).\n5 Attached as Form 5. \nExhibit A – Page 3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 113-1   Filed 09/01/17   Page 17 of 27\nExhibit A \n2. For  those  defendants  previously  assessed  default  time,  the\nJudge will determine whether they are now indigent.  If they are\nfound  to  be  indigent,  the  Judge  shall  consider  the  options  in\nparagraph 3(c)(i)(1) above.  If they are found not to be indigent,\nthe Judge may, in addition to the options identified in paragraph\n3(c)(i)(1) above, activate the default time previously imposed, with\na proportional decrease in the default time based on any partial\npayments made.\nii. If the defendant fails to appear at this hearing, the Court will follow the\nprocedures in Paragraph 4 below.\nd. Community Service. If the Judge imposes a fine with a default community service\nsentence or otherwise requires community service in lieu of payment, the Judge\nwill order the defendant to perform a specific number of hours of community\nservice  based  on  the  amount  of  the  fine  and  costs  owed.    The  amount  of\ncommunity service hours that the Court may impose in default of payment will be\ncapped at no more than the fine and court costs owed divided by the rate of the\ncurrent federal minimum wage (i.e. $7.25 per hour).  Additionally, the Court will\nnot sentence a defendant charged with a traffic ticket to complete more than 16\nhours of community service.  However, if the defendant has been charged with\nDWI,  Reckless  Operation,  or  Excessive  Speeding,  the  Court  shall  retain  the\ndiscretion to impose more than a default sentence of 16 hours of community\nservice.\ne. The Court will not require the defendant to perform more than 16 hours of\ncommunity service per month, though the defendant may perform more per month\nif she desires.\nf. No defendant sentenced to community service shall be charged a fee to sign up\nfor, perform, or otherwise execute his or her sentence of community service.\ng. The Judge will give the defendant an appropriate community service placement\nbased  on  the  Court’s  consideration  of  the  defendant’s  physical  and  mental\ndisabilities,  transportation,  work  schedule,  and  childcare  or  caregiving\nresponsibilities.  The Judge will ask every defendant at least the following two\nquestions  before  imposing  a  community  service  sentence  and  may,  in  his\ndiscretion, ask any additional questions to determine an appropriate community\nservice placement: (1) Do you have a physical disability that would prevent you\nfrom picking up litter?  (2) Are you able to perform community service on\nSaturday mornings?\nh. Failure to Perform Community Service.  If a defendant completes at least 16\nhours of community service per month, she will not be subject to contempt for\nfailure to complete the remaining hours of her community service sentence.  If a\ndefendant fails to complete at least 16 hours of community service per month, the\nExhibit A – Page 4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 113-1   Filed 09/01/17   Page 18 of 27\nExhibit A \nCourt may extend the time for completing community service or hold a properly \nnoticed Show Cause Hearing.  \ni. If the defendant appears at the Show Cause Hearing, the Court will inquire\nas to the reasons for noncompliance, including whether the defendant was\nunable to complete the community service.  The public defender will\nrepresent all indigent defendants at the hearing unless the Judge obtains a\nvalid waiver of counsel.  If after inquiry, the Judge determines there is:\n1. An inability to perform community service, the Judge may (1)\nreduce, modify, or remit the order to perform community service,\nincluding modifying the community service placement; (2) if the\nperson will have the ability to perform community service going\nforward, extend the time to perform community service; or (3) give\nthe defendant the option of paying the remaining balance of the\noriginal  fine  and  costs  in  lieu  of  performing  the  remaining\ncommunity service.\n2. An ability to perform community service, the Judge may consider\nthe options listed in the previous paragraph, and may also find the\ndefendant in contempt and impose punishment in accordance with\nLa.  C.Cr.P.  art  25.    After  defendant  completes  this  contempt\nsentence, the Court will close the case and consider the sentence\nsatisfied in full.\nii. If the defendant fails to appear at this hearing, the Court will follow the\nprocedures in Section 4 below.\n4. Failure to Appear – Direct Contempt Charge\nAn attachment shall issue for a defendant who fails to appear at arraignment or any\nhearing date for which she has been properly noticed to appear.\nThe Court will send notice in accordance with law.\nIf the defendant is arrested on the attachment, the defendant may post bond if available\nunder the Court’s bail procedures.  If the defendant fails to appear on the new hearing\ndate, a new attachment will issue on the underlying charge.\nThe defendant will be held in direct contempt if the Court finds, after an opportunity for\nthe defendant to be heard orally, that the failure to appear was contumacious6 and that\n6 At a minimum, this requires a finding that the failure to appear was willful and openly defiant of the Court’s order, \ninstead of inadvertent or due to the defendant’s inability to appear.  See State v. Taylor, 451 So. 2d 691, 692 (La. Ct. \nApp. 1984) (“In Black's Law Dictionary, 298 (rev. 5th ed. 1979), ‘contumacious’ conduct is defined as ‘wilfully \nstubborn  and  disobedient  conduct.’  Burton's  Legal  Thesaurus,  (1980),  suggests  that  ‘contumacious’  means \nstubbornly disobedient, stubbornly rebellious, openly defiant, or willfully disrespectful.”). \nExhibit A – Page 5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 113-1   Filed 09/01/17   Page 19 of 27\nExhibit A \nproof  of  service  appears  in  the  record,  in  accordance  with  La.  C.Cr.P.  art.  21.    A \ndefendant found in contempt will be sentenced for the direct contempt in accordance with \nLa. C.Cr.P. art 25. \nIf a defendant guilty of direct contempt is sentenced to a fine, with or without default \ntime, the Court will follow the procedures in Section 3, above, to determine whether or \nnot the imposition of default jail time and/or the jailing of a defendant for non-payment is \nappropriate.  \n5. Collection of 1899 Court Costs and Contempt fines\nThe Court will not assess or collect any court costs or any portion of contempt fees that\nwill be deposited into an account controlled directly by the City Court. The City Court\nagrees  to  have  all  costs  collected  pursuant  to  La.  R.S.  13:1899,  the  portion  of  the\ncontempt fines, and all other fees or costs previously retained by the City Court of\nBogalusa deposited into a special account maintained by the City of Bogalusa, which\nshall have control over the account and any disbursements made therefrom to defray the\noperating costs of the City Court.  The Bogalusa City Court Judge will submit a yearly\nbudget request (or amended budget requests, as needed) to the City of Bogalusa to fund\nthe operations of the City Court and that accounts for any expenses the City is required to\npay for under state law.  The Judge’s budget request (and any requests for an amended\nbudget) shall be approved by the Mayor of Bogalusa and the Bogalusa City Council in\naccordance  with  the  City  of  Bogalusa  City  Charter.    The  City  of  Bogalusa,  in  its\ndiscretion, may allocate any funds in the special account to the City Court in whole or in\npart as part of any budget allocation to the City Court to off-set the costs of funding the\noperations of the Court.\n6. Extension Fees\nThe Court will discontinue the use of extension fees, late fees, community service fees, or\nany other fees unless that fee is explicitly authorized by state law. The Court will revise\nits Summons to remove wording related to extension fees, late fees, community service\nfees, or any other fee not explicitly authorized by state law.\nExhibit A – Page 6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 113-1   Filed 09/01/17   Page 20 of 27\nExhibit A - Form 1 \nBOGALUSA CITY COURT  \nWAIVER OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL  \nYou are charged with a misdemeanor or a traffic offense and may be sentenced to \nserve time in jail.

Section “B”(5) \n   \nBOGALUSA CITY COURT and ROBERT   \nJ. BLACK, in his individual and official \ncapacities, \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nJOINT MOTION TO CONTINUE AND  \nTO ENFORCE AGREED STIPULATION \n \n  COME NOW Plaintiffs Ebony Roberts and Rozzie Scott (“Plaintiffs”), and Defendant \nRobert J. Black1 to respectfully request that the Court:  (i) cancel the July 13, 2016 hearing set \nfor Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and suspend the briefing schedule for that \nmotion (see Order, ECF No. 32); (ii) cancel the July 20, 2016 hearing requested by Plaintiffs to \nhear Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification and hold that motion in abeyance (see Motion, \nNotice, and Request, ECF Nos. 30, 30-3, 31); (iii) agree to enforce this Agreement; and (iv) \norder Plaintiffs and Defendant Black to submit a joint written status report in 45 days to report \non the status of settlement discussions and the parties’ respective positions on how the Court \nshould proceed with the pending motions for preliminary injunction and class certification.  As a \nbasis for this Motion, Plaintiffs and Defendant Black state as follows: \n                                                 \n1 The instant motion does not involve Defendant Bogalusa City Court. \n1 \n\n \n1.  This putative class action lawsuit was filed on June 21, 2016.  (ECF No. 1).  The \nlawsuit includes challenges to the constitutionality of certain alleged practices / procedures of \nDefendant Judge Robert J. Black in his role as the Bogalusa City Court Judge and Defendant \nBogalusa City Court, and seeks equitable relief as well as damages.   \n2.  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order  or  Preliminary \nInjunction on June 21, 2016.  (Motion, ECF No. 5).  The Court denied the request for a TRO and \nset the request for a preliminary injunction for a hearing on July 13, 2016, and set a briefing \nschedule.  (Order, ECF No. 32).   \n3.  Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Class Certification, noticed that motion for \nsubmission on July 20, 2016, and requested oral argument.  (Motion, Notice, Request, ECF Nos. \n30, 30-3, 31).   \n4.  In  response  to  the  Complaint,  counsel  for  Plaintiffs  and  Defendant  Black \ndiscussed the issues presented by the lawsuit and determined that they would like to explore in \ndetail the possibility of settlement.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs and Defendant Black have agreed to \njointly petition the Court to continue the matters identified in the opening paragraph of this \nMotion in order to facilitate consideration of a settlement without prejudice to either side’s \nposition and without the unnecessary accrual of attorneys’ fees. \n5.  As used in this filing, the phrase “time period of this Agreement” refers to the \ntime period from June 24, 2016, to seventy-five days after the Court grants this Motion.  \n6.  To permit Plaintiffs and Defendant Black to explore settlement of this matter, \nDefendant Black hereby stipulates that, during the time period of this Agreement, he will not act \nto incarcerate any Bogalusa City Court defendant on the sole basis of nonpayment of fines or \n2 \n\n \ncosts imposed during Bogalusa City Court proceedings, or for nonpayment of or an inability to \npay an assessed contempt fee.   \n7.  Defendant Black also stipulates that, during the time period of this Agreement, he \nwill not assess or collect (i) any court cost authorized by La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899; (ii) any \n“extension fees” or similar payments required by the City Court to allow a defendant additional \ntime to pay court debt; or (iii) any contempt fees that are retained by the City Court and \ndeposited into the City Court’s judicial expense account. \n8.  Defendant Black also stipulates that, during the time period of this Agreement, he \nwill provide to Plaintiffs’ counsel a copy of jail logs for the Bogalusa City Jail for every day of \nthe time period of this Agreement.  A copy of the jail logs will be delivered by facsimile or \nelectronic mail to Plaintiffs’ counsel on a weekly basis by close of business Monday.  Defendant \nBlack will also, upon request by Plaintiffs’ counsel, make available court records pertaining to \nany individual defendant whose name appears on the jail log.   \n9.  Defendant Black also stipulates that, during the time period of this Agreement, he \nwill provide to Plaintiffs’ counsel an up-to-date copy of the Bogalusa City Court’s “Criminal \nAccount-Citizens Income Statement.”  A copy will be delivered by facsimile or electronic mail \nto Plaintiffs’ counsel on a weekly basis.  \n10.   Other than as expressly set out above, Defendant Black retains full rights to \nenforce the law, to accept plea agreements from City Court defendants, to jail those defendants \nwho are arrested or sentenced on grounds other than the nonpayment of fines or costs, and to \notherwise carry on the efficient administration of justice within the City Court.  Furthermore, this \nstipulation is not to be understood to prevent Defendant Black from ordering community service, \nwhere appropriate or allowing partial payment; from continuing court dates or appearances to \n3 \n\n \ntimes beyond the time period of this Agreement; or from otherwise presiding over City Court \ndockets during this or any other time.   \n11.  Finally, Plaintiffs and Defendant Black all agree and hereby stipulate that nothing \ncontained within this Motion is to be construed as an admission of liability on behalf of any \nDefendant; that the filing of this motion shall not be used against any party; and that no party to \nthis filing shall be held to have waived any argument, position, or defense as a result of the \nagreements recited herein or as a result of the Court’s order on this Motion. \n12.  Plaintiffs and Defendant Black stipulate that the Court shall have the authority to \nenforce the stipulations contained within this document by appropriate order. \nWHEREFORE,  the  foregoing  premises  considered,  Plaintiffs  and  Defendant  Black \nrespectfully request that the Court enter an order that specifies that it will exercise its jurisdiction \nto enforce the stipulations contained in paragraphs six to nine, above.  Plaintiffs and Defendant \nBlack further request that the Court enter an order that (i) cancels the July 13, 2016 hearing set \nfor Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and suspends the briefing schedule for that \nmotion; (ii) cancels the July 20, 2016 hearing requested by Plaintiffs to hear Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Class Certification and holds that motion in abeyance; (iii) agrees to enforce this Agreement; \nand (iv) orders Plaintiffs and Defendant Black to submit a joint written status report in 45 days.   \nA proposed order accompanies this Motion. \n \nDATED this June 27, 2016.

Because the Fifth Claim is \nthe only claim against Defendant Bogalusa City Court, the Parties further move that, subject to \nthis Cout1's retention of limited jurisdiction, the Bogalusa City Court be dismissed from  this \naction.  In support of this Joint Motion, the Parties state as follows: \n1.  In  their  pleadings,  Plaintiffs  have  alleged  in  the  Fifth  Claim  for  Relief that \nDefendants required individuals unable to pay their monetary penalties in  full to pay additional \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 91-1   Filed 06/02/17   Page 16 of 20\nExhibit E \n$50 \"extension\" fees  not authorized by state law to avoid going to jail for non-payment. First \nAm. Comp!. ilil 195-201 (ECF No. 67). \n2.  To avoid the expense and burden of protracted litigation, the Parties have reached \na full and final settlement of Plaintiffs' Fifth Claim for Relief. \n3.  Accordingly, the Parties have entered  into a written Settlement Agreement (the \n\"Agreement\"), attached hereto as Exhibit 1, that memorializes the terms of their agreement to \nsettle  the  Fifth  Claim  and  is  incorporated  within  this  Motion.  The  Parties  agree  that  the \nAgreement will fully resolve their disputes related to the Fifth Claim for Relief.  The Parties \nfurther agree that with the settlement of this Claim, the only remaining relief sought by Plaintiffs \nis equitable. \n4.  Pursuant  to  the  Agreement,  the  Parties  jointly  move  the  Court  to  retain \njurisdiction to  enforce the Agreement for  180 days.  Subject to the Court's approval  of this \nrequest to retain jurisdiction, Plaintiffs also  move for dismissal  of the Fifth Claim for Relief \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(l)(A)(ii).

If the Court does not agree to continue its jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement, \nthe Parties withdraw their motion to dismiss the Fifth Claim for Relief. \n6.  For the Court's convenience, the Paities have attached a proposed order granting \nthis Motion; approving the Settlement Agreement; and dismissing the  Fifth  Claim for Relief, \nexcept  where  the  Court  shall  continue  its jurisdiction  to  enforce  the  Settlement Agreement \nconsistent with the terms of the attached Agreement. \n2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 91-1   Filed 06/02/17   Page 17 of 20\nExhibit E \nDATED this  Respectfully submitted, \n--- ---\nIvy Wang \nOn Behalf ofP  laintiffs' Counsel \nSara Zampierin* (Trial Attorney)  Ivy Wang (La.

COMPLAINT \n   \nROBERT J. BLACK, in his individual and   \nofficial capacities, and BOGALUSA CITY  CLASS ACTION \nCOURT,   \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nI.    PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Defendants Judge Robert J. Black (“Black”) and the Bogalusa City Court (“City \nCourt”) operate a modern-day debtors’ prison, jailing the poor for their failure to pay.  Defendant \nBlack routinely orders individuals to jail for non-payment of monetary penalties for minor traffic \nand misdemeanor offenses without inquiring into the reason for non-payment.   \n2.  The City Court is funded off the backs of the poor.  It substantially relies on the \ncourt costs and fees it collects from criminal defendants.  The City Court routinely covers at least \n15% of its expenditures through income it generates from criminal defendants.  This structural \nconflict of interest creates an incentive for Defendant Black to find individuals guilty and to \ncoerce payment through the threat of jail.  Without this money, the  City Court could not \nfunction. \n3.  This  incentive  is  exemplified  through  Defendant  Black’s  creation  of  a  $50 \n“extension fee” to raise additional money to operate the City Court.  This extension fee is not \nauthorized  by  state  law.    However,  Defendant  Black  gives  individuals  unable  to  pay  their \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 2 of 31\nmonetary penalties in full a false choice: they may either go to jail for non-payment of fines and \ncosts or pay this illegal $50 extension fee to buy additional time to pay their monetary penalty.   \n4.  Plaintiffs Rozzie Scott (“Scott”) and Ebony Roberts (“Roberts”) fear they will be \nincarcerated for non-payment, forced to make an illegal payment, and deprived of due process by \nhaving their cases decided by a biased judge at their upcoming court hearings.  Neither has the \nability to pay the hundreds of dollars in fines and costs they owe the City Court.   \n5.  Plaintiffs Scott, Roberts, Latasha Cook (“Cook”), and Robert Levi (“Levi”) were \npreviously victimized by this funding system and were forced to accept the false choice of \npaying the illegal $50 extension fee to avoid being jailed.  Each of these Plaintiffs paid the City \nCourt $50 to purchase their freedom.   \n6.  Defendants’ unconstitutional practices have affected, and will continue to affect, \nhundreds of low-income people with citations for traffic tickets or misdemeanor violations in the \nCity of Bogalusa, Louisiana.  Plaintiffs bring these claims on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated to seek a declaration that Defendants’ practices are unconstitutional, to seek an \ninjunction to enjoin them from continuing these practices, and to seek damages to recover the \nillegal extension fee for those who paid it in the past year.   \nII.    JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion jurisdiction). \n8.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of \nthe events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District.  \n \n   \n  2\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 3 of 31\nIII.    PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n9.  Plaintiff Ebony Roberts is a resident of Bogalusa, Louisiana. \n10.  Plaintiff Rozzie Scott is a resident of Bogalusa, Louisiana. \n11.  Plaintiff Latasha Cook is a resident of Bogalusa, Louisiana. \n12.  Plaintiff Robert Levi is a resident of Bogalusa, Louisiana. \nB.  Defendants \n13.  Defendant Robert J. Black is the sole judge who sits on the Bogalusa City Court \nin Bogalusa, Louisiana.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.   \n14.  Defendant  Bogalusa  City  Court  is  a  government  entity  located  in  Bogalusa, \nLouisiana.   \nIV.    STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Defendant Black Oversees and Administers the Bogalusa City Court. \n15.  Bogalusa  is  a  town  of  about  12,000  people  located  in  Washington  Parish, \nLouisiana, approximately 1.5 hours north of New Orleans, Louisiana.  The town’s economy \ncenters on the lumber and paper mills.  Nearly 36% of the population in Bogalusa lives below the \npoverty line.  The median household income was $25,036 in 2015, less than half of the median \nhousehold income in the United States. \n16.  The City Court is authorized to hear cases involving city ordinance violations, \nincluding  traffic  tickets  and  misdemeanors,  which  are  committed  within  Ward  Four  of \nWashington Parish.  Defendant Black is the only judge who sits on the City Court. \n17.  Defendant Black is elected to his position as judge of the City Court.   \n18.  Defendant Black is authorized to appoint and remove clerks and deputy clerks for \n  3\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 4 of 31\nthe City Court. \n19.  Defendant Black possesses administrative, executive, and judicial powers over the \nCity Court.   In his administrative capacity, Defendant  Black is  responsible for the orderly \nadministration of the City Court.  In his executive capacity, Defendant Black is responsible for \nthe City Court’s finances, including creating a budget for the City Court and ensuring the City \nCourt has sufficient funds to pay employee salaries and the City Court’s overhead expenses.  \nFinally, in his judicial capacity, Defendant Black is responsible for impartially adjudicating \nmunicipal and misdemeanor cases before the City Court.   \n20.  Defendant Black is authorized to create policies and rules for the conduct of \njudicial business before the City Court.  This power includes practices with regard to the City \nCourt’s collection of fines and court costs.  \nB.  The  Bogalusa  City  Court  Systematically  Jails  and  Threatens  to  Jail \nIndividuals Who Cannot Pay Fines and Court Costs that Fund the City \nCourt. \n21.  The Bogalusa City Court typically conducts criminal proceedings once per week, \non Monday mornings and afternoons.   \n22.  On behalf of the City Court, Defendant Black imposes a jail sentence against the \nmajority of individuals who plead guilty or are found guilty after trial.  However, he suspends \nmost sentences on the condition that the individual pay fines and court costs.  A suspended jail \nsentence is commonly referred to as “default time.”  \n23.  If an individual cannot pay the fine and court costs in full on the sentencing date, \nDefendant Black orders the individual to return to the City Court by their “pay date.”  The pay \ndate functions as the deadline by which Defendant Black expects the individual to pay the fines \nand court costs. \n  4\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 5 of 31\n24.  The City Court does not accept partial payments or allow an individual to make \npayments on an installment plan.  Any monetary obligation to the City Court must be paid in \nfull. \n25.  During  both  the  sentencing  proceeding  and  subsequent  pay  date  proceeding, \nDefendant Black does not inquire into the reasons for non-payment if an individual failed to pay \nthe fines and court costs.  Nor does he distinguish between those individuals who willfully refuse \nto pay and those who cannot pay due to their indigence. \n26.  Neither Defendant Black nor anyone acting on behalf of the City Court provides \nor appoints counsel to persons appearing at pay date proceedings. \n27.  Neither Defendant Black nor anyone acting on behalf of the City Court provides \nnotice in advance of the pay date proceedings that the person’s ability to pay will be a critical \nissue at the hearing if they are unable to pay, or provides the individual during or before the \nhearing with a form (or its equivalent) designed to elicit information about the individual’s \nfinancial circumstances.  \n28.  When a person appears at a pay date and does not have the money to pay the \nmonetary penalty, Defendant Black often allows some individuals to pay a $50 “extension fee” \nto purchase their freedom and be permitted additional time to pay their monetary penalty.1   \n29.  Defendant Black instructs those who cannot afford the $50 “extension fee” or \nwho are not given that option to sit in seats at the front of the courtroom for the remainder of the \ncourt session.   \n30.  A City Court marshal generally allows individuals to leave the courtroom to make \n                                                 \n1 This extension fee is described in greater detail at Paragraphs 51 through 58.  \n  5\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 6 of 31\nphone calls to family and friends to try to arrange for payment while court remains in session.  A \nmarshal escorts out of the courtroom those individuals permitted to make phone calls to arrange \nfor payment.  The marshal stands by the individual while he or she attempts to contact family, \nfriends, or co-workers to explain that he or she will be arrested and jailed if the fines and court \ncosts are not paid by the end of the court session.  If family, friends, or co-workers bring money \nto pay the fines and court costs to the courthouse before the end of the court session, the \nindividual is allowed to pay and to leave.  \n31.  At the end of the court session, the marshal walks those who could not pay down \nthe courthouse steps and to the jail in an adjacent building, and books them into the City jail.  \nSometimes the marshal does this by handcuffing persons together.   \n32.  The City Court clerk’s minute entries record when a person is sent to jail for non-\npayment, noting that the person has failed to pay and is ordered to serve time in jail or to remain \nin jail until a certain amount is paid.  To illustrate, in the sample minutes below, Defendant Black \norders an individual to either serve “50 days default time” or pay $575.00 for not having proof of \ninsurance or a license plate: \n \n  6\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 7 of 31\n33.  Any individual arrested for non-payment can be released from jail if the fine and \ncourt costs are paid in full or if the individual serves the default time.   \n34.  The City’s jail logs document the amount of money an individual must pay or the \namount of time the individual must serve to be released from jail.  In the example below, an \nindividual was ordered to serve 160 days in jail unless he paid a $724 “cash fine”: \n \n35.  If  an  individual  fails  to  appear  at  the  pay  date,  Defendant  Black  issues  an \nattachment for the individual’s arrest and orders the individual to serve 15 days in jail or to pay a \n$250 cash bond.  In the sample below, Defendant Black sentenced an individual to a pay or stay \nsentence of “15 days” in jail or a “$250.00 contempt fee”: \n \n36.  Defendant  Black  sometimes  announces  in  open  court  when  issuing  such \nattachments that a person that fails to appear to pay can “buy their way out of jail.” \n37.  Defendant Black’s announcement that a person can “buy their way out of jail” is \nreflected in the jail logs.  In the example below, an individual paid a fine of $250 to “shorten \n  7\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 8 of 31\n[her] sentence of 15 days”: \n \nC.  The Bogalusa City Court Substantially Relies on Court Costs and Fees to \nFund its Court Operations. \n38.  The State of Louisiana does not have a unified funding system for the State’s \ncourts and does not oversee the budgets of city courts.  Instead, as the Louisiana Supreme Court \nreported to the Legislature in 2014, self-generated and local funds—not state funds—represent \nthe  largest  sources  of  revenue  in  the  majority  of  courts.    As  the  Louisiana  House  of \nRepresentatives has noted, city courts are funded through the use of court costs and fees that are \nimposed on those persons appearing before the City Court. \n39.  The City Court’s operating expenses are paid through four sources of revenue: the \nState of Louisiana, the Washington Parish Government, the City of Bogalusa, and the City Court \nitself through assessments of certain costs and fees.   \n40.  The funds the City of Bogalusa, Washington Parish, and the State of Louisiana \nprovide  for  the  City  Court,  however,  are  insufficient  to  cover  the  City  Court’s  operating \nexpenses.  The following table illustrates the City Court’s total revenue from the City, Parish, \nand State (“Total Governmental Funding”); its total expenditures; its shortfall; and the shortfall \nas a percentage of total expenditures, for 2009 to 2014:  \nBogalusa City Court Governmental Revenues and Expenditures \n2009-2014 \nYear  Total Governmental  Total  Shortfall  Shortfall as % of \nFunding  Expenditures  Expenditures \n2009  $109,062  $161,310  $52,248  32.4% \n2010  $120,509  $176,171  $55,662  31.6% \n  8\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 9 of 31\n2011  $210,049  $280,043  $69,994  25% \n2012  $212,910  $293,024  $80,114  27.3% \n2013  $253,641  $364,000  $110,359  30.3% \n2014  $280,357  $386,934  $106,577  27.5% \n \n41.  The  remainder  of  the  City  Court’s  operating  expenses  not  funded  by  the \ncontributions of the State, Parish, and City are funded through court costs and fees collected in \ncriminal cases; court fees collected in civil cases; and reserves of these same fees collected in \nprior years.   \n42.  Defendant Black is authorized under multiple state statutes to assess a variety of \ncourt costs in criminal cases.  Although most of these court costs are disbursed to other entities, \nDefendant Black is also authorized to assess up to $30 under  La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 against \nevery defendant who is found guilty or forfeits his bond.  This court cost is different than other \ncourt costs because Defendant Black is authorized by state statute to keep and spend the money \ngenerated under La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 to support the City Court’s operations.   \n43.  As the top official of the City Court, Defendant Black, in his administrative and \nexecutive capacity, has the sole discretion over how to spend the money generated under La. \nStat. Ann. § 13:1899. \n44.  In his administrative and executive capacity, Defendant Black has established a \npractice of assessing $30 in some cases under La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 and $29.50 in other cases, \ndepending on the charge.  He has created and authorized a case costs schedule for the City Court \nthat reflects whether to charge $30 or $29.50 based on the charge.   \n45.  When imposing a monetary penalty, Defendant Black specifies a specific fine \namount and then refers generally to “costs.”  The specific amount of costs is later assessed by a \ncourt employee based on the schedule.   \n46.  In his administrative and executive capacities for the City Court, Defendant Black \n  9\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 10 of 31\nhas ordered the Clerk of Court to create a “judicial expense” account for the City Court and \ninstructed the clerks to deposit the statutory court costs under La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 into that \naccount.  In addition to these costs, the judicial expense account consists of money collected \nfrom extension fees and contempt fees for non-payment and failure to appear.  No other sources \nfund the City Court’s judicial expense account. \n47.  Costs assessed against criminal defendants comprise a substantial portion of the \nCity Court’s yearly operating budget.  For example, the City Court generated nearly $57,000 for \nits  “judicial  expense”  account  in  2014  through  court  costs  assessed  under  La.  Stat.  Ann. \n§ 13:1899, extension fees, and contempt fees for non-payment—an amount that represented  \napproximately 15% of the City Court’s operating budget.  In 2015, the City Court generated even \nmore court-controlled revenue—at least $64,000 in judicial expense funds from court costs and \nfees and at least $5,000 in extension fees—an amount that represented about 20% of the City \nCourt’s revenues and expenditures in its proposed operting budget.2 \n48.  Defendant  Black  controls  the  judicial  expense  account  in  his  executive  and \nadministrative capacity for the City Court and has sole discretion under state law to determine \nhow these funds are allocated to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses.   \n49.  If a person is unable to pay, Defendant Black possesses alternative tools to serve \nthe City Court’s peneoligical interests, including remitting some of the fines and court costs \nassessed (including the court cost retained by the City Court pursuant to La. Stat. Ann. § \n13:1899); collecting the fines and costs as a money judgment in a civil case rather than by using \n                                                 \n2 The City Court’s final operating budget—showing both proposed and actual income  and \nexpenditures—is reflected in an annual audit report created by the Legislative Auditor’s office; \nfor fiscal year 2015 that audit report will likely be published in late July 2016. \n  10\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 11 of 31\ncriminal sanctions; and creating alternative punishments.  Defendant Black may not jail that \nperson for nonpayment without first finding that the nonpayment was willful.   \n50.  The manner in which Defendants fund the City Court creates a structural conflict \nof interest between Defendant Black’s duty to impartially adjudicate cases and his executive \nresponsibility to raise money to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses.  The City Court \ncannot operate if Defendant Black does not find defendants guilty and does not successfully \ncollect court costs and fees from a substantial number of individuals who appear before him. \nD.  The Bogalusa City Court Has Created an Illegal Extension Fee to Generate \nAdditional Revenue. \n51.  In his executive and administrative capacities, Defendant Black created a $50 \n“extension fee” on behalf of the City Court.  The money collected through this extension fee is \nused to pay for the operations of the City Court.   \n52.  The “extension fee” is not authorized by state law.   \n53.  City courts are not authorized to create new court costs and fees under state law; \nthat authority is limited to the Louisiana State Legislature.   \n54.  Through the creation of this fee, the City Court authorized Defendant Black, \nacting in his judicial capacity, to offer a false choice to individuals who cannot pay fines and \ncourt costs by the pay date: either (a) pay the extension fee by the end of the court session (or in \nsome cases, shortly after booking) and be granted additional time to pay the fines and court costs, \nor (b) go to jail until all fines and costs are paid or the underlying sentence is served.   \n55.  The $50 “extension fee” is not memorialized in an order because it is not actually \nordered by Defendant Black.  Rather, it is treated by the City Court as an alternative collection \nmethod, to permit the person to pay more in order to have additional time to try to pay the \nmonetary penalty. \n  11\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 12 of 31\n56.  If a person is not able to pay the illegal $50 extension fee before the end of court, \nshe is processed into the jail.  But if she obtains it shortly after being jailed, she may be permitted \nto be released, as reflected in the jail records.  For example, in the below jail log excerpt, the \nperson was jailed at 2:52pm and was released 19 minutes later, after paying the extension fee:  \n \n57.  The money collected as an extension fee is not credited toward an individual’s \nfines or court costs.  Instead, it is treated as a separate and additional fee.  \n58.  In 2015, the City Court collected the extension fee from at least 100 individuals, \nnetting at least $5,000 to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses.   \nE.  Plaintiffs Ebony Roberts and Rozzie Scott Face Unconstitutional Treatment \nat Upcoming Court Dates and Have Been Subjected to Unconstitutional \nPolicies and Practices in the Past. \ni.  Plaintiff Rozzie Scott \n59.   Plaintiff Rozzie Scott appeared in front of Defendant Black on May 12, 2016, \nand was found guilty of stealing $5 worth of food from a local store to feed his family.   \n60.  Defendant Black ordered Mr. Scott to pay a $450 fine plus costs on or before June \n13, 2016. \n61.   Mr. Scott returned to the City Court on June 13, 2016, but did not have the \nmoney to pay his fine and court costs.  After telling Defendant Black that he could not pay, \nDefendant Black asked him if he had $50 for an extension of time to pay the fine and costs. \n  12\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 13 of 31\n62.  After Mr. Scott told Defendant Black that he did not have $50, Defendant Black \ntold Mr. Scott to sit in a chair on the side of the courtroom and wait for his arrest.  Defendant \nBlack never asked him why he did not have the money or whether he was working. \n63.  While Mr. Scott waited, Defendant Black told other defendants that they would \ngo to jail if they could not pay the extension fee or their fines plus costs. \n64.  At the end of court, Mr. Scott was arrested and booked into the City jail, where he \nspent about four hours until his cousin paid the $50 extension fee for his release. \n65.  After Mr. Scott was released from jail, he was told that he had to pay the fine plus \ncosts on or before July 25, 2016. \n66.  Mr. Scott faces an imminent threat that he will be jailed because he cannot afford \nto pay the $450 fine plus costs that he owes the City Court on or before July 25, 2016.  \n67.  Mr. Scott’s right to an impartial judge will be violated if he is forced to appear in \nthe City Court on July 25, 2016.  The City Court’s unconstitutional funding structure creates an \nappearance that Defendant Black cannot impartially adjudicate whether Mr. Scott willfully failed \nto pay because Defendant Black has a financial interest in extorting money from him to pay for \nthe City Court’s continued operation.  \nii.  Plaintiff Ebony Roberts \n68.   Plaintiff Ebony Roberts appeared in front of Defendant Black on March 21, \n2016, and pleaded guilty to speeding and driving without a license.   \n69.  Defendant Black sentenced Ms. Roberts to pay a fine amount, plus costs on or \nbefore April 25, 2016, for speeding and for driving without a license.  She later learned it was a \ntotal of about $367.50 in fines and court costs for the speeding ticket and $262.50 in fines and \ncourt costs for the ticket for driving without a license.   \n  13\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 14 of 31\n70.  Ms. Roberts returned to the City Court on April 25, 2016, but did not have the \nmoney to pay her fines and court costs.  Defendant Black did not ask Ms. Roberts whether she \nwas working or why she could not pay.  He did not offer her a payment plan or community \nservice.  He told Ms. Roberts she had to pay the fines and costs or she would go to jail for not \npaying her traffic tickets. \n71.  After Ms. Roberts paid the $50, she was ordered to return to the City Court on \nJune 13, 2016, to pay the fines and court costs on her two traffic tickets. \n72.  Ms. Roberts returned to the City Court on June 13, 2016, and paid $262.50 on her \nticket for driving without a license after borrowing the money from her family.  However, she \ndid not have the money to pay her fine or court costs on the speeding ticket.  Defendant Black \ndid not give Ms. Roberts an opportunity to tell him that she did not have any money and was just \ntrying to do her best to take care of her two-year-old daughter. \n73.  Before Ms. Roberts could say anything, Defendant Black told her “this was [her] \nlast extension.”  A court employee then escorted her out of the courtroom to pay an additional \n$50.  There were so many people standing in line to pay the extension fee that there were even a \ncouple of people that could not fit in the courthouse and had to stand outside. \n74.  After Ms. Roberts told a court employee that she could not pay $50, he told Ms. \nRoberts that she could not leave the City Court and would go to jail if she did not pay the money.  \nHe ordered Ms. Roberts to go back into the courtroom where several other people were also \nfacing arrest for non-payment. \n75.  Ms. Roberts’s boyfriend left the City Court to get $50 as fast as he could to \npurchase Ms. Roberts’s freedom.  She now has until July 25, 2016, to pay the $367.50 she owes \nthe City Court or she will go to jail for not paying her traffic ticket.  \n  14\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 15 of 31\n76.  Ms. Roberts faces an imminent threat that she will be jailed because she cannot \nafford to pay the $367.50 that she owes the City Court on or before July 25, 2016.  \n77.  Ms. Roberts’s right to an impartial judge will be violated if she is forced to appear \nin the City Court on July 25, 2016.  The City Court’s unconstitutional funding structure creates \nan appearance that Defendant Black cannot impartially adjudicate whether Ms. Roberts willfully \nfailed to pay because Defendant Black has a financial interest in extorting money from her to pay \nfor the City Court’s continued operation.  \nF.  Plaintiffs Latasha Cook and Robert Levi Paid an Illegal $50 Extension Fee in \nTheir Criminal Cases before a Judge with an Unconstitutional Conflict of \nInterest. \ni.  Plaintiff Latasha Cook \n78.  Plaintiff Cook appeared in front of Defendant Black on June 1, 2015 and pleaded \nguilty to disturbing the peace.   \n79.  Defendant Black sentenced Ms. Cook to a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail \nwith the condition that she pay a $300 fine plus court costs and complete substance abuse \ntreatment. \n80.  Ms. Cook returned to the City Court on July 13, 2015, but did not have the money \nto pay the fine and court costs because she was unemployed and her only source of income at the \ntime was the disability check she received each month.  \n81.  Defendant Black did not ask Ms. Cook why she did not have the money to pay \nher fine and court costs.  Instead, Ms. Cook paid the City Court the $50 extension fee to receive \nadditional time to pay the fine and court costs. \n82.  Ms. Cook has previously gone to jail because she did not have the money to pay \nher fine and court costs.  Judge Black asked Ms. Cook on that date whether she had $50 to pay \n  15\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 16 of 31\nfor a new court date.  Because she did not have $50 in her pocket, a marshal handcuffed Ms. \nCook and booked her into the City jail.    \nii.  Plaintiff Robert Levi \n83.  Plaintiff  Levi  appeared  in  front  of  Defendant  Black  in  November  2015  and \npleaded guilty to running a stop sign and driving with expired insurance.   \n84.  Defendant Black sentenced Mr. Levi to pay a $100 fine plus court costs and 30 \ndays default time for driving with expired insurance and a $50 fine plus court costs and 15 days \ndefault time for running a stop sign. \n85.  Mr. Levi returned to the City Court in January 2016, but did not have the money \nto pay his fine and court costs.  Judge Black did not ask him why he did not have the money at \nhis January 2016 court date.  Instead, Mr. Levi observed two people arrested for not paying fines \nand court costs.  Mr. Levi was scared that he would go to jail, too, because he did not have the \nmoney to pay his traffic tickets. \n86.  Mr. Levi overheard a city court employee tell a woman that she could pay an \nadditional $50 for an extension of time to pay instead of going to jail.   \n87.  Mr. Levi agreed to pay $50 in addition to his fine and court costs because he \nrealized he would go to jail if he did not pay it.  He had planned to use that money to pay for \nother bills that day, which he was late paying after giving the money to the City Court. \n88.  Mr. Levi returned to the City Court in March 2016 to pay his fine and court costs, \nbut was $40 short of the amount he owed.  He asked a city court employee outside of the \ncourtroom whether he could make a partial payment.  The city court employee told him that \nJudge Black “does not take partial payments” and that he “better call somebody!” because Judge \nBlack is “gonna lock you up!” if he did not come up with the remaining $40. \n  16\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 17 of 31\n89.  Mr. Levi borrowed the outstanding $40 from a friend and paid his traffic tickets in \nfull to avoid going to jail.  \nV.    CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n90.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a Class and Subclass for equitable relief, and a separate \nClass for damages. \n91.  Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott seek class certification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a) and (b)(2), related to Claim One only.  This class is defined as: All individuals who will \nappear in the Bogalusa City Court for criminal cases or who have unpaid fines and costs assessed \nby and owed to the City Court.  This class is referred to as the “Structural Bias Equitable Class.”  \n92.  Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott seek certification of a Subclass pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), related to Claims Two, Three, Four and Six only.  This subclass is \ndefined as: All individuals who were or will be adjudicated guilty in the Bogalusa City Court, \nwho have been or will be given a future date by which to return to City Court, and who have not \npaid the assessed fines and costs in full prior to returning to City Court.  This Subclass is referred \nto as the “Pay Date Equitable Subclass.”  All members of the Pay Date Equitable Subclass are \nalso members of the Structural Bias Equitable Class. \n93.  Plaintiffs Roberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi seek class certification pursuant Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a) and (b)(3), related to Claim Five only.  This class is defined as: Any individual that \npaid an extension fee between June 22, 2015 and the present.  This class is referred to as the \n“Extension Fee Damages Class.”  \n94.  Rule 23(a)(1), Impracticability of Joinder: The precise size of the classes and \nsubclass are unknown by Plaintiffs but is substantial.  The Structural Bias Equitable Class is \nforward-looking and consists of persons appearing in approximately 3,000 criminal traffic and \n  17\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 18 of 31\nmisdemeanor cases filed in the Bogalusa City Court per year.  The Pay Date Equitable Subclass \nis forward-looking and consists of persons who may be subjected to paying an illegal extension \nfee or being put in jail for non-payment; in the past year this occurred to more than 40 persons.  \nThe Extension Fee Damages Class consists of persons who paid the extension fee in the last \nyear, which occurred at least 100 times.  Many classes and most subclasses are comprised of \nlow-income individuals who will likely lack independent resources to bring an independent \naction or to be joined in this action.  Joinder of every member of the class and the subclass would \nbe impracticable.   \n95.  Rule 23(a)(2), Commonality: Plaintiffs raise claims based on questions of law and \nfact that are common to, and typical of, the putative class members they seek to represent.   \na.  Questions of law and fact common to the Structural Bias Equitable Class \ninclude:  \ni.  Whether the City Court has a policy of assessing either $30 or \n$29.50 in court costs according to a fee schedule; \nii.  Whether  court  costs  are  imposed  when  individuals  in  the  City \nCourt are adjudicated guilty but not when they are adjudicated not guilty; \niii.  Whether Defendant Black conducts an inquiry into abilty to pay \nbefore ordering an individual to jail for non-payment of fines and court costs; \niv.  Whether  judicial  expense  funds  are  used  to  pay  for  the  City \nCourt’s operating and other expenses; \nv.  What percentage of the City Court’s total budget is derived from \njudicial expense funds;  \nvi.  Whether  Defendant  Black  has  control  over  the  allocation  of \n  18\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 19 of 31\njudicial expense funds in his executive capacity for the City Court; \nvii.  Whether  court  costs,  extension  fees,  and  contempt  fees  are \ndeposited into the judicial expense account; \nviii.  Whether the City Court created a $50 “extension fee;” \nix.  Whether the City Court permitted Defendant  Black to offer to \nsome defendants the option of paying a $50 extension fee to buy their freedom and additional \ntime to pay their monetary penalties;  \nx.  Whether Defendant Black has a policy or practice of sentencing an \nindividual to serve 15 days in jail or to pay a $250 contempt fee if the individual fails to appear \nto pay her fines and court costs; \nxi.  Whether the City Court’s funding structure creates a structural \nconflict of interest that violates due process; and \nxii.  Whether injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate and if so, \nwhat the terms of such relief should be. \nb.  Questions of law and fact common to the Pay Date Equitable Subclass \ninclude: \ni.  Whether  Defendant  Black  appoints  counsel  at  pay  date \nproceedings or provides alternative safeguards; \nii.

Whether it is lawful for Defendant Black to order individuals to \njail for non-payment of fines and court costs without inquiring into, and making factual findings \nabout, an individual’s ability to pay;  \nvii.  Whether it is lawful for Defendant Black to threaten incarceration \nbut to permit individuals to pay a $50 extension fee to stay out of jail;  \nviii.  Whether it is lawful for Defendant Black to order individuals to \njail for non-payment of fines and court costs without providing counsel at the time of jailing, and \nwithout providing any sort of notice regarding the purpose of the pay date hearing in advance of \nsaid hearing or other procedural safeguards; and  \nix.

Whether the City Court permits Defendant Black to offer to some \nindividuals the option of paying a $50 extension fee to buy their freedom and additional time to \npay their monetary penalties; \n  20\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 21 of 31\niv.

Whether damages are appropriate and if so, what the terms of such \nrelief should be.   \n96.  Rule 23(a)(3), Typicality: The claims of Plaintiffs Roberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi \nare typical of those asserted on behalf of the proposed classes and subclass.  The injuries of \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi all arise out of Defendants’ policies, practices, and \ncustoms.   \n97.  Rule 23(a)(4), Adequacy: Plaintiffs Roberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the proposed classes and subclass.  Plaintiffs are represented \nby  attorneys  from  the  Southern  Poverty  Law  Center,  who  have  experience  in  class-action \nlitigation involving civil rights law, as well as experience litigating policies and practices in \nmunicipal courts that are unconstitutional.  Counsel has the resources, expertise and experience \nto prosecute this action.  Counsel knows of no conflict among members of the proposed class. \n98.  Rule 23(b)(2): Defendant Black has acted on grounds generally applicable to the \nStructural  Bias  Equitable  Class  and  Pay  Date  Equitable  Subclass,  making  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief with respect to the class and subclass as a whole appropriate and necessary.   \n99.  Rule 23(b)(3): The common questions of fact and law predominate over the \nquestions of law and fact affecting individual members of the Extension Fee Damages Class, and \na class action is a superior method to adjudicate these claims, making it appropriate to decide the \ndamages claims through the class mechanism.  Particularly, the factual and legal questions \n  21\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 22 of 31\nsurrounding the general policies and practices of the City Court apply equally to all members of \nthe Damages Class.  Furthermore, class members have little ability to pursue these claims \nindividually,  and  it  would  be  in  the  interest  of  judicial  economy  to  adjudicate  the \nconstitutionality of the City Court’s policies and practices in one proceeding.  \nVI.    CLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Structural Conflict of Interest – Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, and the Structural Bias Equitable Class versus  \nDefendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n100.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n101.  The Due Process Clause requires Defendant Black to impartially adjudicate cases \nas well as maintain the appearance of impartiality.  \n102.  Defendant Black exercises judicial functions when presiding over cases in the \nCity Court and executive functions over the City Court’s finances and collection practices.  \n103.  Defendant Black, in his administrative and executive role, has the duty to create a \nbudget and to raise money to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses, and he has the ultimate \ndiscretion and control over spending court costs, extension fees, and contempt fees deposited \ninto the judicial expense account.  \n104.  Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \npolicymaker for the City Court, established a policy, practice, or custom of creating a budget that \nrelies on judicial expense funds to make up a substantial part of the City Court’s budget.  This \npolicy, practice, or custom is the moving force behind the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nrights. \n  22\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 23 of 31\n105.  The manner in which the City Court is funded creates a structural conflict of \ninterest  between  Defendant  Black’s  duty  to  impartially  adjudicate  cases  and  his  executive \nresponsibility to raise money to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses, in violation of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n106.  There  is  an  on-going  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  Roberts  and  Scott  and \nDefendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the future, and will \nappear before a judge with a structural conflict of interest.  The City Court’s funding structure \ncreates an appearance that Defendant Black cannot impartially adjudicate whether Plaintiffs \nRoberts and Scott willfully failed to pay because Defendant Black has a financial interest in \nextorting money from them to pay for the City Court’s continued operation. \n107.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§ 2201–2202  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983, \nPlaintiffs Roberts and Scott, on behalf of themselves and the Structural Bias Equitable Class, \nseek  a  declaration  and  injunction  against  Defendant  Black  in  his  individual  and  official \ncapacities to prevent future injury resulting from the conflict of interest created by Defendant \nBlack acting under color of law in his individual and official capacities. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Bearden Violation — Due Process and Equal Protection) \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass versus  \nDefendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n108.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n109.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses prohibit \nincarcerating individuals for nonpayment without first determining that they willfully refused to \nmake a monetary payment.   \n  23\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 24 of 31\n110.  There  is  an  on-going  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  Roberts  and  Scott  and \nDefendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the future and will likely \nbe unable to pay their monetary penalties.  Pursuant to his practice, Defendant Black will likely \nfail to make an inquiry into Plaintiffs’ ability to pay before sentencing them to jail for non-\npayment.  \n111.  Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott, as well as those similarly situated, will be subject to \nconfinement and other imminent injury in the future if Defendant Black’s policies, practices, and \ncustoms are not declared to be unconstitutional.   \n112.  Declaratory relief is likely unavailable because Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott are \nrequired to appear in the City Court on July 25, 2016.  There will likely not be sufficient time \nbefore their July 25, 2016 hearing for this Court to reach a final determination on Plaintiffs’ \ndeclaratory judgment claim.  As such, Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott, as well as those similarly \nsituated, alternatively seek a preliminary injunction to protect them from the injuries that will be \ncaused by Defendant Black’s unconstitutional policies, practices, and customs.   \n113.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§ 2201–2202  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983, \nPlaintiffs Roberts and Scott, on behalf of themselves and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass, seek a \ndeclaration,  or  if  unavailable,  a  preliminary  injunction,  to  prevent  future  injury  caused  by \nDefendant Black acting under color of state law in his individual and official capacities. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Right to Counsel – Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass versus  \nDefendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n114.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n  24\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 25 of 31\n115.  There  is  an  on-going  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  Roberts  and  Scott  and \nDefendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the future, and will \nlikely be unable to pay their monetary penalties.  Pursuant to his practice, Defendant Black will \nlikely fail to appoint counsel or provide alternative safeguards before requiring them to pay an \nillegal $50 extension fee or ordering them to jail for non-payment. Defendant Black also will not \nprovide notice to Plaintiffs that their ability to pay will be a critical issue in these proceedings. \n116.  The practices described in the previous paragraph constitutes a violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n117.  Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott, as well as those similarly situated, will be subject to \npayment of an illegal fee, confinement, and other imminent injury in the future if Defendant \nBlack’s policies, practices, and customs are not declared to be unconstitutional.   \n118.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiffs Roberts and \nScott, on behalf of themselves and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass, seek a declaration to prevent \nfuture injury caused by Defendant Black acting under color of state law in his individual and \nofficial capacities. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Substantive Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass  \nversus Defendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n119.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n120.  The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the government from depriving someone of \nliberty or property in an arbitrary or capricious manner. \n121.  Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \n  25\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 26 of 31\npolicymaker  for  the  City  Court,  established  a  policy,  practice,  or  custom  of  creating  an \n“extension fee” that persons could pay in order to avoid going to jail.  This policy, practice, or \ncustom is the moving force behind the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n122.  Defendant  Black’s  policies,  practices,  customs,  acts,  and  omissions  risk \nconditioning Plaintiffs Roberts’ and Scott’s liberty on paying an illegal extension fee to the City \nCourt’s judicial expense account.  \n123.  Conditioning  an  individual’s  liberty  on  the  payment  of  the  extension  fee  is \narbitrary and capricious because there is no statutory or other authority for the extension fee, in \nviolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n124.  There  is  an  on-going  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  Roberts  and  Scott  and \nDefendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the future, and will \nlikely be unable to pay their monetary penalties.  Pursuant to his practice, Defendant Black will \nlikely order Plaintiffs to jail for non-payment if they fail to pay the $50 extension fee.   \n125.  Plaintiffs  Roberts  and  Scott,  and  those  similarly  situated,  will  be  subject  to \nconfinement and imminent injury if Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs are not declared \nto be unconstitutional.   \n126.  Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott, on behalf of themselves and the Pay Date Equitable \nSubclass bring this claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for actions \ntaken by Defendant Black under color of state law and seek a declaration against Defendant \nBlack in his individual and official capacities to prevent future injury. \n  26\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 27 of 31\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Extension Fee — Procedural Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, Cook, Levi, and the Extension Fee Damages Class versus  \nDefendants Bogalusa City Court and Defendant Black in his Official Capacity  \n \n127.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n128.  Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \npolicymaker  for  the  City  Court,  established  a  policy,  practice,  or  custom  of  creating  an \n“extension fee” that persons could pay in order to avoid going to jail.  This policy, practice, or \ncustom is the moving force behind the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n129.  Defendant Black, in his judicial capacity, utilizes this policy, practice, or custom \nto deprive individuals of their property in a manner not authorized by state law by having them \npay a $50 extension fee to Defendant City Court to avoid going to jail for non-payment of their \nmonetary penalties.  \n130.  Plaintiffs  Roberts,  Scott,  Cook,  and  Levi  and  the  proposed  Extension  Fee \nDamages Class have paid the extension fee to the City Court.  \n131.  Plaintiffs  Roberts,  Scott,  Cook,  and  Levi  and  the  proposed  Extension  Fee \nDamages Class have a property interest in the extension fee they paid to the City Court.  \n132.  Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of their property in a manner not authorized by \nstate law by having them pay a $50 extension fee to avoid going to jail for non-payment of their \nmonetary penalties.  \n133.  Plaintiffs  Roberts,  Scott,  Cook,  and  Levi,  on  behalf  of  themselves  and  the \nExtension Fee Damages Class, bring this claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for actions taken by \nDefendant Black under color of state law and seek an award of damages for their injuries from \n  27\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 28 of 31\nDefendant Bogalusa City Court and Defendant Black, sued in his official capacity, by charging \nPlaintiffs the illegal extension fee. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n(Extension Fee — Procedural Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass versus \nDefendant Black in his Individual and Official Capacities \n \n134.

Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \npolicymaker  for  the  City  Court,  established  a  policy,  practice,  or  custom  of  creating  an \n“extension fee” that persons could pay in order to avoid going to jail.  This policy, practice, or \ncustom is the moving force behind the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n136.  Defendant Black, in his judicial capacity, utilizes this policy, practice, or custom \nto deprive individuals of their property in a manner not authorized by state law by having them \npay a $50 extension fee to Defendant City Court to avoid going to jail for non-payment of their \nmonetary penalties.  \n137.  There  is  an  on-going  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  Roberts  and  Scott  and \nmembers of the Pay Date Equitable Subclass and Defendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to \nappear in the City Court in the future and will likely be unable to pay their monetary penalties.  \nPursuant to the City Court’s practice, Defendant Black is authorized to and likely will offer \nPlaintiffs and the Subclass a false choice: either pay the illegal $50 extension fee or go to jail. \n138.  Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott have a property interest in the $50 extension fee they \nwill be asked to pay pursuant to the Bogalusa City Court policy.  \n139.  Plaintiffs Roberts and Scott, as well as those similarly situated, will be subject to \n  28\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/21/16   Page 29 of 31\npayment of an illegal fee, in the future if Defendant’s policies, practices, and customs are not \ndeclared to be unconstitutional.   \n140.

BLACK, in his individual and   \nofficial capacities, and BOGALUSA CITY \nCOURT, \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nI.    PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Defendants Judge Robert J. Black (“Black”) and the Bogalusa City Court (“City \nCourt”) operate a modern-day debtors’ prison, jailing the poor for their failure to pay.  Defendant \nBlack routinely orders individuals to jail for non-payment of monetary penalties for minor traffic \nand misdemeanor offenses without inquiring into the reason for non-payment and imposes overly \nburdensome alternative sentences under the threat of jail that are impossible for many to satisfy.   \n2.  The City Court is funded off the backs of the poor.  It substantially relies on the \ncourt costs and fees it collects from criminal defendants.  The City Court routinely covers at least \n15% of its expenditures through income it generates from criminal defendants.  Without this \nmoney, the City Court could not function.  This structural conflict of interest creates an incentive \nfor Defendant Black to find individuals guilty, to impose the maximum statutory court costs (and \nto fail to waive those costs if an individual is unable to pay), and to either jail a person for failing \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 2 of 44\nto pay without making an inquiry into their ability to pay, or to convert the fines and costs into \nunreasonable community service requirements without considering the person’s ability to satisfy \nthose requirements within the time allotted.   \n3.  This  incentive  is  exemplified  through  Defendant  Black’s  creation  of  a  $50 \n“extension fee,” and later a $25 community service “enrollment fee,” to raise additional money \nto operate the City Court.  These fees are not authorized by state law.   \n4.  On June 21, 2016, Plaintiffs Rozzie Scott (“Scott”), Ebony Roberts (“Roberts”), \nLatasha Cook (“Cook”), and Robert Levi (“Levi”) filed a lawsuit against Defendant  Black \nalleging that Defendant Black operates a modern day debtors’ prison and cannot maintain the \nappearance of impartiality because the City Court substantially relies on court costs and fees to \nfund its operations.  Shortly thereafter, the Parties agreed to several temporary stipulations (the \n“Agreements”) in which Defendant Black agreed not to jail people for non-payment of fines, \ncosts, or contempt fees, and would not assess or collect any court costs authorized by  La. Stat. \nAnn. § 13:1899 or extension or contempt fees that are retained by the City Court.   \n5.  Before the Agreements, Defendant Black gave individuals unable to pay their \nmonetary penalties in full a false choice: they could either go to jail for non-payment of fines and \ncosts or pay this illegal $50 extension fee to buy additional time to pay their monetary penalty.  \n6.  Plaintiffs  Scott,  Roberts,  Cook,  and  Levi  were  previously  victimized  by  this \nfunding system and were forced to accept the false choice of paying the illegal $50 extension fee \nto avoid being jailed.  Each of these Plaintiffs paid the City Court $50 to purchase their freedom.  \nHundreds of other people either went to jail or were forced to make this payment. \n7.  Since  the  Parties  entered  into  the  Agreements,  Defendant  Black  has  started  \nordering defendants who are unable to pay their fines and court costs to perform community \n  2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 3 of 44\nservice, under the threat of jail if they fail to satisfy the order.  There is only one community \nservice option: picking up trash at the Bogalusa City Jail once per week on Saturday mornings.  \nThose  who  cannot  pay  or  perform  the  community  service—because  of  physical  or  mental \ndisability  or  because  of  scheduling  conflicts  due  to  work  or  childcare—are  told  that  the \nalternative is jail. \n8.  The Agreements will expire on February 17, 2017, and there is a reasonable \nexpectation Defendant Black will again require individuals to pay illegal fees, jail them for non-\npayment without regard to indigency, and incarcerate those who cannot perform the community \nservice.    There  is  no  evidence  that  Defendants  will  abandon  the  unconstitutional  policies, \npractices, and procedures they employed before the Agreements.  \n9.  Plaintiffs  Richard  Bolgiano  (“Bolgiano”),  Benny  Graham  (“Graham”),  James \nLorio  (“Lorio”),  Bradley  Moses  (“Moses”),  and  Marisa  Pam  (“Pam”)  fear  they  will  be \nincarcerated  for  non-payment,  forced  to  make  an  illegal  payment,  required  to  perform \nunreasonable community service under the threat of jail, and deprived of due process by having \ntheir cases decided by a biased judge at their upcoming court hearings.  Plaintiffs do not have the \nability to pay the hundreds of dollars in fines and costs they owe the City Court or the ability to \nperform the community service that has been or will be imposed under the threat of jail.   \n10.  Defendants’ unconstitutional practices have affected, and will continue to affect, \nhundreds of low-income people with citations for traffic tickets or misdemeanor violations in the \nCity of Bogalusa, Louisiana.  Plaintiffs bring these claims on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated to seek a declaration that Defendants’ practices are unconstitutional, to seek an \ninjunction to enjoin them from continuing these practices, and to seek damages to recover the \nillegal extension fee for those who paid it in the past year.   \n  3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 4 of 44\nII.    JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion jurisdiction). \n12.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of \nthe events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District.  \nIII.    PARTIES \nA.

Defendant  Bogalusa  City  Court  is  a  government  entity  located  in  Bogalusa, \nLouisiana.   \n   \n  4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 5 of 44\nIV.    STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Defendant Black Oversees and Administers the Bogalusa City Court. \n24.  Bogalusa  is  a  town  of  about  12,000  people  located  in  Washington  Parish, \nLouisiana, approximately 1.5 hours north of New Orleans, Louisiana.  The town’s economy \ncenters on the lumber and paper mills.  Nearly 36% of the population in Bogalusa lives below the \npoverty line.  The median household income was $25,036 in 2015, less than half of the median \nhousehold income in the United States. \n25.  The City Court is authorized to hear cases involving city ordinance violations, \nincluding  traffic  tickets  and  misdemeanors,  which  are  committed  within  Ward  Four  of \nWashington Parish.  Defendant Black is the only judge who sits on the City Court. \n26.  Defendant Black is elected to his position as judge of the City Court.   \n27.  Defendant Black is authorized to appoint and remove clerks and deputy clerks for \nthe City Court. \n28.  Defendant Black possesses administrative, executive, and judicial powers over the \nCity Court.   In his  administrative capacity, Defendant  Black is  responsible for  the orderly \nadministration of the City Court.  In his executive capacity, Defendant Black is responsible for \nthe City Court’s finances, including creating a budget for the City Court and ensuring the City \nCourt has sufficient funds to pay employee salaries and the City Court’s overhead expenses.  \nFinally, in his judicial capacity, Defendant Black is responsible for impartially adjudicating \nmunicipal and misdemeanor cases before the City Court.   \n29.  Defendant Black is authorized to create policies and rules for the conduct of \njudicial business before the City Court.  This power includes practices with regard to the City \nCourt’s collection of fines and court costs.  \n  5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 6 of 44\nB.  The  Bogalusa  City  Court  Systematically  Jails  and  Threatens  to  Jail \nIndividuals Who Cannot Pay Fines and Court Costs that Fund the  City \nCourt  or  Converts  Those  Fines  and  Court  Costs  into  Unreasonable \nCommunity  Service  Requirements  Ordered  Under  the  Threat  of \nIncarceration. \n30.  The Bogalusa City Court typically conducts criminal proceedings once per week, \non Monday mornings and afternoons.   \n31.  On behalf of the City Court, Defendant Black imposes a suspended jail sentence \nfor individuals who plead guilty or are found guilty after trial and are given a sentence of fines \nand costs only, with the jail sentence to be activated if the individual fails to pay.  See La. C. Cr. \nP. Art. 884.  This suspended jail sentence is commonly referred to as “default time.”   \n32.  Defendant Black does not conduct an indigency determination before imposing \ndefault time or inquire into whether an individual has the resources to pay a fine and court costs. \n33.  Defendant  Black  also  imposes  “default  time”  when  ordering  individuals  to \ncomplete community service.   \n34.  If an individual cannot pay the fine and court costs in full on the sentencing date, \nDefendant Black orders the individual to return to the City Court by the “pay date” or converts \nthe fine and court costs to community service.  The pay date functions as the deadline by which \nDefendant Black expects the individual to pay the fines and court costs in full. \n35.  The City Court does not accept partial payments, reduce fines and court costs to a \ncivil judgment, or remit any fines for those who are unable to pay.  Any individual ordered to \npay a fine and court costs must pay the fine and court costs in full or complete the ordered \ncommunity service. \n36.  Neither Defendant Black nor anyone acting on behalf of the City Court provides \nor appoints counsel to persons appearing at pay date proceedings. \n  6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 7 of 44\n37.  Neither Defendant Black nor anyone acting on behalf of the City Court provides \nnotice before the pay date proceedings that the person’s ability to pay will be a critical issue at \nthe hearing if they are unable to pay, or provides the individual during or before the hearing with \na  form  (or  its  equivalent)  designed  to  elicit  information  about  the  individual’s  financial \ncircumstances.  \n1.   Practices Before the Parties’ Agreements. \n38.  Before the Parties’ Agreements, see supra para. 4, Defendant  Black did not \ninquire into the reasons for non-payment if an individual failed to pay the fines and court costs \nimposed or distinguish between those individuals who willfully refused to pay and those who \ncould not pay due to their indigence. \n39.  When a person appeared at a pay date and did not have the money to pay the \nmonetary penalty, Defendant Black often allowed some individuals to pay a $50 “extension fee” \nto purchase their freedom and be permitted additional time to pay their monetary penalty.1   \n40.  Defendant Black instructed those who could not afford the $50 “extension fee” or \nwho were not given that option to sit in seats at the front of the courtroom for the remainder of \nthe court session.   \n41.  A City Court marshal generally allowed individuals to leave the courtroom to \nmake phone calls to family and friends to try to arrange for payment while court remained in \nsession.  A marshal escorted out of the courtroom those individuals permitted to make phone \ncalls to arrange for payment.  The marshal stood by the individual while he or she attempted to \ncontact family, friends, or co-workers to explain that he or she will be arrested and jailed if the \n                                                 \n1 This extension fee is described in greater detail at Paragraphs 89 through 99.  \n  7 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 8 of 44\nfines and court costs were not paid by the end of the court session.  If family, friends, or co-\nworkers brought money to pay the fines and court costs to the courthouse before the end of the \ncourt session, the individual was allowed to pay and to leave.  \n42.  At the end of the court session, the marshal walked those who could not pay down \nthe courthouse steps and to the jail in an adjacent building, and booked them into the City jail.  \nSometimes the marshal did this by handcuffing persons together.   \n43.  The City Court clerk’s minute entries recorded when a person was sent to jail for \nnon-payment, noting that the person had failed to pay and was ordered to serve time in jail or to \nremain in jail until a certain amount was paid.  To illustrate, in the sample minutes below, \nDefendant Black ordered an individual to either serve “50 days default time” or pay $575.00 for \nnot having proof of insurance or a license plate: \n \n44.  Any individual arrested for non-payment could be released from jail if the fine \nand court costs were paid in full or if the individual served the default time.   \n45.  The City’s jail logs document the amount of money an individual had to pay or \nthe amount of time the individual had to serve to be released from jail.  In the example below, an \n  8 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu  m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 9 of 44\nindividual was ordered to serve 160 days in jail unless he paid a $724 “cash fine”: \n \n46.  If an individual failed to appear at the pay date, Defendant  Black issued an \nattachment for the individual’s arrest and ordered the individual to serve 15 days in jail or to pay \na $250 cash bond.  In the sample below, Defendant Black sentenced an individual to a pay or \nstay sentence of “15 days” in jail or a “$250.00 contempt fee”: \n \n47.  Defendant  Black  sometimes  announced  in  open  court  when  issuing  such \nattachments that a person that failed to appear to pay could “buy their way out of jail.” \n48.  Defendant Black’s announcement that a person can “buy their way out of jail” is \nreflected in the jail logs.  In the example below, an individual paid a fine of $250 to “shorten \n[her] sentence of 15 days”: \n \n  9 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 10 of 44\n2. Practices After the Parties’ Agreements. \n49.  Since the Parties entered into the Agreements, Defendant Black still does not \noffer payment plans, remit any fines, or sign a civil judgment in the amount of the fines and costs \nto collect through civil process rather than by using criminal sanctions.  Instead, he has started \nrequiring people who lack the money to pay their fines and court costs at the Pay Date to perform \ncommunity service as an alternative to going to jail for non-payment. \n50.  A person’s sentence is satisfied and her case is closed if the community service is \ncompleted within the allotted timeframe, along with any other conditions of the sentence. \n51.  Defendant Black, however, offers only one community service option: picking up \ntrash at the Bogalusa Police Department. \n52.  The amount of community service imposed varies from defendant to defendant \nand appears to be unrelated to the amount of the initial fine imposed.  There is no cap on the \nnumber of community service hours imposed. \n53.  Additionally, a person can only satisfy any community service requirements one \nday per week on Saturday mornings, generally for a period of four or eight hours.  Individuals \nare not informed about the number of available community service hours in advance of the date \nthat they are performed.  \n54.  Any person ordered to complete community service as an alternative to payment \nis given a summons to return to the City Court to “Pay Fines and Costs” and to provide “Proof of \nCompletion of Community Service or Contempt Charge.”   In the example below, Plaintiff \nMarisa Pam is required to return to the City Court on February 13, 2017 to show proof of 40 \nhours of community service or will be subject to a “contempt charge.” \n  10 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 11 of 44\n \n55.  Defendant Black has continued to threaten some individuals verbally that they \nwill go to jail if they do not complete the community service within the allotted timeframe. \n56.  Defendant Black has also continued to impose fees that are not authorized under \nstate law.  For example, he has charged some individuals a $25 community service “enrollment \nfee” to pick up trash at the Bogalusa Police Department, even though the $25 community service \nenrollment fee is not authorized under state law. \n57.  Money collected from the $25 community service enrollment fee is deposited into \nthe City Court’s accounts.  The City Court’s income statements reflect that Defendant Black has \nraised nearly $1,000 by charging defendants unable to pay fines and court costs this new, \nunauthorized fee: \n \n \n58.  Many  City  Court  defendants  cannot  perform  the  community  service  due  to \ndisability, lack of transportation or childcare, or because they work on Saturdays.   \n59.  Moreover, the limited availability of the community service offered means that \n  11 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 12 of 44\nmany individuals who cannot afford to pay their fines and costs are in practice unable to access \nthis alternative, even though they are capable of doing the work.  \n60.  Defendant Black tells many people who attempt to explain that they cannot pay \nthe fine or perform the community service that the alternative is jail, and orders each defendant \nsentenced to community service to appear to show “proof of completion of community service” \nor face a “contempt charge.”  \n61.  Additionally, Defendant Black has continued to enforce pay or stay sentences on \nanyone who fails to appear, even though the Parties’ Agreements prohibit him from doing so. \n62.  If a person returns to the City Court after failing to appear, Defendant Black holds \nthe person in contempt and orders the person to pay $150 or serve 15 days in jail.2   \n63.  Defendant Black instructs those who do not have the $150 to sit in the front of the \ncourtroom for the remainder of the court session and to await their arrest.   \n64.   A City Court marshal sometimes allows individuals to leave the courtroom to \nmake phone calls to family and friends to try to arrange for payment of the $150 while court \nremains in session.  A marshal escorts out of the courtroom those individuals permitted to make \nphone calls to arrange for payment.  The marshal stands by the individual while he or she \nattempts to contact family, friends, or co-workers to explain that he or she will be arrested and \njailed if the $150 contempt fee is not paid by the end of the court session.  If family, friends, or \nco-workers bring money to pay the $150 contempt fee to the courthouse before the end of the \ncourt session, the individual is allowed to pay and to leave.  \n65.  If an individual is arrested on a warrant for failure to appear, the police tell the \n                                                 \n2 While the stipulations are in place, this fee is $150 instead of $250 because Defendants have \nagreed not to assess the $100 that is credited to the City Court’s judicial expense fund. \n  12 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 13 of 44\nperson that they must either pay $150 or serve 15 days in jail.  This amount is independent of the \nperson’s underlying criminal charge.  In the example below, the person had to pay $300 for \nfailing to appear on two charges or serve 30 days in jail: \n \n66.  The City Court clerk’s minute entries record when a person is sentenced to a pay \nor stay sentence after being arrested on a failure to appear warrant.  To illustrate, in the sample \nminutes below, an individual was sentenced to pay $150 or serve 15 days in jail: \n \n67.  Upon expiration of the Agreements, Defendant Black will no longer be prohibited \nfrom requiring individuals to pay the illegal extension fee, jailing defendants for non-payment \nwithout regard to indigency, incarcerating individuals who are unable to perform the community \nservice, or creating new fees to fund the City Court that are unauthorized by state law. \nC.  The Bogalusa City Court Substantially Relies on Court Costs and Fees to \nFund its Court Operations. \n68.  The State of Louisiana does not have a unified funding system for the State’s \ncourts and does not oversee the budgets of city courts.  Instead, as the Louisiana Supreme Court \nreported to the Legislature in 2014, self-generated and local funds—not state funds—represent \nthe  largest  sources  of  revenue  in  the  majority  of  courts.    As  the  Louisiana  House  of \nRepresentatives has noted, city courts are funded through the use of court costs and fees that are \n  13 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 14 of 44\nimposed on those persons appearing before the City Court. \n69.  The City Court’s operating expenses are paid through four sources of revenue: the \nState of Louisiana, the Washington Parish Government, the City of Bogalusa, and the City Court \nitself through assessments of certain costs and fees.   \n70.  The funds the City of Bogalusa, Washington Parish, and the State of Louisiana \nprovide  for  the  City  Court,  however,  are  insufficient  to  cover  the  City  Court’s  operating \nexpenses.  The following table illustrates the City Court’s total revenue from the City, Parish, \nand State (“Total Governmental Funding”); its total expenditures; its shortfall; and the shortfall \nas a percentage of total expenditures, for 2009 to 2015:  \nBogalusa City Court Governmental Revenues and Expenditures \n2009-2015 \nYear  Total Governmental  Total  Shortfall  Shortfall as % of \nFunding  Expenditures  Expenditures \n2009  $109,062  $161,310  $52,248  32.4% \n2010  $120,509  $176,171  $55,662  31.6% \n2011  $210,049  $280,043  $69,994  25% \n2012  $212,910  $293,024  $80,114  27.3% \n2013  $253,641  $364,000  $110,359  30.3% \n2014  $280,357  $386,934  $106,577  27.5% \n2015  $282,245  $383,303  $101,058  26.4% \n \n71.  The  remainder  of  the  City  Court’s  operating  expenses  not  funded  by  the \ncontributions of the State, Parish, and City are funded through court costs and fees collected in \ncriminal cases; court fees collected in civil cases; and reserves of these same fees collected in \nprior years.   \n72.  Defendant Black is authorized under multiple state statutes to assess a variety of \ncourt costs in criminal cases.  Although most of these court costs are disbursed to other entities, \nDefendant Black is also authorized to assess up to $30 under  La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 against \nevery defendant who is found guilty or forfeits his bond.  This court cost is different than other \n  14 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 15 of 44\ncourt costs because Defendant Black is authorized by state statute to keep and spend the money \ngenerated under La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 to support the City Court’s operations.   \n73.  Defendant Black also retains $100 for the City Court’s operating expenses after \nfinding an individual in contempt and imposing monetary penalties.   \n74.  As the top official of the City Court, Defendant Black, in his administrative and \nexecutive capacity, has the sole discretion over how to spend the money generated under La. \nStat. Ann. § 13:1899. \n1. Practices Before the Parties’ Agreement. \n75.  Before the Agreements, in his administrative and executive capacity, Defendant \nBlack established a practice of assessing $30 in some cases under La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 and \n$29.50 in other cases, depending on the charge.  He created and authorized a case costs schedule \nfor the City Court that reflected whether to charge $30 or $29.50 based on the charge.   \n76.  When imposing a monetary penalty, Defendant Black specified a specific fine \namount and then refers generally to “costs.”  The specific amount of costs is later assessed by a \ncourt employee based on the schedule.   \n77.  In his administrative and executive capacity, Defendant Black also established a \npractice of assessing a $250 contempt fine and costs if a person failed to appear and ordered the \nClerk of Court to retain $100 of that amount to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses. \n78.  In his administrative and executive capacities for the City Court, Defendant Black \nordered  the  Clerk  of  Court  to  create  a  “judicial  expense”  account  for  the  City  Court  and \ninstructed the clerks to deposit the statutory court costs under La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899 into that \naccount.  In addition to these costs, the judicial expense account consisted of money collected \nfrom extension fees and contempt fees.  No other sources funded the City Court’s judicial \n  15 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 16 of 44\nexpense account. \n79.  Costs assessed against City Court criminal defendants comprised a substantial \nportion of the City Court’s yearly operating budget.  For example, the City Court generated \nnearly $57,000 for its “judicial expense” account in 2014 through court costs assessed under La. \nStat.  Ann.  § 13:1899,  extension  fees,  and  contempt  fees  for  non-payment—an  amount  that \nrepresented  approximately 15% of the City Court’s operating budget.  In 2015, the City Court \ngenerated even more court-controlled revenue—at least $64,000 in judicial expense funds from \ncourt costs and fees and at least $5,000 in extension fees—an amount that represented about 18% \nof the City Court’s revenues and expenditures in its proposed operating budget. \n80.  Defendant Black controlled the judicial expense account in his executive and \nadministrative capacity for the City Court and had sole discretion under state law to determine \nhow those funds were allocated to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses.   \n81.  The  manner  in  which  Defendants  funded  the  City  Court  created  a  structural \nconflict of interest between Defendant  Black’s duty to impartially adjudicate cases and his \nexecutive responsibility to raise money to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses.  The City \nCourt could not have operated if Defendant Black did not find, or threaten to find, City Court \ndefendants guilty or in contempt, and if he did not successfully collect court costs and fees from \na substantial number of individuals who appeared before him. \n2. Practices After the Parties’ Agreement. \n82.  Since the Parties entered into the Agreements, Defendant Black has not been \ncollecting or assessing any court costs authorized by  La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899, extension fees, or \ncontempt fees that are retained by the City Court. \n83.  However, neither the local governments nor the State of Louisiana have provided \n  16 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 17 of 44\nthe City Court supplemental funding to off-set this loss of money.  Instead, the City Court has \nbeen funding itself through its reserve funds from its judicial expense account to make up for the \nloss of income from City Court defendants.  As of December 31, 2015, the City Court had \n$52,262 in cash reserves in its judicial expense account.  \n84.  As noted supra para. 68-71, the City Court averages about a $100,000 budgetary \nshortfall from local and State funding sources each year.   \n85.  Six months have passed since the Parties entered into their Agreements.  Based \nupon information and belief, and the City Court’s expenditures from previous years, the City \nCourt will have spent about $50,000 of its cash reserves upon the expiration of the stipulations \nand nearly exhausted its reserves.  \n86.  Neither the State nor local governments have provided sufficient additional funds \nfor 2017 to off-set the loss of monies generated from criminal defendants. \n87.  The City Court will not have sufficient funds to operate unless it begins to assess \njudicial expense funds again upon the expiration of the Agreements. \n88.  The City Court’s funding structure creates a structural conflict of interest between \nDefendant Black’s duty to impartially adjudicate cases and his executive responsibility to raise \nmoney to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses.  The City Court will not be able to operate \nif Defendant Black does not find, or threaten to find, City Court defendants guilty or in contempt \nfor failure to pay, appear, or complete community service,3 and if he does not successfully \ncollect court costs and fees from a substantial number of individuals who appear before him. \n                                                 \n3 The conflict of interest will exist even for those defendants who are facing contempt for failure \nto complete community service.  A person held in contempt is typically assessed a $250 fee, \n$100 of which is deposited into the City Court’s judicial expense fund—or more than three times \nwhat the City Court can initially collect from a defendant in judicial expense funds. \n  17 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 18 of 44\nD.  The Bogalusa City Court Has Created Illegal Fees to Generate Additional \nRevenue. \n89.  Before the Parties’ Agreements, Defendant Black created a $50 “extension fee” \non behalf of the City Court in his executive and administrative capacities.  The money collected \nthrough this extension fee was used to pay for the operations of the City Court.   \n90.  The “extension fee” is not authorized by state law.   \n91.  City courts are not authorized to create new court costs and fees under state law; \nthat authority is limited to the Louisiana State Legislature.   \n92.  Through the creation of this fee, the City Court authorized Defendant Black, \nacting in his judicial capacity, to offer a false choice to individuals who cannot pay fines and \ncourt costs by the pay date: either (a) pay the extension fee by the end of the court session (or in \nsome cases, shortly after booking) and be granted additional time to pay the fines and court costs, \nor (b) go to jail until all fines and costs are paid or the underlying sentence is served.   \n93.  The $50 “extension fee” is not memorialized in an order because it was not \nactually ordered by Defendant Black.  Rather, it was treated by the City Court as an alternative \ncollection method, to permit the person to pay more in order to have additional time to try to pay \nthe monetary penalty. \n94.  If a person was not able to pay the illegal $50 extension fee before the end of \ncourt, she was processed into the jail.  But if she obtained it shortly after being jailed, she may \nhave been permitted to be released, as reflected in the jail records.  For example, in the below jail \nlog excerpt, the person was jailed at 2:52pm and was released 19 minutes later, after paying the \nextension fee:  \n  18 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 19 of 44\n \n95.  The money collected as an extension fee was not credited toward an individual’s \nfines or court costs.  Instead, it was treated as a separate and additional fee.  \n96.  In 2015, the City Court collected the extension fee from at least 100 individuals, \nnetting at least $5,000 to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses.   \n97.  Although the Agreements presently prohibit Defendant Black from assessing the \nextension fee, he will again be able to assess and collect it upon their expiration. \n98.  Since the Agreements, Defendant Black has also created a $25 community service \n“enrollment fee” on behalf of the City Court in his executive and administrative capacities.  The \nmoney collected through this fee is retained by the City Court.   \n99.  Although the $25 community service “enrollment fee” is not authorized by state \nlaw, Defendant Black has started charging defendants this fee to pick up trash at the Bogalusa \nPolice Department.   \nE.  Plaintiffs Richard Bolgiano, Benny Graham, James Lorio, Bradley Moses, \nand Marisa Pam Face Unconstitutional Treatment at Upcoming Court Dates. \ni.  Plaintiff Richard Bolgiano \n100.   Plaintiff Richard Bolgiano appeared in front of Defendant Black on December \n12, 2016, and pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.   \n101.  Defendant Black ordered Mr. Bolgiano to pay $433 in fines and costs on the \npossession of marijuana charge before February 13, 2017, and sentenced him to 15 days default \ntime.  Defendant Black also ordered him to pay $243 in fines and costs before February 13, \n2017, on the possession of drug paraphernalia charge and sentenced him to 15 days default time. \n  19 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 20 of 44\n102.  Mr. Bolgiano faces an imminent threat that he will be jailed because he cannot \nafford to pay the $676 in total fines and costs that he owes the City Court.  \n103.  Mr. Bolgiano’s right to an impartial judge will be violated if he is forced to appear \nin the City Court on February 13, 2017, and on any subsequent court date.  The City Court’s \nunconstitutional funding structure creates an appearance that Defendant Black cannot impartially \nadjudicate whether Mr. Bolgiano willfully failed to pay or failed to comply with other court \norders because Defendant Black has a financial interest in extorting money from him to pay for \nthe City Court’s continued operation.  \nii.  Plaintiff Bradley Moses \n104.   Plaintiff Bradley Moses appeared in front of Defendant Black on October 31, \n2016, and pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, running a stop sign, improper lane usage, \ndriving without a license, and contempt for failing to appear at a previous court date. \n105.  Defendant Black ordered Mr. Moses to pay $150 in fines and costs for failing to \nappear with 15 days default time; $100 fine plus costs for possession of marijuana with 15 days \ndefault time, as well as 1 year of unsupervised probation; 16 hours of community service, with \ndefault time of 15 days, for running a stop sign; 8 hours of community service, with default time \nof 5 days, for improper lane usage; and 16 hours of community service, with default time of 5 \ndays, for driving without a license.  He was ordered to pay and to show proof of completion of \ncommunity service or face contempt on December 12, 2016. \n106.  Mr. Moses returned to the City Court on December 12, 2016, but did not have the \nmoney to pay his outstanding fines and court costs and had not completed his community \nservice.  Defendant Black gave him an extension of time to pay and complete his community \nservice until February 13, 2017. \n  20 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 21 of 44\n107.  Mr. Moses faces an imminent threat that he will be jailed because he cannot \nafford to pay the $333 in total fines and costs that he owes the City Court.  \n108.  Mr. Moses’s right to an impartial judge will be violated if he appears in the City \nCourt on February 13, 2017, and any subsequent dates ordered by the City Court.  The City \nCourt’s unconstitutional funding structure creates an appearance that Defendant Black cannot \nimpartially adjudicate whether Mr. Moses willfully failed to pay or failed to comply with other \ncourt orders because Defendant Black has a financial interest in extorting money from him to \npay for the City Court’s continued operation.  \niii.  Plaintiff Benny Graham \n109.   Plaintiff Benny Graham appeared in front of Defendant Black on November 14, \n2016, and pleaded guilty to resisting arrest.   \n110.  Defendant Black sentenced Mr. Graham to pay a $200 fine, plus court costs, by \nJanuary 23, 2017, and default time of 30 days, for the resisting arrest charge.  He fears he will be \nforced to serve the default jail time if he does not pay the fine and court costs by that date.   \n111.  Mr. Graham faces an imminent threat that he will be jailed because he cannot \nafford to pay the $200 in total fines and costs that he owes the City Court.  \n112.  Mr. Graham’s right to an impartial judge will be violated if he appears in the City \nCourt on January 23, 2017, and any subsequent dates ordered by the City Court.  The City \nCourt’s unconstitutional funding structure creates an appearance that Defendant Black cannot \nimpartially adjudicate whether Mr. Graham willfully refused to pay or failed to comply with \nother court orders because Defendant Black has a financial interest in extoring money from him \nto pay for the City Court’s continued operation.  \n  21 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 22 of 44\niv.  Plaintiff James Lorio \n113.   Plaintiff James Lorio appeared in front of Defendant Black on October 31, 2016, \nand pleaded guilty to criminal mischief.   \n114.  Defendant Black sentenced Mr. Lorio to a suspended sentence of 6 months in jail \nwith the condition that he complete 1 year of unsupervised probation, pay a $100 fine, pay a $40 \npublic defender fee, complete substance use treatment, and perform 40 hours of community \nservice before December 12, 2016.   \n115.  Defendant Black explained to Mr. Lorio that the community service consists of \npicking up litter with the Bogalusa Police Department for eight hours on Saturdays. \n116.  Because Mr. Lorio works on Saturdays, he had to take two days off of work to \ncomplete his community service hours. \n117.  On December 12, 2016, Mr. Lorio returned to the City Court after paying his fine \nand costs, but had not completed his community service.  Mr. Lorio tried to explain to Defendant \nBlack that he works every Saturday, has already taken two days off of work to complete the \ncommunity service, and cannot complete the remaining hours of community service without \nlosing his job. \n118.  Defendant Black, however, would not listen to Mr. Lorio and did not offer Mr. \nLorio alternative options to fulfill the reminder of his community service sentence.  One of the \nCity Court clerks told him he would serve jail time if he did not complete the community service \nby February 13, 2017. \n119.  If Judge Black had offered Mr. Lorio other days to complete the community \nservice, he would be able to complete his community service sentence without losing his job and \nwithout facing the possibility of jail.     \n  22 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 23 of 44\n120.  Mr. Lorio will be arraigned on January 9, 2017, and January 23, 2017, for two \nother traffic tickets for driving with a suspended license.  He fears he will be sentenced to \nadditional fines and costs that he will not be able to pay and to additional community service \nhours, which he will not be able to complete without losing his job or facing jail time.  \n121.  Mr. Lorio faces an imminent threat that he will be jailed because he cannot \ncomplete his community service sentence—and won’t be able to complete any future community \nservice sentence—without losing his job, and because he does not have the money to pay his \nfines and court costs that he owes and will owe the City Court.   \n122.  Mr. Lorio’s right to an impartial judge will be violated if he is forced to appear in \nthe  City  Court  on  February  13,  2017,  or  on  any  subsequent  date.    The  City  Court’s \nunconstitutional funding structure creates an appearance that Defendant Black cannot impartially \nadjudicate whether Mr. Lorio willfully failed to pay or to complete the community service \nbecause Defendant Black has a financial interest in extorting money from him to pay for the City \nCourt’s continued operation.   \nv.  Plaintiff Marisa Pam \n123.   Plaintiff Marisa Pam appeared in front of Defendant Black on October 31, 2016, \nand pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace.   \n124.  Defendant Black sentenced Ms. Pam to 1 year unsupervised probation and 90 \ndays in jail suspended on the condition that she pay a $100 fine plus costs and complete marriage \ncounseling on or before December 12, 2016.   \n125.  Ms. Pam returned to the City Court on December 12, 2016, but did not have the \nmoney to pay her fine and costs because of her limited financial means.  Although she asked for \nan extension of time to pay her fine and court costs, Judge Black refused.  \n  23 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 24 of 44\n126.  Without any inquiry into her ability to perform community service, Defendant \nBlack converted Ms. Pam’s fine and costs to 40 hours of community service and told her that she \nwould have to pick up litter on Saturdays at the jail. \n127.  Ms.  Pam  explained  to  Defendant  Black  that  she  could  not  complete  the \ncommunity service because she suffers from severe chronic pain as a result of a car accident that \nbroke four ligaments in her neck.   \n128.  Defendant Black would not consider any other community service option, told \nMs. Pam to “try it out,” and gave her a summons, which threatened to hold her in contempt if she \ndid not complete the community service before February 13, 2017.  When she left court, she \nstarted crying because she knew that she would not be able to complete Defendant Black’s order \nof community service due to her neck injuries and chronic pain. \n129.  Even if she was not disabled, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms. Pam \nto complete the community service within the time period ordered: there are only nine Saturdays \nbetween her court dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve (when no community \nservice was available), and generally the jail only offers community service for four or eight \nhours each Saturday.  Ms. Pam therefore needs at least 10 Saturdays to complete her community \nservice.  \n130.  Ms. Pam faces an imminent threat that she will be jailed because she cannot \ncomplete the community service or pay the fine and court costs that she owes the City Court.  \n131.  Ms. Pam’s right to an impartial judge will be violated if she appears in the City \nCourt on February 13, 2017, and any subsequent dates ordered by the City Court.  The City \nCourt’s unconstitutional funding structure creates an appearance that Defendant Black cannot \nimpartially adjudicate whether Ms. Pam willfully failed to complete the community service \n  24 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 25 of 44\nbecause Defendant Black has a financial interest in extorting money from her to pay for the City \nCourt’s continued operation.  \nF.  Plaintiffs Rozzie Scott, Ebony Roberts, Latasha Cook and Robert Levi Paid \nan Illegal $50 Extension Fee in Their Criminal Cases before a Judge with an \nUnconstitutional Conflict of Interest. \ni.  Plaintiff Rozzie Scott \n132.   Plaintiff Rozzie Scott appeared in front of Defendant Black on May 12, 2016, \nand was found guilty of stealing $5 worth of food from a local store to feed his family.   \n133.  Defendant Black ordered Mr. Scott to pay a $450 fine plus costs on or before June \n13, 2016. \n134.   Mr. Scott returned to the City Court on June 13, 2016, but did not have the \nmoney to pay his fine and court costs.  After telling Defendant Black that he could not pay, \nDefendant Black asked him if he had $50 for an extension of time to pay the fine and costs. \n135.  After Mr. Scott told Defendant Black that he did not have $50, Defendant Black \ntold Mr. Scott to sit in a chair on the side of the courtroom and wait for his arrest.  Defendant \nBlack never asked him why he did not have the money or whether he was working. \n136.  While Mr. Scott waited, Defendant Black told other defendants that they would \ngo to jail if they could not pay the extension fee or their fines plus costs. \n137.  At the end of court, Mr. Scott was arrested and booked into the City jail, where he \nspent about four hours until his cousin paid the $50 extension fee for his release. \nii.  Plaintiff Ebony Roberts \n138.   Plaintiff Ebony Roberts appeared in front of Defendant Black on March 21, \n2016, and pleaded guilty to speeding and driving without a license.   \n  25 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 26 of 44\n139.  Defendant Black sentenced Ms. Roberts to pay a fine amount, plus costs on or \nbefore April 25, 2016, for speeding and for driving without a license.  She later learned it was a \ntotal of about $367.50 in fines and court costs for the speeding ticket and $262.50 in fines and \ncourt costs for the ticket for driving without a license.   \n140.  Ms. Roberts returned to the City Court on April 25, 2016, but did not have the \nmoney to pay her fines and court costs.  Defendant Black did not ask Ms. Roberts whether she \nwas working or why she could not pay.  He did not offer her a payment plan or community \nservice.  He told Ms. Roberts she had to pay the fines and costs or she would go to jail for not \npaying her traffic tickets. \n141.  After Ms. Roberts paid the $50, she was ordered to return to the City Court on \nJune 13, 2016, to pay the fines and court costs on her two traffic tickets. \n142.  Ms. Roberts returned to the City Court on June 13, 2016, and paid $262.50 on her \nticket for driving without a license after borrowing the money from her family.  However, she \ndid not have the money to pay her fine or court costs on the speeding ticket.  Defendant Black \ndid not give Ms. Roberts an opportunity to tell him that she did not have any money and was just \ntrying to do her best to take care of her two-year-old daughter. \n143.  Before Ms. Roberts could say anything, Defendant Black told her “this was [her] \nlast extension.”  A court employee then escorted her out of the courtroom to pay an additional \n$50.  There were so many people standing in line to pay the extension fee that there were even a \ncouple of people that could not fit in the courthouse and had to stand outside. \n144.  After Ms. Roberts told a court employee that she could not pay $50, he told Ms. \nRoberts that she could not leave the City Court and would go to jail if she did not pay the money.  \n  26 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 27 of 44\nHe ordered Ms. Roberts to go back into the courtroom where several other people were also \nfacing arrest for non-payment. \n145.  Ms. Roberts’s boyfriend left the City Court to get $50 as fast as he could to \npurchase Ms. Roberts’s freedom. \niii.  Plaintiff Latasha Cook \n146.  Plaintiff Cook appeared in front of Defendant Black on June 1, 2015 and pleaded \nguilty to disturbing the peace.   \n147.  Defendant Black sentenced Ms. Cook to a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail \nwith the condition that she pay a $300 fine plus court costs and complete substance abuse \ntreatment. \n148.  Ms. Cook returned to the City Court on July 13, 2015, but did not have the money \nto pay the fine and court costs because she was unemployed and her only source of income at the \ntime was the disability check she received each month.  \n149.  Defendant Black did not ask Ms. Cook why she did not have the money to pay \nher fine and court costs.  Instead, Ms. Cook paid the City Court the $50 extension fee to receive \nadditional time to pay the fine and court costs. \n150.  Ms. Cook has previously gone to jail because she did not have the money to pay \nher fine and court costs.  Judge Black asked Ms. Cook on that date whether she had $50 to pay \nfor a new court date.  Because she did not have $50 in her pocket, a marshal handcuffed Ms. \nCook and booked her into the City jail.    \niv.  Plaintiff Robert Levi \n151.  Plaintiff  Levi  appeared  in  front  of  Defendant  Black  in  November  2015  and \npleaded guilty to running a stop sign and driving with expired insurance.   \n  27 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 28 of 44\n152.  Defendant Black sentenced Mr. Levi to pay a $100 fine plus court costs and 30 \ndays default time for driving with expired insurance and a $50 fine plus court costs and 15 days \ndefault time for running a stop sign. \n153.  Mr. Levi returned to the City Court in January 2016, but did not have the money \nto pay his fine and court costs.  Judge Black did not ask him why he did not have the money at \nhis January 2016 court date.  Instead, Mr. Levi observed two people arrested for not paying fines \nand court costs.  Mr. Levi was scared that he would go to jail, too, because he did not have the \nmoney to pay his traffic tickets. \n154.  Mr. Levi overheard a city court employee tell a woman that she could pay an \nadditional $50 for an extension of time to pay instead of going to jail.   \n155.  Mr. Levi agreed to pay $50 in addition to his fine and court costs because he \nrealized he would go to jail if he did not pay it.  He had planned to use that money to pay for \nother bills that day, which he was late paying after giving the money to the City Court. \n156.  Mr. Levi returned to the City Court in March 2016 to pay his fine and court costs, \nbut was $40 short of the amount he owed.  He asked a city court employee outside of the \ncourtroom whether he could make a partial payment.  The city court employee told him that \nJudge Black “does not take partial payments” and that he “better call somebody!” because Judge \nBlack is “gonna lock you up!” if he did not come up with the remaining $40. \n157.  Mr. Levi borrowed the outstanding $40 from a friend and paid his traffic tickets in \nfull to avoid going to jail.  \nV.    CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n158.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a Class and Subclass for equitable relief, and a separate \nClass for damages. \n  28 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 29 of 44\n159.  Plaintiffs  Lorio,  Graham,  Bolgiano,  Moses,  and  Pam  seek  class  certification \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), related to Claim One only.  This class is defined as: \nAll individuals who will appear in the Bogalusa City Court for criminal cases or who have \nunpaid fines and costs assessed by and owed to the City Court.  This class is referred to as the \n“Structural Bias Equitable Class.”  \n160.  Plaintiffs  Lorio,  Graham,  Bolgiano,  Moses,  and  Pam  seek  certification  of  a \nSubclass pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), related to Claims Two, Three, Four and Six \nonly.  This subclass is defined as: All individuals who were or will be adjudicated guilty in the \nBogalusa City Court, who have been or will be given a future date by which to return to City \nCourt, and who have not paid the assessed fines and costs in full or have not completed the \nassessed community service prior to returning to City Court.  This Subclass is referred to as the \n“Pay Date Equitable Subclass.”  All members of the Pay Date Equitable Subclass are also \nmembers of the Structural Bias Equitable Class. \n161.  Plaintiffs Roberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi seek class certification pursuant Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a) and (b)(3), related to Claim Five only.  This class is defined as: Any individual that \npaid an extension fee between June 22, 2015 and the present.  This class is referred to as the \n“Extension Fee Damages Class.”  \n162.  Rule 23(a)(1), Impracticability of Joinder: The precise size of the classes and \nsubclass are unknown by Plaintiffs but is substantial.  The Structural Bias Equitable Class is \nforward-looking and consists of persons appearing in approximately 3,000 criminal traffic and \nmisdemeanor cases filed in the Bogalusa City Court per year.  The Pay Date Equitable Subclass \nis forward-looking and consists of persons who may be subjected to paying an illegal extension \nfee or being put in jail for non-payment or failure to complete community service; in the past \n  29 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 30 of 44\nyear this occurred to more than 40 persons.  The Extension Fee Damages Class consists of \npersons who paid the extension fee in the last year, which occurred at least 100 times.  Many of \nthe class members and most of the subclass members are low-income individuals who will likely \nlack independent resources to bring an independent action or to be joined in this action.  Joinder \nof every member of the class and the subclass would be impracticable.   \n163.  Rule 23(a)(2), Commonality: Plaintiffs raise claims based on questions of law and \nfact that are common to, and typical of, the putative class members they seek to represent.   \na.  Questions of law and fact common to the Structural Bias Equitable Class \ninclude:  \ni.  Whether the City Court has a policy of assessing either $30 or \n$29.50 in court costs according to a fee schedule; \nii.  Whether  court  costs  are  imposed  when  individuals  in  the  City \nCourt are adjudicated guilty but not when they are adjudicated not guilty; \niii.  Whether Defendant Black conducts an inquiry into ability to pay \nbefore sentencing an individual to, or activating an individuals’, default time for non-payment; \niv.

What percentage of the City Court’s total budget is derived from \njudicial expense funds;  \nvii.  Whether  Defendant  Black  has  control  over  the  allocation  of \njudicial expense funds in his executive capacity for the City Court; \n  30 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 31 of 44\nviii.

Whether the City Court  permitted Defendant  Black to  offer to \nsome defendants the option of paying a $50 extension fee to buy their freedom and additional \ntime to pay their monetary penalties;  \nxi.  Whether Defendant Black has a policy or practice of sentencing an \nindividual to serve 15 days in jail or to pay a $250 contempt fee if the individual fails to appear \nto pay her fines and court costs; \nxii.  Whether the City Court’s funding structure creates a structural \nconflict of interest that violates due process; and \nxiii.  Whether injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate and if so, \nwhat the terms of such relief should be. \nb.  Questions of law and fact common to the Pay Date Equitable Subclass \ninclude: \ni.  Whether  Defendant  Black  appoints  counsel  at  pay  date \nproceedings or provides alternative safeguards; \nii.  Whether Defendant Black assesses a person’s ability to pay prior \nto their jailing for non-payment; \niii.

Whether injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate and if so, \nwhat the terms of such relief should be. \n  32 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 33 of 44\nc.  Questions of law and fact common to the Extension Fee Damages Class \ninclude:  \ni.  Whether  court  costs,  extension  fees,  and  contempt  fees  are \ndeposited into the judicial expense account; \nii.  Whether the City Court created a $50 “extension fee;”  \niii.  Whether the City Court permits Defendant Black to offer to some \nindividuals the option of paying a $50 extension fee to buy their freedom and additional time to \npay their monetary penalties; \niv.  Whether  any  state  law  authorizes  the  City  Court  to  charge \nindividuals an extension fee in order to receive additional time to pay fines and court costs;  \nv.  Whether due process permits offering a choice between paying an \nunauthorized extension fee or going to jail for non-payment; and \nvi.  Whether damages are appropriate and if so, what the terms of such \nrelief should be.   \n164.  Rule  23(a)(3),  Typicality:  The  claims  of  Plaintiffs  Lorio,  Graham,  Bolgiano, \nMoses, Pam, Roberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi are typical of those asserted on behalf of the \nproposed classes and subclass.  The injuries of Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, Pam, \nRoberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi all arise out of Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs.   \n165.  Rule  23(a)(4),  Adequacy:  Plaintiffs  Lorio,  Graham,  Bolgiano,  Moses,  Pam, \nRoberts, Scott, Cook, and Levi will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed \nclasses and subclass.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter, who have experience in class-action litigation involving civil rights law, as well as \nexperience litigating policies and practices in municipal courts that are unconstitutional.  Counsel \n  33 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 34 of 44\nhas the resources, expertise and experience to prosecute this action.  Counsel knows of no \nconflict among members of the proposed class. \n166.  Rule 23(b)(2): Defendant Black has acted on grounds generally applicable to the \nStructural  Bias  Equitable  Class  and  Pay  Date  Equitable  Subclass,  making  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief with respect to the class and subclass as a whole appropriate and necessary.   \n167.  Rule 23(b)(3):  The common questions of fact  and law predominate over the \nquestions of law and fact affecting individual members of the Extension Fee Damages Class, and \na class action is a superior method to adjudicate these claims, making it appropriate to decide the \ndamages claims through the class mechanism.  Particularly, the factual and legal questions \nsurrounding the general policies and practices of the City Court apply equally to all members of \nthe Damages Class.  Furthermore, class members have little ability to pursue these claims \nindividually,  and  it  would  be  in  the  interest  of  judicial  economy  to  adjudicate  the \nconstitutionality of the City Court’s policies and practices in one proceeding.  \nVI.    CLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Structural Conflict of Interest – Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam, and the Structural Bias Equitable Class \nversus  \nDefendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n168.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n169.  The Due Process Clause requires Defendant Black to impartially adjudicate cases \nas well as maintain the appearance of impartiality.  \n170.  Defendant Black exercises judicial functions when presiding over cases in the \nCity Court and executive functions over the City Court’s finances and collection practices.  \n  34 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 35 of 44\n171.  Defendant Black, in his administrative and executive role, has the duty to create a \nbudget and to raise money to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses, and he has the ultimate \ndiscretion and control over spending court costs, extension fees, and contempt fees deposited \ninto the judicial expense account.  \n172.  Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \npolicymaker for the City Court, established a policy, practice, or custom of creating a budget that \nrelies on judicial expense funds to make up a substantial part of the City Court’s budget.  This \npolicy, practice, or custom is the moving force behind the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nrights. \n173.  The manner in which the City Court is funded creates a structural conflict of \ninterest  between  Defendant  Black’s  duty  to  impartially  adjudicate  cases  and  his  executive \nresponsibility to raise money to pay for the City Court’s operating expenses, in violation of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n174.  There is an on-going controversy between Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, \nMoses, and Pam and Defendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the \nfuture, and will appear before a judge with a structural conflict of interest.  \n175.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§ 2201–2202  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983, \nPlaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam, on behalf of themselves and the Structural \nBias Equitable Class, seek a declaration and injunction against Defendant Black in his individual \nand official capacities to prevent future injury resulting from the conflict of interest created by \nDefendant Black acting under color of law in his individual and official capacities. \n  35 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 36 of 44\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Bearden Violation — Due Process and Equal Protection) \nPlaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass \nversus  \nDefendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n176.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n177.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses prohibit \nincarcerating individuals for non-payment without first determining that they willfully refused to \nmake a monetary payment.   \n178.  There is an on-going controversy between Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, \nMoses, and Pam and Defendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the \nfuture and will likely be unable to pay their  monetary penalties.  Pursuant to his practice, \nDefendant Black will likely fail to make an inquiry into Plaintiffs’ ability to pay or complete \ncommunity  service  before  sentencing  them  to  jail  for  non-payment  or  failure  to  complete \ncommunity service.  \n179.  Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam, as well as those similarly \nsituated, will be subject to confinement and other imminent injury in the future if Defendant \nBlack’s policies, practices, and customs are not declared to be unconstitutional.   \n180.  Declaratory  relief  is  likely  unavailable  because  Plaintiffs  Lorio,  Graham, \nBolgiano, Moses, and Pam are required to appear in the City Court in January and February, \n2017, and likely again after the Agreement expires.  There will likely not be sufficient time \nbefore their hearings for this Court to reach a final determination on Plaintiffs’ declaratory \njudgment claim.  As such, Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam, as well as those \nsimilarly situated, may alternatively seek a preliminary injunction to protect them from the \n  36 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 37 of 44\ninjuries  that  will  be  caused  by  Defendant  Black’s  unconstitutional  policies,  practices,  and \ncustoms.   \n181.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§ 2201–2202  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983, \nPlaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam, on behalf of themselves and the Pay Date \nEquitable Subclass, seek a declaration, or if unavailable, a preliminary injunction, to prevent \nfuture injury caused by Defendant Black acting under color of state law in his individual and \nofficial capacities. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Right to Counsel – Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam, and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass \nversus  \nDefendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n182.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n183.  There is an on-going controversy between Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, \nMoses, and Pam and Defendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the \nfuture, and will likely be unable to pay their monetary penalties or complete community service.  \nPursuant to his practice, Defendant Black will likely fail to appoint counsel or provide alternative \nsafeguards before requiring them to pay illegal fees or ordering them to jail for non-payment or \nfailure to complete community service. Defendant Black also will not provide notice to Plaintiffs \nthat their ability to pay or perform the community service will be a critical issue in these \nproceedings. \n184.  The practices described in the previous paragraph constitutes a violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n185.  Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, Moses, and Pam, as well as those similarly \n  37 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 38 of 44\nsituated, will be subject to payment of an illegal fee, confinement, and other imminent injury in \nthe  future  if  Defendant  Black’s  policies,  practices,  and  customs  are  not  declared  to  be \nunconstitutional.   \n186.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiffs  Lorio, \nGraham,  Bolgiano,  Moses,  and  Pam,  on  behalf  of  themselves  and  the  Pay  Date  Equitable \nSubclass, seek a declaration to prevent future injury caused by Defendant Black acting under \ncolor of state law in his individual and official capacities. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Substantive Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, and Moses, and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass  \nversus Defendant Black in His Individual and Official Capacities \n \n187.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n188.  The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the government from depriving someone of \nliberty or property in an arbitrary or capricious manner. \n189.  Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \npolicymaker  for  the  City  Court,  established  a  policy,  practice,  or  custom  of  creating  an \n“extension fee” that persons could pay in order to avoid going to jail.  This policy, practice, or \ncustom is the moving force behind the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n190.  Defendant  Black’s  policies,  practices,  customs,  acts,  and  omissions  risk \nconditioning  Plaintiffs  Lorio,  Graham,  Bolgiano,  and  Moses’s  liberty  on  paying  an  illegal \nextension fee to the City Court’s judicial expense account.  \n191.  Conditioning  an  individual’s  liberty  on  the  payment  of  the  extension  fee  is \narbitrary and capricious because there is no statutory or other authority for the extension fee, in \n  38 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 39 of 44\nviolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n192.  There is an on-going controversy between Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, \nand Moses and Defendant Black.  Plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in the City Court in the \nfuture, and will likely be unable to pay their monetary penalties.  Pursuant to his practice, \nDefendant Black will likely order Plaintiffs to jail for non-payment if they fail to pay the $50 \nextension fee.   \n193.  Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, and Moses, and those similarly situated, will \nbe subject to confinement and imminent injury if Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs \nare not declared to be unconstitutional.   \n194.  Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, and Moses, on behalf of themselves and the \nPay Date Equitable Subclass bring this claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202 and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 for actions taken by Defendant Black under color of state law and seek a declaration \nagainst Defendant Black in his individual and official capacities to prevent future injury. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Extension Fee — Procedural Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Roberts, Scott, Cook, Levi, and the Extension Fee Damages Class versus  \nDefendants Bogalusa City Court and Defendant Black in his Official Capacity  \n \n195.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n196.  Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \npolicymaker  for  the  City  Court,  established  a  policy,  practice,  or  custom  of  creating  an \n“extension fee” that persons could pay in order to avoid going to jail.  This policy, practice, or \ncustom is the moving force behind the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n197.  Defendant Black, in his judicial capacity, utilizes this policy, practice, or custom \n  39 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 40 of 44\nto deprive individuals of their property in a manner not authorized by state law by having them \npay a $50 extension fee to Defendant City Court to avoid going to jail for non-payment of their \nmonetary penalties.  \n198.  Plaintiffs  Roberts,  Scott,  Cook,  and  Levi  and  the  proposed  Extension  Fee \nDamages Class have paid the extension fee to the City Court.  \n199.  Plaintiffs  Roberts,  Scott,  Cook,  and  Levi  and  the  proposed  Extension  Fee \nDamages Class have a property interest in the extension fee they paid to the City Court.  \n200.  Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of their property in a manner not authorized by \nstate law by having them pay a $50 extension fee to avoid going to jail for non-payment of their \nmonetary penalties.  \n201.  Plaintiffs  Roberts,  Scott,  Cook,  and  Levi,  on  behalf  of  themselves  and  the \nExtension Fee Damages Class, bring this claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for actions taken by \nDefendant Black under color of state law and seek an award of damages for their injuries from \nDefendant Bogalusa City Court and Defendant Black, sued in his official capacity, by charging \nPlaintiffs the illegal extension fee. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n(Unauthorized  Fees— Procedural Due Process) \nPlaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, and Moses, and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass \nversus \nDefendant Black in his Individual and Official Capacities \n \n202.  Plaintiffs  re–allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n203.  Defendant  Black,  in  his  executive  and  administrative  role,  and  as  the  final \npolicymaker  for  the  City  Court,  established  a  policy,  practice,  or  custom  of  creating  an \n“extension fee” that persons could pay in order to avoid going to jail, and later a $25 fee to \n  40 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11024-ILRL-MBN   Docu m  ent 67   Filed 01/17/17   Page 41 of 44\nparticipate in community service.  This policy, practice, or custom is the moving force behind the \nviolations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n204.  Defendant Black, in his judicial capacity, utilizes this policy, practice, or custom \nto deprive individuals of their property in a manner not authorized by state law.  \n205.  There is an on-going controversy between Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, \nand Moses, and members of the Pay Date Equitable Subclass and Defendant Black.  Plaintiffs \nare scheduled to appear in the City Court in the future and will likely be unable to pay their \nmonetary penalties.  The City Court has repeatedly used illegal fees in the past, and is going to \nneed to raise increased revenue in the near future.   \n206.  Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, and Moses have a property interest in the \nillegal  fees they will be asked to pay pursuant to the Bogalusa City Court policy.  \n207.  Plaintiffs Lorio, Graham, Bolgiano, and Moses, as well as those similarly situated, \nwill be subject to payment of an illegal fee in the future if Defendant’s policies, practices, and \ncustoms are not declared to be unconstitutional.   \n208.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiffs  Lorio, \nGraham, Bolgiano, and Moses, on behalf of themselves and the Pay Date Equitable Subclass, \nseek a declaration and an injunction, to prevent future injury caused by Defendant Black acting \nunder color of state law in his individual and official capacities. \nVII.
