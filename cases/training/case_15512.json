    "summary": "<p>On February 9, 2015, three individuals whose disability benefits had allegedly been denied or terminated based on examinations performed by a now-disqualified doctor filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the Acting Commissioner of Social Security for alleged violations of the Social Security Act and the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs alleged that the Commissioner wrongfully relied on examinations performed by a physician who, at the time of this complaint, had been disqualified, in denying or terminating their disability benefits. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant’s policy and practice of relying on this disqualified doctor’s defective examination reports in denying or terminating disability benefits was in violation of a requirement that such determinations be based on evidence from acceptable medical sources. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that they, and the class members, were never notified that the doctor had been disqualified, nor were they provided copies of his reports at the time of their denial or termination. Represented by the National Senior Citizens Law Center, Legal Aid of San Mateo County, and private counsel, the plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, class certification, and costs and attorneys’ fees. </p><p>According to the Social Security Act and its implementing regulations, the Social Security Administration “need[s] evidence from acceptable medical sources to establish whether [an individual has] a medically determinable impairment.” The Social Security Administration also mandated that in order to obtain adequate medical evidence of an individual’s disabilities, it was necessary to procure a consultative examination from a qualified medical source. The physician now in question had performed many such examinations in San Francisco and surrounding cities, and had issued reports that he knew were “incorrect or incomplete, including statements that he performed tests he did not in fact perform, and conclusions that were inconsistent with medical evidence already in the record, with no explanation or even acknowledgement of the inconsistency.” After numerous complaints over a period of years, this doctor was disqualified from continuing to provide consultative examinations as of December 30, 2013. However, his prior examination reports continued to be used as competent evidence by the Social Security Administration, and were used in denying and terminating SSI and SSDI benefits.</p><p>After the plaintiffs filed this complaint, the case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu. On February 10, 2015, the court ordered alternative dispute resolution. On March 30, 2015, the case was reassigned to Judge Jon S. Tigar for all further proceedings. </p><p>On April 20, 2015, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, claiming that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust all administrative remedies available to them, and the court therefore did not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p><p>On June 25, 2015, the court held a hearing on the defendant’ motion to dismiss, which was denied on July 17, 2015. The court held that while the plaintiffs had not exhausted all administrative remedies, a waiver should be granted because “requiring plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies would not serve the policies underlying exhaustion.”</p><p>On August 6, 2015, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. </p><p>The case management conference set for August 19 was continued to November 19, 2015 because the court set a class-certification briefing schedule and referred the case to a magistrate judge for settlement, which was set for November 17, 2015. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification on October 14, 2015. 310 F.R.D. 427. </p><p>Following a series of settlement conferences before Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James, the parties came to an agreement on September 19, 2016, and submitted their proposed class action settlement agreement to the court. The agreement provided relief to class members through procedural mechanisms that varied depending on the status of their claims and the amount of time since their examination by the disqualified doctor:</p><p>Class members with open claims (individuals who had received an unfavorable but not-yet-final determination of their claim) were to be notified that their consultative examination reports were flawed, and that they had the option to have the report excluded from consideration in a forthcoming adjudication. However, the adjudicator had the discretion in each case to consider whether ordering an additional consultative examination would be appropriate. </p><p>Class members with closed claims (individuals who had received a final unfavorable determination fo their claim) would be eligible for relief through a readjudication process which would not consider the reports created by the disqualified doctor. The individual would also have the opportunity to submit supplemental evidence relating to the previously-adjudicated period. If found to have been disabled for part or all of the period, they would be eligible to receive back payments for missed benefits.</p><p>This relief would not be granted to individuals in “current pay status” (individuals who were receiving benefits), nor would it be available for individuals whose claims were denied by an adjudication which had afforded no weight to the disqualified doctor’s report. </p><p>The defendant agreed to begin a study of the processes through which it monitors California’s Disability Determination Services office (and its engagement, review, and retention of consultative examiners), in order to identify mechanisms to improve the monitoring process. The defendant also agree to “issue a document setting out processes for notifying adjudicators when an individual [consultative examination] provider previously engaged by the California [Disability Determination Services] has been disqualified for conduct determined to undermine the credibility of that provider’s reports.” The defendant agreed to pay attorneys’ fees in the amount of $490,000, and the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice.</p><p>After preliminarily approving the settlement on November 9, 2016, the court held a final hearing on the settlement on March 16, 2017. On March 17, the parties submitted a joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, subject to the terms of the settlement agreement.</p><p>The court granted final approval of the class action settlement on April 17, 2017. The parties requested, and the court ordered, that the parties provide public notice. Since class members would have to take some affirmative steps to reopen their claims, the court ordered the defendant to publish a notice in newspapers, and ordered the plaintiffs’ counsel to provide notice to organizations that were likely to interact with class members. The court maintained jurisdiction over the case to ensure implementation and enforcement of the settlement.</p><p>On April 25, 2017, the court granted an order amending the settlement. Specifically, the amended settlement: <ol><li>Replaced the term “Administrative Law Judges” with “Social Security Administration”;<li>Extended the deadline for mailing request forms;<li>Clarified language concerning enforcement mechanisms; and<li>Defined the class as “all persons whose SSI or SSDI benefits were either denied or terminated and for whom a consultative examination was prepared by Dr. Frank Chen, and all persons who received a partially favorable decision or determination on their claim for SSI or SSDI benefits and for whom a consultative examination was prepared by Dr. Chen.”</ol>The court reserved exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the settlement for the purposes of supervising its implementation, enforcement, and construction; the duration of jurisdiction was unspecified. </p><p>In April 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for enforcement of the settlement agreement, alleging that the Social Security Administration was not complying with the agreement.  As required by the agreement, the parties scheduled a series of settlement conferences; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those conferences were postponed by joint stipulation of the parties.  As of August 2020, the conferences are pending.</p>",

ORDER GRANTING CLASS \n9    CERTIFICATION \nCAROLYN W. COLVIN, \n10  Re: ECF No. 40 \nDefendant. \n11 \n   \n12  This is a putative class action about the evidence that Administrative Law Judges (“ALJs”) \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  may properly consider in determining whether claimants are entitled to disability benefits from the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Social Security Administration (“SSA”).  Plaintiffs have sued Defendant Carolyn W. Colvin in her \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  capacity as Acting Commissioner of Social Security, ECF No. 1, challenging the SSA’s alleged \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reliance on consultative examinations performed by Dr. Frank Chen, a physician who is now \nS d nr\nee 17  disqualified, in denying or terminating disability benefits.  Id. ¶ 1.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  injunctive relief requiring the SSA to cease relying on Dr. Chen’s reports, to reopen any benefits \n19  determination that relied, at least in part, on a report prepared by Dr. Chen, and to notify those \n20  individuals whose benefits have been denied or terminated of their right to these forms of relief.  \n21  Id. at 23–24.1   \n22  Now before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.  ECF No. 40.  For the \n23  reasons set forth below, the Court will grant the motion.   \n24  I.  BACKGROUND \n25  A.  Factual Background \n26  To obtain benefits based on disability under the Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) or \n27 \n                                                 \n1 Citations are to the internal pagination of the document and not to the pages assigned by the \n28 \nCourt’s electronic case filing system.     \n\n \n1  Social Security Disability Insurance (“SSDI”) programs, a claimant must be unable “to engage in \n2  any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental \n3  impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last \n4  for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 2 (citing 42 U.S.C. § \n5  423(d)(1)(A)).  SSA, which administers the SSI and SSDI programs, is required to “establish by \n6  regulation uniform standards which shall be applied at all levels of determination, review, and \n7  adjudication in determining whether individuals are under disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 421(k)(1).  \n8  The regulations promulgated pursuant to the Social Security Act require that claimants provide \n9  SSA with “evidence from acceptable medical sources to establish whether [an individual has] a \n10  medically determinable impairment(s).”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 3 (citing 20 C.F.R. § 404.1513(a)).  \n11  “Objective medical evidence of pain or other symptoms established by medically acceptable \n12  clinical or laboratory techniques . . . must be considered in reaching a conclusion as to whether [a \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  claimant] is under a disability.”  42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(A).   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Although SSA administers SSI and SSDI, it contracts with state agencies, such as the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Disability Determination Service Division of the California Department of Social Services \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (“DDSD”), to make disability determinations.  Id. ¶ 80.  If DDSD cannot get the information it \nS d nr\nee 17  needs to make a disability determination from a claimant’s own medical records, DDSD may \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  decide to purchase a consultative examination (“CE”).  20 C.F.R. § 404.1519a.  CEs are \n19  examinations performed by doctors or other medical professionals who contract with DDSD.  ECF \n20  No. 1 ¶ 85.  Following a CE, the examiner sends a report regarding the claimant to DDSD.  Id.       \n21  ¶ 87.  SSA has promulgated various guidelines regarding the standards for CEs and the \n22  consideration of CE reports.  Id. ¶¶ 88–93.  In particular, SSA regulations require that evidence \n23  used in making disability determinations, such as CE reports, must come from “acceptable \n24  medical sources.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a), 404.1519(g).  “Acceptable medical sources” include \n25  “[l]icensed physician[s].”  Id. §§ 404.1513(a)(1), 416.913(a)(1).  \n26  SSA regulations require adjudicators to “always consider” CE reports along with the rest \n27  of the relevant evidence in making a disability determination.  Id. §§ 404.1527(b), 416.927(b); see \n28 \n \n2 \n\n \n1  also ECF No. 46 at 3.  “Regardless of its source, [SSA adjudicators] will evaluate every medical \n2  opinion,” including every CE, the adjudicator receives in light of multiple factors to “determine[e] \n3  the weight,” if any, the opinion should be given.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c)(2), 416.927(b).  Even \n4  after an examiner has been disqualified, SSA regulations permit adjudicators to rely on existing \n5  CE reports prepared by the disqualified examiner.  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 99 (citing 20 C.F.R. §§ \n6  404.1503, 416.903a (“We will not use in our program any individual or entity, except to provide \n7  existing medical evidence, who is currently excluded, suspended, or otherwise barred from \n8  participation in . . . any other Federal or Federally-assisted program.”)). \n9  Named Plaintiffs Kevin Hart, Nina Silva-Collins, and Lee Harris all sought the award or \n10  renewal of disability benefits from SSA.  Dr. Frank Chen performed CEs on all of the Named \n11  Plaintiffs in connection with their applications for award or renewal of disability benefits.  Named \n12  Plaintiffs allege various deficiencies with these examinations.    \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    Plaintiff Hart suffered from “tremendous pain and limited mobility,” following a 2007 car \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  accident, as well as “diabetes and emphysema.”  Id. ¶ 17.  Hart was found disabled by an ALJ in \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  April 2010.  Id. ¶ 23.  In April of 2013, Hart was attacked violently, exacerbating his pre-existing \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  pain and causing additional serious health conditions.  Id. ¶ 24–25.  Hart was scheduled for a \nS d nr\nee 17  continuing disability review in 2013 and referred to Dr. Chen.  Id. ¶ 26.  Dr. Chen’s August 15, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2013 examination of Plaintiff Hart lasted only ten minutes.  Id. ¶ 28.  Dr. Chen submitted a report \n19  that misidentified Hart’s complaints and claimed that he had performed tests that he had not \n20  actually performed during his examination.  Id. ¶¶ 29–32.  SSA relied on Dr. Chen’s evaluation in \n21  terminating Hart’s benefits on September 11, 2013.  Id. ¶ 34.  Following a subsequent hearing, a \n22  Disability Hearing Officer concluded in a March 17, 2014 order that Hart’s physical impairments \n23  had “medically improved” and that Hart was “able to do medium work activities” based upon Dr. \n24  Chen’s report.  Id. ¶ 35.  The Officer found Dr. Chen’s report “more reasonable as consistent and \n25  supported by medical evidence” than another doctor’s report that had been submitted by Hart.  Id. \n26  Plaintiff Silva-Collins suffers from “severe, chronic anemia caused by menorrhagia \n27  (abnormally heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding), lumbar degenerative disc disease, \n28 \n \n3 \n\n \n1  depression, anxiety, asthma, and hypertension.”  Id. ¶ 38.  Silva-Collins was examined by Dr. \n2  Chen on August 10, 2013, after an ALJ determined that a CE was necessary to evaluate her \n3  claims.  Id. ¶ 41.  Dr. Chen’s examination of Silva-Collins lasted only ten minutes.  Id. ¶ 42.  Dr. \n4  Chen diagnosed Silva-Collins with “[l]ow back pain, possibly due to obesity,” and “obesity.”  Id.  \n5  ¶ 44.  Dr. Chen’s report claimed that he had completed various strength and range of motion tests \n6  that he never actually performed.  Id. ¶ 45.  “Dr. Chen did not ask Ms. Silva-Collins any questions \n7  about her menorrhagia, anemia, or other blood issues, or the effect that these chronic conditions \n8  had on her physical capabilities.”  Id. ¶ 43.  On January 8, 2014, the ALJ denied Silva-Collins’ \n9  claim for benefits, giving “great weight to the opinion of consultative examiner Dr. Chen” and \n10  observing that Dr. Chen’s “examination is the most thorough and detailed in the record, and well \n11  supported by the medical evidence as a whole.”  Id. ¶ 47.  \n12    Plaintiff Harris suffers from debilitating lower back, leg, and foot pain caused by an April \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  2005 car accident.  Id. ¶ 53.  Following his August 2011 application for SSI benefits, SSA referred \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiff Harris to Dr. Chen for a CE, which was conducted on October 28, 2011.  Id. ¶ 56.  The \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  examination lasted twelve minutes.  Id. ¶ 58.  Dr. Chen instructed Harris to stand without his cane, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and Harris responded that he could not do so without support.  Id. ¶ 60.  Nonetheless, “Dr. Chen \nS d nr\nee 17  concluded that Mr. Harris did not need to use his cane to walk short distances, even though he had \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  never seen Mr. Harris stand without [the cane].”  Id. ¶ 63.  Harris’s application was denied on \n19  November 18, 2011 and denied again upon reconsideration on May 16, 2012.  Id. ¶ 64.  Although \n20  Harris succeeded in obtaining a hearing before an ALJ in April 2013, the ALJ denied Harris’ \n21  claim, stating that “the examination by Dr. Chen indicates far greater functionality than alleged by \n22  the claimant.”  Id. ¶ 65.  The ALJ gave “the greatest weight to Dr. Chen’s opinion because he \n23  personally examined the claimant.”  Id.  \n24    Unbeknownst to claimants who were being referred to Dr. Chen for CEs during this time, \n25  DDSD had sent Dr. Chen a Corrective Action letter regarding deficiencies in his CEs in \n26  September 2011.  Id. ¶ 74.  DDSD sent Dr. Chen a second letter on October 14, 2013, identifying \n27  continuing issues with the quality of his reports, the lack of thoroughness of his examinations, and \n28 \n \n4 \n\n \n1  his unprofessional manner towards applicants.  Id. ¶ 75.  On December 30, 2013, following years \n2  of complaints from applicants and their representatives regarding Dr. Chen’s practices, DDSD \n3  removed Dr. Chen from the CE panel, citing Dr. Chen’s “unprofessional manner and failure to \n4  adequately correct deficiencies in his CE reports.”  Id. ¶ 76.  Although Dr. Chen’s reports were a \n5  part of the record in all of Plaintiffs’ ongoing challenges to their denial of disability benefits, \n6  Plaintiffs were not provided with notice that Dr. Chen had been removed from the CE panel.  Id.   \n7  ¶ 77; see also Defendant’s Answer to Class Action Complaint (“Answer”), ECF No. 38 ¶ 100 \n8  (“SSA admits that there is no regulation or rule directing SSA to provide applicants whose \n9  benefits have been denied or terminated notice that the consultative examiner in their case has \n10  been removed from the applicable CE panel.”). \n11  B.  Procedural Background \n12  On February 9, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint, asking the Court to grant declaratory \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and injunctive relief: 1) declaring that Defendant’s reliance on Dr. Chen’s CE reports “violate[s] \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the SSA’s obligations pursuant to the Social Security Act, its implementing regulations and the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution;” 2) enjoining Defendant from relying on \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  CE reports prepared by Dr. Chen to terminate or deny disability benefits; 3) requiring Defendant \nS d nr\nee 17  to reopen prior determinations terminating or denying benefits in reliance on CE reports prepared \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  by Dr. Chen; and 4) requiring Defendant to provide notice to all individuals whose benefits were \n19  terminated or denied in reliance on a CE report prepared by Dr. Chen of their right to these forms \n20  of relief.  ECF No. 1 at 23–24.  On April 20, 2015, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of \n21  subject matter jurisdiction, contending that the Court could not exercise jurisdiction over this case \n22  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g)2 because Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative \n23  remedies through the SSA’s internal appeals process.  ECF No. 18.  On July 17, 2015, the Court \n24  denied Defendant’s motion to dismiss, concluding that administrative exhaustion would be futile \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n2 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) provides: “Any individual, after any final decision of the Commissioner of \n27  Social Security made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in \ncontroversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days \n28  after the mailing to him of notice of such decision . . . .” \n \n5 \n\n \n1  and that Plaintiffs had satisfied the other requirements for waiver of the exhaustion requirement.  \n2  ECF No. 36.   \n3  On July 31, 2015, Defendant filed her Answer to the Complaint.  ECF No. 38.  On August \n4  6, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking to certify a class of “[a]ll persons \n5  whose SSI or SSDI benefits were either denied or terminated and for whom a consultative \n6  examination was prepared by Dr. Frank Chen,” ECF No. 40 at 9, which motion the Court now \n7  considers. \n8  II.  JURISDICTION \n9  As the Court previously determined, ECF No. 36, the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 42 \n10  U.S.C. § 405(g). \n11  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n12  Class certification under Rule 23 is a two-step process.  First, Plaintiff must demonstrate \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  that the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of 23(a) are met.  “One \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative \nS d nr\nee 17  parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  “Class certification \n19  is proper only if the trial court has concluded, after a ‘rigorous analysis,’ that Rule 23(a) has been \n20  satisfied.”  Wang v. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 709 F.3d 829, 833 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Wal–\n21  Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, ––– U.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011)).  In addition, “[w]hile it \n22  is not an enumerated requirement of Rule 23, courts have recognized that “in order to maintain a \n23  class action, the class sought to be represented must be adequately defined and clearly \n24  ascertainable.”  Vietnam Veterans of Am. v. C.I.A., 288 F.R.D. 192, 211 (N.D. Cal. 2012) \n25  (quoting DeBremaecker v. Short, 433 F.2d 733, 734 (5th Cir. 1970)).3 \n26  Second, a plaintiff must also establish that one of the bases for certification in Rule 23(b) is \n27 \n                                                 \n28  3 Defendant does not dispute that the proposed class is ascertainable.   \n \n6 \n\n \n1  met.  Here, Plaintiff invokes Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that “the party opposing the class has \n2  acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n3  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4  23(b)(2).   \n5  IV.  ANALYSIS \n6  A.  Rule 23(a) requirements \n7  1.  Numerosity \n8  Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous that joinder of all members is \n9  impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  “[C]ourts generally find that the numerosity factor is \n10  satisfied if the class comprises 40 or more members.”  In re Facebook, Inc., PPC Advertising \n11  Litig., 282 F.R.D. 446, 452 (N.D. Cal. 2012).   \n12  Here, Plaintiffs argue that the proposed class is sufficiently numerous because “SSA has \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  admitted there are at least 325 claimants in the proposed class.”  ECF No. 40 at 9 (citing letter \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  from the Chief Administrative Law Judge, Debra Bice, to the Acting Chief Administrative Law \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Judge for San Francisco, John Rolph, stating, “[w]e have identified 325 pending cases at the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  hearing level with medical evidence from Dr. Chen.”).  Plaintiffs further argue that “[t]he 325 \nS d nr\nee 17  claimants whose cases are currently pending at the hearing level are a small minority of putative \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  class members, as the majority of claimants do not reach the ALJ stage and Dr. Chen has been \n19  submitting CE reports for many years.”  Id. at 10 (emphasis in original).  As a result, “[i]t can be \n20  reasonably inferred that the proposed class contains thousands of members.”  Id.  Defendant does \n21  not dispute Plaintiffs’ contentions regarding numerosity.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that \n22  Plaintiffs have satisfied the numerosity requirement. \n23  2.  Commonality \n24  A Rule 23 class is certifiable only if “there are questions of law or fact common to the \n25  class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “[F]or purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) [e]ven a single [common] \n26  question will do.”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556 (internal quotation marks omitted).  However, the \n27  common contention “must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which \n28 \n \n7 \n\n \n1  means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of \n2  each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id. at 2551.  “‘What matters to class certification . . . is not \n3  the raising of common ‘questions’ ‒ even in droves ‒ but rather the capacity of a classwide \n4  proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.’”  Id. (quoting \n5  Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, \n6  131–32 (2009)).  Additionally, “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class \n7  members ‘have suffered the same injury,’” which cannot merely be the suffering of “a violation of \n8  the same provision of law.”  Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 \n9  (1982)). \n10  The Court previously determined that SSA acted according to an SSA-wide policy \n11  regarding Dr. Chen, which policy authorized adjudicators to continue to “consider” Dr. Chen’s CE \n12  reports following his removal from the CE panel.  ECF No. 36 at 9.  In making this determination, \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the Court relied on a March 16, 2015 letter from the Chief Administrative Law Judge for SSA to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the Acting Chief Administrative Law Judge for San Francisco, providing guidance to adjudicators \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  regarding Dr. Chen and instructing them to “consider” Dr. Chen’s removal from the CE panel in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “determining the weight, if any, to which” Dr. Chen’s CE is entitled.  Id. (quoting ECF No. 27-2 \nS d nr\nee 17  at 2–3).  The letter also instructed adjudicators that they “must consider the weight to give Dr. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Chen’s report in accordance with the regulations at 20 CFR 404.1527 and 416.927.”  ECF No. 27-\n19  2 at 3.  Those regulations, in turn, provide that “[r]egardless of its source, [SSA] will evaluate \n20  every medical opinion we receive.”  20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c).  Plaintiffs claim that the SSA’s \n21  regulations do not allow an ALJ to disregard an unreliable report, or question its findings, based \n22  on the fact that the individual who prepared it has been disqualified.  ECF No. 40 at 6 (citing 20 \n23  C.F.R. §§ 404.1527, 416.927).4   \n24  Plaintiffs argue that this SSA-wide policy that requires adjudicators to consider Dr. Chen’s \n25  reports raises two sets of common questions.  First, the SSA-wide policy raises the question of \n26  whether requiring adjudicators to consider CE reports provided by a disqualified doctor is a \n27 \n                                                 \n28  4 The SSA conceded this point at the hearing on the motion. \n \n8 \n\n \n1  violation of (1) the Social Security Act, (2) its implementing regulations, or (3) the Due Process \n2  clause of the United States Constitution.  ECF No. 40 at 12.  Second, the SSA-wide policy raises \n3  “common questions regarding . . . SSA’s legal obligations regarding Dr. Chen, including whether \n4  the Due Process clause requires SSA to provide applicants with a copy of their CE report;5 \n5  whether SSA had an obligation to monitor Dr. Chen; and whether SSA failed to adequately \n6  monitor Dr. Chen.”  Id.  Simply put, Plaintiffs argue that the common question raised by all \n7  proposed class members is whether the SSA-wide policy authorizing adjudicators to consider Dr. \n8  Chen’s CE reports without giving notice to claimants is legal. \n9  In response, Defendant first argues that Plaintiffs have not established commonality \n10  because “[c]ommonality . . . does not mean merely that they have all suffered violation of the \n11  same provision of law.”  ECF No. 46 at 9 (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S.Ct. at 2551).  According to \n12  Defendant, Plaintiffs’ first four purportedly common questions listed above “do just that, asking \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  whether SSA’s alleged conduct violated any of three provisions of law,” and nothing more.  Id.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Indeed, in Wal-Mart, the Supreme Court observed that “the mere claim by employees of the same \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once.  Their claims \nS d nr\nee 17  must depend upon a common contention—for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  part of the same supervisor.”  131 S.Ct. at 2551.  Id.  However, unlike in Wal-Mart’s hypothetical, \n19  while Plaintiffs do claim that each member of the proposed class has suffered violations of the \n20  same provisions of law, the proposed class’s claims also depend on a common contention, namely \n21  that a single SSA-wide policy requiring consideration of Dr. Chen’s reports injured each class \n22  member because any consideration of those reports, prepared by an examiner who had been \n23  subsequently disqualified, violated the Social Security Act, its implementing regulations, and the \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n5 In this respect, Plaintiffs claim that “SSA did not provide putative class members with a copy of \n26  their CE report prior to their hearing, or notice that Dr. Chen had been disqualified.”  ECF No. 40 \nat 11.  Plaintiffs also note that SSA itself “admits that there is no regulation or rule directing SSA \n27  to provide applicants whose benefits have been denied or terminated notice that the consultative \nexaminer in their case has been removed from the applicable CE panel.”  Id. (quoting Answer ¶ \n28  100).  \n \n9 \n\n \n1  Due Process Clause.  In this way, the SSA-wide policy regarding consideration of Dr. Chen’s \n2  reports is the “‘glue’ that hold[s] together the putative class;” either that policy “is unlawful as to \n3  every [member of the proposed class] or it is not.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. \n4  2014).   \n5  Second, Defendant argues that the Supreme Court’s decision in Wal-Mart forecloses class \n6  certification here because Wal-Mart found commonality lacking where the plaintiffs had only \n7  shown a “corporate policy . . . allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment matters.”  \n8  131 S.Ct. at 2554.  Defendant argues that this is “effectively identical to the practice SSA is \n9  accused of perpetrating” here, and, as a result, the Court should find that Plaintiffs have failed to \n10  allege the existence of an SSA-wide policy, which has led to an injury common to all proposed \n11  class members.  ECF No. 46 at 18.  This argument is unpersuasive. \n12  In Wal-Mart, the Supreme Court reasoned that “Wal-Mart’s ‘policy’ of allowing discretion \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  by local supervisors” did not bridge the “conceptual gap” between an individual’s claim and the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury, such that common questions \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  will be typical of all class members, because “demonstrating the invalidity of one manager’s use \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s.”  131 S.Ct. 2553–54.  By \nS d nr\nee 17  contrast here, Plaintiffs argue that the SSA-wide policy of allowing discretion by individual \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  adjudicators to determine how much weight to give to Dr. Chen’s reports was unlawful precisely \n19  because giving any weight to Dr. Chen’s reports whatsoever violates the Social Security Act, its \n20  implementing regulations, and the Due Process Clause.  Wal-Mart would be a more apt \n21  comparison to this case had the Wal-Mart plaintiffs alleged a corporate policy, which allowed \n22  managers to consider some unlawful characteristic—say the sex of an employee—when making \n23  employment decisions.  As it is, however, the holding in Wal-Mart simply does not apply here \n24  because the Wal-Mart plaintiffs did not allege that Wal-Mart explicitly gave its managers the \n25  discretion to consider unlawful criteria, as Plaintiffs allege here.6 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  6 Moreover, as Plaintiffs note, Wal-Mart is further distinguishable because plaintiffs in Wal-Mart \nhad only shown a “corporate policy . . . allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment \n28  matters,” whereas SSA requires adjudicators to “always consider” CE reports, including CE \n \n10 \n\n \n1  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that this case is more similar to Bowen v. City of New \n2  York, 476 U.S. 467 (1986) than Wal-Mart.  In Bowen, plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Health and \n3  Human Services under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), challenging a policy of the SSA which allegedly \n4  “mandated a presumption . . . that a failure to meet or equal [certain criteria] was tantamount to a \n5  finding of ability to do at least unskilled work; that the presumption led to routine denials of \n6  benefits to eligible claimants; and that such a presumption was arbitrary, capricious, and violative \n7  of the Constitution, the Social Security Act, and the applicable regulations.”7  476 U.S. at 473.  \n8  The district court certified a class consisting of claimants residing in the State of New York who \n9  were subject to the allegedly unlawful policy and “whose applications for benefits ha[d] been \n10  denied or whose benefits ha[d] been or [would] be terminated, on the basis of defendants’ \n11  determination that such persons are capable of substantial gainful activity.”  Id. at 475 n.6.  Just as \n12  the district court found in Bowen, Plaintiffs allege here the existence of a “systemwide, unrevealed \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  [SSA] policy that [is allegedly] inconsistent in critically important ways with established \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  regulations.”  Id. at 485.  The existence of such an allegedly unlawful SSA-wide policy \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  distinguishes this case from Wal-Mart. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Third, Defendant argues that the potential members of the proposed class have not suffered \nS d nr\nee 17  the same common injury because “they have not alleged—let alone demonstrated—that reports \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  from Dr. Chen are uniformly deficient across the proposed class.”  ECF No. 46 at 10 (emphasis in \n19  original).  Defendant notes that while Dr. Chen’s CE reports submitted for some Plaintiffs may be \n20  deficient, “some will be entirely competent.”  Id. at 8.  Similarly, Defendant asserts that the \n21  adjudicators reviewing Dr. Chen’s reports could have given them great weight, no weight, or some \n22  degree of weight in between.  Id. \n23  This argument misapprehends the alleged wrong in this case, which is one of process, not \n24  outcome.  As the Plaintiffs put it, “[a]t its core, [this] action asks SSA to give claimants what they \n25  were previously denied—the determination of their disability claim through a fair process.”  ECF \n26 \n                                                                                                                                                                \n27  reports submitted by Dr. Chen.  ECF No. 47 at 5 (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S.Ct. at 2254). \n7 The Bowen plaintiffs also alleged, as here, “that failure to make the policy known to claimants \n28  denied the individual plaintiffs and class members due process of law.”  476 U.S. at 474. \n \n11 \n\n \n1  No. 47 at 3.  In Parsons, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s certification of a class of \n2  Arizona prisoners who were subject to the same allegedly unconstitutional policies of prison \n3  administrators despite the fact that the Complaint did “not allege that the care provided on any \n4  particular occasion to any particular inmate . . . was insufficient.”  754 F.3d at 676.  Rather, the \n5  allegedly unconstitutional policies were “of statewide and systemic application expos[ing] [the \n6  entire class of inmates] to a substantial risk of serious harm.”  Id.  Similarly here, it is \n7  inconsequential that Plaintiffs do not allege that Dr. Chen’s reports were uniformly deficient \n8  across the proposed class because Plaintiffs’ alleged harm stems from an SSA-wide policy which \n9  uniformly deprived the entire class of the adequate process, which Plaintiffs assert is required by \n10  law.  And just as in Parsons, determination of whether the SSA-wide policy is unlawful or not \n11  “does not require [the Court] to determine the effect of [that policy] upon any individual class \n12  member . . . or to undertake any other kind of individualized determination.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  678. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Fourth, Defendant argues that the proposed class does not meet the commonality \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  requirement because some proposed class members “may wish to challenge Dr. Chen’s physical \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  examination findings; others may not; still other may seek to challenge them in part, but not in \nS d nr\nee 17  whole.”  ECF No. 46 at 13.  Indeed, Defendant notes that some of Dr. Chen’s reports contain \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  favorable evidence for individual claimants, and that some potential class members may therefore \n19  wish to give greater weight to Dr. Chen’s reports.  According to Defendant, “[t]he removal of such \n20  a report from the file could be adverse to such a claimant’s interests, and run directly contrary to \n21  his or her efforts to obtain benefits.”  Id. at 14. \n22  In support of this argument, Defendant cites Mayfield v. Dalton, a case in which members \n23  of the armed services challenged the constitutionality of a Department of Defense program which \n24  collected and stored blood samples from all members of the armed forces for future DNA analysis.  \n25  109 F.3d 1423 (9th Cir. 1997).  Plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of all active duty \n26  United States Navy and Marine Corps personnel who had been compelled to provide blood \n27  samples for the program.  Id. at 1424.  The district court denied class certification and the Ninth \n28 \n \n12 \n\n \n1  Circuit affirmed that decision, relying on the fact that some class members may not have opposed \n2  the DNA collection program, thereby rendering the class representatives’ interests “antithetical to \n3  the interests of [other] class members.”  Id. at 1427.  However, the Mayfield Court found that \n4  “there were undoubtedly people among the broad class [of all United States Navy and Marine \n5  Corps personnel] who did not oppose” the challenged DNA repository and “who, in fact, approved \n6  of it and wished the policies fully enforced.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Here, by contrast, Defendant \n7  merely asserts that “a significant number of potential class members may have no objection to \n8  SSA’s consideration of Dr. Chen’s reports,” ECF No. 46 at 15 (emphasis added), although \n9  Defendant offers no evidence of class members who actually take that position.  “Mere \n10  speculation as to conflicts that may develop at the remedy stage is insufficient to support denial of \n11  initial class certification.”  Soc. Servs. Union, Local 535, Serv. Employees Int’l Union, AFL-CIO \n12  v. Santa Clara Cnty., 609 F.2d 944, 948 (9th Cir. 1979); Myers v. Jani-King of Philadelphia, Inc. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  No. 09-1738, 2015 WL 1055700, *9–10 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 11, 2015).     \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Moreover, there may not be a conflict even if some putative class members believe that Dr. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Chen’s report in their individual cases was favorable to them.  While the question of remedy is not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  currently before the Court, there is no reason why individual class members could not elect either \nS d nr\nee 17  to waive the right to have their claims redetermined or to proceed on an administrative record that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  included a report from Dr. Chen.  The district court in Bowen appears to have provided a similar \n19  remedy when it ordered the SSA “to notify class members that their claims had been reopened, \n20  and to inform class members with an appeal pending before an ALJ that such claimants had the \n21  option of proceeding with their appeals upon the existing record rather than with the \n22  administrative reopening of their case.”  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 476 n.7 (emphasis added).   \n23  In short, because Defendant has not shown that a realistic possibility of antagonism exists \n24  between certain members of the proposed class and the Named Plaintiffs, the Court rejects \n25  Defendant’s conflict of interest argument.   \n26  Ultimately, each of Defendant’s arguments is unconvincing.  The Court concludes that \n27  Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing that there exists questions of law or fact common \n28 \n \n13 \n\n \n1  to the proposed class members and that determination of the truth or falsity of these common \n2  questions “will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one \n3  stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 131 at 2551.  In particular, Plaintiffs’ claim asks the Court to determine \n4  whether the SSA-wide policy instructing adjudicators to continue to “consider” Dr. Chen’s CE \n5  reports following his removal from the CE panel violated the Social Security Act, its \n6  implementing regulations, and the Due Process Clause.  Resolution of these questions will not \n7  depend on the individual facts of each Plaintiff’s claims because Plaintiffs argue that any \n8  consideration of Dr. Chen’s report whatsoever violated the law.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have \n9  satisfied the requirement to establish commonality. \n10  3.  Typicality \n11  Defendant next challenges whether the proposed class meets the typicality requirement.  In \n12  certifying a class, courts must find that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “The purpose of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  typicality requirement is to assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  interests of the class.”  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).  “Under \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the rule’s permissive standards, representative claims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably \nS d nr\nee 17  coextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.”  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 685 (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998)).   \n19  “The test of typicality ‘is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the \n20  action is based on conduct which is not unique to the Named Plaintiffs, and whether other class \n21  members have been injured by the same course of conduct.’”  Id. (quoting Hanon, 976 F.2d at \n22  508). \n23  “Where the challenged conduct is a policy or practice that affects all class members . . . the \n24  typicality inquiry involves comparing the injury asserted in the claims raised by the Named \n25  Plaintiffs with those of the rest of the class.”  Id. (quoting Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868–\n26  69 (9th Cir. 2001)).  Here, the Court has already concluded that Plaintiffs challenge an SSA-wide \n27  policy, which affects the entire class.  Plaintiffs assert that each class member’s process was \n28 \n \n14 \n\n \n1  “tainted” by this SSA-wide policy and that each class member was “injured by SSA’s policy of \n2  considering CE reports prepared by Dr. Chen in resolving their disability claims.”  ECF No. 47 at \n3  3.  The Named Plaintiffs thus allege “the same or a similar injury as the rest of the putative class; \n4  they allege that this injury is a result of a course of conduct that is not unique to any of them; and \n5  they allege that the injury follows from the course of conduct at the center of the class claims.”  Id. \n6  (internal quotation marks omitted). \n7  Defendant raises two arguments why the typicality requirement is not satisfied here.  First, \n8  Defendant asserts that the Named Plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of the proposed class because \n9  “[t]here is no allegation . . . that Dr. Chen uniformly provided deficient examination reports.”  ECF \n10  No. 46 at 19 (emphasis in original).  The Court has already rejected this argument in the context of \n11  the commonality requirement.  Plaintiffs’ alleged harm stems from an SSA-wide policy which \n12  uniformly deprived the entire class of the adequate process allegedly required by law.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Determination of whether the SSA-wide policy is unlawful or not “does not require [the Court] to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  determine the effect of [that policy] upon any individual class member . . . or to undertake any \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  other kind of individualized determination.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 678.  As a result, it simply does \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  not matter that Plaintiffs have not alleged that Dr. Chen uniformly provided deficient CE reports. \nS d nr\nee 17  Second, Defendant argues that the Named Plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of other class \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  members’ claims because the Named Plaintiffs’ claims are still pending in SSA’s administrative \n19  process, whereas other proposed class members’ claims are no longer pending.  ECF No. 46 at 20.  \n20  As a result, Defendant claims that unlike the claims of the Named Plaintiffs, the claims of \n21  potential class members with closed claims will require these class members to seek reopening, \n22  which, in turn, requires these claimants “to satisfy narrowly defined, case-specific conditions.”  Id.  \n23  However, Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that the typicality requirement is not \n24  satisfied where certain members of the proposed class may need to satisfy additional requirements \n25  from those of the Named Plaintiffs to eventually prevail on their underlying claims.  Whether \n26  certain class member may need to surmount additional obstacles to prevail on their claims for \n27  benefits is inconsequential because this lawsuit does not seek to adjudicate individual benefit \n28 \n \n15 \n\n \n1  claims.  ECF No. 40 at 15.  Rather, Plaintiffs simply seek a determination of whether the process \n2  involved in each of their benefits determinations was unlawful.  And if the Court finds in favor of \n3  the Plaintiffs on the merits, a potential remedy would be to require SSA to “reopen the [closed] \n4  decisions denying or terminating benefits, and to redetermine eligibility.”  Bowen, 476 U.S. at \n5  476.  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated typicality. \n6  4.  Adequacy \n7  “The adequacy of representation requirement . . . requires that two questions be addressed: \n8  (a) do the Named Plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class \n9  members and (b) will the Named Plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on \n10  behalf of the class?”  In re Mego Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 213 F.3d 454, 462 (9th Cir. 2000).  The \n11  requirement “‘tend[s] to merge’ with the commonality and typicality criteria of Rule 23(a).”  \n12  Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 626 n.20 (1997) (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n.13 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  (1982)).  Among other functions, the requirement serves as a way to determine whether “the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Named Plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.”  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n.13.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendant does not specifically argue that Plaintiffs and their counsel fail to meet Rule \nS d nr\nee 17  23(a)(4)’s adequacy requirement, and the Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied both prongs of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the requirement. \n19  First, the Court rejects the argument, raised by Defendant with respect to the commonality \n20  requirement, that the Named Plaintiffs and their counsel will not be able to “fairly and adequately \n21  protect the interests of the class” simply because some potential class members may wish that Dr. \n22  Chen’s CE report be given greater weight.  While “[t]he Ninth Circuit has rejected class \n23  certification when the class representatives’ ‘interests would . . . have been antithetical to the \n24  interests of [other] class members,” Mayfield, 109 F.3d at 1427, Defendant has not provided the \n25  Court with even a single specific example of such a conflict.  Moreover, as Plaintiffs note, even \n26  assuming the existence of potential class members who would prefer that greater weight be given \n27  to Dr. Chen’s report, “provision of a new CE by a competent examiner,” which is what Plaintiffs \n28 \n \n16 \n\n \n1  ultimately seek, “would not be at odds with the interests of proposed class members because . . . \n2  findings that accurately reflect [these claimants’] disabilities would be captured in a new CE \n3  report.”  ECF No. 47 at 7. \n4  Second, the Named Plaintiffs have retained experienced counsel, including two nonprofit \n5  organizations and a law firm, which collectively “have extensive experience in public benefits \n6  law, the Social Security Act, and class-action litigation, as well as the necessary resources and \n7  commitment to pursue the interests of the class vigorously.”  ECF No. 40 at 16.  Nothing in the \n8  record suggests, and Defendant does not argue, otherwise.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied \n9  the adequacy requirement. \n10  5.  Ascertainability \n11  “[A] class definition is sufficient if the description of the class is ‘definite enough so that it \n12  is administratively feasible for the court to ascertain whether an individual is a member.’”  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Vietnam Veterans of Am., 288 F.R.D. at 211 (quoting O’Connor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998)).  While, as Plaintiff notes, some courts in this Circuit have held \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that there is no ascertainability requirement in Rule 23(b)(2) cases,8 the Court need not address \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  this issue because Defendant does not contest ascertainability.  Even assuming that such a \nS d nr\nee 17  requirement does exist in Rule 23(b)(2) cases, Plaintiffs have persuasively argued that the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  proposed class is ascertainable because the proposed class is defined by two objective criteria: \n19  individuals (1) who received a CE report from Dr. Chen and (2) whose benefits were denied or \n20  terminated.  ECF No. 40 at 17.  As a result, the Court finds that the proposed class is ascertainable. \n21  B.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n22  Rule 23(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n23  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n24  declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “Rule \n25  23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n8 See, e.g., In re Yahoo Mail Litig., No. 13-cv-04980-LHK, 2015 WL 3523908, at *16 (N.D. Cal. \n28  May 26, 2015). \n \n17 \n\n \n1  each member of the class.  It does not authorize class certification when each individual class \n2  member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.”  \n3  Wal-Mart, 131 S.Ct. at 2557.  “These requirements are unquestionably satisfied when members of \n4  a putative class seek uniform injunctive or declaratory relief from policies or practices that are \n5  generally applicable to the class as a whole.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 688 (citing Rodriguez v. \n6  Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir. 2011)).  “That inquiry does not require an examination of \n7  the viability or bases of the class members’ claims for relief, does not require that the issues \n8  common to the class satisfy a Rule 23(b)(3)-like predominance test, and does not require a finding \n9  that all members of the class have suffered identical injuries.”  Id. \n10  Here, contrary to Defendant’s assertion, ECF No. 46 at 22, Plaintiffs allege that SSA \n11  applied the same allegedly unlawful policy to each member of the proposed class.  While the \n12  application of that SSA-wide policy “may not affect every member of the proposed class . . . in \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  exactly the same way,” Plaintiffs seek uniform injunctive and declaratory relief from policies that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  are generally applicable to the class as a whole.  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 688; 7AA Charles A. Wright \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1775 (3d ed.) (“Rule 23(b)(2) . . . has been used \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  extensively to challenge the enforcement and application of complex statutory schemes, such as \nS d nr\nee 17  suits involving the award or termination of benefits under the Social Security Act.”). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Moreover, the relief requested by Plaintiffs—a declaration that the SSA-wide policy in \n19  question is unlawful, an injunction forbidding SSA from relying on Dr. Chen’s CE reports in \n20  making disability determinations, an injunction requiring SSA to reopen all of the closed claims of \n21  proposed class members, and an injunction requiring that SSA notify all proposed class \n22  members—satisfies Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement that “final injunctive relief or corresponding \n23  declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); ECF \n24  No. 1 at 23.  Plaintiffs do not seek monetary damages or individual disability determinations.  ECF \n25  No. 47 at 9.  Contrary to Defendant’s argument, ECF No. 46 at 23, the fact that a single injunction \n26  may affect different individual Plaintiffs in different ways because of the procedural posture of \n27  their individual claims does not negate the fact that a single injunction and declaratory judgment \n28 \n \n18 \n\n \n1  would provide relief to each member of the class.  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 \n2  (9th Cir. 2009) (“The fact that some class members may have suffered no injury or different \n3  injuries from the challenged practice does not prevent the class from meeting the requirements of \n4  Rule 23(b)(2).”).  Indeed, the relief sought by Plaintiffs here is similar to that afforded by the \n5  district court in Bowen.  476 U.S. at 476, 476 n.7 (ordering “the Secretary to reopen the decisions \n6  denying or terminating benefits, . . . to redetermine eligibility,” to notify the class members with \n7  closed cases that their claims would be reopened, and to notify class members with pending \n8  appeals that “such claimants had the option of proceeding with their appeals upon the existing \n9  record rather than the administrative reopening of their case.”). \n10  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 23(b)(2). \n11  CONCLUSION \n12  The Court hereby grants Plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class consisting of all persons \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  whose SSI or SSDI benefits were either denied or terminated and for whom a consultative \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  examination was prepared by Dr. Frank Chen.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  In the joint case management statement due on November 5, 2015, the parties are ordered \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  to propose a schedule for the remainder of the case through trial.    \nS d nr\nee 17  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nth\ninUtro  \nN 18 \nDated: October 14, 2015 \n \n19 \n \n______________________________________ \n20 \nJON S.

Plaintiffs bring this class action to challenge Defendant’s reliance on consultative \n7  examinations (CEs), performed by a physician who is now disqualified, in denying or terminating \n8  disability benefits.  This physician, Dr. Frank Chen, routinely submitted reports that were not \n9  based on medically acceptable clinical diagnostic techniques.  As numerous complaints from \n10  applicants demonstrate, Dr. Chen’s CE reports contained false statements and were based on \n11  cursory examinations and inadequate communication with his patients.  These CE reports were \n12  then relied upon, in whole or in part, to deny or terminate Supplemental Security Income (SSI) \n13  and/or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to Plaintiffs and members of the proposed \n14  class.  By this action, Plaintiffs seek the reopening of prior determinations where Defendant relied \n15  on a report by Dr. Chen, and the opportunity to receive a new CE from a well-qualified clinician. \n16  2.  In order to qualify for benefits based on disability under either SSI or SSDI, an \n17  individual must be unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any \n18  medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or \n19  which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months[.]”  \n20  42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A).  \n21  3.  The Social Security Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder require that \n22  Defendant “need[s] evidence from acceptable medical sources to establish whether [an individual \n23  has] a medically determinable impairment.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a), 416.913(a). \n24  4.  In order to have adequate medical evidence of an individual’s disabilities, it is \n25  frequently necessary to procure a CE from a qualified medical source.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1517 et \n26  seq.   \n27  5.  For many years, Dr. Chen performed a large volume of these CEs in San Francisco \n28  and surrounding counties.  He regularly issued reports that he knew were incorrect or incomplete, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  1 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 4 of 26\n1  including statements that he performed tests he did not in fact perform and conclusions that were \n2  inconsistent with medical evidence already in the record, with no explanation or even \n3  acknowledgement of the inconsistency. \n4  6.  On the basis of numerous complaints from applicants and their representatives \n5  over a period of years, Dr. Chen was disqualified from continuing to provide CEs as of December \n6  30, 2013.  His CE reports, however, continue to be treated as competent evidence by the Social \n7  Security Administration (SSA) and used in determinations to deny or terminate SSI and SSDI \n8  benefits.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1503a, 416.903a. \n9  7.  Plaintiffs challenge Defendant’s policy and practice of relying on Dr. Chen’s \n10  defective CE reports in denying or terminating disability benefits, in violation of its requirement \n11  to base such determinations on evidence from acceptable medical sources. \n12  8.  SSA regulations also require that Defendant monitor and ensure the adequacy of \n13  the CE process and providers.  42 U.S.C. § 421(j)(3); 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1519s(g), 416.919s(g).  \n14  Defendant’s policy and practice of relying on Dr. Chen’s defective CE reports in denying or \n15  terminating disability benefits is contrary to this mandate. \n16  9.  SSDI and SSI applicants and beneficiaries represent a population with education \n17  levels well below the national average.  These individuals are almost never represented by \n18  counsel during the application process or on reconsideration, which is the first phase of the \n19  administrative appeal process.   \n20  10.  Plaintiffs and class members were neither notified of the disqualification of \n21  Dr. Chen nor provided copies of his reports at the time of their denial or termination.  \n22  Accordingly, they had no basis for knowing that their disability determinations were based in part \n23  on incorrect, incomplete medical reports.    \n24  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n25  11.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). \n26  12.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) because at least one \n27  named Plaintiff resides within the Northern District of California. \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  2 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 5 of 26\n1  PARTIES \n2  13.  Plaintiff Kevin Hart is a resident of San Mateo County who receives SSI and SSDI \n3  benefits and is facing termination of his benefits after a consultative examination by Dr. Chen. \n4  14.  Plaintiff Nina Silva-Collins is a resident of Alameda County who was denied SSI \n5  after a consultative examination by Dr. Chen. \n6  15.  Plaintiff Lee Harris is a resident of Alameda County who was denied SSI after a \n7  consultative examination by Dr. Chen. \n8  16.  Defendant Carolyn W. Colvin is the Acting Commissioner of Social Security, \n9  charged by federal law with administering and supervising all benefit programs administered by \n10  SSA nationwide, including SSI and SSDI.  The Commissioner is responsible for determining \n11  eligibility for SSI and SSDI benefits and is authorized to reopen and review these determinations.  \n12  She is sued in her official capacity as the official charged with performing the statutory and \n13  regulatory duties of SSA and its divisions, agents, employees and representatives. \n14  INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFF ALLEGATIONS \n15  Plaintiff Kevin Hart \n16  17.  Plaintiff Kevin Hart is a fifty year old man who was struck by a car on October 2, \n17  2007, shattering his right leg.  Mr. Hart underwent two surgeries in the following months to \n18  attempt to repair his leg, but still experiences tremendous pain and limited mobility.  His leg \n19  injury has also resulted in related ankle and leg pain, and the growth of cysts on his feet.  He \n20  needs a cane to walk.  The resulting decrease in mobility has also caused other health effects, \n21  such as increased blood pressure and cholesterol and swelling in the feet.  He also suffers from \n22  diabetes and emphysema.  Mr. Hart suffers substantial pain and is significantly limited in his day-\n23  to-day activities.  He cannot stand or sit for long periods of time. \n24  18.  While he wants to be able to work, Mr. Hart is incapable of sustained employment \n25  due to his medical conditions.  Mr. Hart worked from the time he was a teenager until his \n26  accident.  He started out doing construction, carpentry, painting and roofing.  He spent a number \n27  of years working for GMG, a Port of San Francisco janitorial contractor.  Then he worked as a \n28  loader for Blue Diamond Growers in Sacramento, California, and then as a groundskeeper for Cal \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  3 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 6 of 26\n1  Expo in Sacramento, until his accident in 2007.  Mr. Hart attempted to return to his job at Cal \n2  Expo in 2008 after the two surgeries and extensive physical therapy.  He had to stop working \n3  after less than a week because he was physically unable to perform the duties of the job. He also \n4  contacted Blue Diamond Growers about returning to work there; however, he could not return to \n5  the job because he was again physically unable to perform the duties of a loader. \n6  19.  Immediately after the accident, Mr. Hart underwent open reduction internal \n7  fixation (ORIF) surgery to try to repair his ankle fracture, where hardware (an “internal fixation” \n8  device) is placed on the bone. \n9  20.  In a June 2008 medical report, a doctor from UC Davis Medical Center explained \n10  that Mr. Hart probably suffered from a “non-union of the fibular site that was very painful” and \n11  while his ankle “would improve somewhat over time,” Mr. Hart “would likely have abnormalities \n12  in terms of decreased range of motion and abnormal gait related to his injury.” \n13  21.  The hardware in Mr. Hart’s ankle was surgically removed on June 18, 2008, \n14  leaving him with residual pain and stiffness.  At an August 18, 2008 consultation, Mr. Hart \n15  presented with “occasional sharp shooting pain” and “leg swelling on extensive walking.”   \n16  22.  Medical records from UC Davis Medical Center and Sacramento County DHHS \n17  show that Mr. Hart was also diagnosed with emphysema, hypertension, and eczema in late 2008, \n18  and insomnia in early 2010. \n19  23.  On April 23, 2010, an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) found Mr. Hart to be \n20  disabled with an onset established retroactive to 2007, due to his history of right ankle fracture, \n21  emphysema, and hypertension.  Mr. Hart was assessed to have “less than sedentary residual \n22  functional capacity.” \n23  24.  Then, on April 12, 2013, Mr. Hart was violently attacked by a group of teenagers \n24  in San Francisco.  He sustained a non-displaced rib fracture, a serious kidney laceration with \n25  hematoma, ruptured cyst, and multiple abrasions.  After the attack he urinated blood.  The \n26  hospital examination also revealed that Mr. Hart suffered from polycystic kidney disease. \n27  25.  Mr. Hart’s medical records show that, independent of his injuries from the attack, \n28  Mr. Hart’s health declined in many respects after he was found to be disabled.  Progress notes \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  4 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 7 of 26\n1  from his treatment at San Mateo Medical Center in 2013 showed that Mr. Hart had a mass on his \n2  right foot that was diagnosed as plantar fibromatosis.  The 2013 records also note new problems \n3  with Mr. Hart’s foot, including a “nodule at plantar to forefoot/midfoot, along the medial margin \n4  of plantar fascia.”  Mr. Hart was also diagnosed with “polcycstic kidney NOS; Diabetes Mellitus, \n5  Type II;” “Hyperlipidemia and Plantar Fibromatosis.”  After the attack, Mr. Hart developed \n6  debilitating back pain. \n7  26.  In 2013, SSA notified Mr. Hart that he was scheduled for a continuing disability \n8  review (CDR) to determine if he continued to meet the disability standard.  The CDR differs from \n9  the initial disability determination in that the first step is to determine if there has been any \n10  medical improvement since the date he was first determined to be disabled.  If medical \n11  improvement related to ability to do work cannot be established, and no exceptions apply, \n12  benefits will continue.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1594. \n13  27.  As part of his CDR, Mr. Hart was referred to Dr. Chen for a consultative \n14  examination, which he received on August 15, 2013. \n15  28.  Dr. Chen’s entire examination of Mr. Hart lasted approximately ten minutes. \n16  29.  Dr. Chen did not complete a full physical examination of Mr. Hart.  He asked \n17  Mr. Hart about his condition, but when Mr. Hart attempted to explain the diagnosis he had \n18  received from his doctors during his hospitalization, Dr. Chen repeatedly interrupted him by \n19  asking “who told you that?”  It appears that Dr. Chen did not review Mr. Hart’s medical records, \n20  which would have corroborated his explanations of his ailments.  Dr. Chen did not show any \n21  interest in learning about Mr. Hart’s condition. \n22  30.  In a subsequent report entitled “Comprehensive Internal Medicine Evaluation,” \n23  dated August 15, 2013, Dr. Chen incorrectly identified Mr. Hart’s “Chief Complaint” as \n24  “Hypertension” and “Intermittent shortness of breath.”  His only two diagnoses were \n25  “[h]ypertension,” and “symptoms of intermittent shortness of breath on exertion.”   \n26  31.  Dr. Chen’s report claims that he completed tests that he did not in fact perform.  \n27  The report gave results for numerous range of motion tests that would have required Dr. Chen to \n28  physically manipulate Mr. Hart’s body.  However, Dr. Chen did not touch Mr. Hart’s body with \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 8 of 26\n1  his hands during the examination, ask him to lie down on the examination table, or ask him to \n2  remove his clothes or shoes.  He did not perform standard tests for strength or range of motion.  \n3  He did not perform even basic tests, such as listening to Mr. Hart’s chest with a stethoscope.   \n4  32.  Neither Dr. Chen’s diagnoses nor his functional capacity assessment include any \n5  mention of Mr. Hart’s leg.  Dr. Chen completely omitted Mr. Hart’s leg and feet ailments from \n6  these sections, despite the fact that Mr. Hart arrived at his CE with his cane, an assistive device.  \n7  Dr. Chen briefly looked at the scar on Mr. Hart’s leg, but only after Mr. Hart proactively \n8  described his surgeries.  He asked Mr. Hart to stand on his right leg while lifting his left leg.  \n9  When Mr. Hart responded that he was physically unable to stand one-legged on his right leg, \n10  Dr. Chen had him sit down and hit his knees with a hammer to test his reflexes.  He did not \n11  perform any additional examination or test of Mr. Hart’s ability to stand or walk.  He did not at \n12  any point observe Mr. Hart walking without his cane.   \n13  33.  Dr. Chen concluded that Mr. Hart was capable of standing and walking for six \n14  hours in an eight hour day, and sitting for six hours in an eight hour day.   He opined that \n15  Mr. Hart could carry “50 pounds occasionally and 2 pounds frequently.”  Mr. Hart, however, \n16  cannot stand or walk for more than a few minutes without the assistance of a cane, and he cannot \n17  sit for long periods of time without experiencing painful swelling in his feet.   \n18  34.  After Dr. Chen’s evaluation, Mr. Hart received a notice from SSA dated \n19  September 11, 2013 telling him that his benefits were being terminated because he was no longer \n20  disabled.  He did not receive a copy of the CE report.  He promptly filed a Request for \n21  Reconsideration on September 30, 2013, stating “I am disabled. The doctor that I was sent to did \n22  not examine me.”  A hearing was scheduled for February 26, 2014 before a Disability Hearing \n23  Officer.  He was not represented by counsel at the Reconsideration hearing.  Although Dr. Chen \n24  had been disqualified two months before the hearing, neither SSA nor Disability Determination \n25  Service Division of the California Department of Social Services (DDSD) ever notified him of \n26  Dr. Chen’s disqualification. \n27  35.  In a written order dated March 17, 2014, the Disability Hearing Officer found that \n28  Mr. Hart’s physical impairments had “medically improved” since the Comparison Point Decision \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  6 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 9 of 26\n1  (CPD) and that he is no longer disabled.  The Order specifically cited Dr. Chen’s report for its \n2  opinion that “the claimant is able to do medium work activities.”  Despite the fact that Mr. Hart \n3  had submitted evidence from another doctor concluding Mr. Hart had “limitations approximate to \n4  less than sedentary work ability,” the Order found that Dr. Chen’s opinion “is more reasonable as \n5  consistent and supported by medical evidence.” \n6  36.  On March 25, 2014, Mr. Hart filed a Request for Hearing by an ALJ.  He is \n7  awaiting his hearing. \n8  37.  Mr. Hart currently lives with his seventy-eight-year-old mother in San Mateo.  He \n9  tries to help his mother with chores around the house but his disability makes simple tasks, like \n10  doing the dishes, extremely difficult.  He worries about having enough money to meet basic needs \n11  like paying rent and buying food, let alone paying for the special shoes and inserts that his doctor \n12  has prescribed to take care of his feet.  He struggles to get by with his monthly SSI and SSDI \n13  disability benefits, and cannot imagine how he will meet these basic life necessities without it.  \n14  That monthly benefit is his only income. \n15  Plaintiff Nina Silva-Collins \n16  38.  Plaintiff Nina Silva-Collins is a thirty-eight year old woman who suffers from \n17  severe, chronic anemia caused by menorrhagia (abnormally heavy and prolonged menstrual \n18  bleeding), lumbar degenerative disc disease, depression, anxiety, asthma, and hypertension. \n19  39.  Menorrhagia is Ms. Silva-Collins’ most debilitating condition, resulting in a period \n20  of intense bleeding that can last up to three weeks per menstrual cycle.  She has been hospitalized \n21  repeatedly as a result, and treated with blood transfusions and medication.  She brings a change of \n22  clothes everywhere she goes because she bleeds so heavily.  When she is menstruating, she has to \n23  go to the restroom once an hour.  This makes even sedentary work impossible.  \n24  40.  Ms. Silva-Collins applied for SSI and SSDI benefits on September 7, 2011, when \n25  her condition required multiple blood transfusions at St. Rose Hospital in Hayward, California.  \n26  Her claim was denied initially on February 8, 2012.  Ms. Silva-Collins filed a timely request for \n27  reconsideration on February 16, 2012, which was denied on July 19, 2012.  Ms. Silva-Collins \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  7 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 10 of 26\n1  filed a written request for a hearing on August 13, 2012.  A hearing before an ALJ was held on \n2  July 2, 2013, but a supplemental hearing was set when the ALJ determined that a CE was needed. \n3  41.  On August 10, 2013, Ms. Silva-Collins was examined by Dr. Chen at the Bay \n4  View Medical Clinic in Oakland, California. \n5  42.  Dr. Chen’s entire examination lasted approximately ten minutes.   \n6  43.  Dr. Chen did not complete a full physical examination of Ms. Silva-Collins.  He \n7  lifted Ms. Silva-Collins’ leg, and asked her to bend over and squat.   Dr. Chen asked her how \n8  much she could pick up, and she explained that her ability to lift items varied due to the cyclical \n9  menorrhagia.  Ms. Silva-Collins’ vital signs were not taken, nor did Dr. Chen use a stethoscope to \n10  listen to her heart beat.  Dr. Chen did not use a hammer or other instrument to test her reflexes, \n11  and he did not test her grip or strength.  Ms. Silva-Collins was never asked to remove her clothes, \n12  shoes or socks, and her body was not measured or palpated.  Dr. Chen did not ask Ms. Silva-\n13  Collins any questions about her menorrhagia, anemia, or other blood issues, or the effect that \n14  these chronic conditions had on her physical capabilities. \n15  44.  In a subsequent report, titled “Comprehensive Internal Medicine Evaluation,” \n16  Dr. Chen made only two diagnoses: “[l]ow back pain, possibly due to obesity,” and “obesity.”  \n17  Neither his diagnoses nor the functional capacity assessment mention Ms. Silva-Collins’ \n18  menorrhagia or anemia.   \n19  45.  Dr. Chen’s report claims that he completed tests that he did not in fact perform.  \n20  The report gave results for numerous strength and range of motion tests that he did not perform. \n21  46.  Dr. Chen concluded, as he did with Mr. Hart, that Ms. Silva-Collins was capable \n22  of standing and walking for six hours in an eight hour day, and sitting for six hours in an eight \n23  hour day.  He opined that she could occasionally bend, stoop, and crouch, and warned only that \n24  Ms. Silva-Collins should “avoid climbing ladders and scaffolds.”   \n25  47.  Following the supplemental hearing on January 8, 2014, the ALJ denied her claim \n26  for benefits in a written order dated January 16, 2014.  In concluding that Ms. Silva-Collins was \n27  not disabled, the ALJ gave “great weight to the opinion of consultative examiner Dr. Chen” and \n28  noted “[h]is examination is the most thorough and detailed in the record, and well supported by \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  8 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 11 of 26\n1  the medical evidence as a whole, thus, the undersigned gives his opinion great weight to the \n2  extent that it is consistent with this decision.” \n3  48.  Ms. Silva-Collins was never notified by SSA or DDSD of Dr. Chen’s \n4  disqualification as a consultative examiner. \n5  49.  Upon learning of Dr. Chen’s disqualification as a consultative examiner, \n6  Ms. Silva-Collins’ attorney sent a letter on February 12, 2014 to the ALJ, attaching a letter from \n7  the California Department of Social Services explaining that Dr. Chen had been disqualified, and \n8  asking the ALJ to reconsider the unfavorable decision.  This request was denied. \n9  50.  Ms. Silva-Collins filed an appeal to the SSA Appeals Council, and is currently \n10  awaiting their decision.   \n11  51.  Ms. Silva-Collins is incapable of sustained employment due to her medical \n12  conditions.  While she has had some temporary, unskilled jobs—an assembly line worker from \n13  January to June 2011, and a warehouse worker with United Parcel Service between June 2000 \n14  and February 2003—her highest lifetime earnings in any single year was $6,321 in 2001.  \n15  Ms. Silva-Collins has no high school diploma or GED, and no other skills or means to earn a \n16  living. \n17  52.  Ms. Silva-Collins currently lives with her father and survives on CalFresh (food \n18  stamps) and $336 a month in General Assistance, much of which she gives to her father in \n19  exchange for his support.  Ms. Silva-Collins has applied for Medi-Cal, but that application is \n20  currently pending.  SSI would allow Ms. Silva-Collins a measure of independence and stability, \n21  and a means to afford needed medical supplies (such as heavy-duty menstrual pads) and other life \n22  necessities. \n23  Plaintiff Lee Harris \n24  53.  Plaintiff Lee Harris is a fifty-four year old man who has suffered from debilitating \n25  pain since a car accident in April 2005 during which he fractured both of his ankles and injured \n26  his lower back.  A CT scan at the time of the accident revealed multiple transverse process \n27  fractures involving the lower thoracic spine and lumbar spine.  On April 13, 2005, Mr. Harris had \n28  surgery to repair the fractures in his right heel bone and left foot that left him in a short leg cast.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  9 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 12 of 26\n1  The next week, he underwent another surgical repair to repin the right heel bone fracture and the \n2  screw in his left foot fracture. \n3  54.  The hardware in his right heel bone caused continued, debilitating pain, and \n4  Mr. Harris had another surgery to remove it in January 2006. \n5  55.  Mr. Harris is incapable of sustained employment due to his medical conditions.  \n6  Before his accident, Mr. Harris worked as an auto dismantler for Dorris Auto Wreckers.  \n7  Mr. Harris has also worked in warehousing, anodizing, and construction.  While he wants to be \n8  able to work again, he is in too much pain. \n9  56.  Mr. Harris applied for SSI benefits on August 9, 2011.  SSA referred Mr. Harris to \n10  Dr. Chen for a consultative examination, which he received on October 28, 2011. \n11  57.  Mr. Harris was examined by Dr. Chen at the Bay View Medical Clinic in Oakland, \n12  California.  Mr. Harris was accompanied by his son, who was approximately six or seven years \n13  old at the time. \n14  58.  Dr. Chen’s entire examination lasted approximately twelve minutes.   \n15  59.  Dr. Chen did not complete a full physical examination of Mr. Harris.  He asked \n16  Mr. Harris to take off his socks and shoes.  Dr. Chen looked at Mr. Harris’ feet.  Dr. Chen did not \n17  use a hammer or other instrument to test his feet. \n18  60.  Dr. Chen asked Mr. Harris to stand without his cane.  Mr. Harris attempted to \n19  stand, but he had to grab the examination table immediately.  Dr. Chen told him to stop grabbing \n20  the table, to which Mr. Harris responded that he could not. \n21  61.  Mr. Harris took out his medications to show Dr. Chen, but the doctor said that he \n22  did not need to see them and asked no questions about them.  Dr. Chen did not ask Mr. Harris any \n23  questions about his conditions or his physical capabilities. \n24  62.  Dr. Chen’s report claims that he completed tests that he did not in fact perform.  \n25  The report gave results for numerous range of motion tests that would have required Dr. Chen to \n26  physically manipulate Mr. Harris’s body. However, Dr. Chen did not touch Mr. Harris’s body \n27  during the examination.  He did not perform standard tests for strength or range of motion.  He \n28  did not perform even basic tests, such as listening to Mr. Harris’s chest with a stethoscope. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  10 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 13 of 26\n1  63.  Dr. Chen concluded that Mr. Harris did not need to use his cane to walk short \n2  distances, even though he had never seen Mr. Harris stand without it.  Dr. Chen also concluded \n3  that Mr. Harris could sit for six hours, stand and walk for six hours in an eight-hour workday, lift \n4  and carry 25 pounds frequently, and lift and carry 50 pounds occasionally. \n5  64.  Mr. Harris’s application was denied on November 18, 2011, and again upon \n6  reconsideration on May 16, 2012.  Thereafter, Mr. Harris filed a written request for hearing on \n7  June 19, 2012.  That hearing was held before an ALJ on April 29, 2013. \n8  65.  In a written order dated June 4, 2013, the ALJ determined that Mr. Harris has the \n9  residual functional capacity to perform medium work as defined in 20 C.F.R. § 416.967(c).  The \n10  decision states that “the examination by Dr. Chen indicates far greater functionality than alleged \n11  by the claimant.”  The ALJ “assign[ed] the greatest weight to Dr. Chen’s opinion because he \n12  personally examined the claimant.” \n13  66.  Mr. Harris applied again for SSI benefits on November 14, 2013. \n14  67.  On November 14, 2013, Mr. Harris’s counsel arranged a physical and forensic \n15  examination of Mr. Harris by Dr. Emily Cohen.  Dr. Cohen diagnosed Mr. Harris with chronic \n16  lumbosacral pain, chronic ankle/foot pain, acute left forearm pain, and hypertension.  Dr. Cohen \n17  concluded that Mr. Harris could walk and/or stand for about two hours out of an eight-hour work \n18  day, and sit for six hours out of an eight-hour work day.  Given his instability, Dr. Cohen found \n19  that Mr. Harris could only lift and carry about ten pounds frequently and occasionally. \n20  68.  On July 21, 2014, SSA referred Mr. Harris to Dr. Calvin Pon for a consultative \n21  examination, which he received on August 8, 2014.  Mr. Harris was examined by Dr. Pon at the \n22  Bay View Medical Clinic in Oakland, California.  Dr. Pon similarly diagnosed Mr. Harris with \n23  chronic low back pain and chronic bilateral heel-foot pain. \n24  69.  Mr. Harris’s claim was denied initially on August 28, 2014.  This initial \n25  determination stated that Mr. Harris’s CE was “reviewed and compared with CE by Dr. Chen in \n26  prior file.”  Mr. Harris sent a request for reconsideration on September 12, 2014, which was \n27  denied on January 26, 2015.  Mr. Harris filed a written request for a hearing on February 4, 2015.  \n28  That request is pending. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  11 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 14 of 26\n1  70.  Mr. Harris lives alone in an apartment in Oakland, California.  His disability \n2  makes simple tasks extremely difficult.  For example, Mr. Harris has to depend on others to do \n3  his grocery shopping, since he is unable to carry the shopping bags.  He struggles to get by with \n4  his monthly $336 in General Assistance benefits and $189 in food stamps.  He often has to seek \n5  financial assistance from his brother and sister to meet basic life necessities. \n6  71.  Receiving SSI benefits would not only help Mr. Harris meet these basic needs, but \n7  it would allow him to visit his eleven year old son, who currently lives in Reno, Nevada. \n8  DISQUALIFICATION OF CONSULTATIVE EXAMINER DR. FRANK CHEN \n9  72.  Dr. Frank Chen is a medical doctor who was appointed by DDSD to be on its CE \n10  panel, and saw applicants for disability benefits in at least four different clinics, in San Francisco, \n11  Oakland, San Jose, and Pacific Grove, California. \n12  Complaints Against Dr. Frank Chen \n13  73.  Over the years, applicants and their representatives filed numerous complaints \n14  against Dr. Chen with DDSD, explaining that he had not actually conducted full physical \n15  examinations as he stated in his reports.  His examinations were not based on medically \n16  acceptable clinical diagnostic techniques, and sometimes included unauthorized neurological \n17  examinations.  Dr. Chen’s reports ignored diagnoses, findings, and symptoms described in his \n18  patients’ medical records, which he claimed to have reviewed.  His reports were internally \n19  inconsistent.  Applicants also complained that Dr. Chen acted unprofessionally and displayed a \n20  lack of attention and concern during their brief appointments.  He interrupted applicants when \n21  they tried to describe their diagnoses and symptoms and laughed when they described the list of \n22  medications they were taking.  He made inappropriate comments about religion and about \n23  patients’ personal characteristics.  When applicants described certain conditions, Dr. Chen \n24  responded that they should go “tell the mental examiner” or “save it for the mental doctor.” \n25  Corrective Action Letters to Dr. Frank Chen \n26  74.  On September 2, 2011, DDSD sent Dr. Chen an initial Corrective Action letter \n27  identifying four areas of concern: the quality of his CE reports, the lack of thoroughness of his \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  12 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 15 of 26\n1  examinations, religious comments made during examinations, and conducting unauthorized \n2  neurological examinations. \n3  75.  DDSD sent a second Corrective Action letter to Dr. Chen on October 14, 2013, \n4  identifying continuing problems with the quality of his CE reports, the lack of thoroughness of his \n5  examinations, and his unprofessional manner towards applicants. \n6  Removal from CE Panel \n7  76.  Finding Dr. Chen had not made the changes required to provide adequate service \n8  and continuing to receive complaints about Dr. Chen, the DDSD removed Dr. Chen from the CE \n9  panel as of December 30, 2013 due to Dr. Chen’s “unprofessional manner and failure to \n10  adequately correct deficiencies in his CE reports.” \n11  77.  Plaintiffs and members of the class were given no notice of Dr. Chen’s \n12  disqualification.   \n13  78.  Even after his disqualification, Dr. Chen’s reports have still been treated as \n14  competent evidence by the Social Security Administration.  His reports continue to be relied upon \n15  by the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) and courts making determinations \n16  of eligibility for benefits. \n17  LEGAL FRAMEWORK \n18  79.  The Social Security Act requires the SSA to provide benefits to qualified \n19  individuals with disabilities who are “unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by \n20  reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to \n21  result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less \n22  than twelve months.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A). \n23  80.  While the SSA administers these benefit programs, it contracts with state agencies \n24  to make the disability determinations under standards established by SSA.  20 C.F.R.                   \n25  § 404.1503(a).  In California, these disability determinations are made by the DDSD. \n26  Standards for Medical Evidence \n27  81.  The existence of an individual’s disabling impairment must be supported by \n28  medical evidence: “there must be medical signs and findings, established by medically acceptable \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  13 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 16 of 26\n1  clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques[.]”   42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. \n2  § 1382c(a)(3)(D). \n3  82.  Defendant is responsible for establishing uniform standards to be applied at all \n4  levels of disability determinations.  42 U.S.C. § 421(k)(1).  The determination that an individual \n5  is disabled must be based on “evidence from acceptable medical sources” to establish whether an \n6  individual has a medically determinable impairment.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a), 416.913(a). \n7  83.  If the evidence provided by the claimant’s own medical sources is inadequate to \n8  determine if he or she is disabled, additional medical information may be sought by contacting \n9  claimant’s sources or by arranging for a consultative examination. \n10  84.  Defendant violated its mandate under the SSA and its implementing regulations to \n11  use evidence from acceptable medical sources by relying upon deficient CE reports from \n12  Dr. Chen in denying or terminating SSI and SSDI benefits. \n13  Consultative Examinations and Reports \n14  85.  CEs are one-time physical or mental examinations performed by medical doctors \n15  and other health professionals who are contractors with the DDSD.   \n16  86.  The SSA’s internal operating instructions—known as the Program Operations \n17  Manual System (“POMS”)—list specific tests which should be performed for different types of \n18  exams.  POMS Disability Insurance (DI) 22510.021 et seq., available at \n19  https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/partlist.  The POMS provisions also list minimum \n20  scheduling intervals for different types of exams to “[a]llow sufficient time to permit the medical \n21  source to take a case history and perform the examination, including any needed tests.”  Id. at DI \n22  39545.250.  For example, the minimum scheduling interval for a comprehensive general medical \n23  examination is “at least 30 minutes.”  Id. \n24  87.  Following the CE, the examiner submits a CE report to the DDSD. \n25  88.  The SSA has promulgated specific guidelines regarding the content of these CE \n26  reports.  Consultative Examinations: A Guide for Health Professionals Part III, available at \n27  http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/greenbook/ce-guidelines.htm.  The guidelines direct a \n28  CE to use “standard reporting principles for a complete medical examination,” including detailed \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  14 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 17 of 26\n1  reporting of the applicant’s medical history, the results of the physical examination, any \n2  laboratory findings, and discussion of conclusions.  Id. \n3  89.  The guidelines also state that the CE report “should be complete enough to enable \n4  an independent reviewer to determine the nature, severity and duration of the claimant’s \n5  impairment,” as well as “the claimant’s ability to perform basic work-related functions.”  Id.  The \n6  physician must provide a narrative of the applicant’s medical history and the physical \n7  examination.  Id. \n8  90.  The guidelines require that conclusions in the CE report must be consistent with \n9  “all available information,” including the “objective clinical findings found on examination and \n10  the claimant’s symptoms” and medical history.  Id.  For adults, the CE report “should include a \n11  description, based on the [CE’s] own findings, of the individual’s ability to do basic work-related \n12  activities.  It should not include an opinion as to whether the claimant is disabled under the \n13  meaning of the law.”  Id. \n14  91.  The guidelines explicitly outline seven requirements for a CE report.  It must: \n15  Provide evidence that serves as an adequate basis for disability \ndecision-making in terms of the impairment it assesses. \n16 \nBe internally consistent, and ensure that all the diseases, \n17  impairments and complaints described in the history are adequately \nassessed and reported in the clinical findings. \n18 \nCorrelate conclusions with the medical history, the clinical \n19  examination and laboratory tests, and explain all abnormalities. \n20  Be consistent with the other information available within the \nspecialty of the examination requested. \n21 \nMention important or relevant complaints within the consultative \n22  examiner’s specialty that is noted in other evidence in the file (e.g., \nblindness in one eye, amputations, pain, alcoholism, depression). \n23 \nBe adequate as compared to the standards set out in the course of a \n24  medical education. \n25  Be properly signed. \n26  Id. \n27  92.  The DDSD then relies on the CE report in making its disability recommendation.  \n28  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1517 – 404.1519t, §§ 416.917 – 416.919t. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  15 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 18 of 26\n1  93.  Because a CE report is used in making disability determinations, SSA regulations \n2  require that it be evidence from an “acceptable medical source[].”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a), \n3  416.913(a). \n4  94.  Defendant’s reliance upon deficient CE reports from Dr. Chen in denying or \n5  terminating SSI and SSDI benefits is contrary to these guidelines. \n6  Monitoring of Consultative Examinations and Examiners \n7  95.  The Social Security Act tasks the Commissioner of Social Security to proscribe \n8  regulations through which the consultative examination process and its examiners are monitored.  \n9  42 U.S.C. § 421(j)(3) (“The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe regulations which \n10  set forth . . . procedures by which the Commissioner of Social Security will monitor . . . the \n11  product of professionals to whom cases are referred.”). \n12  96.  Defendant is responsible for monitoring and ensuring the adequacy of the CE \n13  process, including providers.  See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1519s(g), 416.919s(g) (“The State agencies \n14  will cooperate with us when we conduct monitoring activities in connection with their oversight \n15  management of their consultative examination programs.”). \n16  97.  The SSA’s policy and practice of relying upon CE reports performed by Dr. Chen \n17  is contrary to Defendant’s duty to monitor and ensure the adequacy of the CE process and \n18  providers. \n19  Disqualified Consultative Examiners \n20  98.  The SSA may disqualify a medical provider from performing CEs on its behalf.  \n21  Social Security Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual (“HALLEX”) Ch. I-2-1-32, \n22  available at http://ssa.gov/OP_Home/hallex/hallex.html. \n23  99.  Even after an examiner has been disqualified, Defendant may still rely on existing \n24  reports from that examiner as “existing medical evidence.”  See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1503a, \n25  416.903a (“We will not use in our program any individual or entity, except to provide existing \n26  medical evidence, who is currently excluded, suspended, or otherwise barred[.]”) (emphasis \n27  added).  But to the extent that Defendant relies on those existing reports—where those reports are \n28  deficient and the CE has been disqualified, at least in part, because of such deficiency—to \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  16 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 19 of 26\n1  determine an individual’s disability, such policy and practice violates Defendant’s obligation to \n2  use evidence from acceptable medical sources.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a), 416.913(a). \n3  100.  There is no rule or regulation directing SSA employees to provide applicants \n4  whose benefits have been denied or terminated any notice that their examiner has been \n5  disqualified.  According to “HALLEX”—the Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual that \n6  provides policies and guidance for processing and adjudicating disability claims—the SSA leaves \n7  it to the state agency to decide whether they should provide notice to the Office of Disability \n8  Adjudication and Review.  HALLEX Ch. I-2-1-32(A) (DDS “may provide formal notice” to the \n9  ODAR of a disqualification and “[i]n most circumstances, DDS will identify cases pending in \n10  ODAR that require further action because the record contains a consultative examination \n11  performed by the disqualified consultative examiner.”) (emphasis added). \n12  101.  Moreover, any review of a denial or termination of benefits is done on an \n13  individual basis: an ALJ “must evaluate the allegation of disqualification” based only “on the \n14  medical evidence of record” for that claimant, and issue a decision after weighing that evidence.  \n15  Id. I-2-1-32(B).  The ALJ “will not rely on or associate evidence of a consultative examiner \n16  disqualification submitted by one claimant with a different claimant’s file.”  Id. \n17  Review of Disability Determinations \n18  102.  The Commissioner of Social Security has the authority to review any disability \n19  determination, either before or after any action is taken to implement the disability determination.  \n20  42 U.S.C. § 421(c)(1). \n21  103.  SSA has promulgated regulations dictating the circumstances under which an \n22  applicant’s disability determination or decision may be reopened for both the SSDI and SSI \n23  programs.  For the SSDI program, 20 C.F.R. § 404.988 states: \n24  A determination, revised determination, decision, or revised \ndecision may be reopened— \n25 \n(a) Within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial \n26  determination, for any reason; \n27  (b) Within four years of the date of the notice of the initial \ndetermination if we find good cause, as defined in § 404.989, to \n28  reopen the case; or \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  17 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 20 of 26\n(c) At any time if— \n1 \n(1) It was obtained by fraud or similar fault (see § 416.1488(c) \n2  of this chapter for factors which we take into account in \ndetermining fraud or similar fault)[.] \n3   \n4 \n104.  For the SSI program, 20 C.F.R. § 416.1488 states: \n5 \nA determination, revised determination, decision, or revised \n6  decision may be reopened— \n7  (a) Within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial \ndetermination, for any reason; \n8 \n(b) Within two years of the date of the notice of the initial \n9  determination if we find good cause, as defined in § 416.1489, to \nreopen the case; or \n10 \n(c) At any time if it was obtained by fraud or similar fault.  In \n11  determining whether a determination or decision was obtained by \nfraud or similar fault, we will take into account any physical, \n12  mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of \nfacility with the English language) which you may have had at the \n13  time.   \n \n14 \n105.  “Good cause” for reopening a determination or decision will be found if: \n15 \n(1) New and material evidence is furnished; \n16 \n(2) A clerical error in the computation or recomputation of benefits \n17  was made; or \n18  (3) The evidence that was considered in making the determination \nor decision clearly shows on its face that an error was made.  \n19   \n20  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.989, 416.1489. \n21  106.  “Fraud” exists “when a person, with intent to defraud, either: (1) Makes or causes \n22  to be made a false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact for use in determining rights \n23  to Social Security benefits; or (2) Conceals or fails to disclose a material fact for use in \n24  determining rights to Social Security benefits.”  POMS General (GN) § 04020.010(A)(1). \n25  107.  “Similar fault” exists “when a person either: (1) Knowingly makes an incorrect or \n26  incomplete statement that is material to the determination; or (2) Knowingly conceals information \n27  that is material to the determination.  However, fraudulent intent is not required.”  Id. GN              \n28  § 04020.010(A)(2). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  18 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 21 of 26\n1  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n2  108.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the \n3  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4  109.  This class consists of: \n5  All persons whose SSI disability or SSDI benefits were either \ndenied or terminated and for whom a consultative examination \n6  report was prepared by Dr. Frank Chen.  \n7  110.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. While the \n8  exact number of class members can only be obtained through appropriate discovery, on \n9  information and belief, there are hundreds and possibly thousands of class members whose SSI \n10  and/or SSDI benefits were either denied or terminated because of reliance upon, in whole or in \n11  part, a consultative examination report from Dr. Chen.   \n12  111.  There are questions of law and fact common to all class members that predominate \n13  over questions only affecting individual class members. Such questions include, among others:  \n14  a.  Whether Defendant violated its mandate under the SSA and its implementing \n15  regulations to use evidence from acceptable medical sources by relying upon \n16  deficient CE reports from Dr. Chen in denying or terminating SSI and SSDI \n17  benefits. \n18  b.  Whether Defendant violated its obligation under the SSA and its implementing \n19  regulations to monitor and ensure the adequacy of the consultative examination \n20  process and providers by relying upon deficient CE reports from Dr. Chen in \n21  denying or terminating SSI and SSDI benefits. \n22  c.  Whether Plaintiffs and members of the class were deprived of due process by \n23  Defendant’s failure to provide them with a complete and thorough consultative \n24  examination by a competent consultative examiner, in violation of the Fifth \n25  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n26  d.  Whether Plaintiffs and members of the class were deprived of due process by \n27  Defendant’s failure to notify them of the disqualification of Dr. Chen, in violation \n28  of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  19 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 22 of 26\n1  e.  Whether Plaintiffs and members of the class were deprived of due process by \n2  Defendant’s failure to provide them with copies of their consultative examination \n3  report, in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  \n4  f.  Whether, under the Social Security Act and regulations, Plaintiffs and members of \n5  the class are entitled to have their claims reopened and redetermined on the basis \n6  of “good cause” because new and material evidence has been furnished as to the \n7  adequacy of their CE examinations and reports from Dr. Chen. \n8  g.  Whether, under the Social Security Act and regulations, Plaintiffs and members of \n9  the class are entitled to have their claims reopened and redetermined on the basis \n10  of “good cause” because those determinations relied on a defective CE report from \n11  Dr. Chen that clearly shows on its face that error(s) were made. \n12  h.  Whether, under the Social Security Act and regulations, Plaintiffs and members of \n13  the class are entitled to have their claims reopened and redetermined on the basis \n14  of “fraud or similar fault” because Dr. Chen knew he was making incorrect or \n15  incomplete statements in his CE reports. \n16  i.  Whether, under the Social Security Act and regulations, Plaintiffs and members of \n17  the class are entitled to have their claims reopened and redetermined on the basis \n18  of “fraud or similar fault” because Dr. Chen knowingly concealed material \n19  information when he prepared his CE reports. \n20  j.  Whether, under the Social Security Act and regulations, Plaintiffs and members of \n21  the class are entitled to a new CE report from an acceptable medical source. \n22  k.  Whether, under the Social Security Act and regulations, Plaintiffs and members of \n23  the class are entitled to have their claims reopened and redetermined without any \n24  reliance on Dr. Chen’s consultative examination and report. \n25  112.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all class members, and arise from the \n26  same need to have their applications reopened and redetermined without any reliance on \n27  Dr. Chen’s consultative examination reports.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought is \n28  common to all class members. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  20 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 23 of 26\n1  113.  A class action is superior to other available methods for a fair and efficient \n2  adjudication of this matter in that the prosecution of separate actions by individual class members \n3  would unduly burden the Court and create the possibility of conflicting decisions. \n4  114.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class members. \n5  115.  The named plaintiffs and the proposed class are represented by National Senior \n6  Citizens Law Center, Morrison & Foerster LLP, and Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, \n7  whose attorneys are experienced in class action litigation and will adequately represent the class. \n8  116.  Defendant has acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, by relying on \n9  defective CEs from Dr. Chen, that failed to meet the mandates in the SSA and its implementing \n10  regulations to use evidence from acceptable medical sources to establish whether an individual \n11  has a medically determinable impairment and to monitor and ensure the adequacy of the CE \n12  process and providers. \n13  117.  If class certification is not granted, individuals would be forced to bring separate \n14  actions, thereby wasting judicial resources, as well as the time of attorneys from government \n15  agencies and legal services providers. \n16  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n17  FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR \nImproper Reliance on Dr. Frank Chen CE Reports \n18   \n19  118.  Paragraphs 1 – 117 are each re-alleged and incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n20  119.  The Social Security Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 42 U.S.C. \n21  §§ 421, 423 and 1383b, 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512 – 404.1513 and 416.912 – 416.913, require \n22  Defendant to base disability determinations on evidence from acceptable medical sources.   \n23  120.  The SSA’s policy and practice of relying upon CE reports performed by Dr. Chen \n24  violates Defendant’s legal obligation to base disability determinations on evidence from \n25  acceptable medical sources.   \n26  121.  This policy and practice violates the Social Security Act and its implementing \n27  regulations. \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  21 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 24 of 26\n1  122.  Defendant has the authority to review the disability determinations of Plaintiffs \n2  and class members.  42 U.S.C. § 421(c)(1). \n3  123.  Pursuant to the 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.988, 404.989, 416.1488, 416.1489, grounds exist \n4  to reopen these determinations. \n5  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n6  FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR \nImproper Reliance on Dr. Frank Chen CE Reports \n7   \n8  124.  Paragraphs 1 – 123 are each re-alleged and incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n9  125.  The Social Security Act tasks the Commissioner of Social Security to proscribe \n10  regulations through which the consultative examination process and its examiners are monitored.  \n11  42 U.S.C. § 421(j)(3). \n12  126.  SSA regulations assign Defendant responsibility for monitoring and ensuring the \n13  adequacy of the CE process and providers.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1519s(g), 416.919s(g). \n14  127.  Accordingly, the SSA’s policy and practice of relying upon CE reports performed \n15  by Dr. Chen is irreconcilable with Defendant’s duty to monitor and ensure the adequacy of the \n16  CE process and providers. \n17  128.  This policy and practice violates the Social Security Act and its implementing \n18  regulations. \n19  129.  Defendant has the authority to review the disability determinations of Plaintiffs \n20  and class members.  42 U.S.C. § 421(c)(1). \n21  130.  Pursuant to the 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.988, 404.989, 416.1488, 416.1489, grounds exist \n22  to reopen these determinations. \n23  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR \n24 \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, \n Actionable Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Due Process) \n25 \n26 \n131.  Paragraphs 1 – 130 are each re-alleged and incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n27 \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  22 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 1   Filed 02/09/15   Page 25 of 26\n1  132.  Defendant’s failure to provide Plaintiffs and class members with a complete and \n2  thorough consultative examination by a competent consultative examiner violates Plaintiffs’ and \n3  class members’ Fifth Amendment rights to procedural due process. \n4  133.  Defendant’s failure to notify Plaintiffs and class members of the disqualification of \n5  Dr. Chen violates Plaintiffs’ and class members’ Fifth Amendment rights to procedural due \n6  process. \n7  134.  Defendant’s failure to provide Plaintiffs and class members with copies of their \n8  CE report violates Plaintiffs’ and class members’ Fifth Amendment rights to procedural due \n9  process.   \n10  135.  As a result, Plaintiffs and members of the class were denied an opportunity for a \n11  fair and adequate notice and hearing.  \n12  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n14  a.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \n15  b.  Certify this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \n16  of Civil Procedure; \n17  c.  Declare that Defendant’s policies and practices, as set forth above, violate the \n18  SSA’s obligations pursuant to the Social Security Act, its implementing \n19  regulations and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution; \n20  d.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendant from relying on consultative \n21  exam reports from Dr. Frank Chen to terminate or deny SSI and/or SSDI benefits; \n22  e.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendant to reopen all prior determinations \n23  terminating or denying SSI and/or SSDI benefits that relied, in whole or in part, on \n24  a consultative exam report from Dr. Frank Chen, and to offer Plaintiffs the \n25  opportunity for a new consultative examination from a well-qualified clinician;  \n26  f.

INTRODUCTION \n2  This is a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief only, in which Plaintiffs seek \n3  class certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Only three facts matter for purposes of this motion, and \n4  all are uncontested.   \n5  First, after repeated complaints, the Social Security Administration (SSA) disqualified \n6  Dr. Frank Chen in December 2013 from performing further consultative examinations (“CE”) due \n7  to deficiencies in his reports and the inadequacy of his examinations.  Second, before he was \n8  disqualified, Dr. Chen submitted CE reports in at least 325 cases that resulted in a denial of \n9  benefits and are now pending at the hearing level.  That is only the tip of the iceberg, because it \n10  does not include cases where an applicant may have simply dropped his or her claim after it was \n11  denied, and does not include cases still at the pre-hearing stage.  Altogether, the class likely \n12  consists of thousands of claimants.  Third, the SSA has now admitted—through an attempted \n13  partial fix after this lawsuit was filed—that the integrity of the administrative process was \n14  compromised by Dr. Chen’s CE reports.  Yet, the SSA has instructed its adjudicators that these \n15  reports may be considered nonetheless.  \n16  This is bad enough for those 325 claimants, because Dr. Chen’s reports could still play a \n17  role in a denial or termination of their claims.  But claimants do not ordinarily get to see the CE \n18  reports, so what about the many claimants who never even saw theirs?  They were never told that \n19  their denials or terminations were based on an unreliable report from Dr. Chen.  They likely \n20  would not have had any reason to know they had grounds to challenge the SSA’s determination, \n21  let alone possess the resources to pursue those claims even if they knew they had been wronged.  \n22  For them, the SSA’s attempted fix in the course of litigation is empty, and too late.   \n23  Every SSA claimant is entitled to a fair process.  Whether any given claimant is ultimately \n24  found to be entitled to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability \n25  Insurance (SSDI) benefits is not at issue.  This Court is not being asked to decide that.  Here, \n26  every class member’s process was tainted by a common injury, the SSA’s policy of considering \n27  CE reports prepared by Dr. Chen in resolving their disability claims. \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  1 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 9 of 28\n \n1  That this was a policy cannot be disputed.  In its motion to dismiss, SSA argued that there \n2  was no “policy” being challenged, hence, each aggrieved claimant must individually run the \n3  procedural gauntlet, one by one, and exhaust his or her administrative remedy.  But this Court \n4  concluded that exhaustion would be futile.  It found that SSA’s use of reports by Dr. Chen was a \n5  “policy.”  That finding establishes the commonality element of Rule 23(a), because each class \n6  member was aggrieved by a policy this Court described as “an SSA-wide policy to consider \n7  Dr. Chen’s reports in resolving disability claims, even in the wake of widespread allegations of \n8  deficiencies in the quality of his examinations.” \n9  There is nothing novel about what Plaintiffs seek.  In fact, it is precisely the kind of relief \n10  ordered by the district court in Bowen v. City of New York upon certification of a class of \n11  individuals who had been denied disability benefits or whose benefits had been terminated \n12  pursuant to an allegedly unlawful policy: reopen decisions denying or terminating benefits, and \n13  notify class members that their claims had been reopened.  476 U.S. 467, 475-76 & n.7 (1986). \n14  The Court should certify the proposed class, and allow Named Plaintiffs to seek relief on \n15  behalf of all those who had a CE report from Dr. Chen and were denied benefits or had their \n16  benefits terminated. \n17  II.  ISSUE TO BE DECIDED \n18  The issue to be decided is whether Plaintiffs’ claims satisfy the requirements for class \n19  certification under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2). \n20  III.  BACKGROUND \n21  A.  SSA Is Obliged to Provide a Fair Process for Determining Whether \nClaimants Are Entitled to Benefits.   \n22   \n23  To obtain benefits based on disability under the SSI or SSDI programs, a claimant must be \n24  unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable \n25  physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can \n26  be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.”  42 U.S.C. \n27  § 423(d)(1)(A).  A claimant must provide SSA with “evidence from acceptable medical sources to \n28  establish whether [the individual has] a medically determinable impairment[].”  20 C.F.R. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  2 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 10 of 28\n \n1  § 404.1513(a).  SSA administers these benefit programs, but contracts with state agencies, such as \n2  California’s Disability Determination Service Division (DDSD) of the Department of Social \n3  Services, to make the disability determinations under standards established by SSA.  Id. \n4  § 404.1503(a). \n5  If the DDSD finds that an applicant’s own medical records are insufficient to render a \n6  decision, it can refer the applicant to a contracting doctor for a CE.   Id. §§ 404.1519, 416.919.  \n7  The doctor performing a CE must be licensed, have adequate training, experience, and equipment \n8  to perform the CE, and not otherwise be barred from participating in SSA programs.  Id.  \n9  §§ 404.1519g, 416.919g. \n10  Federal law provides the standard for determining whether someone is disabled:  “there \n11  must be medical signs and findings, established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory \n12  diagnostic techniques.”   42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(A) (emphasis added); see also id. \n13  § 1382c(a)(3)(D).  SSA bears the ultimate responsibility to establish “uniform standards which \n14  shall be applied at all levels of determination, review, and adjudication in determining whether \n15  individuals are under disabilities.”  Id. § 421(k)(1).  SSA regulations require that the \n16  determination that an individual is disabled be based on “evidence from acceptable medical \n17  sources.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a), 416.913(a).   \n18  Further, the Commissioner of Social Security is charged with prescribing procedures for \n19  monitoring both the CE referral processes used, and the product of doctors to whom cases are \n20  referred for CEs.  42 U.S.C. § 421(j)(3).  The resulting regulations explain SSA’s responsibility \n21  for monitoring and ensuring the adequacy of the CE process, including providers.  See 20 C.F.R. \n22  § 416.919t; see also id. § 416.919j (SSA will review allegations that a medical source designated \n23  to perform a CE “lacks objectivity.”); id. § 416.919s(g) (“The State agencies will cooperate with \n24  [SSA] when [it] conduct[s] monitoring activities in connection with their oversight management \n25  of their consultative examination programs.”).  \n26  Upon submission of a claim for benefits, the applicant first receives an initial \n27  determination of his or her claim.   Id. §§ 404.902, 416.1402.  If the applicant is denied, he or she \n28  may seek reconsideration.  Id. §§ 404.929, 416.1429.

If the applicant does not pursue a hearing, the \n3  initial denial becomes binding.  Id. §§ 404.921, 416.1421.  If the claimant requests a hearing, an \n4  ALJ is assigned to the case, and required to review all evidence in the record.  Id. §§ 404.929, \n5  416.1429.  The ALJ will then conduct a hearing and issue a written decision.  Id. §§ 404.944, \n6  404.953, 416.1444, 416.1453.  If the applicant is denied again, he or she has sixty days to request \n7  review from the Appeals Council.  Id. §§ 404.967-68, 416.1467-416.1468.  The Appeals Council \n8  will grant review if there has been an abuse of discretion or an error of law, or if the ALJ’s \n9  actions, findings, or conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.  Id. \n10  §§ 404.970(a), 416.1470(a).  The Appeals Council may decline to review the case, or remand it to \n11  an ALJ, or render a decision.  Id. §§ 404.967, 416.1467.  If the Appeals Council chooses not to \n12  review the case, then the ALJ’s decision becomes binding.  Id. §§ 404.955, 416.1455.  If the \n13  Appeals Council refuses to review the case, or issues an adverse decision, the applicant must then \n14  file a complaint in federal court. \n15  B.  SSA Denied Plaintiffs and Proposed Class Members a Fair Process. \n16  Plaintiffs and proposed class members all received a CE report from Dr. Chen, a medical \n17  doctor who was appointed by the Disability Determination Service for the State of California to \n18  be on its CE panel.  Over the years, applicants and their representatives filed numerous \n19  complaints against Dr. Chen with DDSD, explaining that he had not actually conducted full \n20  physical examinations as he stated in his reports.  See, e.g., Declaration of Andy Chu in Supp. of \n21  Pls’ Mot. for Class Certification (“Chu Decl.”) ¶¶ 5-15, Exs. A-B.)  Dr. Chen’s reports were also \n22  internally inconsistent, and ignored diagnoses, findings, and symptoms described in the \n23  applicants’ medical records, which he claimed to have reviewed.  (See, e.g., id.)  Ultimately, \n24  Dr. Chen was disqualified because of “uncorrected deficiencies regarding the quality of his \n25  examination reports and the thoroughness of his examinations, which were the subject of \n26  corrective action letters dated September 2, 2011, and October 14, 2013.”  (Decl. of Scott J. \n27  Borrowman in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (“Borrowman Decl.”) Ex. B at 1, ECF No. 27-3.)   \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  4 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 12 of 28\n \n1  SSA, however, never provided notice to Plaintiffs or proposed class members that \n2  Dr. Chen had been disqualified.  (See Declaration of Trinh Phan in Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for Class \n3  Certification (“Phan Decl.”) ¶ 17; Declaration of Nyla Moujaes in Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for Class \n4  Certification (“Moujaes Decl.”) ¶ 12; Declaration of Kyle Kitson in Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for Class \n5  Certification (“Kitson Decl.”) ¶ 14; see also Def.’s Answer to Class Action Compl. (“Answer”) \n6  ¶ 100, ECF No. 38 (“SSA admits that there is no regulation or rule directing SSA to provide \n7  applicants whose benefits have been denied or terminated notice that the consultative examiner in \n8  their case has been removed from the applicable CE panel.”).)  Nor did SSA reopen the \n9  applications that were tainted by Dr. Chen’s reports.  Moreover, SSA did not even inform the \n10  judges and staff who adjudicate disability claims that Dr. Chen was disqualified until over a year \n11  after his disqualification—and months after this lawsuit was filed.  (See Def.’s Reply in Supp. of \n12  Mot. to Dismiss (“Reply”) at 14:11-15:6, ECF No. 271; Borrowman Decl. Ex. B, see also id. \n13  Ex. A, ECF No. 27-2.) \n14  C.  SSA’s Post-Litigation Fix Is Inadequate. \n15  Despite the SSA’s belated admission that there were “uncorrected deficiencies regarding \n16  the quality of [Dr. Chen’s] examination reports” and questions about “the thoroughness of his \n17  examinations,” the SSA has failed to restore the integrity of the administrative process.  SSA \n18  admits that “reports from Dr. Chen generated prior to December 30, 2013 are treated as reports \n19  from acceptable medical sources under governing regulations.”  (Answer ¶ 6.)  SSA has \n20  instructed adjudicators to “consider” Dr. Chen’s removal from the panel in “determining the \n21  weight, if any, to which” Dr. Chen’s CE is entitled.  (Borrowman Decl. Ex. A at 2.)  In a \n22  March 16, 2015 memorandum to the Acting Chief Administrative Law Judge for San Francisco, \n23  the Chief Administrative Law Judge for SSA explains that Dr. Chen “was no longer authorized to \n24  perform consultative examinations (CEs) . . . premised in part on uncorrected deficiencies \n                                                 \n25 \n1 SSA’s own policies, which Plaintiffs claim are inadequate, place any responsibility on \nDDSD to inform adjudicators that a consultative examiner has been disqualified, and even then \n26 \nqualify that DDSD “may provide formal notice to the Office of Disability Adjudication and \nReview (ODAR) through the regional consultative examination coordinator (CEC).”  Social \n27 \nSecurity Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual (“HALLEX”) Ch. I-2-1-32A, \nhttp://ssa.gov/OP_Home/hallex/hallex.html (emphasis added). \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  5 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 13 of 28\n \n1  regarding the quality of his examination reports and the thoroughness of his examinations, which \n2  were the subject of corrective action letters dated September 2, 2011, and October 14, 2013.”  (Id. \n3  at 1.) \n4  The memorandum then instructs:  “When preparing the decision, the ALJ or senior \n5  attorney advisor must consider the weight to give Dr. Chen’s report in accordance with the \n6  regulations at 20 C.F.R. 404.1527 and 416.927.”  (Id. at 2.)  These cited regulations provide that \n7  “every medical opinion” received by an ALJ will be evaluated “[r]egardless of its source[.]”  \n8  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c), 416.927(c).  The regulations restrict an ALJ’s evaluation of the \n9  evidence to the face of the report, and other evidence in the record.  See id.  They do not allow an \n10  ALJ to disregard an unreliable report, or question its findings, based on the fact that the individual \n11  who prepared it has been disqualified.  See id. §§ 404.1527(b)-(c).   \n12  One month later, on April 15, 2015, the Division Chief Administrative Appeals Judge \n13  issued a similar memorandum to all employees of the Office of Appellate Operations providing \n14  instructions regarding the cases tainted by Dr. Chen’s reports that are pending appeal.  \n15  (Borrowman Decl. Ex. B at 1.)  The memorandum requires the Appeals Council (AC) to grant \n16  review of any case if it contains a CE report prepared by Dr. Chen after he was disqualified—a \n17  highly unlikely, and perhaps nonexistent, scenario.  (Id. at 2.)  But “in all other cases involving \n18  reports from Dr. Chen, the AC will rely on the record before it and adjudicate the issues in the \n19  claim on a case-by-case basis.”  (Id.)  The policy provides three examples of how the AC should \n20  proceed, but in each example Dr. Chen’s CE reports are still considered and weighed along with \n21  other medical evidence in the record (assuming there is any).  (Id.)   \n22  Accordingly, SSA has continued its agency-wide policy regarding Dr. Chen’s reports, and \n23  continues to violate its obligations under the Social Security Act to make disability \n24  determinations based upon medical signs and findings, established by medically acceptable \n25  clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.  Instead, it requires adjudicators to continue to \n26  consider Dr. Chen’s reports as medical evidence to resolve disability claims, even though SSA \n27  knows they are inadequate and based on incomplete examinations.   \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  6 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 14 of 28\n \n1  Further, SSA’s memoranda only offer directives for the cases currently pending at the \n2  hearing or appellate level.  They do nothing for the far larger number of cases of individuals \n3  whose claims are pending at earlier levels, or whose claims are no longer pending.2  Claimants \n4  impacted by Dr. Chen’s CE reports may not have pursued their administrative remedies after an \n5  initial denial or termination because they were never told they had grounds to reopen their case.  \n6  SSA requires those injured by Dr. Chen’s CE reports to both initiate and run an administrative \n7  obstacle course before they have any chance of relief.  They must somehow first learn about \n8  Dr. Chen’s disqualification, seek out counsel, become informed that their case can be reopened, \n9  reopen their case, and challenge Dr. Chen’s CE report.  This gauntlet is especially unfair given \n10  that claimants often lack the resources necessary to undertake such an ordeal.  (See Phan Decl. \n11  ¶¶ 22-23; Kitson Decl. ¶¶ 24-25; Moujaes Decl. ¶¶ 18-20; see also City of New York, 476 U.S. \n12  at 483 (district court “found that class members not only were denied the benefits they were \n13  seeking, but ‘[the] ordeal of having to go through the administrative appeal process may trigger a \n14  severe medical setback.’”)  And even if a claimant could clear all of these hurdles, the unreliable \n15  evidence from Dr. Chen remains part of the record—and SSA still requires all adjudicators to \n16  consider it.  SSA’s partial attempt at corrective action is plainly insufficient to repair the damage \n17  it has caused.  That is why Plaintiffs come to this Court for prospective relief that will provide a \n18  meaningful remedy for those whose administrative claims were tainted by Dr. Chen’s reports.    \n19  D.  Plaintiffs’ Claims \n20  By their complaint, Plaintiffs make four requests:  First, they request a declaration that \n21  SSA’s policies and practices violate the Social Security Act, its implementing regulations, and the \n22  Due Process clause of the United States Constitution.  Second, they ask that SSA be enjoined \n23  from relying on the reports of Dr. Chen.  Third, they request that their cases be reopened so that \n24 \n                                                 \n2 According to its most recent budget justification, SSA denied 68% of all initial Social \n25 \nSecurity and SSI disability determinations in fiscal year 2014, and only 40% of those denials \nwere appealed to the first level or reconsideration stage of the appeal process in the same year.  \n26 \nSee SSA FY 2016 Budget Justification at 143, Table 3.27-FY 2014 Workload Data Disability \nAppeals, http://www.ssa.gov/budget/FY16Files/2016FCJ.pdf.  Without reason to believe the \n27 \npopulation of claimants who received CE reports from Dr. Chen is significantly different than the \nnational average, the majority of putative class members did not reach the ALJ stage. \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  7 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 15 of 28\n \n1  they can receive a fair disability determination.  And fourth, they ask that SSA provide notice to \n2  claimants whose cases were tainted by a Dr. Chen report.  The requested relief is appropriate for \n3  the class as a whole because Plaintiffs and proposed class members suffered from the same \n4  wrong: their administrative process was tainted by consideration of a Dr. Chen report in resolving \n5  their disability claims.   \n6  E.  Procedural Background \n7  Plaintiffs filed their class action complaint (“Compl.”) on February 9, 2015.  (ECF No. 1.)  \n8  On April 20, 2015, Defendant sought to dismiss this action under Rule 12(b)(1).  (ECF No. 18.)  \n9  The Court denied that motion.  (ECF No. 36.)  It held that jurisdiction was proper and that Section \n10  405(g)’s exhaustion requirement was properly waived because (1) Plaintiffs alleged irreparable \n11  harm; (2) Plaintiffs’ claims for relief are collateral to any claim for benefits, as they challenge the \n12  SSA’s policy of considering Dr. Chen’s reports in resolving disability claims; and (3) it would be \n13  futile to require Plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies “[b]ecause Plaintiffs challenge \n14  an SSA-wide policy of continuing to use Dr. Chen’s reports in evaluating claimants,” and \n15  “Defendant has already stated the SSA’s intention to continue to consider Dr. Chen’s reports in \n16  appeals of disability denials or terminations.”  (Id. at 11-12.) \n17  IV.  LEGAL STANDARDS \n18  Plaintiffs must satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), as well \n19  as at least one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n20  131 S. Ct. 2541, 2548 (2011).  Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking certification must demonstrate \n21  that “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are \n22  questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative \n23  parties are typical of the claims of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \n24  adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2548.  \n25  Here, Plaintiffs must also show that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n26  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n27  declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n28  Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2548-49. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  8 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 16 of 28\n \n1  V.  CLASS DEFINITION \n2  Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of:  All persons whose SSI or SSDI benefits were either \n3  denied or terminated and for whom a consultative examination report was prepared by Dr. Frank \n4  Chen. \n5  VI.  ARGUMENT \n6  A.  Plaintiffs Satisfy All of Rule 23(a)’s Requirements. \n7  1.  The proposed class is sufficiently numerous. \n8  Plaintiffs satisfy the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) because SSA has admitted \n9  there are at least 325 claimants in the proposed class.  In its March 16, 2015 memorandum, SSA \n10  states:  “We have identified 325 pending cases at the hearing level with medical evidence from \n11  Dr. Chen.”  (Borrowman Decl. Ex. A at 2.)  In its April 15, 2015 memorandum, SSA identifies \n12  additional proposed class members:  “Some cases now pending at the Appeals Council (AC) level \n13  contain reports from Dr. Chen[.]”  (Id. Ex. B at 1.)  Accordingly, the proposed class certainly \n14  contains several hundred members.  By comparison, courts in the Ninth Circuit have found that \n15  classes of far fewer than 100 members are sufficiently numerous to render joinder impracticable.  \n16  See, e.g., Perez-Funez v. Dist. Dir., 611 F. Supp. 990, 995 (C.D. Cal. 1984) (“Classes consisting \n17  of 25 members have been held large enough to justify certification.”); James M. Wagstaffe et al., \n18  California Practice Guide: Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial § 10:261 (2015) (citing \n19  Ansari v. New York Univ., 179 F.R.D. 112, 114 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)). \n20  Plaintiffs also have the advantage of a “relaxed” numerosity standard because they seek \n21  only injunctive and declaratory relief.  Arnott v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Serv., 290 F.R.D. \n22  579, 586 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 22, 2012) (in an action for injunctive and declaratory relief, plaintiffs \n23  “may rely on [] reasonable inference[s] arising from plaintiffs’ other evidence that the number of \n24  unknown and future members of [the] proposed []class . . . is sufficient to make joinder \n25  impracticable”) (quoting Sueoka v. United States, 101 F. App’x 649, 653 (9th Cir. 2004)); see \n26  also Charlebois v. Angels Baseball, LP, No. SACV 10-0853 DOC (ANx), 2011 WL 2610122, \n27  at *9 (C.D. Cal. June 30, 2011) (noting that “numerosity requirements are often ‘relaxed’ when \n28  only injunctive or declaratory relief is sought”). \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  9 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 17 of 28\n \n1  While Plaintiffs do not know precisely how many individuals are in the proposed class, \n2  common sense dictates that it is large enough to satisfy the numerosity requirement.  See \n3  Sullivan v. Kelly Servs., 268 F.R.D. 356, 362 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (“[W]here ‘the exact size of the \n4  class is unknown, but general knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, the \n5  numerosity requirement is satisfied.’” (quoting 1 Alba Cone & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on \n6  Class Actions § 3.3 (4th ed. 2002))).  The 325 claimants whose cases are currently pending at the \n7  hearing level are a small minority of putative class members, as the majority of claimants do not \n8  reach the ALJ stage and Dr. Chen has been submitting CE reports for many years.  (See \n9  discussion supra Part III.C.; Second Decl. of Scott J. Borrowman in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, \n10  Ex. C at 12, ECF No. 28-1 (listing October 8, 2008 CE report from Dr. Chen).)  It can reasonably \n11  be inferred that the proposed class contains thousands of members.     \n12  2.  The SSA-wide policy raises questions of law and fact common to the \nclass.   \n13   \n14  Plaintiffs challenge the SSA-wide policy that has applied uniformly to each proposed \n15  class member: consideration of Dr. Chen’s reports in resolving disability claims.  A class bringing \n16  similar challenge to an allegedly unlawful SSA policy was certified in City of New York, \n17  including individuals who had been denied benefits or whose benefits were terminated pursuant \n18  to that policy.  476 U.S. at 475-76.  In both cases, the SSA policies provide the bases for \n19  commonality. \n20  As the Supreme Court has explained, “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate \n21  that the class members ‘have suffered the same injury,’” such that “all their claims can be \n22  productively litigated at once.”  Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (citation omitted).  The common \n23  questions must “generate common answers” that are “apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  \n24  Id. (citation omitted).  Commonality is therefore satisfied where the claims of all class members \n25  “depend upon a common contention . . . of such a nature that it is capable of classwide \n26  resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \n27  central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id.  The commonality requirement \n28  has “been construed permissively,” and “[a]ll questions of fact and law need not be common to \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  10 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 18 of 28\n \n1  satisfy the rule.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998); see also \n2  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1122 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that “common” does not mean \n3  “complete congruence” (citation omitted)).  In its Order denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss, \n4  this Court confirmed “the existence of an SSA-wide policy regarding Dr. Chen, authorizing \n5  adjudicators to continue to ‘consider’ his CE reports following his removal from the CE panel.”  \n6  (ECF No. 36 at 9.)   \n7  This case contains numerous common issues of fact and law stemming from SSA’s \n8  consideration of Dr. Chen’s reports that will drive the resolution of this case.  While the \n9  circumstances of individual applicants’ disability claims will vary, they were all subjected to the \n10  same tainted process:  unreliable reports from Dr. Chen were submitted into evidence in their \n11  cases and SSA required adjudicators to consider the reports.  Additionally, SSA did not provide \n12  putative class members with a copy of their CE report prior to their hearing, or notice that \n13  Dr. Chen had been disqualified.  (See Kitson Decl. ¶¶ 14, 25; Moujaes Decl. ¶¶ 12, 20; Phan \n14  Decl. ¶ 17.)  In fact, SSA “admits that there is no regulation or rule directing SSA to provide \n15  applicants whose benefits have been denied or terminated notice that the consultative examiner in \n16  their case has been removed from the applicable CE panel.”  (Answer ¶ 100; see also Reply at 1 \n17  (explaining such policy “is its ordinary administrative process for disability determinations”).)  \n18  Courts have held that such processes are sufficient to show commonality under Rule 23(a).  See, \n19  e.g., Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014) (common agency policies and practices \n20  can be the “glue” required to bring common constitutional claims on behalf of a class of prisoners \n21  with individualized medical needs); Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1046 (9th Cir. 1998) \n22  (differences among class members regarding merits of individual cases were “simply insufficient \n23  to defeat the propriety of class certification”); Doe v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 48 F. \n24  Supp. 2d 1233, 1241 (C.D. Cal. 1999) (“[C]ommonality exists if plaintiffs share a common harm \n25  or violation of their rights, even if individualized facts supporting the alleged harm or violation \n26  diverge.”). \n27  Plaintiffs’ challenges to the constitutionality of SSA’s policies and procedures also \n28  support certification of the class.  Courts have found class certification is particularly well-suited \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  11 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 19 of 28\n \n1  in such cases.  See La Duke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th Cir. 1985) (case challenging \n2  constitutionality of INS procedure “[p]lainly” raised common questions of law and fact).  In \n3  language that applies nearly verbatim here, the Supreme Court in Yamasaki found class relief to \n4  be “peculiarly appropriate” because: \n5  The issues involved are common to the class as a whole.  They turn \non questions of law applicable in the same manner to each member \n6  of the class. . . . It is unlikely that the differences in the factual \nbackground of each claim will affect the outcome of the legal issue.  \n7  And the class-action device saves the resources of both the courts \nand the parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every \n8  social security beneficiary to be litigated in an economical fashion \nunder Rule 23.   \n9   \n10  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 (1979). \n11  Specifically, the SSA-wide policy requiring consideration of Dr. Chen’s reports raises two \n12  types of common questions.  First, there are common questions about the legality of admitting \n13  unreliable evidence from Dr. Chen into SSI and SSDI proceedings.  Specifically, these questions \n14  include whether requiring adjudicators to consider CE reports provided by a doctor who has been \n15  disqualified because of “uncorrected deficiencies regarding the quality of his examination reports \n16  and the thoroughness of his examinations” is a violation of (1) the Social Security Act, (2) its \n17  implementing regulations, or (3) the Due Process clause of the United States Constitution. \n18  Second, there are common questions regarding SSA’s legal obligations, including \n19  (1) whether the Due Process clause requires SSA to provide applicants with a copy of their CE \n20  report; (2) whether SSA had an obligation to monitor Dr. Chen; and (3) whether SSA failed to \n21  adequately monitor Dr. Chen.  \n22  None of these questions turn on the facts of any individual’s case.  The first set of \n23  common questions requires the Court to determine whether this unreliable evidence from \n24  Dr. Chen can legally be considered in a particular administrative proceeding.  In short, is the \n25  SSA-wide policy authorizing adjudicators to consider Dr. Chen’s CE reports legal?  All proposed \n26  class members were, or are, subject to this policy.  The second set of questions require the Court \n27  to determine SSA’s legal obligations, and also to consider SSA’s conduct in relation to \n28  Dr. Chen—not individual class members.   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  12 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 20 of 28\n \n1  In addition to being common, the bulk of these questions are case-dispositive.  For \n2  example, if SSA’s policy of requiring adjudicators to consider unreliable CE reports as medical \n3  evidence is illegal, then Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief.  Likewise, if SSA is not \n4  required to provide applicants with a copy of their CE report, or did not have an obligation to \n5  monitor Dr. Chen, then Plaintiffs will lose those claims.   \n6  3.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class. \n7  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class because Plaintiffs have been subjected to the \n8  same SSA-wide policy and have lost or been denied benefits as a result.  Rule 23(a)(3) requires \n9  that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties [be] typical of the claims or defenses of \n10  the class.” “‘The purpose of the typicality requirement is to assure that the interest of the named \n11  representative aligns with the interests of the class.’”  Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., LLC, \n12  617 F.3d 1168, 1175 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 \n13  (9th Cir. 1992)).  The typicality requirement is “‘satisfied when each class member’s claim arises \n14  from the same course of events, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove \n15  the defendant’s liability.’”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1124 (quoting Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d \n16  849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001)).  “Like the commonality requirement, the typicality requirement is \n17  ‘permissive’ and requires only that the representative’s claims are ‘reasonably co-extensive with \n18  those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.’”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d \n19  at 1124 (quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020).   \n20  In this case, Plaintiffs’ experiences exemplify the problem faced by all members of the \n21  proposed class:  each received a CE report from Dr. Chen and had their claim for benefits denied \n22  or terminated.  In August 2013, Dr. Chen examined Named Plaintiff Kevin Hart when he was \n23  scheduled for a continuing disability review (CDR) to determine if he continued to meet the \n24  disability standard.3  (Phan Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Ex. B.) \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n3 The CDR differs from the initial disability determination in that the first step is to \ndetermine if there has been any medical improvement since the date the applicant was first \n27 \ndetermined to be disabled.  If medical improvement related to ability to do work cannot be \nestablished, and no exceptions apply, benefits will continue.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1594. \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  13 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 21 of 28\n \n1  SSA relied on Dr. Chen’s evaluation in terminating Mr. Hart’s benefits on September 11, \n2  2013.  (Id. ¶ 11.)  Following a subsequent hearing, a Disability Hearing Officer concluded in a \n3  March 17, 2014 order that Mr. Hart’s physical impairments had “medically improved” and that he \n4  was “able to do medium work activities” based upon Dr. Chen’s report.  (Id. ¶¶ 14-15, Ex. E at \n5  6.)  The Officer found Dr. Chen’s report “more reasonable as consistent and supported by medical \n6  evidence” than another doctor’s report that had been submitted by Mr. Hart.  (Id. Ex. E at 9.)   \n7  Mr. Hart promptly filed a Request for Hearing by an ALJ, which occurred in March 2015.  \n8  Thanks to his counsel’s complaints about the existing Dr. Chen report, Mr. Hart received a new \n9  CE on May 6, 2015.  (See id. ¶ 18.)  The prior CE report by Dr. Chen, however, still remains in \n10  the administrative record of his claim and, in accordance with SSA regulations, it must be \n11  considered by the fact-finder.  See 20 C.F.R §§ 404.1527(c), 416.927(c) (“Regardless of its \n12  source, we will evaluate every medical opinion we receive.”). \n13  Like Mr. Hart, Named Plaintiffs Nina Silva-Collins and Lee Harris also received CEs \n14  from Dr. Chen and their claims for benefits were denied.  The cases of Ms. Silva-Collins and \n15  Mr. Harris also demonstrate how Dr. Chen’s CE reports have continued to be used in the \n16  adjudication of individual disability claims well after his disqualification.  Ms. Silva-Collins was \n17  examined by Dr. Chen on August 10, 2013, after the ALJ determined that a CE was necessary to \n18  evaluate her claims.  (Moujaes Decl. ¶ 10.)  Nevertheless, the ALJ who denied her claim for \n19  benefits following a supplemental hearing on January 8, 2014, “gave great weight to the opinion \n20  of consultative examiner Dr. Chen.”  (Id. ¶ 13, Ex. E at 12.)  Ms. Silva-Collins filed an appeal to \n21  SSA’s Appeals Council, which was recently granted.  (Id. ¶¶ 15-16.)  Her case was remanded to \n22  an ALJ for further proceedings; however, the Order requires the ALJ to consider all medical \n23  evidence in the record, and does not exclude the Dr. Chen CE.  (Id. ¶ 16, Ex. G.) \n24  Mr. Harris has been unfairly haunted by a similarly inadequate examination following his \n25  application for SSI.  He previously applied for benefits in 2011, and that application was denied \n26  by an ALJ on June 4, 2013, based on Dr. Chen’s CE report, which was assigned the “greatest \n27  weight” in the ALJ’s decision.  (Kitson Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. D at 10.)  Mr. Harris applied for SSI \n28  benefits again on November 14, 2013.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  Mr. Harris subsequently obtained not one but \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  14 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 22 of 28\n \n1  two subsequent examinations, one arranged by his counsel and another by a different SSA \n2  consultative examiner, both of which found Mr. Harris’ limitations to be much greater than those \n3  described by Dr. Chen.  (Id. ¶¶ 13, 15, Exs. E-F.)  Yet once again, Dr. Chen’s CE report was \n4  considered in the initial denial of Mr. Harris’ 2013 application.  The denial stated that Mr. \n5  Harris’s CE was “reviewed and compared with CE by Dr. Chen in prior file.”  (Id. ¶ 16, Ex. G \n6  at 7.)  Mr. Harris’s written request for a hearing was submitted on February 4, 2015, and is still \n7  pending.4  (Id. ¶ 20, Ex. J.) \n8  In this case, Plaintiffs and all members of the proposed class received a CE report from \n9  Dr. Chen, and have had benefits terminated or denied.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and \n10  injunctive relief are identical to that of the class, and their interest in enforcing their statutory and \n11  constitutional rights is identical to that of the class.  See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 686 (Rule 23(a)(3) \n12  requires only that the named plaintiffs’ “claims be ‘typical’ of the class, not that they be \n13  identically positioned to each other or to every class member.”).  In short, “named plaintiff’s \n14  claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly \n15  and adequately protected.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.  Differences in \n16  the underlying facts concerning class members’ disability status are not relevant because this \n17  lawsuit challenges only SSA-wide policies and practices in resolving disability claims.  It does \n18  not seek to adjudicate individual benefit amounts.  See, e.g., Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1124 (holding \n19  that variations in named plaintiff and class members’ entitlements to relief did not defeat \n20  typicality because such “particular characteristics . . . will not impact the resolution of this general \n21  statutory question”).  Thus, Rule 23’s typicality requirement is met. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n4 In her Answer to the Complaint, Defendant cites a 60-day statute of limitations defense \nagainst Mr. Harris’s claims.  (Answer at 20.)  That statute of limitations is inapplicable because \n26 \nPlaintiffs have alleged “good cause,” as well as “fraud or similar fault.”  (See Compl. ¶ 111; see \nalso, e.g., Chu Decl. ¶¶ 5-15, Exs. A-B.)  An SSDI or SSI disability determination may be \n27 \nreopened at any time in the case of fraud of similar fault.  (20 C.F.R. §§ 404.988, 416.1488.)  This \nissue is one that must be resolved after a full consideration of the merits. \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  15 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 23 of 28\n \n1  4.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nproposed class.   \n2   \n3  Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives as their claims are typical of the class, and \n4  therefore they have no conflicts with class members.  Rule 23(a)(4) is satisfied when the class \n5  representatives will “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  In order to make this \n6  determination, courts must resolve two questions: “(1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel \n7  have any conflicts of interest with other class members and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their \n8  counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class?”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  In \n9  considering the adequacy of plaintiffs’ counsel, the court must consider “(i) the work counsel has \n10  done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action; (ii) counsel’s experience in \n11  handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action; \n12  (iii) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) the resources that counsel will commit to \n13  representing the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  Plaintiffs and proposed class members share \n14  the same interest: to remedy the systemic consideration of Dr. Chen’s reports in resolving their \n15  disability claims.  Because SSA has instructed adjudicators to continue using reports by Dr. Chen, \n16  and those reports remain in the record for each claimant’s file, Plaintiffs and proposed class \n17  members are all interested in the relief requested by this action, including a declaration that \n18  SSA’s policies and practices violate the law, and that SSA be stopped from relying on the reports \n19  of Dr. Chen.  \n20  Plaintiffs are also adequate class representatives as they have retained experienced and \n21  committed counsel, namely Justice in Aging (formerly known as the National Senior Citizens \n22  Law Center), the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, and the law firm of Morrison & \n23  Foerster LLP, working pro bono.  Collectively, the two nonprofit organizations and the law firm, \n24  as well as the particular attorneys involved in the case, have extensive experience in public \n25  benefits law, the Social Security Act, and class-action litigation, as well as the necessary \n26  resources and commitment to pursue the interests of the class vigorously.  (Declaration of \n27  William Stern in Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for Class Certification ¶¶ 4-15; Declaration of Anna Rich in \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  16 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 24 of 28\n \n1  Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for Class Certification ¶¶ 2-7; Second Declaration of Trinh Phan in Supp. of \n2  Pls’ Mot. for Class Certification ¶¶ 2-7.) \n3  5.  The proposed class is ascertainable. \n4  “[C]ourts have implied an additional requirement under Rule 23(a): that the class to be \n5  certified be ascertainable.”  In re Google Inc. Gmail Litig., No. 13-MD-02430-LHK, 2014 WL \n6  1102660, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2014).  “‘A class definition should be precise, objective, and \n7  presently ascertainable,’ though ‘the class need not be so ascertainable that every potential \n8  member can be identified at the commencement of the action.’”  Gray v. Golden Gate Nat’l \n9  Recreational Area, 279 F.R.D. 501, 508 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (quoting O’Connor v. Boeing N. Am., \n10  Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998)).  In the Ninth Circuit, some courts have held that \n11  there is no ascertainability requirement in class actions brought under Rule 23(b)(2)5; while \n12  others have merely relaxed the requirement.  Compare In re Yahoo Mail Litig., No. 13-CV-\n13  04980, 2015 WL 3523908, at *16 (N.D. Cal. May 26, 2015) (holding that there is no \n14  ascertainability requirement in 23(b)(2) cases), with Berndt v. Cal. Dept. of Corrections, No. \n15  C. 03-3174 PJH, 2012 WL 950625, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 20, 2012) (finding the ascertainability \n16  requirement satisfied for a proposed (b)(2) class where the “class definition satisfactorily \n17  describes and reaches members of the class who may experience harm” as a result of the \n18  defendant’s conduct “at some point in the future”).  In any event, Plaintiffs’ proposed class is \n19  ascertainable because they have precisely defined the class based on objective criteria.  See In re \n20  High-Tech Emp. Antitrust Litig., 985 F. Supp. 2d 1167, 1182 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (explaining it must \n21  be possible to determine whether a class member is included “by reference to objective criteria”) \n22  (quoting 5 James W. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice, § 23.21[3] (Matthew Bender 3d ed.)).  \n23  Here, an individual is a member of the class if (1) they received a CE report from Dr. Chen, and \n24  (2) their benefits were denied or terminated.   \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n5 The First, Third, and Tenth Circuits have all concluded that the ascertainability \nrequirement is inappropriate for (b)(2) classes.  See Yaffe v. Powers, 454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st \n27 \nCir. 1972); Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 561 (3d Cir. 2015); Shook v. El Paso Cnty., 386 \nF.3d 963, 972 (10th Cir. 2004).  \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  17 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 25 of 28\n \n1  Moreover, SSA has implicitly conceded the ascertainability of the class proposed here:  it \n2  was able to identify 325 cases pending at the hearing level with medical evidence from Dr. Chen \n3  (Borrowman Decl. Ex. A at 2), and it must maintain records of those applicants who have been \n4  granted benefits, denied benefits, or had their benefits terminated, in order to administer the SSI \n5  and SSDI programs.  See 20 C.F.R. § 401 app. A(b)(2)(c).  Therefore, the class meets the \n6  ascertainability requirement, to the extent there is one. \n7  B.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \n8  This case meets the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(2) because SSA “has \n9  acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate \n10  final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  \n11  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998).  Plaintiffs present a prototypical Rule \n12  23(b)(2) class.  Rule 23(b)(2) “has been used extensively to challenge the enforcement and \n13  application of complex statutory schemes, such as suits involving the award or termination of \n14  benefits under the Social Security Act.”  7AA Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and \n15  Procedure § 1775, at 73 (3d ed. 2005).   \n16  SSA has acted on grounds that apply generally to the class proposed here:  it has acted \n17  based on an SSA-wide policy to consider CE reports from Dr. Chen to deny or terminate \n18  disability benefits.  And, as the Court explained in its denial of Defendant’s motion to dismiss, the \n19  memorandum issued by the SSA “only underscores the existence of an SSA-wide policy \n20  regarding Dr. Chen, authorizing adjudicators to continue to ‘consider’ his CE reports following \n21  his removal from the CE panel.”  (ECF No. 36 at 9.)  In this way, SSA has confirmed that \n22  adjudicators must continue to consider these unreliable reports in determining the disability \n23  claims of class members. \n24  Further, the relief requested by Plaintiffs is appropriate for the class as a whole.  In City of \n25  New York, the district court certified a strikingly similar class of individuals who had applied for \n26  or received Title II and/or Title XVI benefits, were found to have “a functional psychotic or \n27  functional nonpsychotic mental impairment which is severe (i.e., determined under 20 CFR \n28  § 404.1520(c) or § 416.930(c) to require evaluation under Appendix I of that Regulation), and \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  18 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 26 of 28\n \n1  whose applications for benefits have been denied or whose benefits have been or will be \n2  terminated, on the basis of defendants’ determination that such persons are capable of substantial \n3  gainful activity.”  476 U.S. at 475-76 n.6 (1986).  “As a remedy, the District Court ordered the \n4  Secretary to reopen the decisions denying or terminating benefits, and to redetermine eligibility. . \n5  . .  The District Court also ordered SSA to notify class members that their claims had been \n6  reopened, and to inform class members with an appeal pending before an ALJ that such claimants \n7  had the option of proceeding with their appeals upon the existing record rather than with the \n8  administrative reopening of their case.”  Id. at 476 & n.7.  Here, if Plaintiffs succeed on the \n9  merits, SSA will similarly be required to provide all class members with notice that their cases are \n10  being reopened.  SSA will now have to give claimants what they were previously denied—the \n11  determination of their disability claim through a fair process.   \n12  SSA may argue that some class members are not entitled to this relief because the \n13  outcome of their benefits determination was not entirely dependent on a CE report from Dr. Chen.  \n14  But “[t]he fact that some class members may have suffered no injury or different injuries from the \n15  challenged practice does not prevent the class from meeting the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).”  \n16  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125.   \n17  Indeed, this case is quite similar to Rodriguez, where plaintiffs sought injunctive and \n18  declaratory relief providing individual bond hearings to all members of the class.  Id. at 1111.  \n19  The defendants in Rodriguez argued that Rule 23(b)(2) certification was inappropriate because \n20  some class members may not be entitled to a bond hearing since they were properly subject to \n21  mandatory detention.  Id. at 1125.  The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that some of the class \n22  members may not have viable individual claims for relief, but that did “not alter the fact that \n23  relief from a single practice is requested by all class members.”  Id. at 1126.  It was sufficient that \n24  “all class members seek the exact same relief as a matter of statutory or, in the alternative, \n25  constitutional right.”  Id.  \n26  As in Rodriguez, the possibility that some class members may not have a viable claim for \n27  benefits does not preclude Rule 23(b)(2) certification.  Members of the class may differ in terms \n28  of the exact deficiencies of the exam that they received, or the degree of weight given to the CE \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  19 \nCASE NO. 3:15-CV-00623-JST \nsf-3554959  \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 40   Filed 08/06/15   Page 27 of 28\n \n1  report in the course of SSA’s denial or termination of their benefits, and the details of Plaintiffs’ \n2  financial or medical eligibility for benefits are, of course, highly individualized.  None of those \n3  differences matters for purposes of Rule 23, however, because Plaintiffs do not ask the Court to \n4  adjudicate the disability status of the entire class.  Rather, Plaintiffs challenge SSA-wide policies, \n5  which apply to Plaintiffs and all class members. \n6  VII.  CONCLUSION \n7  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the Plaintiffs’ motion, certify this matter \n8  as a class action as defined above, and appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel. \n9   \n \n10  Dated: August 6, 2015  WILLIAM L.

Eligibility for Group 1 Readjudication Relief:  A Class Member eligible for \nGroup 1 readjudication relief (“Group 1 claimant”) is someone who filed a claim for DIB or SSI \nor both; who, as part of that claim (or as part of a continuing disability review), underwent a \nconsultative examination performed by Dr. Frank Chen on or after January 1, 2011; who \nreceived an  Unfavorable decision or determination on that claim (or that continuing disability \nreview), or a Partially Favorable decision or determination on that claim, on or before the date of \nfinal approval; and who is not in current pay status.  A person who meets all of the requirements \nfor eligibility in the preceding sentence and who, prior to the date of final approval, appealed a \nfinal decision of the Commissioner to a federal court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g) or \n1383(c)(3), is a Group 1 claimant only if he or she (1) obtains a judicial remand of that case upon \nmotion by the claimant pursuant to Section 2.d; or (2) obtains relief from judgment in that case \nupon motion by the claimant pursuant to Section 2.d. \n2.  Group 1 Readjudication Relief – Readjudication Process:  A Group 1 claimant \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 9 of 83\n \nwill be entitled to readjudication of his or her Unfavorable decision or determination or Partially \nFavorable decision or determination, provided the Group 1 claimant requests this relief within \nthe time limit set forth in Section III.A.3 (for a Group 1 claimant who received an Unfavorable \ndecision or determination) or Section III.A.4 (for a Group 1 claimant who received a Partially \nFavorable decision or determination) below.  Any Group 1 claimant whose claim history reflects \nmore than one basis for Group 1 eligibility (i.e., satisfaction of all of the conditions in paragraph \nIII.A.1 above) and who proceeds through the readjudication process will proceed based on the \nearliest of his or her Group 1 eligibility bases.  The process for readjudication shall be as follows: \n(a) For Group 1 claimants whose Unfavorable decision or determination or \nPartially Favorable decision or determination was rendered at the DDS level: \nEvery Group 1 claimant who timely requests readjudication relief will be \nprovided with forms that will provide him or her with the opportunity to submit \nsupplemental evidence relating to the previously-adjudicated period within sixty \n(60) days from receipt of the forms.  The forms shall include a notification that a \nGroup 1 claimant may, prior to the expiration of the 60-day period, request a \nreasonable extension of time to submit supplemental evidence relating to the \npreviously-adjudicated period.  \nSuch supplemental information and evidence may include a re-articulation of the \nnature of the impairment(s) that existed during the previously-adjudicated period, \nthe disclosure of medical providers who have information that bears on the \nclaimant’s condition during the previously-adjudicated period, and medical or \nother evidence that relates to his or her condition during the previously-\nadjudicated period.  Within 60 days of the date of final approval, SSA will \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 10 of 83\n \nprovide to Class counsel a draft copy of the forms for submission of supplemental \nevidence.  Within three business days of receiving these draft forms, Class \ncounsel may provide comments on these draft forms to SSA, and SSA will \nconsider those comments in good faith, but shall have no obligation to implement \nor accept any comments or changes from Class counsel.  No Group 1 claimant \nwill be obliged to provide any additional information in order to receive a \nreadjudication, and if a Group 1 claimant elects not to provide additional \ninformation, he or she may proceed exclusively on the record that was created \nduring his or her previous application process, as further described in this \nparagraph.  Through its Disability Processing Unit, SSA will readjudicate claims \nby considering the original record and any supplemental information or evidence \nsubmitted by the Class Member that relates to the previously-adjudicated period, \nbut without considering the consultative examination report prepared by Dr. \nFrank Chen.  No consultative examinations will be purchased by SSA with \nrespect to readjudication of the previously-adjudicated period.  If, as a result of \nthe readjudication, the Class Member is found to have been disabled for the \npreviously-adjudicated period, or any portion thereof, he or she will receive the \nappropriate award of DIB or SSI back benefits or payments for the period of \ndisability demonstrated.  In addition, the Class Member, if found to have been \ndisabled for the previously-adjudicated period (but not for a closed period of \ndisability that is within the previously-adjudicated period and whose end date is \nbefore the end date of the previously-adjudicated period), may attempt to \ndemonstrate that his or her disability continues to exist into the period after the \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 11 of 83\n \npreviously-adjudicated period, up to and including the date of the readjudication, \nthrough use of supplemental evidence; as part of this process of demonstrating \ncontinuing disability into the period after the previously-adjudicated period, if \nSSA in its discretion deems it appropriate, SSA may order a consultative \nexamination to assess the Class Member’s current medical condition.  If the Class \nMember successfully demonstrates that his or her disability continues forward \nthrough the date of the readjudication decision, he or she will receive the \nappropriate award of back benefits or payments from the end of the previously-\nadjudicated period through the date of the readjudication decision, as well as \nappropriate current benefits or payments (subject to continuing disability reviews, \nreporting responsibilities, and any other rules and procedures generally applicable \nto recipients of DIB or SSI).  Likewise, if the Class Member successfully \ndemonstrates that his or her disability continues forward, but only for a closed \nperiod that does not continue forward to the date of the readjudication decision, he \nor she will receive the appropriate  award of back benefits or payments from the \nend of the previously-adjudicated period to the end of the closed period \ndemonstrated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Class \nMember has an application for DIB or SSI pending at the time of the \nreadjudication, SSA will not consider the period of disability alleged in that \npending application in the readjudication.   \n(b) For Group 1 claimants whose Unfavorable decision or determination or \nPartially Favorable decision or determination was rendered at the ALJ level: \nAs part of the readjudication process for Group 1 claimants who timely request \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 12 of 83\n \nreadjudication relief and whose pertinent Unfavorable decision or determination \nor Partially Favorable decision or determination was rendered at the ALJ level, \nSSA will review the prior ALJ decision to assess whether Dr. Frank Chen’s CE \nreport was explicitly afforded no weight in the analysis.  A new hearing will not \nbe scheduled for a claimant if Dr. Chen’s report was explicitly afforded no weight \nby the adjudicator, or if the decision was rendered for failure to meet non-medical \ncriteria; the readjudication process will conclude for such a claimant.  A hearing \nwill be scheduled for all other claimants.  For any claimant for whom a new \nhearing is scheduled, the claimant will be provided forms that provide him or her \nwith the opportunity to submit supplemental evidence relating to the claim of \ndisability that was previously denied.  Such supplemental information and \nevidence may include a re-articulation of the nature of the impairment(s) that \nexisted during the previously-adjudicated period, the disclosure of medical \nproviders who have information that bears on the claimant’s condition during the \npreviously-adjudicated period, and medical or other evidence that relates to his or \nher condition during the previously-adjudicated period.  Within 60 days of the \ndate of final approval, SSA will provide to Class counsel a draft copy of the forms \nfor submission of supplemental evidence.  Within three business days of receiving \nthese draft forms, Class counsel may provide comments on these draft forms to \nSSA, and SSA will consider those comments in good faith, but shall have no \nobligation to implement or accept any comments or changes from Class counsel.  \nNo Group 1 claimant will be obliged to provide any additional information in \norder to receive a new hearing, and if a Group 1 claimant elects not to provide \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 13 of 83\n \nadditional information, he or she may proceed on the record that was created \nduring his or her previous application process, as further described in this \nparagraph.  At the same time, should the Group 1 claimant allege that he or she is \ndisabled at the date of the readjudication, the claimant will be asked to provide \nupdated disability information pertaining to his or her current condition as well.  \nAt the hearing, the ALJ will have the discretion to take evidence for both the \npreviously-adjudicated period and the current period (or any part thereof), should \nthe ALJ find that most efficient in light of the circumstances of the case.  The ALJ \nalso may exercise his or her usual discretion to engage a vocational expert, \nprocure a CE report, engage a medical expert, and the like.  If, as a result of the \nreadjudication, the Group 1 claimant is found to have been disabled for the \npreviously-adjudicated period, or any portion thereof, he or she will receive the \nappropriate award of back benefits or payments for the period of disability \ndemonstrated.  If the Group 1 claimant is found to have been disabled for the \npreviously-adjudicated period (but not for a closed period of disability that is \nwithin the previously-adjudicated period and whose end date is before the end \ndate of the previously-adjudicated period), should that Group 1 claimant also \nsuccessfully demonstrate that his or her disability continues forward through the \ndate of the readjudication decision, he or she will receive the appropriate award of \nback benefits or payments from the end of the previously-adjudicated period \nthrough the date of the readjudication decision, as well as appropriate current \nbenefits or payments (subject to continuing disability reviews, reporting \nresponsibilities, and any other rules and procedures generally applicable to \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 14 of 83\n \nrecipients of DIB or SSI).  Likewise, if the Group 1 claimant successfully \ndemonstrates that his or her disability continues forward, but only for a closed \nperiod that does not continue forward to the date of the readjudication decision, he \nor she will receive the appropriate  award of back benefits or payments from the \nend of the previously-adjudicated period to the end of the closed period \ndemonstrated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Class \nMember has an application for DIB or SSI pending at the time of the \nreadjudication, SSA will not consider the period of disability alleged in that \npending application in the readjudication. \n(c)  For Group 1 claimants who requested review of the ALJ’s decision by the \nAppeals Council or for whom the Appeals Council took review on its own \nmotion: As part of the readjudication process for Group 1 claimants who timely \nrequest readjudication relief and whose pertinent Unfavorable decision or \ndetermination or Partially Favorable decision or determination was rendered at the \nAppeals Council level, or who requested Appeals Council review of an \nUnfavorable decision or determination or Partially favorable decision or \ndetermination rendered at the ALJ level, SSA will review the Unfavorable \ndecision or determination or Partially Favorable decision or determination to \nassess whether Dr. Frank Chen’s CE report was explicitly afforded no weight in \nthe analysis.  A new ALJ hearing will not be scheduled for a claimant if Dr. \nChen’s report was explicitly afforded no weight by the adjudicator, or if the \ndecision was rendered for failure to meet non-medical criteria; and the \nreadjudication process will conclude for such a claimant.  The Appeals Council  \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 15 of 83\n \nwill issue an Order of Remand to the ALJ, and a new hearing will be scheduled, \nfor all other claimants.  For any claimant for whom a new hearing is scheduled, \nthe claimant will be provided forms that provide him or her with the opportunity \nto submit supplemental evidence relating to the claim of disability that was \npreviously denied.  Such supplemental information and evidence may include a \nre-articulation of the nature of the impairment(s) that existed during the \npreviously-adjudicated period, the disclosure of medical providers who have \ninformation that bears on the claimant’s condition during the previously-\nadjudicated period, and medical or other evidence that relates to his or her \ncondition during the previously-adjudicated period.  Within 60 days of the date of \nfinal approval, SSA will provide to Class counsel a draft copy of the forms for \nsubmission of supplemental evidence.  Within three business days of receiving \nthese draft forms, Class counsel may provide comments on these draft forms to \nSSA, and SSA will consider those comments in good faith, but shall have no \nobligation to implement or accept any comments or changes from Class counsel.  \nNo Group 1 claimant will be obliged to provide any additional information in \norder to receive a new hearing, and if a Group 1 claimant elects not to provide \nadditional information, he or she may proceed on the record that was created \nduring his or her previous application process, as further described in this \nparagraph.  At the same time, should the Group 1 claimant allege that he or she is \ndisabled at the date of the readjudication, the claimant will be asked to provide \nupdated disability information pertaining to his or her current condition as well.  \nAt the hearing, the ALJ will have the discretion to take evidence for both the \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 16 of 83\n \npreviously-adjudicated period and the current period (or any part thereof), should \nthe ALJ find that most efficient in light of the circumstances of the case.  The ALJ \nalso may exercise his or her usual discretion to engage a vocational expert, \nprocure a CE report, engage a medical expert, and the like.  If, as a result of the \nreadjudication, the Group 1 claimant is found to have been disabled for the \npreviously-adjudicated period, or any portion thereof, he or she will receive the \nappropriate award of back benefits or payments for the period of disability \ndemonstrated.  If the Group 1 claimant is found to have been disabled for the \npreviously-adjudicated period (but not for a closed period of disability that is \nwithin the previously-adjudicated period and whose end date is before the end \ndate of the previously-adjudicated period), should that Group 1 claimant also \nsuccessfully demonstrate that his or her disability continues forward through the \ndate of the readjudication decision, he or she will receive the appropriate award of \nback benefits or payments from the end of the previously-adjudicated period \nthrough the date of the readjudication decision, as well as appropriate current \nbenefits or payments (subject to continuing disability reviews, reporting \nresponsibilities, and any other rules and procedures generally applicable to \nrecipients of DIB or SSI).  Likewise, if the Group 1 claimant successfully \ndemonstrates that his or her disability continues forward, but only for a closed \nperiod that does not continue forward to the date of the readjudication decision, he \nor she will receive the appropriate  award of back benefits or payments from the \nend of the previously-adjudicated period to the end of the closed period \ndemonstrated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Class \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 17 of 83\n \nMember has an application for DIB or SSI pending at the time of the \nreadjudication, SSA will not consider the period of disability alleged in that \npending application in the readjudication. \n(d)  For claimants who appealed a final decision of the Commissioner to federal \ncourt: Certain claimants appealed their final decisions to a federal court pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g) or 1383(c)(3) prior to the date of final approval.  For any \nsuch claimant, assuming he or she otherwise meets the eligibility criteria to be a \nGroup 1 claimant, as set forth in Section III.A.1, and submits a timely request for \nreadjudication pursuant to Section III.A.3 or Section III.A.4 below, as applicable, \nSSA agrees to take the procedural steps described below upon request from the \nclaimant or his or her counsel in the federal court case to counsel for SSA in the \nfederal court case.  For a claimant whose case is pending in federal court at the \ntime of the request, SSA will file a notice of non-opposition in response to a \nmotion for remand to the agency for further proceedings so long as (1) the motion \nis filed within ninety (90) days of the date the claimant receives Notice A or \nNotice A2 (as described below); (2) the basis for that motion is that the agency \nhas entered into this Settlement Agreement under which the claimant is \npotentially eligible for relief, and that the claimant wishes to be eligible for \nconsideration for such relief; and (3) SSA determines that Dr. Chen’s report was \nafforded weight (i.e., more than no weight) in the ALJ’s analysis.  For a claimant \nwhose case has resulted in a final judgment affirming the final decision of the \nCommissioner at the time of the request, the claimant may file a motion for relief \nfrom judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).  So long as \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 18 of 83\n \n(1) the Rule 60(b)(6) motion is filed within ninety (90) days of the date the \nclaimant receives Notice A or Notice A2 (as described below); and (2) the basis \nfor that motion is that the agency has entered into this Settlement Agreement \nunder which the claimant is potentially eligible for relief, and that the claimant \nwishes to be eligible for consideration for such relief; and (3) SSA determines that \nDr. Chen’s report was afforded weight (i.e., more than no weight) in the ALJ’s \nanalysis, SSA will file a notice of non-opposition in response to such a motion.  \nSSA reserves its right to oppose any motion for remand or motion for relief from \njudgment on any basis other than the agency’s entering into this Settlement \nAgreement.  \nAll completed Group 1 readjudication decisions or determinations that address the claimant’s \ndisability on the merits will be subject to administrative or judicial review under the statutes, \nrules, and regulations applicable to determinations and decisions and set forth at 42 U.S.C. §§ \n405(g) and 1383(c)(3), and 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.929, 404.967, 416.1429, and 416.1467, with the \nexception that there will be no “reconsideration” step.  Therefore, Group 1 claimants who receive \na readjudication of a claim previously adjudicated at the DDS level may proceed to request an \nALJ hearing without first seeking reconsideration of that readjudicated claim.   \n3.  Group 1 Readjudication Relief -- Time to Request Readjudication:  Except for \nGroup 1 claimants seeking readjudication of a Partially Favorable decision or determination \n(discussed separately in Section III.A.4 below), in order to receive a readjudication, a Group 1 \nclaimant must affirmatively request readjudication within ninety (90) days after the date he or \nshe receives the notice informing him or her of his or her right to relief (described herein as \n“Notice A”), using the procedures described in that notice, unless the claimant demonstrates to \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 19 of 83\n \nthe satisfaction of SSA that this ninety (90)-day deadline was missed for good cause.  The \nDisability Processing Unit will evaluate good cause using the standards set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ \n404.911 and 416.1411.  Determinations that good cause is lacking are final and not subject to \nfurther review. \n4.  Special Procedures for Group 1 claimants who received Partially Favorable \ndecisions or determinations:  In order to receive a readjudication, a Group 1 claimant seeking \nreadjudication of a Partially Favorable decision or determination must affirmatively request \nreadjudication within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date he or she receives the notice \ninforming him or her of his or her right to relief (described herein as “Notice A2”), using the \nprocedures described in that notice, unless the claimant demonstrates to the satisfaction of SSA \nthat this 180-day deadline was missed for good cause.  The Disability Processing Unit will \nevaluate good cause using the standards set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911 and 416.1411.  \nDeterminations that good cause is lacking are final and not subject to further review. \n5.  Notice of Group 1 Readjudication Relief for Group1 Claimants With \nUnfavorable decisions or determinations (“Notice A”):  Attached to this Settlement Agreement \nis Notice A (Exhibit A), the language of which has been agreed to by the Parties.  Personal \ninformation such as a Class Member’s address, appropriate field office, and similar information, \nwill be included by SSA in Notice A.  Contact information for Class counsel will be included by \nClass counsel where indicated in Notice A.  SSA shall send Notice A by first class mail with a \ndesignated post office box as the return address within ninety (90) days after the date on which \nthe Settlement becomes effective to the last known address in the “case information” section of \nthe electronic claim file, or the pertinent disability application in the paper claim file, for each \nClass Member identified by SSA as potentially eligible for Group 1 readjudication relief who \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 20 of 83\n \nreceived an Unfavorable decision or determination.  Prior to sending Notice A, SSA shall match \nthe addresses in its records for all Class Members who are not in current pay status against the \nU.S.P.S. National Change of Address (NCOA) file.  Notice A will be sent in standard print \nformat and, in addition, will be sent in Spanish to those individuals whose claims files indicate \nan existing record of receiving Notices in that language, and will be sent to individuals who have \nan existing election for a special notice option for the blind or visually impaired in the Special \nNotice Options format elected, pursuant to POMS NL 01001.001, 01001.010.  Notice A, in \naddition to describing the potential relief available and the necessary steps to be taken, will also \nadvise the Class Member of his or her right to retain a representative to assist with his or her \nclaim.  If mail is returned as undeliverable, SSA will query the Supplemental Security \nRecord/Master Beneficiary Record, and, if necessary, contact the field office to request any \nupdated address information the field office may have.  If an updated address for the Class \nMember is found, SSA will mail another copy of Notice A to the Class Member at the updated \naddress found.  SSA shall bear the cost of printing and mailing copies of Notice A.  Where, sixty \n(60) days after the mailing of Notice A, SSA records indicate that a Class Member to whom \nNotice A was mailed and not returned as undeliverable has not returned the required form that \naccompanied Notice A, SSA will mail a letter indicating that a time-sensitive form had been \nmailed to them 60 days earlier, summarizing information from the correspondence, and including \na copy of Notice A.  Receipt of, or a request for, another copy of Notice A shall not operate to \ntoll or otherwise enlarge the time for return of the claim form. \n6.  Notice of Group 1 Readjudication Relief for Group1 Claimants With Partially \nFavorable decisions or determinations (“Notice A2”):  Attached to this Settlement Agreement \nis Notice A2 (Exhibit A2), the language of which has been agreed to by the Parties.  Personal \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 21 of 83\n \ninformation such as a Class Member’s address, appropriate field office, and similar information, \nwill be included by SSA in Notice A2.  Contact information for Class counsel will be included \nby Class counsel where indicated in Notice A2.  SSA shall send Notice A2 by first class mail \nwith a designated post office box as the return address within ninety (90) days after the date on \nwhich the Settlement becomes effective to: the last known address in the “case information” \nsection of the electronic claim file, or the pertinent disability application in the paper claim file, \nfor each Class Member identified by SSA as potentially eligible for Group 1 readjudication relief \nwho received a Partially Favorable decision or determination.  If so elected by a Class Member \non the Representative Notification Request Form, SSA will also mail a copy of Notice A2 to the \nrepresentative, if any, who assisted the Class Member on the prior claim, so long as that \nrepresentative has not been disqualified from appearing in Social Security matters.  Prior to \nsending Notice A2, SSA shall match the addresses in its records for all Class Members who are \nnot in current pay status against the U.S.P.S. National Change of Address (NCOA) file.  Notice \nA2 will be sent in standard print format and, in addition, will be sent in Spanish to those \nindividuals whose claims files indicate an existing record of receiving Notices in that language, \nand will be sent to individuals who have an existing election for a special notice option for the \nblind or visually impaired in the Special Notice Options format elected, pursuant to POMS NL \n01001.001, 01001.010.  Notice A2, in addition to describing the potential relief available and the \nnecessary steps to be taken, will also advise the Class Member of his or her right to retain a \nrepresentative to assist with his or her claim.  Because readjudication of a Partially Favorable \ndecision or determination has the potential to result in an unfavorable determination or decision \non the claim, Notice A2 will apprise the claimant of such risk, advise the claimant to carefully \nevaluate such risk before deciding to return the claim form seeking a readjudication, and advise \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 22 of 83\n \nthe claimant that he or she may wish to consult with counsel.  If mail is returned as \nundeliverable, SSA will query the Supplemental Security Record/Master Beneficiary Record, \nand if necessary, contact the field office to request any updated address information the field \noffice may have.  If an updated address for the Class Member is found, SSA will mail another \ncopy of Notice A2 to the Class Member at the updated address found.  SSA shall bear the cost of \nprinting and mailing copies of Notice A2.  Receipt of, or a request for, another copy of Notice \nA2 shall not operate to toll or otherwise enlarge the time for return of the claim form. \nB.  Group 2 Relief for Class Members With Closed Claims Who Were Examined \nby Dr. Chen Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010 \n1.  Eligibility for Group 2 Relief:  A Class Member eligible for Group 2 relief \n(“Group 2 claimant”) is someone who filed a claim for DIB or SSI or both; who, as part of that \nclaim (or as part of a continuing disability review), underwent a consultative examination \nperformed by Dr. Frank Chen between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010; who received an \nUnfavorable decision or determination on that claim (or that continuing disability review), or a \nPartially Favorable decision or determination on that claim, on or before the date of final \napproval; and who is not in current pay status.  A person who meets all of the requirements for \neligibility in the preceding sentence and who, prior to the date of final approval, appealed a final \ndecision of the Commissioner to a federal court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g) or 1383(c)(3), is \na Group 2 claimant only if he or she (1) obtains a judicial remand of that case upon motion by \nthe claimant pursuant to Section 2.c; or (2) obtains relief from judgment in that case upon motion \nby the claimant pursuant to Section 2.c.  Class Members who are eligible to be Group 1 \nclaimants are ineligible to be Group 2 claimants.   \n2.   Group 2 Relief – Application for DIB or SSI and Lookback Assessment \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 23 of 83\n \nProcess:  A Group 2 claimant will be invited to apply for SSI or DIB or both by timely returning \na claim form and indicating on the form whether he or she is currently disabled.  A Group 2 \nclaimant who (1) timely returns the claim form; (2) indicates on the form that he or she is \ncurrently disabled; (3) files a current application for DIB and/or SSI within the time limit set \nforth in paragraph III.B.3 below; and (4) is found to be disabled upon adjudication of his or her \ncurrent application, will then become entitled to a Lookback Assessment for the previously-\nadjudicated period.  The process for Group 2 relief shall be as follows: \na)  Application for DIB and/or SSI Based on Present Disability Status: Each \nGroup 2 claimant may file an application for DIB or SSI or both.  This application \nshall be filed and pursued in the normal manner, using SSA’s online system if for \nDIB only, or telephone systems or by appearing at the appropriate SSA field \noffice, and completing the forms that normally accompany or follow such \napplications.  SSA will adjudicate these claims pursuant to the rules and \nregulations  ordinarily applicable to disability claims.  Decisions or \ndeterminations on these claims will be subject to administrative or judicial review \nunder the rules and regulations applicable to determinations and decisions and set \nforth at 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g) and 1383(c)(3), and 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.902, 404.907, \n404.929, 404.967, 416.1402, 416.1407, 416.1429, and 416.1467.   \nb)  Lookback Assessment: For a Group 2 claimant who (1) timely returns the claim \nform; (2) indicates on the form that he or she is currently disabled and intends to \nfile a current application for DIB and/or SSI; (3) files a current application for \nDIB and/or SSI within the time limit set forth in paragraph III.B.3 below; and (4) \nreceives a favorable or partially favorable decision on his or her current \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 24 of 83\n \napplication, SSA’s Disability Processing Unit will conduct a Lookback \nAssessment.  No Lookback Assessment will be initiated until after any agency \nreview of the current application has been completed and the decision or \ndetermination has been effectuated.  In conducting the Lookback Assessments, \nSSA will evaluate the record, but without considering the consultative \nexamination report prepared by Dr. Chen, and will request that the individual \nsubmit any additional evidence relevant to the Lookback Assessment Period \n(defined below).  Additional consultative examinations will not be ordered as part \nof this Lookback Assessment.  The Lookback Assessment will address a \n“Lookback Assessment Period.” The Lookback Assessment Period means either \n(1) in the case of an eligible Group 2 claimant who received an Unfavorable \ndecision or determination, the previously-adjudicated period, which begins on the \nalleged onset date and ends on the date of the Unfavorable decision or \ndetermination; (2) in the case of an eligible Group 2 claimant who received a \nPartially Favorable decision or determination, the previously-adjudicated period, \nwhich begins on the alleged onset date and ends on the date of the Partially \nFavorable decision or determination; or (3) in the case of a termination of benefits \nor payments upon a continuing disability review in which the individual was \nexamined by Dr. Chen, the previously-adjudicated period, which begins on the \ndate the individual is determined to have medically improved and the date of the \nfinal decision or determination finding that disability has ended.  A Lookback \nAssessment is a readjudication of the Lookback Assessment Period; if, as a result \nof a Lookback Assessment, a Group 2 claimant is found to have been disabled for \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 25 of 83\n \nthe Lookback Assessment Period, or any portion thereof, he or she will receive \nthe appropriate award of back benefits or payments for the period of disability \ndemonstrated.  A Lookback Assessment does not include a readjudication of any \nperiod between the date of the Unfavorable decision or determination or the \nPartially Favorable decision or determination, as the case may be, and the date as \nof which benefits or payments are awarded on the Group 2 claimant’s current \napplication; back benefits or payments for this intervening period are not \navailable as part of the Lookback Assessment.  The determination made by the \nDisability Processing Unit on a Lookback Assessment will be final and not \nsubject to further administrative or judicial review.   \nc)  For claimants who appealed a final decision of the Commissioner to federal \ncourt: Certain claimants appealed their final decisions to a federal court pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g) or 1383(c)(3) prior to the date of final approval.  For any \nsuch claimant, assuming he or she otherwise meets the eligibility criteria to be a \nGroup 2 claimant, as set forth in Section III.B.2, and submits a timely request for \nrelief pursuant to Section III.B.3 or Section III.B.4, as applicable, SSA agrees to \ntake the procedural steps described below upon (1) request from the claimant or \nhis or her counsel in the federal court case to counsel for SSA in the federal court \ncase; and (2) confirmation that the Group 2 claimant has been awarded benefits \non the current application and the decision or determination has been effectuated.  \nFor a claimant whose case is pending in federal court at the time of the request, \nSSA will file a notice of non-opposition in response to a motion for remand to the \nagency for further proceedings so long as (1) the motion is filed within ninety (90) \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 26 of 83\n \ndays of the date on which the Group 2 claimant receives his or her award letter on \nhis or her current application; (2) the basis for that motion is that the agency has \nentered into this Settlement Agreement under which the claimant is potentially \neligible for relief, and that the claimant wishes to be eligible for consideration for \nsuch relief; and (3) SSA determines that Dr. Chen’s report was afforded weight \n(i.e., more than no weight) in the ALJ’s analysis.  For a claimant whose case has \nresulted in a final judgment affirming the final decision of the Commissioner at \nthe time of the request, the claimant may file a motion for relief from judgment \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).  So long as (1) the Rule \n60(b)(6) motion is filed within ninety (90) days of the date on which the Group 2 \nclaimant receives his or her award letter on his or her current application;  (2) the \nbasis for that motion is that the agency has entered into this Settlement Agreement \nunder which the claimant is potentially eligible for relief, and that the claimant \nwishes to be eligible for consideration for such relief; and (3) SSA determines that \nDr. Chen’s report was afforded weight (i.e., more than no weight) in the ALJ’s \nanalysis, SSA will file a notice of non-opposition in response to such a motion.  \nSSA reserves its right to oppose any motion for remand or motion for relief from \njudgment on any basis other than the agency’s entering into this Settlement \nAgreement. \n3.  Group 2 Relief -- Time to Submit Claim Form and to File Current Application:  \nExcept for Group 2 claimants with a Partially Favorable decision or determination (discussed \nseparately in Section III.B.4 below), in order to be eligible for Group 2 relief, a Group 2 claimant \nmust: (1) return the claim form that will be included with Notice B within ninety (90) days of the \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 27 of 83\n \ndate the claimant receives Notice B (as described below), and indicate on that form that he or she \nis currently disabled; and (2) file a new application for DIB or SSI or both, within one hundred \neighty (180) days of the date the claimant receives Notice B (as described below).  Return of a \nproperly completed  claim form that conforms to the requirements of POMS GN 00204.010B \nwill establish a protective filing date for the filing of the Group 2 claimant’s new application as \nof the date SSA receives the form, but does not operate to toll the time for filing the new DIB or \nSSI application.  The claimant may also demonstrate, to the satisfaction of SSA, that the ninety \n(90)-day deadline for returning the claim form was missed for good cause.  SSA will evaluate \ngood cause using the standards set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911 and 416.1411.  Determinations \nthat good cause is lacking are final and not subject to further review. \n4.  Special Procedures for Group 2 claimants with Partially Favorable \ndeterminations or decisions:  In order for a Group 2 claimant who has received a Partially \nFavorable determination or decision to be eligible for Group 2 relief, he or she must: (1) return \nthe claim form that will be included with Notice B2 (as described below) within one hundred \neighty (180) days of the date the claimant receives Notice B2, and indicate on that form that he \nor she is currently disabled; and (2) file a new application for DIB or SSI or both, within one \nhundred eighty (180) days of the date the claimant receives Notice B2.  Return of a properly \ncompleted  claim form that conforms to the requirements of POMS GN 00204.010B will \nestablish a protective filing date for the filing of the Group 2 claimant’s new application as of the \ndate SSA receives the form, but does not operate to toll the time for filing the new DIB or SSI \napplication.  The claimant may also demonstrate, to the satisfaction of SSA, that the one hundred \neighty (180)-day deadline for returning the claim form was missed for good cause.  SSA will \nevaluate good cause using the standards set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911 and 416.1411.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 28 of 83\n \nDeterminations that good cause is lacking are final and not subject to further review. \n5.  Notice of Group 2 Relief for Group 2 Claimants With Unfavorable decisions or \ndeterminations (“Notice B”):  Attached to this Settlement Agreement is Notice B (Exhibit B), \nthe language of which has been agreed to by the Parties.  Personal information such as a Class \nMember’s address, appropriate field office, and similar information, will be included by SSA in \nNotice B.  Contact information for Class counsel will be included by Class counsel where \nindicated in Notice B.  SSA shall send Notice B by first class mail with a designated post office \nbox as the return address within ninety (90) days after the date on which the Settlement becomes \neffective to the last known address in the “case information” section of the electronic claim file, \nor the pertinent disability application in the paper claim file, for each Class Member identified by \nSSA as potentially eligible for Group 2 relief.  Prior to sending Notice B, SSA shall match the \naddresses in its records for all Class Members who are not in current pay status against the \nU.S.P.S. National Change of Address (NCOA) file.  Notice B will be sent in standard print \nformat and, in addition, will be sent in Spanish to those individuals whose claims files indicate \nan existing record of receiving Notices in that language, and will be sent to individuals who have \nan existing election for a special notice option for the blind or visually impaired in the Special \nNotice Options format elected, pursuant to POMS NL 01001.001, 01001.010.  Notice B, in \naddition to describing the potential relief available and the necessary steps to be taken, will also \nadvise the Class Member of his or her right to retain a representative to assist with his or her \nclaim.  If mail is returned as undeliverable, SSA will query the Supplemental Security \nRecord/Master Beneficiary Record, and if necessary, contact the field office to request any \nupdated address information the field office may have.  If an updated address for the Class \nMember is found, SSA will mail another copy of Notice B to the Class Member at the updated \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 29 of 83\n \naddress found.  SSA shall bear the cost of printing and mailing copies of Notice B.  Where, sixty \n(60) days after the mailing of Notice B, SSA records indicate that a Class Member to whom \nNotice B was mailed and not returned as undeliverable has not returned the required form that \naccompanied Notice B, SSA will mail a letter indicating that a time-sensitive form had been \nmailed to them 60 days earlier, summarizing information from the correspondence, and including \na copy of Notice B.  Receipt of, or a request for, another copy of the form shall not operate to toll \nor otherwise enlarge the time for return of the claim form. \n6.  Notice of Group 2 Readjudication Relief for Group 2 Claimants With Partially \nFavorable decisions or determinations (“Notice B2”):  Attached to this Settlement Agreement \nis Notice B2 (Exhibit B2), the language of which has been agreed to by the Parties.  Personal \ninformation such as a Class Member’s address, appropriate field office, and similar information, \nwill be included by SSA in Notice B2.  Contact information for Class counsel will be included \nby Class counsel where indicated in Notice B2.  SSA shall send Notice B2 by first class mail \nwith a designated post office box as the return address within ninety (90) days after the date on \nwhich the Settlement becomes effective to: the last known address in the “case information” \nsection of the electronic claim file, or the pertinent disability application in the paper claim file, \nfor each Class Member identified by SSA as potentially eligible for Group 2 readjudication \nrelief.  If so elected by a Class Member on the Representative Notification Request Form, SSA \nwill also mail a copy of Notice B2 to the representative, if any, who assisted the Class Member \non the prior claim, so long as that representative has not been disqualified from appearing in \nSocial Security matters.  Prior to sending Notice B2, SSA shall match the addresses in its records \nfor all Class Members who are not in current pay status against the U.S.P.S. National Change of \nAddress (NCOA) file.  Notice B2 will be sent in standard print format and, in addition, will be \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 30 of 83\n \nsent in Spanish to those individuals whose claims files indicate an existing record of receiving \nNotices in that language, and will be sent to individuals who have an existing election for a \nspecial notice option for the blind or visually impaired in the Special Notice Options format \nelected, pursuant to POMS NL 01001.001, 01001.010.  Notice B2, in addition to describing the \npotential relief available and the necessary steps to be taken, will also advise the Class Member \nof his or her right to retain a representative to assist with his or her claim.  Because performing a \nLookback Assessment of a Partially Favorable decision or determination has the potential to \nresult in an unfavorable determination or decision on the claim, Notice B2 will apprise the \nclaimant of such risk, advise the claimant to carefully evaluate such risk before deciding to return \nthe claim form seeking a readjudication, and advise the claimant that he or she may wish to \nconsult with counsel.  If mail is returned as undeliverable, SSA will query the Supplemental \nSecurity Record/Master Beneficiary Record, and if necessary, contact the field office to request \nany updated address information the field office may have.  If an updated address for the Class \nMember is found, SSA will mail another copy of Notice B2 to the Class Member at the updated \naddress found.  SSA shall bear the cost of printing and mailing copies of Notice B2.  Receipt of, \nor a request for, another copy of Notice B2 shall not operate to toll or otherwise enlarge the time \nfor return of the claim form. \nC.  Group 3 Relief for Class Members With Open Claims  \n1.  Eligibility for Group 3 Relief:  A Class Member eligible for Group 3 relief \n(“Group 3 claimant”) is someone (1) who filed a claim for DIB or SSI or both; (2) who, as part \nof that claim (or as part of a continuing disability review), underwent a consultative examination \nperformed by Dr. Frank Chen; and (3) who received an unfavorable decision or determination on \nthat claim (or that continuing disability review), or a partially favorable decision or \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 31 of 83\n \ndetermination on that claim, that, as of the date of final approval of this Settlement Agreement, is \nnot a final decision or determination.   \n2.  Group 3 Relief – Processing Guidance:  Within twenty (20) days of the date on \nwhich the Settlement becomes effective, SSA will issue processing guidance to ALJs who will \nbe handling claims of Group 3 claimants.  The processing guidance will require ALJs to advise \nany Group 3 claimant who, at the time the guidance is issued, has not yet proceeded to hearing \nduring his or her upcoming hearing that: (1) he or she received a CE from Dr. Chen, a provider \nwho was later removed from the California DDS panel for reasons that include uncorrected \ndeficiencies regarding the quality of his examination reports and the thoroughness of his \nexaminations; (2) he or she has the option to have the report from Dr. Chen excluded from \nconsideration in the forthcoming adjudication; and (3) the adjudicator has the discretion to \nconsider whether ordering an additional CE is appropriate.  The parties have negotiated and \napproved the language of this processing guidance to be issued to ALJs.  SSA will provide Class \ncounsel with a copy of this processing guidance.  Group 3 claimants who have already proceeded \nto hearing but who have not received a decision from the ALJ at the time the processing \nguidance is issued will be provided the option to have Dr. Chen’s report excluded from \nconsideration in the forthcoming adjudication.  Claims of Group 3 claimants that are pending at \nthe Appeals Council level at the date of final approval or thereafter will be remanded to an ALJ \nfor processing in accordance with the processing guidance issued to ALJs unless the Appeals \nCouncil determines that the ALJ explicitly afforded no weight to Dr. Chen’s report in the \nanalysis, or excluded Dr. Chen’s report from consideration (in which case the request for review \nwill be processed pursuant to otherwise applicable regulations).  \n3.  Notice of Group 3 Relief (“Notice C”):  Attached to this Settlement Agreement is \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 32 of 83\n \nNotice C (Exhibit C), the language of which has been agreed to by the Parties.  Personal \ninformation such as a Class Member’s address, appropriate field office, and similar information, \nwill be included by SSA in Notice C.  Contact information for Class counsel will be included by \nClass counsel where indicated in Notice C.  No later than twenty (20) days after the date on \nwhich the settlement becomes effective, SSA shall send Notice C to the claimant; and the Class \nMember’s appointed representative, if any.  Notice C will be sent in accordance with HALLEX \nI-2-3-45 (for Spanish-language notices) and HALLEX I-2-3-50 (for visual impairments).  SSA \nshall bear the cost of printing and mailing copies of Notice C.   \nIV.  PROSPECTIVE RELIEF \nA.  Study of the California DDS CE Provider Processes and Recommendations for \nImprovement:   SSA will, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Settlement becomes \neffective, begin a study of the processes through which it monitors the California DDS’s \nengagement, review, and retention of empaneled consultative examiners.  The goal of the \nstudy, which SSA will complete within one (1) year and thirty (30) days of the date on which \nthe Settlement becomes effective, will be to identify, for potential implementation, \nmechanisms to improve monitoring of the California DDS’s engagement, review, and retention \nof empaneled consultative examiners.  SSA, through its counsel, will provide written notice to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel upon (1) the study’s commencement; and (2) its conclusion.  Nothing in this \nparagraph precludes SSA from conducting further study of the California DDS beyond the \ntimeframes set forth above. \nB.  Notice to Adjudicators in Open Claims of Disqualified California CE Providers:  \nWithin thirty (30) days after completion of the study referenced in Section IV.A above, SSA \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 33 of 83\n \nshall issue a document identifying processes for notifying adjudicators when an individual \nconsultative examination provider previously engaged by the California DDS has been \ndisqualified for conduct determined to undermine the reliability of that provider’s previously-\nissued reports.  The document will also identify, to the extent feasible, appropriate, and \nconsistent with applicable law, processes for securing new consultative examinations and/or  \nproviding notice of such consultative examination provider’s disqualification to claimants, and \ntheir authorized representative, if any, with administratively open claims pending at the ALJ or \nAppeals Council levels and who were examined by the disqualified provider for that \nadministratively open claim. \nV.  PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \nA.  Preliminary approval:  Following its execution, the Parties shall promptly present \nthe Settlement Agreement to the Court with a request that the Court preliminarily approve the \nSettlement Agreement.  The Parties shall further request that upon any preliminary approval \nthe Court schedule a hearing pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n(hereinafter referred to as the “Fairness Hearing”), after which the Court will determine \nwhether to grant its final approval of the Settlement Agreement.   \nB.  Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement and Fairness Hearing:  Attached to \nthis Settlement Agreement is a Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement and Fairness \nHearing (“Notice D”) (Exhibit D), the language of which has been agreed to by the Parties.  \nNotice D contains a brief description of the claims advanced by Plaintiffs and SSA’s denial of \nliability for such claims, a summary of the terms of the proposed settlement, and information \nregarding the upcoming Fairness Hearing.  Information related to the Fairness Hearing date \nand time, postmark deadline for written comments, and the manner of submission of certain \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 34 of 83\n \ncomments will be included in Notice D where indicated following any preliminary approval by \nthe Court.   \nC.  Publication: Within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Court \npreliminarily approves the Settlement Agreement, SSA shall deliver for publication a copy of \nNotice D, or such other notice as ordered by the Court, to the following five (5) newspapers \nwith instructions that the Notice be published at least once per week for three (3) successive \nweeks as a one-eighth (1/8th)  page advertisement: San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco \nExaminer, San Luis Obispo Tribune, Monterey Herald, and Santa Cruz Sentinel.  Class counsel \nwill also disseminate notice of the settlement to the organizations listed in Exhibit E.  The \nparties agree that such publication of Notice D, if approved by the Court, shall satisfy the \nnotice requirement of Rule 23(c)(2) and Rule 23(e)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nVI.  ENFORCEMENT \nA.  Any party, including any member of the Class, may seek enforcement of this \nAgreement (the “Enforcement Parties”).  The parties agree that the process set forth in this \nSection is the exclusive process for remedying alleged violations of this Agreement.  The \nparties further agree that no other litigation action in the Case, including but not limited to the \nfiling of any motions or pleadings, may be taken except as set forth in this Section VI.  While \nenforcement may be sought against SSA in accordance with this Section VI by a Class \nMember without being represented by Class counsel in such an enforcement effort, such a \nClass Member must first state in writing to SSA that he or she requested representation from \nClass counsel, but that Class counsel has declined to represent the Class Member in the \nenforcement effort.  SSA shall have no obligation to respond to any enforcement effort until \nsuch time as the Class Member either secures representation by Class counsel or provides the \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 35 of 83\n \nrequired certification in writing to SSA.   \nB.  In the event that one of the Enforcement Parties (the “Noticing  Party”) believes \nthat the other Enforcement Party (the “Receiving Party”) has not complied with a provision of \nthis Agreement, the Noticing Party shall serve on the Receiving Party a written notice \ndescribing with particularity the alleged failure to comply.  This notice must (1) identify the \nspecific provision(s) of this Agreement that have allegedly been violated; (2) describe the \nerrors or omissions upon which the alleged violation is based; and (3) identify reasonable \nmeasures that the Receiving Party can take to cure the alleged violation.  The notice must be \nserved promptly, and no later than sixty (60) days after the Noticing Party becomes aware, or \nreasonably should have become aware, of a potential violation.  \nC.  Within sixty (60) days of the Responding Party’s receipt of a written notice from \nthe Noticing Party, counsel for the Enforcement Parties will meet and confer in an effort to \naddress the alleged failure to comply.  Upon request, the Noticing Party will provide to the \nReceiving Party any reasonably available, non-privileged information that supports the alleged \nfailure to comply.   \nD.  If the Enforcement Parties are unable to resolve the alleged failure to comply, and \nthe Noticing Party still wishes to pursue a remedy for the alleged violation of the Agreement, \nthe Noticing Party shall request, no sooner than sixty (60) days after the date on which the \nnotice was served, and no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date on which the \nnotice was served, a mediation conference with Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James.  Should \nJudge James cease to be a Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court, Northern \nDistrict of California, the Noticing Party shall request a mediation conference with the \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 36 of 83\n \nMagistrate Judge then assigned to this case, or, if no Magistrate Judge is assigned at that time, \nwith whichever Magistrate Judge is assigned by the Clerk of Court following a request for such \nassignment by the Noticing Party.  The Noticing Party shall serve its request for mediation \nconference on the Receiving Party at the time the request is made.  The Receiving Party may at \nany time prior to sixty (60) days after the date on which the notice was served take the \nmeasures to cure the alleged violation that were identified by the Noticing Party in its notice, in \nwhich case no request for mediation conference may be made. \nE.  No later than sixty (60) days after the date of the mediation conference, the \nNoticing Party may request judicial enforcement of the provision that has allegedly been \nviolated by filing a motion for enforcement with the Court, which motion shall be subject to \nthe Local Civil Rules for the Northern District of California.  The Receiving Party may at any \ntime prior to thirty (30) days after the date of the mediation conference take the measures to \ncure the alleged violation that were identified by the Noticing Party in its notice, in which case \nno request for judicial enforcement may be brought.  The Parties agree that in the event the \nCourt decides any motion for enforcement in favor of the Noticing Party, the remedy shall be \nlimited to requiring the Receiving Party to comply with whichever provision(s) of Section III \nor Section IV the Court finds there has been a lack of compliance.  The Enforcement Parties \nagree that any such motion for enforcement shall not include a request that any party or non-\nparty to the Case be held in contempt. \n \nVII.  DISMISSAL AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nPlaintiffs agree to the dismissal of the Case with prejudice under Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 41(a)(1) and 23(e), subject to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  In accordance \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 79-1   Filed 11/08/16   Page 37 of 83\n \nwith the terms of this Settlement Agreement, immediately following, and no later than the day \nafter, final approval of the Settlement Agreement the Parties will file a joint stipulation of \ndismissal with prejudice that incorporates the terms of this agreement, and which shall be \neffective three years after the date of final approval and which will be subject to the enforcement \nprovisions set forth in Section VI of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the effective date of the \njoint dismissal, all other terms of this Settlement Agreement shall be effective upon the date on \nwhich the Settlement becomes effective.  A copy of the joint stipulation of dismissal to be filed is \nattached as Exhibit F to this Agreement.  SSA agrees to pay the amount of $490,000 to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel as attorneys’ fees and costs incurred through the date of final approval and for \nany implementation and enforcement of this settlement following the date of final approval.  \nThis payment shall be the full and final payment for any and all claims for attorneys’ fees, costs, \nor expenses.  The amount of $490,000 that SSA has agreed to pay to Plaintiffs’ counsel shall be \npaid to Justice in Aging and the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, with the payment of \nthat amount to be allocated between those two organizations in a manner to be communicated by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel to counsel for Defendant at a later date.  Plaintiffs’ counsel Morrison & \nFoerster has agreed to waive any attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with this \naction.  The parties negotiated this settlement term only after all of the substantive settlement \nterms were resolved. \nVIII.

Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Chen’s reports were flawed \nin important ways and subject to complaints, and that he is no longer allowed to perform these \nexaminations. \n \nThis notice is about an earlier disability application that we denied, or a decision to stop \ndisability benefits that you were receiving.  Our records show that Dr. Chen examined you \nbetween January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, as part of this claim, and you received an \nunfavorable decision.   \n \nAs a result of this settlement, you may be eligible to have us review your prior claim.  For some \npeople, the review may result in current benefits and back benefits.  If you want us to review \nyour prior claim, you must return the enclosed “Hart v. Colvin Request Form” within 90 days. \nThis review may or may not change the prior decision.   \n \nHow We Will Review Claims \n \nThere are four steps to the review process under the settlement: \n \n1)   You must request review of your claim by returning the attached request form within 90 \ndays of the date you receive this notice.  We will assume you received this notice within \n5 days of the date printed on the top of this notice unless you show you did not get it \nwithin the 5-day period.   \n2)   We will determine whether you are eligible for review under the settlement.  If we \ndecide you are not eligible for review, we will send you a notice telling you why. \n  \n\nBNC  A  2 \n  CCaassee  33::1155--ccvv--0000662233--JJSSTT      DDooccuummeenntt  7769--11      FFiilleedd  0191//1098//1166      PPaaggee  4488  ooff  8833\n3)   If we decide you are eligible for review, we will ask you to complete updated disability \nforms and give us any additional medical evidence that relates to your prior claim.  Then, \nwe will review your prior claim without considering Dr. Chen’s report. \n4)  We will make a decision about your claim.  This could mean you will receive current \nbenefits and back benefits. \n \nIf you do not respond within 90 days, you may lose your chance for review.  We will not \nconsider a late request unless we find you had a good reason for not responding in time. \n \nIf You Have Or Want A Representative \n \nYou can have a friend, representative, or someone else help you.  It is important to understand \nthat if you had an appointed representative at the time of your prior claim, that representation \nended after the decision on your claim became final.  This means that if you want a \nrepresentative to help you, you must appoint one by giving us a notice of appointment.   \n \nIf you want more information about having, getting, or appointing a representative, you may call \nour toll-free number or contact a Social Security office as shown below.  You may also visit our \nwebsite at www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10075.pdf to read “Your Right to Representation” \n(Publication No. 05-10075).

Colvin lawsuit, No. 3:15-cv-623-JST (N.D.

Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Chen’s reports were flawed \nin important ways and subject to complaints, and that he is no longer allowed to perform these \nexaminations. \n \nThis notice is about an earlier disability application where you received a partially favorable \ndecision.  This means that you received benefits but only for part of the period covered by your \napplication.  Our records show that Dr. Chen examined you between January 1, 2011, and \nDecember 31, 2013, as part of this claim.   \n \nAs a result of this settlement, you may be eligible to have us review your prior claim.

We will not \nconsider a late request unless we find you had a good reason for not responding in time. \n \nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING VERY CAREFULLY \n \nYour prior decision was partially favorable, and you may have received benefits as a result.  If \nyou ask us to review your prior claim, it is possible that the result will be the same.  It is possible \nthat the result will be better, which means we may decide you are entitled to benefits for the \nentire period covered by your application.  It is also possible that the decision will be \nunfavorable, which means we will decide you were not entitled to the benefits you already \nreceived.   \n \nBefore you return the request form asking us to review your claim, you should carefully consider \nthe possible risks.  Even if you do not want us to review your prior claim and choose not to \nreturn the request form, you may file a new claim if you believe you are disabled.   \n \nIf you are currently receiving benefits, the review of your claim may result in additional benefits.  \nHowever, we may decide that you were not disabled.  If we review your claim and make an \nunfavorable decision finding that you were not disabled, it would mean that you were not entitled \nto the benefits you already received.  In that case, benefits you may be currently receiving would \nno longer be paid.  Also, if we decide that you were not disabled, it could mean that you were \noverpaid, and it is possible that you may have to pay us back some or all of the benefits we paid \nyou. \n \nYou may also wish to ask questions of the attorneys who represent the members of the plaintiff \nclass who brought the Hart v. Colvin lawsuit.  For this purpose, we have provided contact \ninformation for the attorneys who represent the members of the class in this notice.     \n \nIf You Have Or Want A Representative \n \nYou can have a friend, representative, or someone else help you.

Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Chen’s reports were flawed in important \nways and subject to complaints, and that he is no longer allowed to perform these examinations. \n \nThis notice is about an earlier disability application that we denied, or a decision to stop \ndisability benefits that you were receiving.  Our records show that Dr. Chen examined you \nbetween January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2010, as part of this claim, and you received an \nunfavorable decision.   \n \nAs a result of this settlement, you may be eligible to have us review your prior claim.

This review may or may not change the \nprior decision.   \n \nHow We Will Review Claims \n \nThere are five steps to the review process for your claim under the settlement: \n \n1)   You must request review of your claim by returning the enclosed “Hart v.

We will assume you \nreceived this notice within 5 days of the date printed on the top of this notice unless you \nshow you did not receive it within the 5-day period.   \n2)  You must file a new application for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or \nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) (or both) within 180 days of the date you receive \nthis notice. \nSOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION  BALTIMORE, MD  21235-0001 \n \n\nBNC  B  2 \n  CCaassee  33::1155--ccvv--0000662233--JJSSTT      DDooccuummeenntt  7769--11      FFiilleedd  0191//1098//1166      PPaaggee  5599  ooff  8833\n3)   If we find you are disabled and eligible for benefits on your new claim, then we will \ndetermine whether you are eligible for review of your prior claim under the settlement.

If we find you are not disabled on your new claim, then you are \nnot eligible for review of your prior claim. \n4)   If we decide you are eligible for review of your prior claim, we will ask you to complete \nupdated disability forms and give us any additional medical evidence that relates to your \nprior claim. \n5)  If we decide you are eligible for review of your prior claim, we will review your claim \nwithout considering Dr. Chen’s report.  If we find that you were disabled during the \nperiod covered by your prior claim or any part of that time, you may receive back \nbenefits for the period of disability established.  If we find that you were not disabled \nduring the period covered by your prior claim, you will not receive back benefits.  That \ndecision will be final and not subject to appeal. \n \nIf you do not respond within 90 days, you may lose your chance for review.

Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Chen’s reports were flawed in important \nways and subject to complaints, and that he is no longer allowed to perform these examinations. \n \nThis notice is about your pending disability application or continuing disability review.  Our \nrecords show that between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2013, Dr. Chen examined you as \npart of this claim.  Our records also show that your claim is either currently pending before an \nadministrative law judge (ALJ) or has recently been decided by an ALJ, and you either still have \ntime to appeal or have already done so.     \n \nAs a result of this settlement, you are entitled to choose whether we consider this doctor’s report \nwhen we decide your claim.  You should return the attached request form indicating your \npreference within 30 days of the date you receive it, or, if your hearing has already been \nscheduled, no fewer than 5 days before the hearing date.  \n \nIf You Have Not Had A Hearing Before An ALJ Yet \n \nIf you have not had your ALJ hearing yet, you should return the attached request form within 30 \ndays of the date you receive this notice and tell us whether you want us to consider or ignore Dr. \nChen’s report.  If your hearing has already been scheduled, you should return the attached \nrequest form no fewer than 5 days before the hearing date.  If you tell us that you do not want us \nto consider Dr. Chen’s report, then we will make a decision on your claim by considering all of \nthe evidence in your record except for his report.  The ALJ may also decide to send you for a \nnew consultative examination with another doctor.  If the ALJ decides that a new consultative \nexamination report is necessary, you will receive a separate notice explaining this. \n \n \n\nBNC  C \nCCaassee  33::1155--ccvv--0000662233--JJSSTT      DDooccuummeenntt  7769--11      FFiilleedd  0191//1098//1166      PPaaggee  7711  ooff  8833\nIf you want to have the ALJ consider Dr. Chen’s report, then the ALJ will consider it.  The ALJ \nwill also consider the reasons Dr. Chen was removed from the consultative examination panel.  \nThe ALJ should also consider whether ordering an additional consultative examination is \nappropriate.  The ALJ should explain the weight, if any, he or she gives to Dr. Chen’s report.       \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \nAt your hearing, the ALJ will remind you of your right to decide whether we consider the \ndoctor’s report when we decide your claim. \n \nIf You Have Had A Hearing But Have Not Received An ALJ Decision Yet \n \nIf you have already had an ALJ hearing but have not gotten a decision yet, you should return the \nattached request form within 30 days of the date you receive this notice.  Please tell us whether \nyou want us to consider or ignore Dr. Chen’s report when deciding your claim.  If you tell us that \nyou do not want us to consider his report, then we will make a decision on your claim by \nconsidering all of the evidence in your record except for that report.  The ALJ may also decide to \nsend you for a new consultative examination with another doctor.  If the ALJ decides that a new \nconsultative examination is necessary, you will receive a separate notice explaining this. \n \nIf You Have Already Received An ALJ Decision \n \nIf you have already received an ALJ decision on your claim, you should request that the Appeals \nCouncil review the ALJ’s decision if you have not already done so.  Remember that you have 60 \ndays from the date you receive the ALJ’s decision to request Appeals Council review.  However, \nyour time to request review can be extended if we find that you had good cause for not meeting \nthis deadline. \n \nIf you did not have a chance to state your preference to the ALJ, once you request review, or if \nyou have already requested review of the ALJ’s decision, the Appeals Council will consider \nwhether Dr. Chen’s report was given any weight in the ALJ’s decision.  If the Appeals Council \ndetermines that the ALJ explicitly gave no weight to Dr. Chen’s report, the Appeals Council will \nnot grant review on the basis of the doctor’s report (but may grant review on other bases, if \nwarranted).   \n \nIf the Appeals Council determines that the ALJ did not make it clear that no weight was given to \nDr. Chen’s report when deciding your claim, the Appeals Council will grant your request for \nreview and send your claim to an ALJ for further consideration.  If the Appeals Council sends \nyour claim back to an ALJ, you will have the option to choose whether the ALJ considers Dr. \nChen’s report when deciding your claim on remand.  \n \nIf You Have Or Want A Representative \n \nYou can have a friend, representative, or someone else help you with your claim.  If a \nrepresentative is helping you with your claim, you should contact that person to let him or her \nknow about this notice.  You may want to do so before returning the request form.  If we have \ninformation about your representative in your file, we will send him or her a copy of this notice.  \nThat person’s name will also be listed below.     \n \nIf you want more information about having, getting, or appointing a representative, you may call \nour toll-free number or contact a Social Security office as shown below.

You must \nhave received an unfavorable or partially favorable decision on that claim, or had a \ncontinuing disability review where benefits were stopped.   \nWhat Is The Lawsuit About? \nThe lawsuit is called Hart v. Colvin, Civil Action No. 3:15-cv-00623-JST (N.D. Cal.). \nPlaintiffs said that the Social Security Administration should not have relied on \nconsultative examination reports from this doctor when it denied disability claims or \nstopped benefits.  This doctor examined people in the San Francisco Bay Area and in \ncounties along the coast as far south as San Luis Obispo. Social Security denies any \nwrongdoing or liability.  The parties are proposing to settle the lawsuit. \nWhat Are The Terms Of The Proposed Settlement? \nThis notice contains only a summary of the proposed settlement.  To fully understand \nthe proposed settlement, you should read the entire proposed settlement agreement. \nThe proposed settlement provides that: \n1.   If you are a class member with a closed disability claim or continuing disability \nreview who was examined by this doctor between January 1, 2011, and \nDecember 31, 2013, you can have your case decided again if you were not \nreceiving disability benefits as of October 14, 2015.  If Social Security finds you \ndisabled for the period covered by your original application or continuing \ndisability review, Social Security will also give you the opportunity to show that \nyou continued to be disabled after that period \n2.   If you are a class member with a closed disability claim or continuing disability \nreview who was examined by this doctor between January 1, 2007, and \nDecember 31, 2010, and you are not receiving disability benefits as of October \n14, 2015, you may be able to have your case decided again.  To have your \ncase decided again, you first have to file a new claim for current disability \nbenefits and be found disabled and eligible for current disability benefits.  If \nSocial Security decides your case again and finds you disabled for the period \ncovered by your original application or continuing disability review, Social \nSecurity will not give you the opportunity to show that you continued to be \ndisabled after that period. You will not be able to appeal the decision that Social \nSecurity makes when it looks at your case again. \n3.   If you are a class member with an open claim or continuing disability review, \nyou will have the chance to decide whether you want Social Security to \nconsider this doctor’s report when it makes a decision on your open claim or \nreview. \n4.   Social Security will also provide other relief.  This relief includes guidance to \nadministrative law judges and Appeals Council adjudicators and a study of the \nprocesses through which Social Security monitors the California Disability \n\nCCaassee  33::1155--ccvv--0000662233--JJSSTT      DDooccuummeenntt  7769--11      FFiilleedd  0191//1098//1166      PPaaggee  7766  ooff  8833\nDetermination Service Division’s consultative examination provider process, \nunder which Dr. Chen performed examinations. \n5.   As part of the settlement, lead counsel for class plaintiffs—Morrison & Foerster \nLLP—agreed to waive its fees for work done on this lawsuit. Morrison & \nFoerster’s co-counsel, not-for-profit organizations called Justice in Aging and \nLegal Aid Society of San Mateo County, will be paid fees of $490,000 for work \ndone on this lawsuit.  \nHow Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The Proposed Settlement? \nThe Court will need to approve the proposed settlement before it becomes final. \nThe Court will hold a public hearing, called a fairness hearing, to decide if the proposed \nsettlement is fair. The hearing will be held on _____, 2016 at ________, at the following \naddress: \nUnited States District Court \nNorthern District of California \n450 Golden Gate Avenue, Courtroom 9 -19th Floor   \nSan Francisco, California 94102. \n \nWhat Can You Do If You Object To The Settlement Or Have Other Comments? \nIF YOU AGREE with the proposed settlement, you do not have to do anything at this \ntime. You have the right to attend the fairness hearing, at the time and place above. \nIF YOU DISAGREE OR HAVE COMMENTS about the proposed settlement, you can \nwrite to the Court or ask to speak at the hearing. You must do this by writing to the Clerk \nof the Court, at the following mailing address: \nClerk of the Court \nUnited States District Court \nNorthern District of California \n450 Golden Gate Avenue \nSan Francisco, California 94102. \nYour written comments or request to speak at the fairness hearing must be postmarked \nby _____, 2016. \nThe Clerk will provide copies of written comments to the lawyers who brought the \nlawsuit and to the Social Security Administration by filing the comments on the court's \nelectronic case filing system. \nIf your comments involve your health or other personal information, and you do not want \nsuch information to be widely available, you may ask the Court to keep your comments \nprivate by requesting that they be filed “_____________.” If you do this, your comments \nwill be seen by the Court, the lawyers, and the Social Security Administration, but will \nnot be made public. If you do not say that you want your comments “_____________,” \nthey may be read, downloaded, or distributed by anyone who has an account with the \nCourt’s public access service.

The Court previously granted a motion for preliminary approval of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  agreement, ECF No. 81, and held a Final Approval Hearing on March 16, 2017.  The Court will \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  grant the motion. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  I.  BACKGROUND \nS d nr\nee 17  A.  The Parties and Claims \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  This case is a putative class action against Defendant Carolyn W. Colvin, Acting \n19  Commissioner of Social Security, involving the evidence used by Administrative Law Judges \n20  (“ALJs”) in deciding whether individuals are entitled to receive disability benefits.  The evidence \n21  ALJs consider when making a disability benefits determination includes consultative evaluations \n22  (“CEs”) performed by medical professionals under the guidelines provided by the Social Security \n23  Administration (“SSA”).  SSA regulations require adjudicators to “always consider” CE reports \n24  along with the other evidence when making a disability determination.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(b), \n25  416.927(b).  The SSA contracts with state agencies, including the Disability Determination Service \n26  Division of the California Department of Social Services (DDSD) to make disability \n27  determinations.  ECF No. 36 at 2.     \n28  One of the evaluators was Dr. Frank Chen.  After receiving complaints that Dr. Chen’s \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 88   Filed 04/17/17   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  reports were of low quality, and sometimes included results of tests that he never actually \n2  performed, the DDSD disqualified him from providing CEs, citing Dr. Chen’s “unprofessional \n3  manner and failure to adequately correct deficiencies in his CE reports.”  Id. at 4.  Plaintiffs were \n4  not given notice that Dr. Chen had been disqualified, even though the SSA relied on his reports in \n5  deciding to deny their applications for disability benefits.  Plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit, \n6  asking the Court to grant declaratory and injunctive relief.  ECF No. 1 at 23-24. \n7  B.  Procedural History \n8    Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on February 9, 2015.  ECF No. 1.  After the SSA’s motion \n9  to dismiss was denied, ECF No. 36, it answered the Complaint on July 31, 2015, ECF No. 38.  \n10  Plaintiffs then filed a motion for class certification, ECF No. 40, which the Court granted on \n11  October 14, 2015, ECF No. 50. \n12    Settlement negotiations began in November 2015 before Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  James.  See ECF Nos. 44-45.  On September 19, 2016, the parties reached an agreement and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  agreement.  ECF No. 76.  The Court granted a motion for preliminary approval on November 9, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  2016, concluding that “the proposed benefits to be awarded to the class [fell] ‘within the range of \nS d nr\nee 17  possible approval,’” and that it otherwise met the criteria for approval.  ECF No. 81 at 13-14.  The \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Court found that the settlement agreement was appropriate in light of the risk and expense of \n19  litigation, the negotiations were non-collusive, there was a government participant, and the \n20  settlement contained no obvious deficiencies or preferential treatment to any class member.  Id. at \n21  13-14.   \n22  Because the class was certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and the \n23  settlement provides only injunctive relief, the Court was not obliged to require the parties to \n24  provide notice of the settlement to the class.  Id. at 14-15 (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Duke, \n25  564 U.S. 338, 362 (2011); Green v. Am. Express Co., 200 F.R.D. 211, 212-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)).  \n26  Nonetheless, the parties proposed and the Court ordered that notice be given, “since class \n27  members’ will have to take affirmative action if they desire their claims to be reopened, and will \n28  subsequently be notified via the claim form procedure if the settlement agreement is finally \n2 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 88   Filed 04/17/17   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  approved.”  Id. at 15.  The Court ordered Defendant to publish a Publication Notice in newspapers \n2  of general circulation1 and Plaintiffs’ counsel to disseminate the notice to “several organizations \n3  that are likely to interact with class members.”  Id.  Individual notice was not required because \n4  “class members are not afforded an opportunity to opt out.”  Id. \n5  Plaintiffs now bring this unopposed motion for final approval of the class action settlement \n6  agreement.  ECF No. 82.   \n7  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n8  The Ninth Circuit has a “strong judicial policy” favoring the settlement of class actions. \n9  Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir. 1992).  Rule 23(e) “requires the \n10  district court to determine whether a proposed settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and \n11  reasonable.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1026 (9th Cir. 1998).  The proposed \n12  settlement need not be ideal, but it must be fair and free of collusion, consistent with counsel's \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  fiduciary obligations to the class.  Id. at 1027.  In assessing a settlement agreement, a court must \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  weigh:  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  [T]he strength of the plaintiffs' case; the risk, expense, complexity, and likely \n sir\net duration of further litigation; the risk of maintaining class action status throughout \ntatsiD 16  the trial; the amount offered in settlement; the extent of discovery completed and \nS d nr the stage of the proceedings; the experience and views of counsel; the presence of a \nee 17  governmental participant; and the reaction of the class members to the proposed \nth\nintr settlement. \nUo\nN 18 \nId. at 1026.  The court need not consider all of these factors, and may consider others.  In re \n19 \nBluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d 935, 942 (9th Cir. 2011).   \n20 \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n21 \nA.  Notice Publication \n22 \nWhen a class is certified under Rule 23(b), courts typically do not require the parties to \n23 \nnotify the class.  Jamba Juice Co., 2015 WL 1248027, at *8.  Moreover, when a settlement \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  1 In its preliminary approval of the settlement agreement, the Court initially ordered that the notice \nbe published in three newspapers of general circulation.  ECF No. 81 at 15.  On November 8, \n27  2016, the Defendant filed an unopposed Amendment to the Settlement agreement, specifying five \nnewspapers in which the SSA would publish the notice: San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco \n28 \nExaminer, San Luis Obispo Tribune, Monterey Herald, and Santa Cruz Sentinel.  ECF No. 79 at 3. \n3 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 88   Filed 04/17/17   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  provides only injunctive relief, as is the case here, notice “is not uniformly required.”  Green v. \n2  Am. Express Co., 200 F.R.D. 211, 212-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  In its preliminary approval of the \n3  settlement agreement, however, the Court found that publication of notice would nonetheless be \n4  wise, and ordered notice to be published in newspapers of general circulation and organizations \n5  likely to come in contact with class members.  ECF No. 81 at 15.   \n6  The parties have complied with the publication requirement.  Defendant published notice \n7  of the settlement in five newspapers and Plaintiffs’ counsel disseminated the notice to a number of \n8  organizations’ publications within the time limits established by the Court.  See ECF No. 82-1 \n9  (Decl. of Trinh Phan), 82-2 (Decl. of Patricia Raymond).  The Court finds that the class notice \n10  plan was implemented properly.  \n11  B.  Fairness, Adequacy, and Reasonableness of the Settlement \n12  The Court previously found that the settlement agreement fell within the range of possible \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  approval, with no obvious deficiencies, no preferential treatment to any class member, and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  resulting from non-collusive negotiations led by experienced and competent counsel.  ECF No. 81 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  at 13-14.  No objections to the settlement have been filed or brought to the parties’ or the Court’s \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  attention.  ECF No. 82 at 3.  Defendant has no objection to final approval of the settlement \nS d nr\nee 17  agreement.  ECF No. 83 at 2.  The Court incorporates here its reasons for granting preliminary \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  approval of the settlement, and finds that the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable within the \n19  meaning of Rule 23(e).   \n20  C.  Claim Form Procedure \n21  The proposed settlement agreement provides that upon final approval of the agreement, the \n22  parties will send “Request Forms” to individual class members describing the member’s \n23  procedural status with the SSA, informing them of the risks of reopening their claims, informing \n24  them that they can have a representative assist them with their claim, and providing an option to \n25  submit a different address.  ECF No. 81 at 15; ECF No. 76 at 24-25.  The forms shall be sent to \n26  the class members’ last known address in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  See ECF \n27  No. 76 at 24-25.   \n28 \n4 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 88   Filed 04/17/17   Page 5 of 5\n \n1  CONCLUSION \n2  The Court finds the settlement agreement fair, adequate, and reasonable and GRANTS \n3  Plaintiffs motion for final approval of the settlement.   \n4  The parties shall distribute the Request Forms by May 19, 2017.   \n5  Defendant will pay $490,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs to Plaintiffs’ counsel Justice in \n6  Aging and Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County.  The Court finds that this award is fair and \n7  reasonable in light of the nature of this Action, counsel’s experience and efforts in prosecuting and \n8  resolving this action, and the benefits obtained for the Class.  Plaintiffs’ co-counsel, Morrison & \n9  Foerster, has agreed to waive its fees and costs.   \n10  The Court reserves exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the Action, the Class \n11  Representatives, the Class members, and Defendants for the purposes of supervising the \n12  implementation, enforcement, and construction of the Settlement and this Judgment. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Dated:  April 17, 2017 \ni\nrts fo  \niD tc 15   \n sir\net ______________________________________ \ntatsiD 16  JON S.

      "text": " \n1   \n2   \n3   \n4  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n5  NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n6   \nKEVIN HART, et al., \n7  Case No.  15-cv-00623-JST    \nPlaintiffs,   \n8  ORDER DENYING MOTION TO \nv.  DISMISS \n9   \nCAROLYN W. COLVIN,  Re: ECF No. 18 \n10 \nDefendant. \n11 \n   \n12   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  This is a putative class action about the evidence that Administrative Law Judges \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (“ALJ’s”) may properly consider in determining whether claimants are entitled to disability \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  benefits from the Social Security Administration (“SSA”).  Plaintiffs have sued Defendant \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Carolyn W. Colvin in her capacity as Acting Commissioner of Social Security, ECF No. 1, \nS d nr\nee 17  challenging the SSA’s alleged reliance on consultative examinations (CEs) performed by Dr. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Frank Chen, a physician who is now disqualified, in denying or terminating disability benefits.  Id. \n19  at ¶ 1.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the SSA to cease relying on Dr. \n20  Chen’s reports and requiring it to reopen any benefits determination that relied, at least in part, on \n21  a report prepared by Dr. Chen.  Id. at 23-24. \n22    Defendant now moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint for lack of subject matter \n23  jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).  ECF No. 18.  She contends that \n24  the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) because \n25  Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies through the Social Security \n26  Administration’s internal appeals process.  Plaintiffs respond that this Court should waive the \n27  exhaustion requirement of Section 405(g), because Plaintiffs’ claims are collateral to their claims \n28  for benefits, administrative exhaustion would be futile, and Plaintiffs have made a colorable \n\n \n1  showing of irreparable harm.  ECF No. 25.  This matter came for a hearing on June 25, 2015. \n2  For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that administrative exhaustion would \n3  be futile, and that Plaintiffs have satisfied the other requirements for waiver of the exhaustion \n4  requirement.  The Court therefore denies Defendant’s motion to dismiss.   \n5  I.  Background1 \n6  To to obtain benefits based on disability under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) \n7  program or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), a claimant must be unable “to engage in \n8  any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental \n9  impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last \n10  for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.”  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 2 (citing 42 U.S.C. § \n11  423(d)(1)(A)).  The regulations promulgated pursuant to the Social Security Act require that \n12  claimants provide the Social Security Administration (SSA) with “evidence from acceptable \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  medical sources to establish whether [an individual has] a medically determinable impairment(s).”  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Id. at ¶ 3 (citing 20 C.F.R. § 404.1513(a)).  Although the SSA administers SSI and SSDI, it \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  contracts with state agencies, such as the Disability Determination Service Division of the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  California Department of Social Services (DDSD), in order to make disability determinations.  Id. \nS d nr\nee 17  at ¶ 80.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Consultative examinations (CEs) are examinations performed by doctors or other medical \n19  professionals who contract with DDSD.  Id. at ¶ 85.  Following CEs, the examiner will send their \n20  report on a claimant to the DDSD.  Id. at ¶ 87.  The SSA has promulgated various guidelines \n21  regarding the standards for CEs and the consideration of CE reports.  Id. at ¶¶ 88-93. \n22  Named Plaintiffs Kevin Hart, Nina Silva-Collins, and Lee Harris all sought the award or \n23  renewal of disability benefits from the SSA.  Dr. Frank Chen performed consultative examinations \n24  (CEs) on all of the Named Plaintiffs in connection with their application for award or renewal of \n25  disability benefits.  Named Plaintiffs allege various deficiencies with these examinations.    \n26    Plaintiff Hart suffered from “tremendous pain and limited mobility,” following a 2007 car \n27 \n                                                 \n1 For the purposes of this order, the Court accepts as true all of the well-pled factual allegations \n28 \ncontained in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  ECF No. 1. \n2 \n\n \n1  accident, as well as “diabetes and emphysema.”  Id. at ¶ 17.  Hart was found disabled by an ALJ in \n2  April 2010.  Id. at ¶ 23.  In April of 2013, Hart was attacked violently, exacerbating his pre-\n3  existing pain and causing additional serious health conditions.  Id. at ¶ 24-25.  Hart was scheduled \n4  for a continuing disability review in 2013, and referred to Dr. Chen.  Id. at ¶ 26.  Dr. Chen’s \n5  August 15, 2013 examination of Plaintiff Hart lasted only ten minutes.  Id. at ¶¶ 28.  Dr. Chen \n6  submitted a report that misidentified Hart’s complaints and claimed that he had performed tests \n7  that he had not actually performed during his examination.  Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.  The SSA relied on Dr. \n8  Chen’s evaluation in terminating Hart’s benefits on September 11, 2013.  Id. at ¶ 34.  Following a \n9  subsequent hearing, a Disability Hearing Officer concluded in a March 17, 2014 order that Hart’s \n10  physical impairments had “medically improved” and that Hart was “able to do medium work \n11  activities” based upon Dr. Chen’s report.  Id.  at ¶ 35.  The Officer found Dr. Chen’s report “more \n12  reasonable as consistent and supported by medical evidence” than another doctor’s report that had \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  been submitted by Hart.  Id. at ¶ 35.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiff Silva-Collins suffers from “severe, chronic anemia caused by menorrhagia \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (abnormally heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding), lumbar degenerative disc disease, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  depression, anxiety, asthma, and hypertension.”  Id. at ¶ 38.  Silva-Collins was examined by Dr. \nS d nr\nee 17  Chen on August 10, 2013, after the ALJ determined that a CE was necessary to evaluate her \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  claims.  Id. at ¶ 41.  Dr. Chen’s examination of Silva-Collins lasted for only ten minutes.  Id. at ¶ \n19  42.  Dr. Chen diagnosed Silva-Collins with “[l]ow back pain, possibly due to obesity,” and \n20  “obesity.”  Id. at ¶ 44.  Dr. Chen’s report claimed that Dr. Chen had completed various strength \n21  and range of motion tests that he never actually performed.  Id. at ¶ 45.  “Dr. Chen did not ask Ms. \n22  Silva-Collins any questions about her menorrhagia, anemia, or other blood issues, or the effect that \n23  these chronic conditions had on her physical capabilities.”  Id. at ¶ 43.  On January 8, 2014, the \n24  ALJ denied Silva-Collins’ claim for benefits, giving “great weight to the opinion of consultative \n25  examiner Dr. Chen” and observing that Dr. Chen’s “examination is the most thorough and detailed \n26  in the record, and well supported by the medical evidence as a whole.”  Id. at ¶ 47.  \n27    Plaintiff Harris suffers from debilitating lower back, leg, and foot pain following an April \n28  2005 car accident.  Id. at ¶ 53.  Following his August 2011 application for SSI benefits, the SSA \n3 \n\n \n1  referred Plaintiff Harris to Dr. Chen for a CE, which was conducted on October 28, 2011.  Id. at ¶ \n2  56.  The examination lasted twelve minutes.  Id. at ¶ 58.  Dr. Chen instructed Harris to stand \n3  without his cane and Harris responded that he could not do so without support.  Id. at ¶ 60.  \n4  Nonetheless, “Dr. Chen concluded that Mr. Harris did not need to use his cane to walk short \n5  distances, even though he had never seen Mr. Harris stand without it.”  Id. at ¶ 63.  Harris’s \n6  application was denied on November 18, 2011 and again on reconsideration on May 16, 2012.  Id. \n7  at ¶ 64.  Although Harris succeeded in obtaining a hearing before an ALJ in April 2013, the ALJ \n8  denied the claim, stating that “the examination by Dr. Chen indicates far greater functionality than \n9  alleged by the claimant.”  Id. at ¶ 65.  The ALJ gave “the greatest weight to Dr. Chen’s opinion \n10  because he personally examined the claimant.”  Id.  \n11    Unbeknownst to claimants who were being referred to Dr. Chen for CEs during this time, \n12  DDSD had sent Dr. Chen a Corrective Action letter regarding deficiencies in his CEs in \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  September 2011.  Id. at ¶ 74.  DDSD sent Dr. Chen a second letter on October 14, 2013, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  identifying continuing issues with the quality of his reports.  Id. at ¶ 75.  On December 30, 2013, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  following years of complaints from applicants and their representatives regarding Dr. Chen’s \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  practices, the DDSD removed Dr. Chen from the CE panel, citing Dr. Chen’s “unprofessional \nS d nr\nee 17  manner and failure to adequately correct deficiencies in his CE reports.”  Id. at ¶ 76.  Although Dr. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Chen’s reports were a part of the record in all of Plaintiffs’ ongoing challenges to their denial of \n19  disability benefits, Plaintiffs were not provided with notice that Dr. Chen had been removed from \n20  the CE panel.  Id. at ¶ 77. \n21     Plaintiffs ask that this Court assume jurisdiction over this case, certify a class action, and \n22  grant declaratory and injunctive relief: 1) declaring that Defendant’s reliance on Dr. Chen’s CE \n23  reports “violate[s] the SSA’s obligations pursuant to the Social Security Act, its implementing \n24  regulations and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution”;  2) enjoining \n25  Defendant from relying on CE reports prepared by Dr. Chen to terminate or deny disability \n26  benefits; 3) requiring Defendant to reopen prior determinations terminating or denying benefits in \n27  reliance on CE reports prepared by Dr. Chen; and 4) requiring Defendant to provide notice to all \n28  individuals whose benefits were terminated or denied in reliance on a CE report prepared by Dr. \n4 \n\n \n1  Chen.  Id. at 23-24.  \n2  II.  Legal Standard \n3    The Social Security Act permits claimants to challenge the denial of social security \n4  benefits in a federal District Court after a “final decision” is rendered by the Commissioner.  42 \n5  U.S.C. § 405(g).  Plaintiffs filing a civil action generally must meet two requirements: \n6  presentment and exhaustion.  Johnson v. Shalala, 2 F.3d 918, 921 (9th Cir. 1993).  Presentment of \n7  a benefits claim to the Commissioner is a jurisdictional requirement, but exhaustion is not; the \n8  exhaustion requirement may therefore be waived by the SSA or the courts.  Id. (citing Matthews v. \n9  Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 330 (1975)).   \n10    Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiffs have satisfied the jurisdictional requirement by \n11  presenting their claims to the Commissioner.  Plaintiffs concede that they have not exhausted their \n12  claims through the administrative review process, but urge the Court to waive the exhaustion \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  requirement under the circumstances alleged in the complaint.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    The exhaustion requirement embodies the policy of deferring to the SSA “in the first \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  instance, both because of its superior ‘expertise in administering its own regulations,’ and because \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  it is generally more efficient to allow the agency, if it can, to resolve disputes concerning the \nS d nr\nee 17  entitlement programs it administers.”  Briggs v. Sullivan, 886 F.2d 1132, 1139 (9th Cir. 1989) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (quoting  Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467, 485 (1986)).  Nevertheless, “cases may arise \n19  where a claimant’s interest in having a particular issue resolved promptly is so great that deference \n20  to the agency’s judgment is inappropriate.”  Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 330. \n21    A court may waive the exhaustion requirement where the claim to be reviewed is \n22  “(1) collateral to a substantive claim of entitlement (collaterality), (2) colorable in its showing that \n23  refusal to the relief sought will cause an injury which retroactive payments cannot remedy \n24  (irreparability), and (3) one whose resolution would not serve the purposes of exhaustion \n25  (futility).”  Briggs v. Sullivan, 886 F.2d 1132, 1139 (9th Cir.1989) (citing Eldridge, 424 U.S. at \n26  330) (internal quotations omitted).  All three elements must be met.  See Kaiser v. Blue Cross of \n27  Cal., 347 F.3d 1107, 1115–16 (9th Cir. 2003).  However, “[t]he ultimate decision of whether to \n28  waive exhaustion should not be made solely by mechanical application of the Eldridge factors, but \n5 \n\n \n1  should also be guided by the policies underlying the exhaustion requirement.”  City of New York, \n2  476 U.S. at 484.   \n3  III.  Analysis  \n4    A.   Irreparability  \n5    A plaintiff satisfies the irreparability requirement by making a claim that is “colorable in \n6  its showing that refusal to the relief sought will cause an injury which retroactive payments cannot \n7  remedy.”  Briggs, 886 F.2d at 1139.  A claimant states such a colorable claim where they allege \n8  that “because of [their] physical condition and dependency upon the disability benefits, an \n9  erroneous termination would damage [them] in a way not recompensable through retroactive \n10  payments.”  Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 331.  The Ninth Circuit has held that back payment of benefits \n11  cannot “erase either the experience or the entire effect of several months without food, shelter or \n12  other necessities.”  Briggs, 886 F.2d at 1140.  Accordingly, courts have found irreparability where \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  a plaintiff has pled that they were living with their elderly mother while awaiting approval of their \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  SSI application, because they had no other income, Johnson, 2 F.3d at 920, or alleged reliance on \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  General Assistance and food stamps, a lack of medical insurance, and homelessness.  Kildare, 325 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  F.3d at 1083.   \nS d nr\nee 17    The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that their alleged \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  injuries are irreparable.2  Each Named Plaintiff has pled facts indicating the denial of benefits \n19  represents a grave hardship to him or her for which back payments would not fully compensate.  \n20  The complaint states that Plaintiff Hart currently lives with his elderly mother and struggled to \n21  afford basic needs even while he was receiving SSI and SSDI benefits, ECF No. 1 at ¶ 37, Plaintiff \n22  Silva-Collins lives with her father and requires SSI in order to afford necessary medical supplies, \n23  id. at ¶ 52, and Plaintiff Harris is currently dependent on family support to afford food and other \n24  basic life necessities.  Id. at ¶ 70.    \n25    Plaintiffs’ claims are colorable in their showing that refusal to the relief sought will cause \n26  an injury which retroactive payments cannot remedy. \n27 \n                                                 \n2 Defendant does not argue that Plaintiffs have failed to make a colorable showing of \n28 \nirreparability.   \n6 \n\n \n1    B.  Collaterality \n2    “A plaintiff’s claim is collateral if it is not essentially a claim for benefits.”  Johnson, 2 \n3  F.3d at 921.  Plaintiffs argue that they are not asking the Court to award or reinstate benefits as a \n4  result of this litigation, but instead ask for injunctive relief that would require the SSA to reopen \n5  proceedings that erroneously relied on Dr. Chen’s reports to terminate or deny benefits.   ECF No. \n6  25 at 8.  Defendant contends that, despite Plaintiffs’ “artful attempt to frame their claims as a \n7  challenge to an alleged SSA ‘policy and practice,’” ECF No. 18 at 15, Plaintiffs in fact seek to \n8  advance their claims for benefits by challenging Dr. Chen’s reports.  Id. at 16.  Defendant finds it \n9  significant that the Complaint challenges Defendant’s “policy and practice of relying on Dr. \n10  Chen’s defective CE reports in denying or terminating benefits,” and argues that this demonstrates \n11  that “Plaintiffs do not challenge a ‘policy’ but are, instead, challenging a specific outcome– denial \n12  of benefits– in cases where Dr. Chen prepared reports.”  ECF No. 27 at 7 (quoting ECF No. 1 at ¶ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  7).   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    The fact that Plaintiffs challenge the SSA’s use of Dr. Chen’s reports in cases that resulted \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in denials of claims for benefits does not convert Plaintiffs’ challenge into a claim for benefits.  In \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  City of New York, the Supreme Court held that a challenge to the SSA’s presumption that \nS d nr\nee 17  mentally disabled applicants were qualified to do unskilled work was collateral to a claim for \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  benefits.  476 U.S. 467.  The Court reasoned that “[t]he class members neither sought nor were \n19  awarded benefits in the District Court, but rather challenged the Secretary’s failure to follow the \n20  applicable regulations.”  Id. at 483.  The Court reached this conclusion even though Plaintiffs \n21  challenged the SSA’s use of a blanket presumption that “led to routine denials of benefits to \n22  eligible claimants.”  Id. at 473 (emphasis added).  Likewise, in Johnson, the Ninth Circuit held that \n23  plaintiffs’ challenge to “the Secretary’s policy of treating as income all in-kind loans” was \n24  collateral to their claims for benefits.  2 F.3d at 921.  The Court observed that plaintiffs had \n25  “sought the invalidation of a rule used to determine eligibility for benefits rather than the denial of \n26  benefits in a particular case.”  Id.  The Johnson court acknowledged that a favorable decision for \n27  plaintiffs would require the Secretary to “readjudicate those claims that were denied under the in-\n28  kind policy.”  Id.  (emphasis added).  But, the court concluded that, while adjudication would \n7 \n\n \n1  mean that “[s]ome claimants will receive benefits they were once denied,” other claimants would \n2  continue to be denied benefits as “[t]hey would not be entitled to benefits under either policy,” \n3  demonstrating plaintiffs’ claims were collateral.  Id.   \n4    Plaintiffs’ claims in this case are collateral to their claims for benefits because they do not \n5  challenge the outcome of the SSA proceedings—the denial or termination of their SSI or SSDI \n6  benefits.  Rather, they challenge the process by which that outcome was reached—in reliance on \n7  Dr. Chen’s CE reports.  It is of no moment to the analysis that, should Plaintiffs be granted the \n8  relief they seek, the outcome of their disability claims might ultimately prove different.  This was \n9  also true of the Plaintiffs in City of New York and Johnson, who alleged that procedural \n10  deficiencies occasioned the wrongful denial of their claims for benefits.  All that Plaintiffs seek \n11  from this Court is relief mandating that the SSA not use Dr. Chen’s CE reports in the process of \n12  evaluating Plaintiffs’ disability claims.  In the event that Plaintiffs are entitled to such relief at the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  close of the litigation, their ultimate entitlement to benefits will still be unknown and left to be \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  resolved by the SSA.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Defendant also contends that Plaintiffs’ claims are not collateral to their claims for benefits \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  because there is no SSA-wide “policy” to rely on Dr. Chen’s reports in resolving disability claims.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendant asserts that SSA adjudicators resolve disability claims on a case-by-case basis, and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “must decide the degree of weight, if any, to afford that report in determining whether the claimant \n19  is disabled.”  ECF No. 27 at 5.  Therefore, “[a]pplication of SSA’s regulations in a particular case \n20  may result in a degree of ‘reliance’ [on Dr. Chen’s reports] by the adjudicator, or it may not, all \n21  depending on the particular circumstances of the case.”  Id.   \n22  Defendant argues that this case resembles Kildare, where the Ninth Circuit concluded that \n23  plaintiffs’ claims were not collateral to claims for benefits when plaintiffs had alleged “a series of \n24  claimed irregularities in individual cases that [were] entirely dependent on the [plaintiffs’] \n25  underlying claims for benefits.”  325 F.3d at 1083.  Although the plaintiffs in that case had used \n26  terms such as “policy,” “practice,” and “systematic” throughout their complaint, the Kildare court \n27  observed that the plaintiffs had “admitted in their brief that they cannot point to any specific \n28  policy, directive, or order” that had resulted in the alleged erroneous denial of plaintiffs’ claims.  \n8 \n\n \n1  Id.  But Plaintiffs in this case do not merely allege “idiosyncratic individual errors,” as was the \n2  case in Kildare, id.; they point to an SSA-wide policy to consider Dr. Chen’s reports in resolving \n3  disability claims, even in the wake of widespread allegations of deficiencies in the quality of his \n4  examinations.   \n5  Defendant’s reply brief points to a March 16, 2015,3 letter from the Chief Administrative \n6  Law Judge for the SSA to the Acting Chief Administrative Law Judge for San Francisco providing \n7  guidance to adjudicators regarding Dr. Chen and instructing them to “consider” Dr. Chen’s \n8  removal from the panel in “determining the weight, if any, to which” Dr. Chen’s CE is entitled.  \n9  ECF No. 27-2 at 2-3.  Defendant offers this letter in an attempt to show that the SSA is aware of \n10  the serious issues with Dr. Chen’s CE reports and has instructed its adjudicators to factor these \n11  concerns into the case-by-case review of Plaintiffs’ disability claims.  But this letter only \n12  underscores the existence of an SSA-wide policy regarding Dr. Chen, authorizing adjudicators to \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  continue to “consider” his CE reports following his removal from the CE panel.4   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Plaintiffs do not seek an award of benefits from this Court.  Instead, Plaintiffs seek \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  injunctive relief mandating that the SSA cannot rely on Dr. Chen’s reports in resolving disability \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  claims going forward and requiring the SSA to reopen terminations or denials of disability claims \nS d nr\nee 17  that relied on CEs performed by Dr. Chen.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims challenge a policy and are \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  collateral to their claims for benefits.   \n19    C.  Futility \n20    The Ninth Circuit has held that a claimant can demonstrate futility by showing that \n21  “[r]equiring him to exhaust administrative remedies would not serve the policies underlying \n22  exhaustion.”  Briggs, 886 F.2d at 1140 (quoting Cassim v. Bowen, 824 F.2d 791, 795 (9th Cir. \n23  1987)).  For instance, “[w]hen the agency applies a ‘systemwide policy’ that is ‘inconsistent in \n24  critically important ways with established regulations,’ nothing is gained ‘from permitting the \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n3 The complaint in this case was filed February 9, 2015.   \n4 Defendant submitted this letter as evidence for the first time in connection with her reply brief.  \n27 \nThe Court generally does not consider new evidence presented for the first time on reply.  In re \nHansen Natural Corp. Sec. Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1150 (C.D. Cal. 2007).  The Court will \n28 \nconsider the letter in this instance, however, because no prejudice to the Plaintiffs will result.   \n9 \n\n \n1  compilation of a detailed factual record, or from agency expertise.’”  Johnson, 2 F.3d at 922 \n2  (quoting City of New York, 476 U.S. at 484).  A Court’s conclusion that it is “unlikely that an \n3  individual claimant could have succeeded in having the Secretary’s policy overturned or his \n4  benefits restored through the administrative process” also supports a finding of futility, as in such \n5  a case “[r]equiring each individual to exhaust his administrative remedies would result in a \n6  considerable waste of judicial resources.”  Id.  In contrast, when alleged “errors require \n7  interpretation of the regulations and vary with each Appellant, the errors must be determined in the \n8  context of individual disability proceeding and require development of individual factual records.”  \n9  Kildare, 325 F.3d at 1084. \n10    Plaintiffs argue that exhaustion would be futile as “a more fully developed factual record, \n11  or agency expertise” would not assist the Court in resolving the purely legal issue of whether \n12  continued reliance on Dr. Chen’s CE reports violates SSA’s legal obligations.  ECF No. 25 at 13.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Defendant counters that the extent to which the adjudicator relied on Dr. Chen’s report varies \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  depending on the claimant, necessitating the development of an individualized factual record.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Defendant also argues that administrative exhaustion would not be futile because individual \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs could prevail on administrative appeal of their denial or termination of benefits.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendant states that “SSA’s review process is capable of vacating any instances of improper \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  reliance, ordering new consultative examinations, or awarding benefits to meritorious claimants.”  \n19  ECF No. 27 at 9.   \n20    Defendant attempts to bolster her argument that administrative exhaustion would not be \n21  futile by noting that, following the filing of the complaint in this case, the ALJ in Hart’s \n22  administrative review provided Hart “with a new consultative examination from an internist other \n23  than Dr. Chen.”  ECF No. 18 at 17.  Defendant argues that “Plaintiff Hart cannot plausibly argue \n24  that there is ‘nothing to be gained’ from administrative exhaustion when he has received the very \n25  thing he asked this Court to order.”  Id.  Defendant has also notified the Court that the Appeals \n26  Council in Plaintiff Silva-Collins internal appeal has recently remanded her case back to the ALJ \n27 \n28 \n10 \n\n \n1  for further proceedings.5  The Appeals Council reasoned that because the ALJ had given “great \n2  weight” to Dr. Chen’s CE, despite the CE’s “inconsistent opinions regarding the claimant’s \n3  functional limitations,” the ALJ was required to engage in “additional development and evaluation \n4  of the evidence” in order to determine the claimant’s residual functional capacity.  ECF No. 34-1 \n5  at 8.  The Appeals Council noted that the ALJ a new CE “may be particularly helpful” to evaluate \n6  Plaintiff’s residual functional capacity, but did not require the ALJ to order one.  Id.  Although the \n7  Council noted the inconsistencies in Dr. Chen’s report and his recent disqualification, the Appeals \n8  Council did not instruct the ALJ as to whether it could continue to consider Dr. Chen’s CE on \n9  remand.  Id. at 8-10. \n10    Defendant argues that these orders demonstrate that Plaintiffs should be required to \n11  exhaust the administrative process before bringing this suit, as the SSA internal appeals process is \n12  aware of Dr. Chen’s disqualification and likely to grant affected claimants relief.  But Plaintiffs do \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  not ask this Court merely to order the SSA to provide a new CE report in their particular cases or \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  to instruct ALJ’s to examine Dr. Chen’s reports critically for potential inconsistencies; they urge \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that Dr. Chen’s reports are so unreliable that they should not be relied upon at all in the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  administrative review of their disability claims.  As Plaintiffs assert forcefully in their opposition, \nS d nr\nee 17  “[t]he fact that Mr. Hart, or any other Plaintiff, may receive a new CE does not ensure that the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  prior CE report from Dr. Chen will be excluded in the decision of whether the claimant is entitled \n19  to benefits.”  ECF No. 25 at 13.  Indeed, even after Hart’s new CE, an ALJ could decide “that the \n20  new CE report is less consistent with the evidence as a whole, including the improper and \n21  misleading CE report by Dr. Chen, and make a determination to deny or terminate benefits on that \n22  basis.”  Id.   \n23    Because Plaintiffs challenge an SSA-wide policy of continuing to use Dr. Chen’s reports in \n24  evaluating claimants, there is nothing to be gained “from permitting the compilation of a detailed \n25  factual record.”  Johnson, 2 F.3d at 922.  Indeed, the SSA has already informed the Court of how \n26 \n                                                 \n5 Following the hearing on this motion, Defendant submitted an unopposed administrative motion \n27 \nseeking to file notice of an Appeals Council order that was entered in Plaintiff Silva-Collins \nadministrative appeal.  ECF No. 34.  As the motion is unopposed, the Court will consider the \n28 \nappeals council order.   \n11 \n\n \n1  it intends to respond to the issues with Dr. Chen’s reports:  it has directed adjudicators to \n2  “consider” Dr. Chen’s removal from the CE panel “when evaluating a report from Dr. Chen and \n3  determining the weight, if any, to which it is entitled,” ECF No. 27-2 at 3, and it has instructed \n4  adjudicators to “consider whether ordering an additional CE is appropriate.”  Id.  Such remedial \n5  action falls well short of the relief requested in the Complaint.  Therefore, requiring all putative \n6  class members to exhaust their administrative appeals “would result in a considerable waste of \n7  judicial resources,” Johnson, 2 F.3d at 922, as Defendant has already stated the SSA’s intention to \n8  continue to consider Dr. Chen’s reports in appeals of disability denials or terminations.   \n9    The Court therefore concludes that requiring Plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies \n10  would not serve the policies underlying exhaustion.  Briggs, 886 F.2d at 1140   \n11  IV.  Conclusion   \n12    Because Plaintiffs have shown that waiver of Section 405(g)’s exhaustion requirement is \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  appropriate under the circumstances, the Court will deny Defendant’s motion to dismiss the \nCfi\n tclaC 14  Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).6   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Dated:  July 17, 2015 \nS d nr ______________________________________ \nee 17 \ntinhtr JON S.

ECF Nos. 75, 79.1  For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the motion.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  I.  BACKGROUND \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  A.  Factual Background \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    This is a putative class action about the evidence that Administrative Law Judges (“ALJs”) \nS d nr\nee 17  may properly consider in determining whether claimants are entitled to disability benefits from the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Social Security Administration (“SSA”).  ECF No. 50.  Named Plaintiffs Kevin Hart, Nina Silva-\n19  Collins, and Lee Harris represent a class of individuals who received a consultative examination \n20  (“CE”) performed by Dr. Frank Chen, a physician who is now disqualified, in connection with \n21  their applications for award or review of disability benefits from the SSA.  ECF No. 50; ECF No. \n22  1 ¶¶ 13-15.  Defendant Carolyn W. Colvin is the Acting Commissioner of Social Security.   \n23  To obtain benefits based on disability under the Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) or \n24  Social Security Disability Insurance (“SSDI”) programs, a claimant must be unable “to engage in \n25  any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental \n26 \n                                                 \n1 On November 8, 2016, the parties filed a Notice of Amended Settlement Agreement, which is \n27 \nthe agreement currently before the Court.  The only amendment was a change in the notice by \npublication term of the settlement to specify the publications in which notice will be published.  \n28 \nThe change is sensible, is not material, and does not require further discussion.   \n\n \n1  impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last \n2  for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 2 (citing 42 U.S.C. § \n3  423(d)(1)(A)).  SSA, which administers the SSI and SSDI programs, is required to “establish by \n4  regulation uniform standards which shall be applied at all levels of determination, review, and \n5  adjudication in determining whether individuals are under disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 421(k)(1).  \n6  The regulations promulgated pursuant to the Social Security Act require that claimants provide \n7  SSA with “evidence from acceptable medical sources to establish whether [an individual has] a \n8  medically determinable impairment(s).”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 3 (citing 20 C.F.R. § 404.1513(a)).  \n9  “Objective medical evidence of pain or other symptoms established by medically acceptable \n10  clinical or laboratory techniques . . . must be considered in reaching a conclusion as to whether [a \n11  claimant] is under a disability.”  42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(A).   \n12  Although SSA administers SSI and SSDI, it contracts with state agencies, such as the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Disability Determination Service Division of the California Department of Social Services \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (“DDSD”), to make disability determinations.  Id. ¶ 80.  If DDSD cannot get the information it \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  needs to make a disability determination from a claimant’s own medical records, DDSD may \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  decide to purchase a consultative examination (“CE”).  20 C.F.R. § 404.1519a.  CEs are \nS d nr\nee 17  examinations performed by doctors or other medical professionals who contract with DDSD.  ECF \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  No. 1 ¶ 85.  Following a CE, the examiner sends a report regarding the claimant to DDSD.  Id.       \n19  ¶ 87.  SSA has promulgated various guidelines regarding the standards for CEs and the \n20  consideration of CE reports.  Id. ¶¶ 88–93.  In particular, SSA regulations require that evidence \n21  used in making disability determinations, such as CE reports, must come from “acceptable \n22  medical sources.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a), 404.1519(g).  “Acceptable medical sources” include \n23  “[l]icensed physician[s].”  Id. §§ 404.1513(a)(1), 416.913(a)(1).  \n24  SSA regulations require adjudicators to “always consider” CE reports along with the rest \n25  of the relevant evidence in making a disability determination.  Id. §§ 404.1527(b), 416.927(b); see \n26  also ECF No. 46 at 3.  “Regardless of its source, [SSA adjudicators] will evaluate every medical \n27  opinion,” including every CE, the adjudicator receives in light of multiple factors to “determine[e] \n28  the weight,” if any, the opinion should be given.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c)(2), 416.927(b).  Even \n2 \n\n \n1  after an examiner has been disqualified, SSA regulations permit adjudicators to rely on existing \n2  CE reports prepared by the disqualified examiner.  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 99 (citing 20 C.F.R. §§ \n3  404.1503, 416.903a (“We will not use in our program any individual or entity, except to provide \n4  existing medical evidence, who is currently excluded, suspended, or otherwise barred from \n5  participation in . . . any other Federal or Federally-assisted program.”)). \n6  Named Plaintiffs Kevin Hart, Nina Silva-Collins, and Lee Harris all sought the award or \n7  renewal of disability benefits from SSA.  Dr. Frank Chen performed CEs on all of the Named \n8  Plaintiffs in connection with their applications for award or renewal of disability benefits.  Named \n9  Plaintiffs allege various deficiencies with these examinations.    \n10    Plaintiff Hart suffered from “tremendous pain and limited mobility,” following a 2007 car \n11  accident, as well as “diabetes and emphysema.”  Id. ¶ 17.  Hart was found disabled by an ALJ in \n12  April 2010.  Id. ¶ 23.  In April of 2013, Hart was attacked violently, exacerbating his pre-existing \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  pain and causing additional serious health conditions.  Id. ¶ 24–25.  Hart was scheduled for a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  continuing disability review in 2013 and referred to Dr. Chen.  Id. ¶ 26.  Dr. Chen’s August 15, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  2013 examination of Plaintiff Hart lasted only ten minutes.  Id. ¶ 28.  Dr. Chen submitted a report \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that misidentified Hart’s complaints and claimed that he had performed tests that he had not \nS d nr\nee 17  actually performed during his examination.  Id. ¶¶ 29–32.  SSA relied on Dr. Chen’s evaluation in \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  terminating Hart’s benefits on September 11, 2013.  Id. ¶ 34.  Following a subsequent hearing, a \n19  Disability Hearing Officer concluded in a March 17, 2014 order that Hart’s physical impairments \n20  had “medically improved” and that Hart was “able to do medium work activities” based upon Dr. \n21  Chen’s report.  Id. ¶ 35.  The Officer found Dr. Chen’s report “more reasonable as consistent and \n22  supported by medical evidence” than another doctor’s report that had been submitted by Hart.  Id. \n23  Plaintiff Silva-Collins suffers from “severe, chronic anemia caused by menorrhagia \n24  (abnormally heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding), lumbar degenerative disc disease, \n25  depression, anxiety, asthma, and hypertension.”  Id. ¶ 38.  Silva-Collins was examined by Dr. \n26  Chen on August 10, 2013, after an ALJ determined that a CE was necessary to evaluate her \n27  claims.  Id. ¶ 41.  Dr. Chen’s examination of Silva-Collins lasted only ten minutes.  Id. ¶ 42.  Dr. \n28  Chen diagnosed Silva-Collins with “[l]ow back pain, possibly due to obesity,” and “obesity.”  Id.  \n3 \n\n \n1  ¶ 44.  Dr. Chen’s report claimed that he had completed various strength and range of motion tests \n2  that he never actually performed.  Id. ¶ 45.  “Dr. Chen did not ask Ms. Silva-Collins any questions \n3  about her menorrhagia, anemia, or other blood issues, or the effect that these chronic conditions \n4  had on her physical capabilities.”  Id. ¶ 43.  On January 8, 2014, the ALJ denied Silva-Collins’ \n5  claim for benefits, giving “great weight to the opinion of consultative examiner Dr. Chen” and \n6  observing that Dr. Chen’s “examination is the most thorough and detailed in the record, and well \n7  supported by the medical evidence as a whole.”  Id. ¶ 47.  \n8    Plaintiff Harris suffers from debilitating lower back, leg, and foot pain caused by an April \n9  2005 car accident.  Id. ¶ 53.  Following his August 2011 application for SSI benefits, SSA referred \n10  Plaintiff Harris to Dr. Chen for a CE, which was conducted on October 28, 2011.  Id. ¶ 56.  The \n11  examination lasted twelve minutes.  Id. ¶ 58.  Dr. Chen instructed Harris to stand without his cane, \n12  and Harris responded that he could not do so without support.  Id. ¶ 60.  Nonetheless, “Dr. Chen \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  concluded that Mr. Harris did not need to use his cane to walk short distances, even though he had \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  never seen Mr. Harris stand without [the cane].”  Id. ¶ 63.  Harris’s application was denied on \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  November 18, 2011 and denied again upon reconsideration on May 16, 2012.  Id. ¶ 64.  Although \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Harris succeeded in obtaining a hearing before an ALJ in April 2013, the ALJ denied Harris’ \nS d nr\nee 17  claim, stating that “the examination by Dr. Chen indicates far greater functionality than alleged by \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the claimant.”  Id. ¶ 65.  The ALJ gave “the greatest weight to Dr. Chen’s opinion because he \n19  personally examined the claimant.”  Id.  \n20    Unbeknownst to claimants who were being referred to Dr. Chen for CEs during this time, \n21  DDSD had sent Dr. Chen a Corrective Action letter regarding deficiencies in his CEs in \n22  September 2011.  Id. ¶ 74.  DDSD sent Dr. Chen a second letter on October 14, 2013, identifying \n23  continuing issues with the quality of his reports, the lack of thoroughness of his examinations, and \n24  his unprofessional manner towards applicants.  Id. ¶ 75.  On December 30, 2013, following years \n25  of complaints from applicants and their representatives regarding Dr. Chen’s practices, DDSD \n26  removed Dr. Chen from the CE panel, citing Dr. Chen’s “unprofessional manner and failure to \n27  adequately correct deficiencies in his CE reports.”  Id. ¶ 76.  Although Dr. Chen’s reports were a \n28  part of the record in all of Plaintiffs’ ongoing challenges to their denial of disability benefits, \n4 \n\n \n1  Plaintiffs were not provided with notice that Dr. Chen had been removed from the CE panel.  Id.   \n2  ¶ 77; see also Defendant’s Answer to Class Action Complaint (“Answer”), ECF No. 38 ¶ 100 \n3  (“SSA admits that there is no regulation or rule directing SSA to provide applicants whose \n4  benefits have been denied or terminated notice that the consultative examiner in their case has \n5  been removed from the applicable CE panel.”). \n6    B.  Procedural Background \n7  On February 9, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint, asking the Court to grant declaratory \n8  and injunctive relief: 1) declaring that Defendant’s reliance on Dr. Chen’s CE reports “violate[s] \n9  the SSA’s obligations pursuant to the Social Security Act, its implementing regulations and the \n10  Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution”; 2) enjoining Defendant from relying on \n11  CE reports prepared by Dr. Chen to terminate or deny disability benefits; 3) requiring Defendant \n12  to reopen prior determinations terminating or denying benefits in reliance on CE reports prepared \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  by Dr. Chen; and 4) requiring Defendant to provide notice to all individuals whose benefits were \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  terminated or denied in reliance on a CE report prepared by Dr. Chen of their right to these forms \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of relief.  ECF No. 1 at 23–24.  On April 20, 2015, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  subject matter jurisdiction, contending that the Court could not exercise jurisdiction over this case \nS de nre 17  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g)2 because Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  remedies through the SSA’s internal appeals process.  ECF No. 18.  On July 17, 2015, the Court \n19  denied Defendant’s motion to dismiss, concluding that administrative exhaustion would be futile \n20  and that Plaintiffs had satisfied the other requirements for waiver of the exhaustion requirement.  \n21  ECF No. 36.   \n22  On July 31, 2015, Defendant filed her Answer to the Complaint.  ECF No. 38.  On August \n23  6, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking to certify a class of “[a]ll persons \n24  whose SSI or SSDI benefits were either denied or terminated and for whom a consultative \n25  examination was prepared by Dr. Frank Chen,” ECF No. 40 at 9.  On October 14, 2015, the Court \n26 \n                                                 \n2 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) provides: “Any individual, after any final decision of the Commissioner of \n27 \nSocial Security made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in \ncontroversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days \n28 \nafter the mailing to him of notice of such decision . . . .” \n5 \n\n \n1  granted the motion for class certification, concluding that Plaintiffs had met the requirements of \n2  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  ECF No. 50.  On September 19, 2016, \n3  Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement \n4  agreement, which motion the Court now considers.  ECF No. 75.  \n5  II.  CLASS CERTIFICATION \n6    A.  Legal Standard \n7  Class certification under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is a two-step \n8  process.  First, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the four requirements of Rule 23(a) are met: \n9  numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy.  “Class certification is proper only if the trial \n10  court has concluded, after a ‘rigorous analysis,’ that Rule 23(a) has been satisfied.”  Wang v. \n11  Chinese Daily News, Inc., 709 F.3d 829, 833 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \n12  Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011)).  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Second, a plaintiff must establish that the action meets one of the bases for certification in \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Rule 23(b). Here, because they rely on Rule 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs must establish that “questions of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  members, and . . . [that] a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and \nS d nr\nee 17  efficiently adjudicating the controversy.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The party seeking class certification bears the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance \n19  of the evidence that all four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one of the three requirements \n20  under Rule 23(b) are met.  See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. \n21    B.  Proposed Class Modification \n22    The Court has previously certified a class “consisting of all persons whose SSI or SSDI \n23  benefits were either denied or terminated and for whom a consultative examination was prepared \n24  by Dr. Frank Chen.”  ECF No. 50 at 19.  Solely for purposes of the proposed settlement, as agreed \n25  to by the parties, Plaintiffs request that the class definition be amended to be: \n \n26 \n[A]ll persons whose SSI or SSDI benefits were either denied or terminated and for \nwhom a consultative examination was prepared by Dr. Frank Chen, and all persons \n27 \nwho received a partially favorable decision or determination on their claim for SSI \n28  or SSDI benefits and for whom a consultative examination was prepared by Dr. \n6 \n\n \nChen.  \n1 \nECF No. 76 at 5.  Plaintiffs argue that “this is not a substantive change,” and merely includes in \n2 \nthe class, in explicit terms, “individuals who did not receive an award or benefits for the full \n3 \nperiod of their application—in other words, whose benefits were ‘denied or terminated’ only in \n4 \npart.”  Id.  As stated in the Court’s order granting class certification, the alleged wrong in this case \n5 \n“is one of process, not outcome,” and resolution does not “depend on the individual facts of each \n6 \nPlaintiff’s claims because Plaintiffs argue that any consideration of Dr. Chen’s report whatsoever \n7 \nviolated the law.”  ECF No. 50 at 10, 14.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ requested \n8 \nmodification is appropriate and does not affect the class’s sufficiency under Rule 23.  The \n9 \nmodification is approved. \n10 \nIII.  PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \n11 \n  A.  Legal Standard \n12 \n \na\ntr in The Ninth Circuit maintains a “strong judicial policy” that favors the settlement of class \nuoro 13 \nC tfila actions.  Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir. 1992).  Courts generally \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo employ a two-step process in evaluating a class action settlement.  First, courts make a \niD tc 15 \n seirt “preliminary determination” concerning the merits of the settlement and, if the class action has \ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr settled prior to class certification, the propriety of certifying the class.  See Manual for Complex \nee 17 \nth\nintr Litigation, Fourth (“MCL, 4th”) § 21.632 (FJC 2004).  “The initial decision to approve or reject a \nUo\nN 18 \nsettlement proposal is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.”  City of Seattle, 955 \n19 \nF.2d at 1276.  Courts “must be particularly vigilant not only for explicit collusion, but also for \n20 \nmore subtle signs that class counsel have allowed pursuit of their own self-interests and that of \n21 \ncertain class members to infect the negotiations.”  In re Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig., 654 \n22 \nF.3d 935, 947 (9th Cir. 2011). \n23 \nThe Court’s task at the preliminary approval stage is to determine whether the settlement \n24 \nfalls “within the range of possible approval.”  In re Tableware Antitrust Litig., 484 F. Supp. 2d \n25 \n1078, 1080 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (quotation omitted); see also MCL, 4th § 21.632 (explaining that \n26 \ncourts “must make a preliminary determination on the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of \n27 \nthe settlement terms and must direct the preparation of notice of the certification, proposed \n28 \n7 \n\n \n1  settlement, and date of the final fairness hearing.”).  Second, courts must hold a hearing pursuant \n2  to Rule 23(e)(2) to make a final determination of whether the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and \n3  adequate.” \n4  Preliminary approval of a settlement is appropriate if “the proposed settlement appears to \n5  be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies, does \n6  not improperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class, and \n7  falls within the range of possible approval.”  In re Tableware, 484 F. Supp. 2d at 1079 (quotation \n8  omitted).  The proposed settlement need not be ideal, but it must be fair and free of collusion, \n9  consistent with counsel’s fiduciary obligations to the class.  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d \n10  1011, 1027 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Settlement is the offspring of compromise; the question we address is \n11  not whether the final product could be prettier, smarter or snazzier, but whether it is fair, adequate \n12  and free from collusion.”).  To assess a settlement proposal, courts must balance a number of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  factors:  \nCfi\n tla  \nciC 14  the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; the risk, expense, complexity, and likely \nrts fo duration of further litigation; the risk of maintaining class action status throughout \niD tc 15  the trial; the amount offered in settlement; the extent of discovery completed and \n sir\net the state of the proceedings; the experience and views of counsel; the presence of a \ntatsiD 16  governmental participant; and the reaction of the class members to the proposed \nS d nr settlement.  \nee 17 \nth\nintr Id. at 1026 (citations omitted).  The proposed settlement must be “taken as a whole, rather than the \nUo\nN 18 \nindividual component parts” in the examination for overall fairness.  Id.  Courts do not have the \n19 \nability to “delete, modify, or substitute certain provisions”; the settlement “must stand or fall in its \n20 \nentirety.”  Id. \n21 \n  B.  Settlement Negotiations \n22 \n  On August 17, 2015, the Court referred the parties for a Settlement Conference before \n23 \nMagistrate Judge Maria-Elena James, scheduled for November 2015.  ECF Nos. 44-45.  The \n24 \nparties engaged in settlement discussions in person, by phone, and by email in the intervening \n25 \nmonths.  ECF No. 76 at 4.  The first Settlement Conference took place on November 17, 2015.  \n26 \nECF No. 54.  The parties subsequently had six additional Settlement Conferences with Magistrate \n27 \nJudge James: on December 18, 2015, April 5, 2016, April 28, 2016, May 19, 2016, July 13, 2016, \n28 \n8 \n\n \n1  and July 28, 2016.  ECF Nos. 57, 62, 65, 66, 68, 71.  The parties reached an agreement on \n2  September 19, 2016.  ECF No. 76.    \n3    C.  Terms of the Settlement \n4    As described by Plaintiffs, “[t]he Settlement Agreement provides relief to class members \n5  through procedural mechanisms that vary depending on the status of their claims and the amount \n6  of time since their examination by Dr. Chen.”  ECF No. 76 at 5.  \n7      1.  Individuals with “Open” Claims \n8    “A class member who has an ‘open’ claim is an individual who received an unfavorable \n9  decision or determination of their claim but, as of the date of final approval of this Settlement \n10  Agreement, that decision or determination is not final.”  Id.   \n11    For individuals who meet this definition, the ALJs handling their claims are required to: \n12  o  Notify the individual that he or she received a CE from Dr. Chen, and that Dr. Chen’s \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  reports were flawed in important ways and subject to complaints, and that he is no longer \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  allowed to perform these examinations; \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  o  Notify the individual that he or she has the option to have the report from Dr. Chen \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  excluded from consideration in the forthcoming adjudication; and \nS d nr\nee 17  o  Notify the individual that the adjudicator has the discretion to consider whether ordering an \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  additional CE is appropriate.  \n19  ECF No. 76 at 5-6; ECF No. 76-1 at III.C.   \n20    2.  Individuals with “Closed” Claims Who Were Examined by Dr. Chen \n21  On or After January 1, 2011 \n22    “A class member who has a ‘closed’ claim is an individual who received an unfavorable \n23  decision or determination of their claim and, as of the date of final approval of this Settlement \n24  Agreement, that decision or determination is final.”  ECF No. 76 at 6; ECF No. 76-1 at III.A. \n25    Due to the fact that these class members’ claims are “closed,” if they are eligible for relief \n26  they will need to proceed through a readjudication process.  ECF No. 76 at 6.  “The person or \n27  entity responsible for readjudicating these claims will reflect the level at which each claimant \n28  received the unfavorable decision or determination.”  Id.   \n9 \n\n \n1    If the DDS made the final decision at issue, the proposed settlement provides that the SSA \n2  will readjudicate those claims through its “Disability Processing Unit,” without consideration of \n3  Dr. Chen’s CE report.  Id.; ECF No. 76-1 at III.A.2.a.  In addition to the omission of Dr. Chen’s \n4  report, the claimant will also have the opportunity to submit supplemental evidence relating to the \n5  previously-adjudicated period, and receive back benefits or payments if found to have been \n6  disabled for all, or any part of, the previously-adjudicated period.  Id.   \n7    Moreover, if the Disability Processing Unit finds that the claimant was disabled at the end \n8  of the previously-adjudicated period, the claimant may use supplemental evidence or a new CE \n9  ordered by the Disability Processing Unit to show that his or her disability has continued beyond \n10  the previously adjudicated period, up to and including the date of readjudication.  Id.  A claimant \n11  who makes the appropriate showing will receive the appropriate additional back benefits or \n12  payments, and/or current benefits or payments.  Id. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    If an ALJ made the final decision at issue, a new hearing will be scheduled for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  reconsideration of the claim without consideration of Dr. Chen’s report.  ECF No. 76 at 7; ECF \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  No. 76-1 at III.A.2.b.  A claimant in this category also has the opportunity to submit supplemental \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  evidence relating to the previously-adjudicated period, the ALJ can order a new CE within his or \nS d nr\nee 17  her discretion, and the claimant will receive back benefits or payments if found to have been \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  disabled for all, or any part of, the previously-adjudicated period.  Id.  Furthermore, if the \n19  Disability Processing Unit finds that the claimant was disabled at the end of the previously-\n20  adjudicated period, the claimant can show that his or her disability has continued beyond the \n21  previously adjudicated period, up to and including the date of the readjudication.  Id. Then, again, \n22  the claimant may use supplemental evidence and the ALJ can order a new CE in the exercise of \n23  his or her discretion.  Id.  If the claimant can make such a demonstration, he or she will receive the \n24  appropriate additional back benefits or payments, and/or current benefits or payments.  Id.   \n25    If class members in this category requested review by the Appeals Council or if the \n26  Appeals Council took review on its own motion, their case will be remanded, and they will have a \n27  new hearing with the same rights described above.  Id.; ECF No. 76-1 at III.A.2.c.   \n28      3.  Individuals With “Closed” Claims Who Were Examined by Dr. Chen \n10 \n\n \n1  Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010 \n2    “A class member who has a ‘closed’ claim, and who was examined by Dr. Chen between \n3  January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2010, will be invited by SSA to apply for SSI or DIB benefits, \n4  or both, by timely returning a claim form, indicating on the form whether he or she is currently \n5  disabled, and proceeding to file a new application within the applicable timeframe.”  ECF No. 76; \n6  ECF No. 76-1 at III.B.2.  If the claimant is determined to be disabled upon adjudication of his or \n7  her current application, he or she will then be entitled to a “lookback assessment” for the \n8  previously-adjudicated period for which he or she were denied benefits.  Id.  The Disability \n9  Processing Unit will perform the lookback assessments based on the record without considering \n10  Dr. Chen’s report.  Again, the claimants are allowed to submit any relevant supplemental \n11  evidence.  Id.; ECF No. 76-1 at III.B.2.b.  A finding of disability during the previously-\n12  adjudicated period will entitle the claimant to the appropriate award of back benefits or payments.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  ECF No. 76 at 8.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14      4.  Individual in “Current Pay Status” \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Individuals in “current pay status” are currently receiving benefits, despite a past denial (or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  partial denial) of a claim for benefits that involved an examination by Dr. Chen.  Id.  “An \nS d nr\nee 17  individual who was already in ‘current pay status’ as of October 14, 2015—the date the Court \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  granted class certification—will not be eligible for relief.”  Id.   \n19      5.  Individuals With Claims Where ALJ Explicitly Afforded No Weight to \n20  Dr. Chen’s Report \n21     “If SSA reviews the prior ALJ decision and determines that Dr. Chen’s CE report was \n22  explicitly afforded no weight in the analysis, that individual will not be eligible for another review \n23  of his or her claim.”  ECF No. 76 at 8; ECF No. 76-1 at III.A.2.b; III.A.2.c.   \n24      6.  Individuals With “Closed” Claims Who Appealed to Federal Court \n25    For claimants eligible for relief who appealed their final decision to a federal court \n26  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g) or 1383(c)(3) prior to the date of final approval and have a \n27  pending federal court case, “SSA will file a notice of non-opposition in response to a timely \n28  motion for remand to the agency for further proceedings if the claimant wishes to be eligible for \n11 \n\n \n1  consideration for such relief.”  ECF No. 76 at 8; ECF No. 76-1 at III.A.2.d.  If a claimant is \n2  eligible for relief but his or her “federal court case has resulted in a final judgment affirming the \n3  final decision of the Commissioner, SSA will file a notice of non-opposition in response to a \n4  timely 60(b)(6) motion for remand to the agency for further proceedings if the claimant wishes to \n5  be eligible for consideration for such relief.”  ECF No. 76 at 8-9.   \n6      7.  Additional Relief   \n7    In addition to the relief discussed for each category of class member, Defendant will \n8  “begin a study of the processes through which it monitors the California DDS’s engagement, \n9  review, and retention of empaneled consultative examiners,” with the goal of identifying \n10  “mechanisms to improve the monitoring of these processes.”  ECF No. 76 at 9.  \n11    Defendant has also “agreed to issue a document setting out processes for notifying \n12  adjudicators when an individual CE provider previously engaged by the California DDS has been \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  disqualified for conduct determined to undermine the reliability of that provider’s reports.”  Id.; \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  ECF No. 76-1 at IV.B.  “The document will also identify, to the extent feasible, processes for (1) \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  providing notice to claimants with open claims, and their representatives, that they were examined \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by a disqualified provider and/or (2) providing new CEs to such claimants.”  Id.   \nS d nr\nee 17    Defendants will also “pay attorney’s fees, both for pre-approval work already incurred and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  for post-approval work in the future, and reimbursement of expenses and costs by Plaintiff’s \n19  counsel Justice in Aging and Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County in the amount of $490,000.”  \n20  ECF No. 76 at 10; ECF No. 76-1 at VII.  “Plaintiffs’ counsel Morrison & Foerster has agreed to \n21  waive any attorney’s fees and costs incurred in connection with this action.”  Id.   \n22    In exchange, “Plaintiffs agree to the dismissal of the Case with prejudice under Federal \n23  Rules of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1) and 23(e),” and agree to “release, waive, acquit, and forever \n24  discharge the United States, the Commissioner, the Social Security Administration, the California \n25  Disability Determination Service, and all of their officers, employees, and agents, from, and are \n26  hereby forever barred and precluded for prosecuting, any and all claims, causes of action, and/or \n27  requests for relief that would be barred by the doctrine of res judicata were final judgment on the \n28  merits entered on all claims asserted in this case.”  ECF No. 76-1 at VII-VIII.   \n12 \n\n \n1    D.  Analysis \n2    The Court concludes that the proposed benefits to be awarded to the class fall “within the \n3  range of possible approval.”   \n4      1.  Risk, Expense, Complexity, and Likely Duration of Further Litigation \n5    While the parties agree that the outcome of a trial is “uncertain,” they do not describe \n6  Plaintiffs’ claims as “not particularly strong” or weak.  ECF No. 76 at 12; see also In re Bluetooth \n7  Headset Products Liability Litigation, 654 F.3d 935, 946 (9th Cir. 2011).  Still, the Court agrees \n8  that it would be more expensive and time-consuming for the parties to litigate this case through \n9  trial, and that resolution of this action through settlement is appropriate.  Discovery and an \n10  eventual trial would surely prolong the wait class members face to obtain relief.   \n11      2.  Non-Collusive Negotiations \n12    In examining the means by which the parties arrived at a settlement, the Court concludes \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  that the negotiations and agreement were non-collusive.  The stipulated settlement was reached \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  after the parties engaged in motion practice and participated in arms-length, extensive settlement \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  negotiations overseen by an experienced and neutral third party.  ECF No. 76 at 14.  These \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  assertions support the conclusion that the settlement is non-collusive and likely to benefit the class \nS d nr\nee 17  members.  See, e.g., Harris v. Vector Marketing Corp., No. C-08-5198 EMC, 2011 WL 1627973, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  at *8 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2011).  While no formal discovery has taken place, the parties exchanged \n19  some documents and information “that allowed the parties to draft and refine the terms of the \n20  Settlement Agreement,” and Plaintiffs’ own investigation resulted in useful documents that were \n21  included in the SSA’s prior filings.  Id. at 13; see In re Mego Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 213 F.3d 454, \n22  459 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[F]ormal discovery is not a necessary ticket to the bargaining table where the \n23  parties have sufficient information to make an informed decision about settlement.” (citations \n24  omitted)).  The Court also agrees that counsel for both Plaintiffs and Defendants are experienced \n25  and competent.  ECF No. 76 at 13. \n26      3.  Presence of a Government Participant \n27    Defendant Carolyn W. Colvin is Acting Commissioner of Social Security and is charged \n28  by federal law with administering and supervising the benefit programs administered by SSA.  \n13 \n\n \n1  The Court agrees that her participation weighs in favor of approval.  Id. at 14.    \n2      4.  Obvious Deficiencies \n3    The settlement has no obvious deficiencies.  The settlement addresses Plaintiffs’ central \n4  claim by providing that class members will be afforded fair process to determine their eligibility \n5  for benefits without consideration of Dr. Chen’s reports.  It also allows some class members to \n6  preserve Dr. Chen’s report in their record by giving them the option of whether to challenge it.  \n7  ECF No. 76 at 17.  The Court concludes that such relief falls within the range of possible \n8  approval.  \n9      5.  Preferential Treatment \n10    Under this factor, the Court looks at whether the settlement agreement provides \n11  preferential treatment to any class member.  The named plaintiffs receive the same relief as all \n12  other class members under the agreement.  The variations that are included in the different sub-\n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  classes reflect only that different class members occupy different procedural postures within \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  SSA’s administrative process.  The Court agrees that the agreement provides relief through the use \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of procedural mechanisms most appropriate for each sub-group based on procedural posture.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  While such differences may result in different types of relief for the different subclasses, they are \nS d nr\nee 17  rational in this instance because some claimants’ claims are “closed” while others are “open,” and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the September 2011 distinguishing date represents when Defendant sent Dr. Chen a corrective \n19  action letter and was officially aware of problems with his reports.  See, e.g., Torrisi v. Tucson \n20  Elec. Power Co., 8 F.3d 1370, 1377 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that two subclasses were rationally \n21  distinguished by events occurring on a certain date).  Thus, while Dr. Chen’s reports may well \n22  have been deficient before that date, class members for whom Dr. Chen prepared a report before \n23  September 2011 may require extra evidentiary support for their claims.  This distinction reflects a \n24  reasonable compromise.  \n25      6.  Notice Procedure \n26    “Courts typically require less notice in Rule 23(b)(2) actions, as their outcomes do not \n27  truly bind class members.”   Lilly v. Jamba Juice Co., No. 13-cv-2998-JST, 2015 WL 1248027, at \n28  *8 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2015).  As the Supreme Court has stated, “[t]he Rule provides no \n14 \n\n \n1  opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige the District \n2  Court to afford them notice of the action.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 362 \n3  (2011).  Yet the Court “may direct appropriate notice to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 2(c)(2).   \n4    When, for instance, “the settlement provides for only injunctive relief, and, therefore, there \n5  is no potential for the named plaintiffs to benefit at the expense of the rest of the class,” notice “is \n6  not uniformly required.”  Green v. Am. Express Co., 200 F.R.D. 211, 212-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  \n7  Such is the case here, as the settlement provides for injunctive relief and a readjudication process.  \n8  Unlike in Lilly, however, in this case class members are releasing all of their claims in exchange \n9  for settlement relief.  Lilly, 2015 WL 1248027, at *8 (“[T]he settlement does not release the \n10  monetary claims of class members.”).  \n11    In any case, the parties have proposed that notice be provided to the class.  This is wise, \n12  since class members’ will have to take affirmative action if they desire their claims to be reopened, \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and will subsequently be notified via the claim form procedure if the settlement agreement is \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  finally approved.  First, notice is to be published, at Defendant’s expense, in three newspapers of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  general circulation.  ECF No. 76 at 18.  Plaintiffs’ counsel will also disseminate notice of the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  settlement to “several organizations that are likely to interact with class members,” and “provide \nS d nr\nee 17  adequate notice of the proposed class settlement so that interested parties may object to its \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  reasonableness.”  Id.  The Court agrees that individual notice of the settlement is not required \n19  because class members are not afforded an opportunity to opt out.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2).  In \n20  response to Plaintiffs’ request, the Court will order publication of this Publication Notice.   \n21      7.  Claim Form Procedure \n22      If the Court approves the settlement agreement, the parties will send notice and \n23  corresponding “Request Forms” to “individual class members based on the relief afforded to \n24  them.”  ECF No. 76 at 19.  The Notice forms will be sent to class members’ last known address, \n25  will describe their procedural status within the SSA process, apprise them of the opportunity and \n26  risks associated with reopening their claims, advise claimants that they can have a representative \n27  help with his or her claim and that the claimant may want to speak to that representative before \n28  returning the request form, and includes an option to submit a different address.  Id.; ECF No. 76-\n15 \n\n \n1  1, Exh. A.  The Claim Forms require that class members return the forms within 30, 90, or 180 \n2  days, depending on their subclass, if they wish for their claims to be reopened.  Id.  It is fair and \n3  reasonable to require claim forms to enable the class members to make a choice as to whether to \n4  reopen their claims. \n5  8.  Notice Provision for Objections \n6  The Notice of Settlement contains a section entitled, “What Can You Do If You Object To \n7  The Settlement Or Have Other Comments?”  ECF No. 76-1 at 76.  Consistent with the Northern \n8  District’s Procedural Guidance for Class Action Settlements, \n9  http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/ClassActionSettlementGuidance, the parties are ordered to amend \n10  that section of the Notice to read as follows: \n \n11  You can ask the Court to deny approval by filing an objection.  You can’t ask the \nCourt to order a larger or different settlement; the Court can only approve or deny \n  12  the settlement.  If the Court denies approval, no relief will be awarded to the class \na\ntr in and the lawsuit will continue.  If that is what you want to happen, you must object. \nuoro 13   \nCfi\n tla You may object to the proposed settlement in writing.  You may also appear at the \nciC 14  Final Approval Hearing, either in person or through your own attorney.  If you \nrts fo appear through your own attorney, you are responsible for paying that attorney.  All \niD tc 15  written objections and supporting papers must (a) clearly identify the case name \n sir\net and number (Hart v. Colvin, Case Number 3:15-cv-00623-JST), (b) be submitted to \ntatsiD 16  the Court either by mailing them to the Class Action Clerk, United States District \nS d nr Court for the Northern District of California, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San \nee 17  Francisco, CA 94102, or by filing them in person at any location of the United \nth\nintr States District Court for the Northern District of California, and (c) be filed or \nUo\nN 18  postmarked on or before February 10, 2017.” \n19  CONCLUSION \n20  The Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement Agreement is granted.  \n21  The Court therefore orders as follows: \n22  1.  The Court preliminarily approves the agreement set forth in the Settlement \n23  Agreement.  See ECF No. 76-1.    \n24  2.  The class certified in the Court’s prior order, ECF No. 50, is modified to be defined \n25  as follows: \n26 \n[A]ll persons whose SSI or SSDI benefits were either denied or terminated and for \nwhom a consultative examination was prepared by Dr. Frank Chen, and all persons \n27 \nwho received a partially favorable decisions or determination on their claim for SSI \nor SSDI benefits and for whom a consultative examination was prepared by Dr. \n28 \n16 \n\n \nChen. \n1 \n \n  3.

Berryhill, Acting Commissioner of Social \n3 Security, sued solely in her official capacity (“SSA”), submit this Stipulated Request to Amend \n4 the Court’s April 17, 2017 Order Granting Final Approval of Class Action Settlement (“Order”) \n5 [ECF  No.  88]  to  comport  with  the  terms  of  the  parties’  Amended  Settlement  Agreement \n6 (“Agreement”) [ECF No. 79-1].  The April 17, 2017 Order differs from the Agreement in the \n7 following four material respects.  First, on page 1, line 19, the Order recites that the case involves \n8 “evidence used by Administrative Law Judges (‘ALJs’),” but the case involved adjudications at \n9 all levels, not just at the ALJ stage, so Plaintiff would request that “Administrative Law Judges \n10 (‘ALJs’)” be replaced with “Social Security Administration (‘SSA’)”; and at page 1, line 20-21, \ninstead of saying “The evidence ALJs consider when making a disability benefits determination \n11\nincludes consultative evaluations,”  this should be re[placed with “The evidence the agency \n12\nconsiders when making a disability benefits determination often includes consultative evaluations \n13\n… . “   Second, the Order sets the date for mailing Request Forms as May 19, 2017, but under the \n14\nAgreement that the Court was approving, the deadline for mailing the Request Forms is later, \n15\nnamely, ninety days (for most forms) and twenty days (for another form) after the time for any \n16\nappeals from the approval order has elapsed.  Third, the Order contains language that might create \n17\nconfusion concerning the enforcement mechanism negotiated and agreed upon by the parties.  \n18\nFourth, the parties had requested that the Court grant final approval to the amended class \n19\ndefinition, which was omitted from the Court’s Order Granting Final Approval.  Respectfully, \n20\ntherefore, the parties request that the Court amend its April 17, 2017 Order in the manner \n21\ndescribed below.  Alternatively, the parties request that the Court withdraw the Order and enter \n22\nthe Amended Proposed Order [ECF No. 85-1] that the parties submitted on March 1, 2017 in \n23\nconnection with Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval.   \n24\nRequest for Amendment of the Order \n25\n  The Conclusion of the Order provides as follows: \n26\n \n27\nCONCLUSION \n28\nHart, et al. v. Berryhill, Case No. 3:15-cv-00623-JST \nStipulated Request to Amend Order Granting Final Approval  1 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 90   Filed 04/25/17   Page 4 of 10\n \nThe Court finds the settlement agreement fair, adequate, and \n1\nreasonable and GRANTS Plaintiffs motion for final approval of the \nsettlement. \n2\nThe parties shall distribute the Request Forms by May 19, \n3 2017. \nDefendant will pay $490,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs to \n4\nPlaintiffs’ counsel Justice in Aging and Legal Aid Society of San \nMateo County. The Court finds that this award is fair and reasonable \n5\nin light of the nature of this Action, counsel’s experience and efforts \n6 in prosecuting and resolving this action, and the benefits obtained \nfor  the  Class.  Plaintiffs’  co-counsel,  Morrison  &  Foerster,  has \n7\nagreed to waive its fees and costs. \n8 The Court reserves exclusive and continuing jurisdiction \nover the Action, the Class Representatives, the Class members, and \n9 Defendants for the purposes of supervising the implementation, \nenforcement, and construction of the Settlement and this Judgment. \n10\n \n11\nOrder 5.  The parties request that the Order be amended to remove the second and fourth \n12\nparagraphs of this Conclusion, and to include a term that the parties had requested that the Court \n13\ninclude.   \n14\nSecond Paragraph: In the Agreement, the parties did not establish a date certain (such as \n15\nMay 19, 2017) by which SSA would send claimants the agreed-upon notices and claim forms \n16\n(referred to by the Court as “Request Forms” in the Order).  Instead, the deadline to send such \n17\nforms is to be established in relation to the “date on which the Settlement becomes effective.”  \n18\nSee Agreement 18, 20, 27, 28, 31 (providing that SSA will send Notices A, A2, B, and B2 within \n19\nninety days after the effective date and Notice C within twenty days after the effective date).  \n20\nPursuant to the agreed definition, the “date on which the Settlement becomes effective” will not \n21\nbe known until either (1) any timely appeal of the approval order is resolved; or (2) no timely \n22\nappeal is filed.  Agreement 4 (defining “date on which the Settlement becomes effective”).  A \n23\nMay 19, 2017 deadline to distribute the Request Forms is therefore at odds with the terms of the \n24\nAgreement.  Further, counsel have been informed that SSA is not in a position to meet a May 19, \n25\n2017 deadline (which would in any event come before the deadline for an appeal from the April \n26\n17, 2017 Order).  Therefore, the parties respectfully request that the second paragraph of the \n27\nConclusion be stricken.  Otherwise, the parties will be in the difficult position of having an Order \n28\nHart, et al. v. Berryhill, Case No. 3:15-cv-00623-JST \nStipulated Request to Amend Order Granting Final Approval  2 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00623-JST   Document 90   Filed 04/25/17   Page 5 of 10\n \n1 granting final approval of a Settlement Agreement that deviates from the negotiated terms of the \n2 Settlement Agreement (and which, as a practical matter, cannot be performed).  \n3 Fourth Paragraph: In the Agreement, the parties identified specific pre-dispute resolution \n4 procedures in an Enforcement provision.  Agreement 33-35. Without noting the Enforcement \n5 provision, the April 17, 2017 Order states that the Court “reserves exclusive and continuing \n6 jurisdiction over the Action, the Class Representatives, the Class members, and Defendants for \n7 the purposes of supervising the implementation, enforcement, and construction of the Settlement \n8 and this Judgment.”  Order 5.    In the Agreement, however, the parties agreed to an “exclusive \n9 process for remedying alleged violations of this Agreement.”  Agreement 33.  The parties “further \nagree[d] that no other litigation action in the Case, including but not limited to the filing of any \n10\nmotions  or  pleadings,  may  be  taken  except  as  set  forth  in  this  Section  VI  [concerning \n11\nEnforcement].”  Id.  In order to avoid potential confusion from the language in the Order (which \n12\ndoes not expressly reference the Enforcement provision), the parties respectfully request that the \n13\nfourth paragraph of the Conclusion be stricken.1  \n14\nFinal Approval of Amended Class Definition: In the Agreement, the parties agreed, for \n15\nsettlement purposes, to amend the definition of the class and to request that the Court amend the \n16\ncertified class so that the plaintiff class is defined as consisting of “all persons whose SSI or SSDI \n17\nbenefits were either denied or terminated and for whom a consultative examination was prepared \n18\nby Dr. Frank Chen, and all persons who received a partially favorable decision or determination \n19\non their claim for SSI or SSDI benefits and for whom a consultative examination was prepared \n20\nby Dr. Chen.”  Agreement 6-7.  Although the Court preliminarily approved this modification of \n21\nthe class definition, see Order Granting Mot. for Prelim. Approval, ECF No. 81, at 6-7, it did not \n22\nexpressly grant final approval to this modification.  To ensure that proper notice is given of the \n23\n                            \n24  \n1 It appears that the fourth paragraph of the Conclusion may have been drawn from the \n25\noriginal proposed order submitted by Plaintiffs in connection with their Motion for Final \nApproval.  See Proposed Order, ECF No. 82-3, at 5, ¶ 10 (using same language as fourth \n26\nparagraph of the Conclusion).  Following submission of this proposed order, SSA registered its \n27 objections to this language with Plaintiffs’ counsel, and the parties then agreed to submit an \nAmended Proposed Order, in which this language does not appear.  See Notice of Am. Proposed \n28\nOrder, ECF No. 85-1; see also Def.’s Mem. Supp. Final Approval, ECF No. 83, at 1 n.2. \nHart, et al. v.

See also Notice of Am. Proposed Order, ECF No. 85-1, at 1-2, ¶ 5. \n4 *  *  * \n5 In summary, the parties respectfully request that the Court amend page 1, line 19 to replace \n6 “Administrative Law Judges (‘ALJs’)” with “Social Security Administration (‘SSA’)”; and at \n7 page 1, line 20-21, instead of saying “The evidence ALJs consider when making a disability \n8 benefits determination includes consultative evaluations,” this should be replaced with “The \n9 evidence the agency considers when making a disability benefits determination often includes \nconsultative evaluations … . “   The Conclusion of the Order should be amended so that it provides \n10\nas follows: \n11\n \n12\nCONCLUSION \n13\nThe Court finds the settlement agreement fair, adequate, and \nreasonable and GRANTS Plaintiffs motion for final approval of the \n14\nsettlement. \n15 This Court gives its final approval of the Settlement to the \namended class definition as approved in its Order Granting Motion \n16\nfor Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement: \n[A]ll persons whose SSI or SSDI benefits \n17\nwere either denied or terminated and for whom a \n18 consultative examination was prepared by Dr. Frank \nChen,  and  all  persons  who  received  a  partially \n19\nfavorable decision or determination on their claim \nfor SSI or SSDI benefits and for whom a consultative \n20\nexamination was prepared by Dr. Chen. \n21 (ECF No. 81 at 6-7.) \nDefendant will pay $490,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs to \n22\nPlaintiffs’ counsel Justice in Aging and Legal Aid Society of San \nMateo County. The Court finds that this award is fair and reasonable \n23\nin light of the nature of this Action, counsel’s experience and efforts \n24 in prosecuting and resolving this action, and the benefits obtained \nfor  the  Class.  Plaintiffs’  co-counsel,  Morrison  &  Foerster,  has \n25\nagreed to waive its fees and costs. \n26\nAlternatively, the parties request that the Court withdraw the Order in its entirety and enter the \n27\nAmended Proposed Order [ECF No. 85-1] that the parties submitted on March 1, 2017 in \n28\nconnection with Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval.
