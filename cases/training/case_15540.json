We do urge, however, that your review be confined to the question \nwhether the mandate has been carried out upon the record before this court.’ \n \n1  The Court’s opinion incorrectly states that we ‘ordered oral argument at which all parties concerned were afforded \n  an opportunity to be heard on the question whether there had been compliance with the mandate.’ Ante, at 1861. \nThe complete text of the Court’s order directing a hearing unequivocally shows that the parties were requested to \naddress themselves only to the motion filed by the State of Utah requesting permission to dismiss its appeal and \nthat the parties were not asked to argue the merits of the appeal: \n‘The motion of appellant to dismiss the appeal under Rule 60 and the motion of William M. Bennett for a hearing \nare set for oral argument on April 29, 1969. The Solicitor General is invited to file a brief and present oral argument \nif he so desires. Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart dissent, believing that the action taken by the Court \nabuses its own processes. See Rule 60. Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Fortas, and Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in \nthe consideration or decision of this matter.’ 394 U.S. 970, 89 S.Ct. 1453, 22 L.Ed.2d 751 (1969). Pursuant to the \nCourt’s order, the parties used their limited time for oral argument in an effort to satisfy the Court that they had \nacted properly in refusing to take an appeal from the District Court’s decision. No party presented any substantial \narguments on the merits of this case. \n \n2  See Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., supra; United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. \n  651, 84 S.Ct. 1044, 12 L.Ed.2d 12 (1964); cf. California v. Federal Power Commission, 369 U.S. 482, 82 S.Ct. 901, 8 \nL.Ed.2d 54 (1962). \n \n3  Rule 29 provided: \n \n‘Whenever the plaintiff and defendant in a writ of error pending in this court, or the appellant and appellee in any \nappeal, shall at any time hereafter, in vacation and out of term time, by their respective attorneys, who are entered \nas such on the record, sign and file with the clerk an agreement in writing, directing the case to be dismissed, and \nspecifying the terms upon which it is to be dismissed as to costs, and also paying to the clerk any fees that may be \ndue to him, it shall be the duty of the clerk to enter the case dismissed, and to give to either party which may \nrequest it a copy of the agreement filed; but no mandate or other process is to issue without an order by the court.’ \nWhile this rule by its terms provided for dismissal of cases only during vacation, there is no indication that a \ndifferent procedure was followed during the Term. Surely there would be little reason to permit automatic dismissal \n  8 \n \n\n \nduring vacation but forbid it at other times. \nRule 29, with minor amendments, was a part of the Court’s rules until July 1, 1954, when it was replaced by the \npresent Rule 60. \n \n4  It is of course perfectly appropriate for a court to make an independent judgment as to the merits of an antitrust \n  consent decree which the parties submit for approval. See, e.g., United States v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., \n1959 Trade Cas. 69,300, at 75,138 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.). For in the consent decree context, the parties are requesting \naffirmative action from the judiciary in order to resolve their dispute, while in the situation we confront, none of the \nparties are requesting further judicial relief. \n \n5  See In re Potts, 166 U.S. 263, 17 S.Ct. 520, 41 L.Ed. 994 (1897); cf. In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., 160 U.S. 247, 16 \n  S.Ct. 291, 40 L.Ed. 414 (1895); Ex parte The Union Steamboat Co., 178 U.S. 317, 20 S.Ct. 904, 44 L.Ed. 1084 (1900). \n \n6  The Court does not decide whether the papers opposing Utah’s motion to dismiss which were presented by John J. \n  Flynn and I. Daniel Stewart, as amicus curiae, and those tendered by William M. Bennett, as ‘consumer spokesman,’ \nmay be properly considered at this late stage in the proceedings. Since the Court does not reach this question, I do \nnot believe it appropriate to state my views on the matter; nor have I believed it proper to consider in any way the \narguments made by Messrs. Flynn, Stewart, and Bennett. \n \n7  These  conditions  were  approved  by  the  District  Court  on  November  7,  1968,  in  an  order  approving  the \n  Implementing Documents filed by the appropriate parties pursuant to Judge Chilson’s decision naming CIG as the \nsuccessful applicant. The Implementing Documents are a part of the record in this case. \nIn addition to the restrictions mentioned in the text, the District Court also forbade El Paso’s officers and directors as \nwell as their associates, from owning more than one-tenth of one percent of New Company stock for the next 10 \nyears; moreover, El Paso and its affiliates are forbidden to acquire any New Company or CIG stock at any time in the \nfuture. Steps have also been taken to assure that El Paso will have no officers or directors in common with New \nCompany or CIG. \n \n8  The Court relies heavily on United States v. E.I. du Pont De Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 81 S.Ct. 1243, 6 L.Ed.2d 318 \n  (1961), to support its claim that Cascade’s mandate has been breached. But du Pont only holds that the District \nCourt must assure itself that ‘the inter-corporate community of interest which we found to violate the law’ must be \ndissolved by divestiture. 366 U.S., at 331, 81 S.Ct. at 1253. Nothing in du Pont suggests, let alone holds, that a cash \nsale is the only way to accomplish this objective. Like Cascade, du Pont established no per se rule in this area. \n \n \n \n \n \n  9 \n ",

(Pacific Gas and Electric did not join in the statement.) \n \n4  The basis for this position was developed during the hearings on the allocation of gas reserves during which there \n  was evidence that of the reserves proposed to be divested to New Company in the San Juan Basin, there “may be” \n100,000 MCF per day, on an annual basis available to supply the unserved increments of demand in the California \nmarket. \nSouthern California Gas Company (So.Cal.) requested each applicant for acquisition to commit itself to sell this gas \nto So.Cal. at or near Ignacio, Colorado, and So.Cal. would arrange for its transportation to California through the El \nPaso Southern Division system. \nApco made a qualified acceptance to the extent of 40,000 MCF per day; Copaco committed itself only to file an \napplication with the Federal Power Commission for a certificate to sell at least 40,000 MCF per day; and Westco \nmade a commitment to sell 50,000 MCF per day. \nThe other applicants for acquisition did not refuse to consider So.Cal.’s offer, but refused to commit themselves at \nthis stage of the proceedings. On this basis, the five California intervenors took the position “No applicant who has \nnot made a definite, specific, and binding commitment to serve additional gas to California is qualified”. (Page 2, \nJoint Statement filed April 3, 1972.) \n \n5  “Roll Over of Debt” is the term used in the hearings to describe a division of El Paso’s debt between El Paso and New \n  Company. \n \n6  Webster’s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged and Black’s Law Dictionary Fourth Edition. \n \n \n7  The restrictive provisions will be negotiated between El Paso and the successful applicant subject to the approval of \n  the Court. These restrictive provisions will be no less restrictive than those adopted by the Court as a part of the \n1968 Decree. \n \n8  Plaintiff’s tentative plan of divestiture filed January 12, 1971, Pages 22-24 and Federal Power Commission staff brief \n  filed April 5, 1972, Pages 6 and 7. \n \n9  Apco states that this stock was privately placed and is held by a small number of institutional investors. A survey of a \n \n  20 \n \n\n \nmajority of these holders has confirmed the opinion that there would be no difficulty in effecting such exchange. \n \n10  Paradox and Banister proposed “book value” of the divested assets as the basis for reimbursement rather than “fair \n  market value” adopted by the Court. \n \n11  Under the modified Paradox Plan, El Paso would incur Federal taxes estimated from a minimum of $30 million to a \n  maximum of $77 million.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\nWhen this case was here the last time,' we held that\nthe acquisition of Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corpora-\ntion by El Paso Natural Gas Company violated § 7 of\nthe Clayton Act; and we directed the District Court \"to\norder divestiture without delay.\" United States v. El\nPaso Natural Gas Co., 376 U. S. 651, 662. That was on\nApril 6, 1964. It is now nearly three years later and,\nas we shall see, no divestiture in any meaningful sense\nhas been directed. The United States, now an appellee,\nmaintains that the issues respecting divestiture are not\n1 California v. Federal Power Commission, 369 U. S. 482, involved\nanother aspect of the same merger; and we held that the Commission\nshould not have approved it until the District Court decided whether\nit violated § 7 of the Clayton Act.\n\n•(cid:9) •\n2 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nbefore us. The threshold question does indeed involve\nanother matter. Appellants were denied intervention by\nthe District Court and came here by way of appeal.\n15 U. S. C. § 29. We noted probable jurisdiction. 382\nU. S. 970.\nThe initial question concerning intervention turns on a\nconstruction of Rule 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure entitled \"Intervention of Right.\" At the time\nthe District Court ruled on the motions that Rule pro-\nvided in relevant part, \"Upon timely application anyone\nshall be permitted to intervene in an action . . . (3) when\nthe applicant is so situated as to be adversely affected\nby . . . disposition of property which is in the custody\nor subject to the control or disposition of the court or\nan officer thereof.\" As amended effective July 1, 1966,\nsubsequent to the time these motions to intervene were\ndenied, Rule 24 (a) (2) provides that there may be inter-\nvention of right, \"when the applicant claims an interest\nrelating to the property or transaction which is the sub-\nject of the action and he is so situated that the disposi-\ntion of the action may as a practical matter impair or\nimpede his ability to protect that interest, unless the\napplicant's interest is adequately represented by existing\nparties.\"\nCalifornia, one of the appellants, is a State where El\nPaso sells most of its gas and its purpose in intervening\nwas to assure that Pacific Northwest, illegally merged\nwith El Paso, or its successor, would be restored as an\neffective competitor in California. As we noted in the\nprior opinion, Pacific Northwest had been \"a substantial\nfactor in the California market at the time it was acquired\nby El Paso.\" 376 U. S., at 658. It was to restore that\n\"competitive factor\" that divestiture was ordered.\nId., at 658-662. Southern California Edison, another\n\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 3\nappellant, is a large industrial user of natural gas pur-\nchasing from El Paso sources and desirous of retaining\ncompetition in California. Cascade Natural Gas is a dis-\ntributor in Oregon and Washington, and its sole supplier\nof natural gas was Pacific Northwest and will be the new\ncompany. Cascade maintains that there has been a\ngrossly unfair division of gas reserves between El Paso\nand the new company, particularly in the southwest field\nknown as the San Juan Basin. Moreover, the District\nCourt approved contracts between El Paso and the new\ncompany for delivery of gas both from Canada and from\nthe San Juan Basin, and allowed El Paso unilaterally and\nwithout application to the Federal Power Commission, to\nsaddle new and allegedly onerous prices and other condi-\ntions on the new company. Moreover, the stock of West\nCoast Transmission Co., Ltd., was ordered sold for the\nbenefit of El Paso. Pacific Northwest had owned about a\nfourth of West Coast Transmission's stock and that own-\nership gave Pacific Northwest, it is said, special insight\ninto and access to the Canadian gas supply. These fac-\ntors, implicating the ability of Pacific Northwest to per-\nform in the future, give Cascade, it is argued, standing to\nintervene.\nUnder old Rule 24 (a) (3) those \"adversely affected\"\nby a disposition of property would usually be those who\nhave an interest in the property.' But we cannot read it\nto mean exclusively that group.\nRule 24 (a) (3) was not merely a restatement of exist-\ning federal practice at law and in equity. If it had been,\nthere would be force in the argument that the rigidity\nof the older cases remains unaltered, restricting inter-\nvention as of right very narrowly, as for example where\nthere is a fund in court to which a third party asserts\n2 See Board of Com'rs v. Bernardin, 74 F. 2d 809, 816; Dowdy\nv. Haw field, 189 F. 2d 637, 638.\n\n4 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\na right that would be lost absent intervention. Credits\nCommutation Co. v. United States, 177 U. S. 311, 316;\nCentral Trust Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 218 F.\n336, 339. But the Advisory Committee stated that\nRule 24 \"amplifies and restates the present federal prac-\ntice at law and in equity.\" We therefore know that some\n3 \nelasticity was injected;  and the question is, how much.\nAs stated by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the\nCentral Trust Co. case, \"It is not always easy to draw\nthe line.\" Ibid.\nIn Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co. v. United States,\n312 U. S. 502, a consent decree was, entered in an anti-\ntrust suit, designed to protect Panhandle from Columbia\nwhich had acquired domination of the former to stifle\n3 In 1966 the Advisory Committee when making a revision of\nRule 24 (a) said:\n\"Rule 24 (a) (3) as amended in 1948 provided for intervention\nof right where the applicant established that he would be adversely\naffected by the distribution or disposition of property involved in\nan action to which he had not been made a party. Significantly,\nsome decided cases virtually disregarded the language of this pro-\nvision. Thus Professor Moore states: 'The concept of a fund has\nbeen applied so loosely that it is possible for a court to find a fund\nin almost any in personam action.' 4 Moore's Federal Practice\n¶ 24.09[3], at 55 (2d ed. 1962), and see, e. g., Formulabs, Inc. v.\nHartley Pen Co., 275 F. 2d 52 (9th Cir. 1960). This development\nwas quite natural, for Rule 24 (a) (3) was unduly restricted. If an\nabsentee would be substantially affected in a practical sense by the\ndetermination made in an action, he should, as a general rule, be\nentitled to intervene, and his right to do so should not depend on\nwhether there is a fund to be distributed or otherwise disposed of.\nIntervention of right is here seen to be a kind of counterpart to\nRule 19 (a) (2) (i) on joinder of persons needed for a just adjudica-\ntion: where, upon motion of a party in an action, an absentee should\nbe joined so that he may protect his interest which as a practical\nmatter may be substantially impaired by the disposition of the\naction, he ought to have a right to intervene in the action on his\nown motion. See Louisell & Harzar, Pleading and Procedure: State\nand Federal 749-50 (1962).\" 4 Moore's Federal Practice (1966\nSpec. Supp.), c. 24, pp. 1-2. (Italics added.)\n\n•\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 5\nits competition. The decree sought to assure opportuni-\nties for competition by Panhandle. A security holder\nof Panhandle sought to intervene on Panhandle's behalf\nwhen the consent decree was reopened and was denied\nthat right. We reversed, noting at the outset that \"the\ncircumstances under which interested outsiders should be\nallowed to become participants in a litigation is, barring\nvery special circumstances, a matter for the nisi pries\ncourt. But where the enforcement of a public law also\ndemands distinct safeguarding of private interests by\ngiving them a formal status in the decree, the power to\nenforce rights thus sanctioned is not left to the public\nauthorities nor put in the keeping of the district court's\ndiscretion.\" Id., at 506.\nWe noted that Panhandle's economic independence\nwas \"at the heart of the controversy.\" Ibid. In the\npresent case protection of California interests in a com-\npetitive system was at the heart of our mandate directing\ndivestiture. For it was the absorption of Pacific North-\nwest by El Paso that stifled that competition and disad-\nvantaged the California interests. It was indeed their\ninterests, as part of the public interest in a competitive\nsystem, that our mandate was designed to protect. In\nthat sense the present case is very close to Pipe Line Co.\nApart from that but in the spirit of Pipe Line Co. we\nthink these two appellants qualify as intervenors under\nRule 24 (a) (3). Certainly California and Southern Cali-\nfornia Edison are \"so situated\" geographically as to be\n\"adversely affected\" within the meaning of Rule 24 (a)(3)\nby a merger that reduces the competitive factor in nat-\nural gas available to Californians. We conclude that it\nwas error to deny them intervention. We need not decide\nwhether Cascade could have intervened as of right under\nthat Rule. For there is now in effect a new version of\nRule 24 (a) which in subsection (2) recognizes as a proper\nelement in intervention \"an interest\" in the \"transaction\nwhich is the subject of this action.\" This Rule applies to\n\n6 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\n\"further proceedings\" in pending actions. 384 U. S. 1031.\nSince the entire merits of the case must be reopened to\ngive California and Southern California Edison an oppor-\ntunity to be heard as of right as intervenors, we conclude\nthat the new Rule 24 (a)(2) is broad enough to include\nCascade also ; and as we shall see the \"existing parties\"\nhave fallen far short of representing its interests. We\ntherefore reverse the District Court in each of these ap-\npeals and remand with directions to allow each appellant\nto intervene as of right, to vacate the orders of divestiture\nand to have de novo hearings on the type of divestiture\nwe envisioned and made plain in our opinion in 376 U. S.\n651.\nII.\nThe necessity for new  hearings needs a word of\nexplanation.\nThe United States on oral argument stated that the\ndecree to which it agreed and which it urges us to ap-\nprove was made in \"settlement\" of the litigation. We\ndo not question the authority of the Attorney General\nto settle suits after, as well as before, they reach here.\nThe Department of Justice, however, by stipulation or\notherwise has no authority to circumscribe the power of\nthe courts to see that our mandate is carried out. No\none, except this Court, has authority to alter or modify\nour mandate. United States v. Du Pont & Co., 366 U. S.\n316, 325. Our direction was that the District Court pro-\nvide for \"divestiture without delay.\" That mandate in\nthe context of the opinion plainly meant that Pacific\nNorthwest or a new company be at once restored to a\nposition where it could compete with El Paso in the\nCalifornia market.\nWe do not undertake to write the decree. But we do\nsuggest guidelines that should be followed:\n(1) Gas Reserves. The gas reserves granted the new\ncompany must be no less in relation to present existing\n\n•(cid:9) •\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 7\nreserves than Pacific Northwest had when it was inde-\npendent; and the new gas reserves developed since the\nmerger must be equitably divided between El Paso and\nthe new company. We are told by the intervenors that\nEl Paso gets the new reserves in the San Juan Basin—\nwhich due to their geographical propinquity to California\nare critical to competition in that market. But the\nmerged company, which discovered them, represented\nthe interests both of El Paso and of Pacific Northwest.\nWe do not know what an equitable division would re-\nquire. Hearings are necessary, followed by meticulous\nfindings made in light of the competitive requirements\nto which we have adverted.\nAs already indicated, the proposed decree provides the\nterms of contracts 4 imposed on the new company re-\nspecting the purchase of gas from various sources. It is\nurged that these contracts are onerous, detrimental to\nthe new company, and partial to El Paso interests. We\ndo not pass upon the wisdom or desirability of the pro-\nposed contracts. It is enough to note that they were\nproposed by El Paso, that the changes, reluctantly ac-\nceded to by the Government, will redound to the sub-\nstantial benefit of El Paso, and that the new company\nhas had no opportunity to evaluate the advisability of\nthe terms or to negotiate for better terms. Nor has the\nFederal Power Commission had the opportunity to pass\n4 For example, one contract relates to reciprocal gas gathering\nbetween the new company and El Paso in the San Juan Basin.\nPrior to the merger El Paso and Pacific Northwest entered a con-\ntract providing that they would develop gathering lines in the basin\ncooperatively, and that whichever company made greater use of the\nother's gathering lines would pay a gathering charge of 1.3750 per\nMcf. of extra gas. El Paso did much more gathering for Pacific\nNorthwest than Pacific Northwest did for El Paso. The proposed\nagreement increases the gathering charge to 4.50. The intervenors\nclaim that the increased rate will substantially increase the new\ncompany's costs and impair its ability to compete.\n\n8 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nupon the contracts. The terms of these contracts should\nbe negotiated by the new company under such restric-\ntions as the Federal Power Act may impose.\n(2) Financial Aspects. As noted, El Paso is allowed\nto sell the stock of West Coast Transmission Co., Ltd.,\nbrought into the merger by Pacific Northwest, and keep\nthe proceeds, which if stock prices at the time of the\nproposed divestiture are considered might result, it is\nalleged, in a profit of $10,000,000 or more, while the new\ncompany gets the stock of Northwest Production Co.\nwhich from 1960-1963 showed heavy losses. It is charged\nthat by the proposed decree El Paso is saving the cream\nfor itself and foisting the \"cats and dogs\" on the new\ncompany. It is also earnestly argued that the new com-\npany will sorely need the valuable and fairly liquid stock\nof West Coast Transmission if it is to have the working\ncapital necessary to restore the competitive balance that\nthe merger destroyed. These are highly relevant argu-\nments. Certainly a plan of divestiture of the kind we\nenvisaged must establish a new company in the same or\ncomparable competitive position that Pacific Northwest\nwas in when the illegal merger obliterated it.\nIt is also pointed out that some $53,000,000 of tax-\nable losses which Pacific Northwest had were utilized\nby El Paso during the years following the ill-starred\nmerger. It is argued that since these tax loss carry-overs\nwere in a real sense an asset of Pacific Northwest utilized\nby El Paso, the new company should receive other assets\nor a reduction in debt of equivalent value. These allega-\ntions, if proven, require remuneration of some kind to the\nnew company. For it must be a viable, healthy unit, as\nable to compete as Pacific Northwest was when it was\nacquired by El Paso.\n(3) Control of El Paso. The divestiture decree pro-\nvides that El Paso is to cause the formation of the new\ncompany, whose chief executive shall be approved by\n\n•(cid:9) 41)\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 9\nEl Paso, the Government, and the court. The new com-\npany is to file an application with the Federal Power\nCommission \"at the earliest possible date\" requesting\nthe issuance of a certificate of public convenience and\nnecessity authorizing it to acquire, own, and operate the\nproperties to be received from El Paso.' When the neces-\nsary certificates, authorizations, and orders are obtained\nfrom the FPC, El Paso is to transfer to the new company\nthe properties and assets set forth in the plan of divesti-\nture, generally those which El Paso received from Pacific\nNorthwest. In return, the new company is to assume\ncertain of El Paso's indebtedness and issue to El Paso\nall its common stock. El Paso is to transfer the new\ncompany stock to the new company's chief executive,\nas voting trustee. The new company's chief executive\nshall release the stock only in accordance with the plan\nfor divestment of El Paso's interest in the stock. Under\nthe plan, El Paso is ordered completely to divest itself of\nall interest in the new company stock within three years\nafter the transfer of the assets to the new company.\nAlternate methods of divestment are provided. (1) El\nPaso may, within 18 months of the transfer, distribute\nat least 80% of the shares to holders of El Paso common\nstock who are willing to exchange their El Paso shares\nfor new company shares, and who shall own no other\nEl Paso shares immediately after the exchange. The\nremainder of new company stock would be disposed of\nby a public offering. (2) If El Paso does not dispose of\nthe new company stock under the first alternative, it is\nto dispose of the new company stock \"by one or more\nsales to the public.\" At such public offering no El Paso\nofficer or director and no owner of El Paso's capital stock,\n5 We are informed that the new company's chief executive has\nbeen approved and that the new company has applied to the Federal\nPower Commission for certification. The FPC proceedings have\nbeen continued until this Court has decided this appeal.\n\n10 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nin excess of one-half of one percent of the total shares\noutstanding, shall be permitted to purchase new company\nstock.6\nThus the El Paso-Pacific Northwest combination will\nnot begin to be severed until the regulatory approvals\nhave been obtained. Complete divestiture is not required\nuntil three years after the transfer of assets. An earlier\ndivestiture is permissible, but divestiture is mandatory\nonly after three years. During the interregnum between\nthe entry of the decree and the regulatory approvals, and\nbetween the transfer of assets and El Paso's eventual\ndisposition of the new company stock, El Paso will con-\ntinue to reap the benefits of the illegal combination.\nMoreover, prior to the eventual disposition of the new\ncompany stock, all the stock is to be voted by the new\ncompany chief executive. The chief executive is to\nbe approved by El Paso, and El Paso is the beneficial\nowner of the stock to be voted by him. Even though\nthe chief executive is subject to the ultimate control\nand supervision of the District Court, there is danger\nthat he may vote the new company stock in a manner\ncalculated to promulgate the very conditions which led\nus to order severance of the illegal combination.\nEven after the mandatory disposition of the new com-\npany stock there is considerable danger that El Paso in-\nterests may end up controlling the new company. The\ndecree, to be sure, provides that neither El Paso officers\nand directors nor owners of more than one-half of one\npercent of El Paso stock shall purchase new company\nstock at a public offering. But the decree does not pro-\n6 El Paso is also enjoined from having as an officer or director\nany person who is also an officer, director, or employee of the new\ncompany or who owns any capital stock of the new company or\nwhose immediate family owns more than one-tenth of one percent\nof the stock of the new company.\n\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 11\nhibit members of the families of such prohibited pur-\nchasers from obtaining new company stock. Further,\nunder the terms of the decree, it would be possible for a\ngroup of El Paso stockholders, each with less than one-\nhalf of one percent of El Paso stock, to acquire at the\ninitial public offering enough new company stock sub-\nstantially to influence or even to dominate the new com-\npany. Or, such a group could combine with the families\nof prohibited purchasers in order to control the new\ncompany. After the exchange or public offering, there is\nno restriction on the number of new company shares\nEl Paso shareholders may acquire. Thus, there is a\ndanger that major El Paso stockholders may, subsequent\nto the exchange or public offering, purchase large blocks\nof new company stock and obtain effective control. Thus,\nthere has been no studied attempt to ensure the swift\nseverance of the illegal combination or to make sure that\nthe new company's stock does not end up controlled by\nEl Paso interests. Disposition of all of the stock with\nall convenient speed is necessary and conditions must\nbe imposed to make sure that El Paso interests do not\nacquire a controlling interest. For if they do, the new\ncompany might well be only El Paso under the masquer-\nade of a beard.\nThe proposed decree by-passes completely the prospect\nof an outright purchase of the assets of the new company\nor its stock by outside interests. Two purchasers ap-\nparently are anxious and eager; and before the United\nStates knuckled under to El Paso and \"settled\" this litiga-\ntion, it represented to the District Court that a \"sale to a\nthird party is both a desirable and possible alternative to\nthe El Paso plan.\" No alternative of that kind was\nchosen.

That's what the root\nof this plan is.\n\"Now, if you're going to get New Company down\nhere in competition in Southern California from the\nSan Juan Basin, you'd upset the whole scheme. To\neven that situation up, you're going to have to put\nEl Paso up in the Northwest in competition there;\nand that's a kind of ridiculous thing—long pipelines\nfrom these various sources.\n\"It seems to me to make a lot of sense that New\nCompany operating in the Northwest from very\nmuch closer Canadian reserves, and Northwest re-\nserves, and El Paso down in the Southwest, with\nreserves in the San Juan Basin, serving the Southern\nCalifornia area, among some other areas. That\nseems to me to make a lot of sense.\"\nThe proposed decree in its various ramifications does\nprecisely that. It therefore does the opposite of what\nour prior opinion and mandate commanded.

Because\nI think the Court's answer to that question is wrong, and\nbecause I think the Court has gone further astray in\nundertaking to address itself to issues which are not here\nfor adjudication, I respectfully dissent.\nIntervention of right is governed by Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 24 (a). At the time the District Court\npassed on appellants' motions to intervene, that Rule\nprovided as follows:\n\"Rule 24. Intervention\n\"(a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely applica-\ntion anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an\naction : (1) when a statute of the United States con-\nThe Rule has since been amended. See p. 11, infra.\n\n2 CASCADE NAT.

No appellant claims\nany statutory right to intervene under 24 (a) (1). And\nit is clear that no appellant has any right to intervene\nunder 24 (a) (2), for in order to intervene under that\nprovision, the applicant for intervention must show that\nhe \"may be bound\" by the judgment in the Government's\naction in a res judicata sense.

And it is settled\nthat the judgment in a government suit has no res\njudicata effect on private antitrust claims. Sam Fox\nPublishing Co. v. United States, supra.\nThe Court, however, finds that the State of California\nand Southern California Edison Co. have an absolute\nright to intervene under 24 (a) (3). I disagree for several\nreasons.\nAnalysis of the Rule's proper scope must begin with\nan historical examination of intervention practice, for, as\nthe Court has stated, the Rule constitutes a \"codification\nof general doctrines of intervention.\" Missouri-Kansas\nPipe Line Co. v.

When a court\nacquired in rem jurisdiction over property, by admiralty\nlibel, sequestration, receivership, or other process, a per-\nson claiming title or some other legal or equitable interest\nwas allowed to come in to assert his claim to the property.\nOtherwise, he would have been subjected to the obvious\ninjustice of having his claim erased or impaired by the\ncourt's adjudication without ever being heard. Elements\nof this procedure were gradually assimilated in this coun-\ntry, e. g., Pennock v. Coe, 23 How. 117, and provided\nthe foundation for intervention doctrine in the federal\ncourts.'\nVarious generalizations about the nature of the prop-\nerty interest that will support intervention of right under\nthis doctrine have been attempted. This Court has\nstated that the requisite interest must be \"of such a direct\nand immediate character that the intervenor will either\ngain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of\nthe judgment.\" Smith v.

GAS.\nlations are of limited use in deciding particular cases.\nMore illuminating are examples of particular interests\nwhich have been held to support intervention of right\nunder the established practice. These have included the\nclaim of ownership in attached property,' the claim of a\npart owner to personal property being foreclosed under\na mortgage,' a mortgage lien on a leasehold interest\nsubjected to forfeiture,' and the claim of the purchaser\nof land involved in foreclosure proceedings against\nthe seller.' Interests like these have continued to pro-\nvide a familiar basis for intervention of right since the\npromulgation of Rule 24 (a) (3).9\nThe other traditional basis for intervention under\n24 (a) (3) derives from interpleader practice; when a\nnumber of persons possess claims to a fund which are\nor may be mutually exclusive, intervention is allowed a\nclaimant. Thus, in Oliver v. United States, 156 F. 2d 281\n(C. A. 8th Cir.), the United States had acquired cer-\ntain land and deposited the purchase price in court\nto be divided among the various owners.

Hartley Pen\nCo., 275 F. 2d 52 (C. A. 9th Cir.), cert. denied, 363 U. S.\n830. The applicant for intervention had licensed a secret\nmanufacturing process to one of the parties, and the\nother party was seeking to apply discovery to the proc-\ness. Finding that the trade secret was \"property\" sub-\nject to the court's control and that the secrecy which\nwas the heart of the applicant's interest in that property\nmight be totally destroyed, the court allowed intervention\nunder 24 (a) (3).\nBut the claims of California and the Southern Cali-\nfornia Edison Co. in these cases lie far beyond the reach\nof even the most imaginable construction of 24 (a) (3).\nTo be sure, the assets of El Paso are \"property which\nis in the custody or subject to the control or disposition\nof the court\" for purposes of the Rule. Sutphen Estates,\nInc. v. United States, 342 U. S. 19. But the \"interest\"\nin these assets relied upon by the appellants to justify\nintervention is merely their preference that certain of\nthe assets, particularly the San Juan Basin reserves, end\nup in the hands of New Company rather than El Paso,\non the theory that such an allocation may be conducive\nto greater gas competition in California. These general\nand indefinite interests do not even remotely resemble\nthe direct and concrete stake in litigation required for\nintervention of right. The Court's decision not only\noverturns established general principles of intervention,\nbut, as will be shown below in detail, also repudiates\na large and long-established body of decisions specifi-\ncally, and correctly, denying intervention in government\nantitrust litigation.\nThis Court is all too familiar with the fact that anti-\ntrust litigation is inherently protracted. Indeed, it is\njust such delay which seems to so concern the Court in\nthis case. But nothing could be better calculated to\n\n6 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nconfuse and prolong antitrust litigation than the rule\nwhich the Court today announces. The entrance of\nadditional parties into antitrust suits can only serve\nto multiply trial exhibits and testimony, and further\nconfound the attempt to bring order out of complicated\neconomic issues. For these reasons, federal courts have\nbeen most reluctant to grant intervention under 24 (a.)(3)\neven in private antitrust litigation. For example, in\nCommonwealth Edison Co. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,\n315 F. 2d 564 (C. A. 7th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U. S.\n834, the State of Illinois, representing consumers' in-\nterests in a possible rate rebate, was denied interven-\ntion in a suit brought by a utility charging equipment\nmanufacturers with price fixing.11\nThe reasons for denying intervention are even stronger\nwhen intervention is sought in an antitrust suit brought\nby the Government. To the extent that the would-be\nintervenor seeks to press his own private antitrust claims\nagainst the defendant, intervention must be denied be-\ncause Congress has carefully provided separate statutory\nprocedures for private and public antitrust litigation.\"\nAs the Court observed in United States v. Borden Co.,\n347 U. S. 514, 518-519, the thrust of the Clayton Act \"is\nsharply to distinguish between Government suits, either\ncriminal or civil, and private suits for injunctive relief\nor for treble damages. Different policy considerations\ngovern each of these. They may proceed simultaneously\n11 Cf. American Louisiana Pipe Line Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 158\nF. Supp. 13 (D. C. E. D. Mich.)

United States,\n366 U. S. 683, at 693. A fortiori, intervention is im-\nproper when a private party appears in order to vindi-\ncate his theory of the public interest in an action brought\nby the Government. For as the Court has consistently\nrecognized, it is the \"United States, which must alone\nspeak for the public interest\" in antitrust litigation.\nBuckeye Coal & Ry. Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., 269\nU. S. 42, 49.14 The appellants here seek intervention to\npress their own version of what the public interest in gas\ncompetition in California requires. But the determina-\ntion of what the public interest requires is the statutory\nduty and responsibility of the Government. The law ex-\nplicitly requires that suits brought by the Government for\ninjunctive relief shall be \"under the direction of the At-\ntorney General.\" 15 U. S. C. §§ 4 and 25. That statutory\ncommand is violated when private parties are allowed\nto intervene and control public suits.

Thus, in In re Engelhard & Sons Co., 231 U. S.\n646, intervention was denied to a subscriber seeking to\nenter a suit between a municipality and a telephone\nutility involving the validity of the city's rate ordinance\nand the disposition of rate overcharges. Similarly, in\nCity of New York v. Consolidated Gas Co. of New York,\n253 U. S. 219, and City of New York v. New York Tele-\nphone Co., 261 U. S. 312, the City of New York was not\nallowed to intervene on behalf of consumer residents of\nthe city in litigation between state authorities and public\nutilities over the validity of state rate regulation. The\nwise principle of those decisions is reflected in many\nother federal cases decided both before and after the\nadoption of Rule 24 (a) (3).\"\n15 O'Connell v.

Panhandle\nEastern Pipe Line Co. was a competitor of defendants charged by\nthe Government with improperly exercising control over Panhandle\nto weaken its threat as a competitor. A consent decree was nego-\ntiated to protect Panhandle's independence. The decree provided\nfor retention of jurisdiction by the court to enter such \"further orders\nand decrees\" as were necessary to carry out its purpose, and stated\nthat \"Panhandle Eastern, upon proper application, may become a\nparty hereto\" to protect its rights under the decree. When the\nGovernment later sought modifications of the decree, we held that\nthe decree gave Panhandle the right to intervene. The Court care-\nfully noted that this right to intervene was bottomed solely on the\nspecific provisions of the decree and not general principles of inter-\nvention: \"Its foundation is the consent decree. We are not here\ndealing with a conventional form of intervention . . . .\" 312 U. S.,\nat 506. The Court concluded, \"Therefore, the codification of general\ndoctrines of intervention contained in Rule 24 (a) does not touch\nour problem.\" 312 U. S., at 508.\n\n10 CASCADE NAT. GAS v.

Ball v. United States, 338 U. S. 802.\nThe results which follow from the Court's rejection of\nthe practical wisdom embodied in these decisions are\napparent. There were over 20 applications to intervene\nin the decree proceedings below. The Court's construc-\ntion of 24 (a) (3) would require the District Court to\ngrant most if not all of them. El Paso gas goes to\nmillions of consumers, and under the Court's decision\nany or all of them are entitled to intervene as of right.\nAnd there is nothing in the Court's opinion which sug-\ngests that this right to intervene is limited to litigation\nover remedy. If consumers and others have an interest\nin making sure that a government antitrust decree meets\ntheir standards of effectiveness, they have an even\ngreater interest in insuring that a violation is found.\nThus the Court's reasoning gives any consumer a right\nto intervene in government antitrust litigation at the\nvery outset. The Court invites a scope of intervention\nthat will make the delays in this case seem mercifully\nshort.\nThe Court's decision would not be of such concern,\nnor merit so much discussion, if it were simply limited\nto 24 (a) (3), a provision which has been superseded.\nBut the same approach which creates a right to inter-\n17 The policy behind these decisions was stated in United States\nv.

GAS. 11\nvene for California and the Southern California Edison\nCo. under the old Rule 24 (a) (3) appears in the Court's\nconstruction of the new Rule 24, under which it says\nCascade has a right to intervene. The New Rule 24 (a)(2)\nreplaces the previous Rule 24 (a)(2) and (3), and provides\nfor intervention of right:\n\"[W]hen the applicant claims an interest relating\nto the property or transaction which is the subject\nof the action and he is so situated that the disposi-\ntion of the action may as a practical matter impair\nor impede his ability to protect that interest, unless\nthe applicant's interest is adequately represented by\nexisting parties.\"\nThis and other amendments to the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure were promulgated by this Court to \"take\neffect on July 1, 1966, and . . . govern all proceedings in\nactions brought thereafter and also in all further pro-\nceedings in actions then pending . . . .\" 384 U. S. 1031.\nSince the District Court denied Cascade's motion to in-\ntervene in 1965, before the effective date of the amended\nRule, the new Rule was inapplicable to Cascade's mo-\ntion.ls But even if the new Rule were applicable, neither\nCascade nor the other appellants could claim intervention\nof right under it.\n18 In Klapprott v. United States, 335 U. S. 601, the petitioner\nsought to reopen a default judgment denaturalizing him, relying on\namendments to Rule 60 (b). Several Justices thought that the\npetitioner should be able to obtain relief under the amended Rule\neven though the District Court had denied the petitioner's applica-\ntion before the effective date of the amendments. Cascade's interest\nhere bears no resemblance to the extraordinary hardship and injus-\ntice claimed by the petitioner in Klapprott, where it could be per-\nsuasively argued that it was \"more consonant with equitable consid-\nerations to judge the case on the basis of the Rule now in force, even\nthough the lower court did not have the opportunity to apply it.\"\n335 U.

United States,\nsupra, and to give recognition to decisions such as\nFormulabs, Inc. v. Hartley Pen Co., supra, which had\nexpanded intervention under the former 24 (a) (3) beyond\nthe strict pro interesse suo model it embodied.' But an\napplicant is still required to have an \"interest\" in the\nlitigation sufficiently direct and immediate to justify his\nentry as a matter of right. The remote and general con-\ncerns that appellants State of California and Southern\nCalifornia Edison Co. have with this government suit\nhave already been discussed. And Cascade's interest is\neven more insubstantial. While it purchases gas from\nEl Paso in Oregon, it seeks intervention to vindicate gas\ncompetition in California.20 Even if it should be thought\nthat the amended Rule might encompass such remote\ninterests in some conceivable circumstances, it is clear\nthat such interests may never justify intervention of\nright in public antitrust litigation, where Congress has\ncarefully entrusted the conduct of government suits to\nthe \"direction of the Attorney General.\" But even if\nCascade should pass this hurdle, it would also have to\nshow that there was a failure of \"adequate representa-\ntion\" by the Justice Department in this case.\nThe Court states that the Government \"knuckled\nunder to El Paso\" and has \"fallen far short of represent-\ning\" Cascade's interest. Since the interest that Cascade\nclaims to be representing is that of the public, the Court\nis charging the Justice Department with dereliction of\nduty or serious incompetence. I regard this charge as\n19 See Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, Fed.

The Government did settle for less\nthan all the relief that it sought at the outset. But this\nis a wholly familiar phenomenon of negotiation. Bar-\ngaining for consent decrees and stipulated remedies is a\nnormal and necessary element in the Government's en-\nforcement of the antitrust laws. Moreover, it is perfectly\nconceivable that in the course of negotiations the Gov-\nernment may become aware of errors in its opening posi-\ntion. If, as the Court's opinion seems to suggest, the\nGovernment is required to press its original negotiating\nposition unceasingly and to the bitter end, the number\nof cases which the Government can afford to undertake\nwill be sharply reduced, and the enforcement of the anti-\ntrust laws will ultimately become less effective. And of\ncourse the delay in antitrust litigation, which so concerns\nthe Court, will markedly increase.\nThe Court's standard of \"adequate representation\"\ncomes down to this: If, after the existing parties have\nsettled a case or pursued litigation to the end, some vol-\nunteer comes along who disagrees with the parties' assess-\nment of the issues or the way they have pursued their\nrespective interests, intervention must be granted to that\nvolunteer as of right. This strange standard is not only\nunprecedented and unwise; it is also unworkable.\nThe requirement of inadequate representation by exist-\ning parties as a precondition of the right to intervene\nunder the new Rule 24 is obviously an adaptation of the\nsimilar standard contained in the former 24 (a) (2). De-\ncisions under that standard allowed intervention of right\nwhen the intervenor could show a conflict of interest\nbetween himself and the party supposed to represent his\ninterest,21 a complete failure of representation by existing\n21 Pyle-National Co. v.

The Court's approach draws judges into\nthe adversary arena and forces them into the impossible\nposition of trying to second-guess the parties in the pur-\nsuit of their own interests. It is also wasteful and pro-\nductive of delay, because under this strange standard a\nperson's right to intervene in litigation cannot be ascer-\ntained until that litigation is concluded and the existing\nparties' conduct evaluated.\nWrong as the Court's approach is with respect to liti-\ngation generally, it is even more wrong when a would-be\nintervenor seeks to challenge the adequacy of the Gov-\nernment's representation of the public interest. The\nseparation of powers in our federal system generates prin-\nciples that make it peculiarly inappropriate for courts to\nassume the role of supervision over policy decisions of\nthe Executive. Yet the Court presumes to tell the Jus-\ntice Department that it made tactical errors in conducting\nlitigation, failed in its assessment of the public interest,\n22 Pellegrino v.

This\nCourt does not have the constitutional power to second-\nguess decisions of the Attorney General made within the\nbounds of his official discretion. That is the responsi-\nbility of the President and, ultimately, the electorate.\nIn words appropriate here, we long ago stated in the\ncontext of an attack on the Government's settlement of\nan antitrust case : \". . . we do not find in the statutes\ndefining the powers and duties of the Attorney General\nany such limitation on the exercise of his discretion as\nthis contention involves. His authority to make deter-\nminations includes the power to make erroneous decisions\nas well as correct ones.\" Swift & Co. v. United States,\n276 U. S. 311, 331-332. The Court today gives only lip\nservice to these principles. It states that \"We do not\nquestion the authority of the Attorney General to settle\nsuits after, as well as before, they reach here.\" Ante, at\n—. But it then proceeds to take the direction of a gov-\nernment lawsuit out of the hands of the Attorney General\nand into its own.\nThe Court relies on the fact that we have previously\nrendered a judgment in this case and cites dictum from\nthe opinion in United States v. E. I. DuPont & Co., 366\nU. S. 316, to justify the extraordinary course it takes.\nBut in the absence of outright fraud, it has never been\nthought that the fact that parties have initially resorted\nto the courts gives judges power to set aside later settle-\nment agreements and impose others on the parties. And\ncertainly when it is the Executive Branch of the Govern-\nment that has made the settlement as representative of\nthe public interest, only the grossest bad faith or malfea-\nsance on its part could possibly support such a step.\nEither the Court is saying the Government was guilty of\nsuch misconduct—a charge totally without support in\nthe record—or the Court has grossly overreached the per-\nmissible limit of judicial power.\n\n16 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nNot only concern for the constitutional position of\nthis Court, but more directly pragmatic considerations\nunderlie my disagreement with today's decision. To\npermit volunteers to intervene and second-guess the\nJustice Department is especially inappropriate when the\nissues involved, like those in the antitrust field, require\ntechnical experience and an assessment and balancing of\ninterests essentially administrative and political. Formu-\nlation of effective and consistent government antitrust\npolicy is unlikely to result from \"piecemeal intervention\nof a multitude of individual complainants\" 25 in litigation\nbrought by the Government. Less than six years ago we\nfully recognized this principle:\nit\n. . . sound policy would strongly lead us to decline\n[the] invitation to assess the wisdom of the Gov-\nernment's judgment in negotiating and accepting\nthe . . . consent decree, at least in the absence of\nany claim of bad faith or malfeasance on the part\nof the Government in so acting.\" Sam Fox Pub-\nlishing Co. v.

The District Court did not err in deny-\ning intervention to the appellants,\" and these appeals\nshould therefore be dismissed.'\nBut even if I am completely wrong, and the Court\nis right in concluding that the District Court erred' in\ndenying appellants the right to intervene, the proper\ncourse would be simply to remand the case to the Dis-\ntrict Court so that the appellants' contentions may be\nmet by the Government or El Paso and passed on by a\ntrial court that is intimately familiar with the massive\nrecord in this case. Instead, the Court brushes aside the\n\"threshold\" question of appellants' right to intervene\nin a few pages and devotes most of its opinion to pro-\nnouncements on gas reserves, delivery contracts, and\nother intricacies of gas competition in the western United\nStates. These issues were never the subject of adversary\nproceedings in the District Court. They were never\nresolved through findings by the District Court. Ap-\npellees did not directly brief or argue them before this\nCourt. On the basis of what are in effect ex parte criti-\ncisms of the decree entered below, the Court lays down\n\"guidelines\" with respect to complex issues which will\nshape the future of an important segment of this Na-\n27 The appellants also seek to challenge the District Court's denial\nof their motions for permissive intervention under Rule 24 (b).

In so doing the Court roams at large,\nunconfined by anything so mundane as a factual record\ndeveloped in adversary proceedings.\n\"The obvious must be restated. We do not sit to\ndraft antitrust decrees de novo. This is a court of\nappeal, not a trial court. We do not see the wit-\nnesses, sift the evidence in detail, or appraise the\ncourse of extended argument . . . . In short, this\nCourt does not partake of the procedure and is not\ncharged with the responsibility demanded of the\ncourt entrusted with the task of devising the details\nof a decree appropriate for the governance of a\nvastly complicated situation arising out of unique\ncircumstances.\" United States v. E. I. DuPont &\nCo., 366 U. S. 316, 371 (dissenting opinion).\nThe Court has decided this case on little more than\nrepugnance for \"the attitude or philosophy of the Dis-\ntrict Court\" and the unjustified and extraordinarily op-\nprobrious conclusion that the Government \"knuckled\nunder.\" This is not a happy foundation for radical ex-\ntensions of intervention doctrine. And it is not a proper\nbasis for deciding how stock in the New Company should\nbe marketed, or how gas reserves in New Mexico should\nbe divided. In its zeal to censure the District Judge and\nreprimand the Justice Department, the Court has rushed\nheadlong into a jurisprudential quagmire far more dan-\ngerous than the \"evil\" it purports to discern in the decree\nentered by the trial court.\nFinally, I must note my emphatic disagreement with\nthe Court's extraordinary action in directing that further\nproceedings in this case must be conducted by a different\ndistrict judge. Federal reviewing courts have taken this\nserious step only in the rarest circumstances, when the\ntrial judge's personal or emotional involvement in a case\nhas been demonstrated. See Offutt v.

C. § 29. We noted probable jurisdiction. 382\nU. S. 970.\nThe initial question concerning intervention turns on a\nconstruction of Rule 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure entitled \"Intervention of Right.\" At the time\nthe District Court ruled on the motions that Rule pro-\nvided in relevant part, \"Upon timely application anyone\nshall be permitted to intervene in an action . . . (3) when\nthe applicant is so situated as to be adversely affected\nby . . . disposition of property which is in the custody\nor subject to the control or disposition of the court or\nan officer thereof.\" As amended effective July 1, 1966,\nsubsequent to the time these motions to intervene were\ndenied, Rule 24 (a) (2) provides that there may be inter-\nvention of right, \"when the applicant claims an interest\nrelating to the property or transaction which is the sub-\nject of the action and he is so situated that the disposi-\ntion of the action may as a practical matter impair or\nimpede his ability to protect that interest, unless the\napplicant's interest is adequately represented by existing\nparties.\"\nCalifornia, one of the appellants, is a State where El\nPaso sells most of its gas and its purpose in intervening\nwas to assure that Pacific Northwest, illegally merged\nwith El Paso, or its successor, would be restored as an\neffective competitor in California. As we noted in the\nprior opinion, Pacific Northwest had been \"a substantial\nfactor in the California market at the time it was acquired\nby El Paso.\" 376 U. S., at 658. It was to restore that\n\"competitive factor\" that divestiture was ordered.\nId., at 658-662. Southern California Edison, another\n\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 3\nappellant, is a large industrial user of natural gas pur-\nchasing from El Paso sources and desirous of retaining\ncompetition in California. Cascade Natural Gas is a dis-\ntributor in Oregon and Washington, and its sole supplier\nof natural gas was Pacific Northwest and will be the new\ncompany. Cascade maintains that there has been a\ngrossly unfair division of gas reserves between El Paso\nand the new company, particularly in the southwest field\nknown as the San Juan Basin. Moreover, the District\nCourt approved contracts between El Paso and the new\ncompany for delivery of gas both from Canada and from\nthe San Juan Basin, and allowed El Paso unilaterally and\nwithout application to the Federal Power Commission, to\nsaddle new and allegedly onerous prices and other condi-\ntions on the new company. Moreover, the stock of West\nCoast Transmission Co., Ltd., was ordered sold for the\nbenefit of El Paso. Pacific Northwest had owned about a\nfourth of West Coast Transmission's stock and that own-\nership gave Pacific Northwest, it is said, special insight\ninto and access to the Canadian gas supply. These fac-\ntors, implicating the ability of Pacific Northwest to per-\nform in the future, give Cascade, it is argued, standing to\nintervene.\nUnder old Rule 24 (a) (3) those \"adversely affected\"\nby a disposition of property would usually be those who\nhave an interest in the property.' But we cannot read it\nto mean exclusively that group.\nRule 24 (a) (3) was not merely a restatement of exist-\ning federal practice at law and in equity. If it had been,\nthere would be force in the argument that the rigidity\nof the older cases remains unaltered, restricting inter-\nvention as of right very narrowly, as for example where\nthere is a fund in court to which a third party asserts\n2 See Board of Com'rs v. Bernardin, 74 F. 2d 809, 816; Dowdy\nv. Haw field, 189 F. 2d 637, 638.\n\n4 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\na right that would be lost absent intervention. Credits\nCommutation Co. v. United States, 177 U. S. 311, 316;\nCentral Trust Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 218 F.\n336, 339. But the Advisory Committee stated that\nRule 24 \"amplifies and restates the present federal prac-\ntice at law and in equity.\" We therefore know that some\n3 \nelasticity was injected;  and the question is, how much.\nAs stated by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the\nCentral Trust Co. case, \"It is not always easy to draw\nthe line.\" Ibid.\nIn Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co. v. United States,\n312 U. S. 502, a consent decree was, entered in an anti-\ntrust suit, designed to protect Panhandle from Columbia\nwhich had acquired domination of the former to stifle\n3 In 1966 the Advisory Committee when making a revision of\nRule 24 (a) said:\n\"Rule 24 (a) (3) as amended in 1948 provided for intervention\nof right where the applicant established that he would be adversely\naffected by the distribution or disposition of property involved in\nan action to which he had not been made a party. Significantly,\nsome decided cases virtually disregarded the language of this pro-\nvision. Thus Professor Moore states: 'The concept of a fund has\nbeen applied so loosely that it is possible for a court to find a fund\nin almost any in personam action.' 4 Moore's Federal Practice\n¶ 24.09[3], at 55 (2d ed. 1962), and see, e. g., Formulabs, Inc. v.\nHartley Pen Co., 275 F. 2d 52 (9th Cir. 1960). This development\nwas quite natural, for Rule 24 (a) (3) was unduly restricted. If an\nabsentee would be substantially affected in a practical sense by the\ndetermination made in an action, he should, as a general rule, be\nentitled to intervene, and his right to do so should not depend on\nwhether there is a fund to be distributed or otherwise disposed of.\nIntervention of right is here seen to be a kind of counterpart to\nRule 19 (a) (2) (i) on joinder of persons needed for a just adjudica-\ntion: where, upon motion of a party in an action, an absentee should\nbe joined so that he may protect his interest which as a practical\nmatter may be substantially impaired by the disposition of the\naction, he ought to have a right to intervene in the action on his\nown motion. See Louisell & Harzar, Pleading and Procedure: State\nand Federal 749-50 (1962).\" 4 Moore's Federal Practice (1966\nSpec. Supp.), c. 24, pp. 1-2. (Italics added.)\n\n•\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 5\nits competition. The decree sought to assure opportuni-\nties for competition by Panhandle. A security holder\nof Panhandle sought to intervene on Panhandle's behalf\nwhen the consent decree was reopened and was denied\nthat right. We reversed, noting at the outset that \"the\ncircumstances under which interested outsiders should be\nallowed to become participants in a litigation is, barring\nvery special circumstances, a matter for the nisi pries\ncourt. But where the enforcement of a public law also\ndemands distinct safeguarding of private interests by\ngiving them a formal status in the decree, the power to\nenforce rights thus sanctioned is not left to the public\nauthorities nor put in the keeping of the district court's\ndiscretion.\" Id., at 506.\nWe noted that Panhandle's economic independence\nwas \"at the heart of the controversy.\" Ibid. In the\npresent case protection of California interests in a com-\npetitive system was at the heart of our mandate directing\ndivestiture. For it was the absorption of Pacific North-\nwest by El Paso that stifled that competition and disad-\nvantaged the California interests. It was indeed their\ninterests, as part of the public interest in a competitive\nsystem, that our mandate was designed to protect. In\nthat sense the present case is very close to Pipe Line Co.\nApart from that but in the spirit of Pipe Line Co. we\nthink these two appellants qualify as intervenors under\nRule 24 (a) (3). Certainly California and Southern Cali-\nfornia Edison are \"so situated\" geographically as to be\n\"adversely affected\" within the meaning of Rule 24 (a)(3)\nby a merger that reduces the competitive factor in nat-\nural gas available to Californians. We conclude that it\nwas error to deny them intervention. We need not decide\nwhether Cascade could have intervened as of right under\nthat Rule. For there is now in effect a new version of\nRule 24 (a) which in subsection (2) recognizes as a proper\nelement in intervention \"an interest\" in the \"transaction\nwhich is the subject of this action.\" This Rule applies to\n\n6 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\n\"further proceedings\" in pending actions. 384 U. S. 1031.\nSince the entire merits of the case must be reopened to\ngive California and Southern California Edison an oppor-\ntunity to be heard as of right as intervenors, we conclude\nthat the new Rule 24 (a)(2) is broad enough to include\nCascade also ; and as we shall see the \"existing parties\"\nhave fallen far short of representing its interests. We\ntherefore reverse the District Court in each of these ap-\npeals and remand with directions to allow each appellant\nto intervene as of right, to vacate the orders of divestiture\nand to have de novo hearings on the type of divestiture\nwe envisioned and made plain in our opinion in 376 U. S.\n651.\nII.\nThe necessity for new  hearings needs a word of\nexplanation.\nThe United States on oral argument stated that the\ndecree to which it agreed and which it urges us to ap-\nprove was made in \"settlement\" of the litigation. We\ndo not question the authority of the Attorney General\nto settle suits after, as well as before, they reach here.\nThe Department of Justice, however, by stipulation or\notherwise has no authority to circumscribe the power of\nthe courts to see that our mandate is carried out. No\none, except this Court, has authority to alter or modify\nour mandate. United States v. Du Pont & Co., 366 U. S.\n316, 325. Our direction was that the District Court pro-\nvide for \"divestiture without delay.\" That mandate in\nthe context of the opinion plainly meant that Pacific\nNorthwest or a new company be at once restored to a\nposition where it could compete with El Paso in the\nCalifornia market.\nWe do not undertake to write the decree. But we do\nsuggest guidelines that should be followed:\n(1) Gas Reserves. The gas reserves granted the new\ncompany must be no less in relation to present existing\n\n•(cid:9) •\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 7\nreserves than Pacific Northwest had when it was inde-\npendent; and the new gas reserves developed since the\nmerger must be equitably divided between El Paso and\nthe new company. We are told by the intervenors that\nEl Paso gets the new reserves in the San Juan Basin—\nwhich due to their geographical propinquity to California\nare critical to competition in that market. But the\nmerged company, which discovered them, represented\nthe interests both of El Paso and of Pacific Northwest.\nWe do not know what an equitable division would re-\nquire. Hearings are necessary, followed by meticulous\nfindings made in light of the competitive requirements\nto which we have adverted.\nAs already indicated, the proposed decree provides the\nterms of contracts 4 imposed on the new company re-\nspecting the purchase of gas from various sources. It is\nurged that these contracts are onerous, detrimental to\nthe new company, and partial to El Paso interests. We\ndo not pass upon the wisdom or desirability of the pro-\nposed contracts. It is enough to note that they were\nproposed by El Paso, that the changes, reluctantly ac-\nceded to by the Government, will redound to the sub-\nstantial benefit of El Paso, and that the new company\nhas had no opportunity to evaluate the advisability of\nthe terms or to negotiate for better terms. Nor has the\nFederal Power Commission had the opportunity to pass\n4 For example, one contract relates to reciprocal gas gathering\nbetween the new company and El Paso in the San Juan Basin.\nPrior to the merger El Paso and Pacific Northwest entered a con-\ntract providing that they would develop gathering lines in the basin\ncooperatively, and that whichever company made greater use of the\nother's gathering lines would pay a gathering charge of 1.3750 per\nMcf. of extra gas. El Paso did much more gathering for Pacific\nNorthwest than Pacific Northwest did for El Paso. The proposed\nagreement increases the gathering charge to 4.50. The intervenors\nclaim that the increased rate will substantially increase the new\ncompany's costs and impair its ability to compete.\n\n8 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nupon the contracts. The terms of these contracts should\nbe negotiated by the new company under such restric-\ntions as the Federal Power Act may impose.\n(2) Financial Aspects. As noted, El Paso is allowed\nto sell the stock of West Coast Transmission Co., Ltd.,\nbrought into the merger by Pacific Northwest, and keep\nthe proceeds, which if stock prices at the time of the\nproposed divestiture are considered might result, it is\nalleged, in a profit of $10,000,000 or more, while the new\ncompany gets the stock of Northwest Production Co.\nwhich from 1960-1963 showed heavy losses. It is charged\nthat by the proposed decree El Paso is saving the cream\nfor itself and foisting the \"cats and dogs\" on the new\ncompany. It is also earnestly argued that the new com-\npany will sorely need the valuable and fairly liquid stock\nof West Coast Transmission if it is to have the working\ncapital necessary to restore the competitive balance that\nthe merger destroyed. These are highly relevant argu-\nments. Certainly a plan of divestiture of the kind we\nenvisaged must establish a new company in the same or\ncomparable competitive position that Pacific Northwest\nwas in when the illegal merger obliterated it.\nIt is also pointed out that some $53,000,000 of tax-\nable losses which Pacific Northwest had were utilized\nby El Paso during the years following the ill-starred\nmerger. It is argued that since these tax loss carry-overs\nwere in a real sense an asset of Pacific Northwest utilized\nby El Paso, the new company should receive other assets\nor a reduction in debt of equivalent value. These allega-\ntions, if proven, require remuneration of some kind to the\nnew company. For it must be a viable, healthy unit, as\nable to compete as Pacific Northwest was when it was\nacquired by El Paso.\n(3) Control of El Paso.

The new com-\npany is to file an application with the Federal Power\nCommission \"at the earliest possible date\" requesting\nthe issuance of a certificate of public convenience and\nnecessity authorizing it to acquire, own, and operate the\nproperties to be received from El Paso.' When the neces-\nsary certificates, authorizations, and orders are obtained\nfrom the FPC, El Paso is to transfer to the new company\nthe properties and assets set forth in the plan of divesti-\nture, generally those which El Paso received from Pacific\nNorthwest. In return, the new company is to assume\ncertain of El Paso's indebtedness and issue to El Paso\nall its common stock. El Paso is to transfer the new\ncompany stock to the new company's chief executive,\nas voting trustee. The new company's chief executive\nshall release the stock only in accordance with the plan\nfor divestment of El Paso's interest in the stock. Under\nthe plan, El Paso is ordered completely to divest itself of\nall interest in the new company stock within three years\nafter the transfer of the assets to the new company.\nAlternate methods of divestment are provided. (1) El\nPaso may, within 18 months of the transfer, distribute\nat least 80% of the shares to holders of El Paso common\nstock who are willing to exchange their El Paso shares\nfor new company shares, and who shall own no other\nEl Paso shares immediately after the exchange. The\nremainder of new company stock would be disposed of\nby a public offering. (2) If El Paso does not dispose of\nthe new company stock under the first alternative, it is\nto dispose of the new company stock \"by one or more\nsales to the public.\" At such public offering no El Paso\nofficer or director and no owner of El Paso's capital stock,\n5 We are informed that the new company's chief executive has\nbeen approved and that the new company has applied to the Federal\nPower Commission for certification.

GAS.\nin excess of one-half of one percent of the total shares\noutstanding, shall be permitted to purchase new company\nstock.6\nThus the El Paso-Pacific Northwest combination will\nnot begin to be severed until the regulatory approvals\nhave been obtained. Complete divestiture is not required\nuntil three years after the transfer of assets. An earlier\ndivestiture is permissible, but divestiture is mandatory\nonly after three years. During the interregnum between\nthe entry of the decree and the regulatory approvals, and\nbetween the transfer of assets and El Paso's eventual\ndisposition of the new company stock, El Paso will con-\ntinue to reap the benefits of the illegal combination.\nMoreover, prior to the eventual disposition of the new\ncompany stock, all the stock is to be voted by the new\ncompany chief executive. The chief executive is to\nbe approved by El Paso, and El Paso is the beneficial\nowner of the stock to be voted by him. Even though\nthe chief executive is subject to the ultimate control\nand supervision of the District Court, there is danger\nthat he may vote the new company stock in a manner\ncalculated to promulgate the very conditions which led\nus to order severance of the illegal combination.\nEven after the mandatory disposition of the new com-\npany stock there is considerable danger that El Paso in-\nterests may end up controlling the new company. The\ndecree, to be sure, provides that neither El Paso officers\nand directors nor owners of more than one-half of one\npercent of El Paso stock shall purchase new company\nstock at a public offering. But the decree does not pro-\n6 El Paso is also enjoined from having as an officer or director\nany person who is also an officer, director, or employee of the new\ncompany or who owns any capital stock of the new company or\nwhose immediate family owns more than one-tenth of one percent\nof the stock of the new company.\n\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 11\nhibit members of the families of such prohibited pur-\nchasers from obtaining new company stock. Further,\nunder the terms of the decree, it would be possible for a\ngroup of El Paso stockholders, each with less than one-\nhalf of one percent of El Paso stock, to acquire at the\ninitial public offering enough new company stock sub-\nstantially to influence or even to dominate the new com-\npany. Or, such a group could combine with the families\nof prohibited purchasers in order to control the new\ncompany. After the exchange or public offering, there is\nno restriction on the number of new company shares\nEl Paso shareholders may acquire. Thus, there is a\ndanger that major El Paso stockholders may, subsequent\nto the exchange or public offering, purchase large blocks\nof new company stock and obtain effective control. Thus,\nthere has been no studied attempt to ensure the swift\nseverance of the illegal combination or to make sure that\nthe new company's stock does not end up controlled by\nEl Paso interests. Disposition of all of the stock with\nall convenient speed is necessary and conditions must\nbe imposed to make sure that El Paso interests do not\nacquire a controlling interest. For if they do, the new\ncompany might well be only El Paso under the masquer-\nade of a beard.\nThe proposed decree by-passes completely the prospect\nof an outright purchase of the assets of the new company\nor its stock by outside interests. Two purchasers ap-\nparently are anxious and eager; and before the United\nStates knuckled under to El Paso and \"settled\" this litiga-\ntion, it represented to the District Court that a \"sale to a\nthird party is both a desirable and possible alternative to\nthe El Paso plan.\" No alternative of that kind was\nchosen. El Paso carried the day, obtained a decree that\npromises to perpetuate rather than terminate this un-\nlawful merger, and that threatens to turn loose on the\n\n12 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\npublic a new company unable to maintain the competi-\ntive role that Pacific Northwest filled before this illegal\ntransaction took place.\nThe convenience of El Paso would be the easier choice.\nThe enforcement of our mandate and § 7 of the Clayton\nAct is the harder one; but that is the criterion we follow.\nThe evil with which the proposed decree is permeated\nreflects the attitude or philosophy of the District Court\nwhich was frankly stated after our remand as follows:\n\"The Court: You see, what this plan proposes is\na division of the country, a division of the market, a\ndivision of the reserves, one area to New Company\nand another area to El Paso. That's what the root\nof this plan is.\n\"Now, if you're going to get New Company down\nhere in competition in Southern California from the\nSan Juan Basin, you'd upset the whole scheme. To\neven that situation up, you're going to have to put\nEl Paso up in the Northwest in competition there;\nand that's a kind of ridiculous thing—long pipelines\nfrom these various sources.\n\"It seems to me to make a lot of sense that New\nCompany operating in the Northwest from very\nmuch closer Canadian reserves, and Northwest re-\nserves, and El Paso down in the Southwest, with\nreserves in the San Juan Basin, serving the Southern\nCalifornia area, among some other areas. That\nseems to me to make a lot of sense.\"\nThe proposed decree in its various ramifications does\nprecisely that. It therefore does the opposite of what\nour prior opinion and mandate commanded.

Because\nI think the Court's answer to that question is wrong, and\nbecause I think the Court has gone further astray in\nundertaking to address itself to issues which are not here\nfor adjudication, I respectfully dissent.\nIntervention of right is governed by Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 24 (a). At the time the District Court\npassed on appellants' motions to intervene, that Rule\nprovided as follows:\n\"Rule 24. Intervention\n\"(a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely applica-\ntion anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an\naction : (1) when a statute of the United States con-\nThe Rule has since been amended. See p. 11, infra.\n\n2 CASCADE NAT.

No appellant claims\nany statutory right to intervene under 24 (a) (1). And\nit is clear that no appellant has any right to intervene\nunder 24 (a) (2), for in order to intervene under that\nprovision, the applicant for intervention must show that\nhe \"may be bound\" by the judgment in the Government's\naction in a res judicata sense.

And it is settled\nthat the judgment in a government suit has no res\njudicata effect on private antitrust claims. Sam Fox\nPublishing Co. v. United States, supra.\nThe Court, however, finds that the State of California\nand Southern California Edison Co. have an absolute\nright to intervene under 24 (a) (3). I disagree for several\nreasons.\nAnalysis of the Rule's proper scope must begin with\nan historical examination of intervention practice, for, as\nthe Court has stated, the Rule constitutes a \"codification\nof general doctrines of intervention.\" Missouri-Kansas\nPipe Line Co. v. United States, 312 U. S. 502, 508.2 In-\n2 This statement is confirmed by the Rules Advisory Committee,\nwhich observed that the Rule \"amplifies and restates the present\nfederal practice at law and in equity.\" Advisory Committee on\nRules for Civil Procedure, Notes 25 (March 1938).\n\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 3\ntervention to assert an interest in property within the\ncourt's control or custody derives from the English doc-\ntrine of appearance pro interesse suo. When a court\nacquired in rem jurisdiction over property, by admiralty\nlibel, sequestration, receivership, or other process, a per-\nson claiming title or some other legal or equitable interest\nwas allowed to come in to assert his claim to the property.\nOtherwise, he would have been subjected to the obvious\ninjustice of having his claim erased or impaired by the\ncourt's adjudication without ever being heard. Elements\nof this procedure were gradually assimilated in this coun-\ntry, e. g., Pennock v. Coe, 23 How. 117, and provided\nthe foundation for intervention doctrine in the federal\ncourts.'\nVarious generalizations about the nature of the prop-\nerty interest that will support intervention of right under\nthis doctrine have been attempted. This Court has\nstated that the requisite interest must be \"of such a direct\nand immediate character that the intervenor will either\ngain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of\nthe judgment.\" Smith v.

GAS.\nlations are of limited use in deciding particular cases.\nMore illuminating are examples of particular interests\nwhich have been held to support intervention of right\nunder the established practice. These have included the\nclaim of ownership in attached property,' the claim of a\npart owner to personal property being foreclosed under\na mortgage,' a mortgage lien on a leasehold interest\nsubjected to forfeiture,' and the claim of the purchaser\nof land involved in foreclosure proceedings against\nthe seller.' Interests like these have continued to pro-\nvide a familiar basis for intervention of right since the\npromulgation of Rule 24 (a) (3).9\nThe other traditional basis for intervention under\n24 (a) (3) derives from interpleader practice; when a\nnumber of persons possess claims to a fund which are\nor may be mutually exclusive, intervention is allowed a\nclaimant. Thus, in Oliver v. United States, 156 F. 2d 281\n(C. A. 8th Cir.), the United States had acquired cer-\ntain land and deposited the purchase price in court\nto be divided among the various owners.

Hartley Pen\nCo., 275 F. 2d 52 (C. A. 9th Cir.), cert. denied, 363 U. S.\n830. The applicant for intervention had licensed a secret\nmanufacturing process to one of the parties, and the\nother party was seeking to apply discovery to the proc-\ness. Finding that the trade secret was \"property\" sub-\nject to the court's control and that the secrecy which\nwas the heart of the applicant's interest in that property\nmight be totally destroyed, the court allowed intervention\nunder 24 (a) (3).\nBut the claims of California and the Southern Cali-\nfornia Edison Co. in these cases lie far beyond the reach\nof even the most imaginable construction of 24 (a) (3).\nTo be sure, the assets of El Paso are \"property which\nis in the custody or subject to the control or disposition\nof the court\" for purposes of the Rule. Sutphen Estates,\nInc. v. United States, 342 U. S. 19. But the \"interest\"\nin these assets relied upon by the appellants to justify\nintervention is merely their preference that certain of\nthe assets, particularly the San Juan Basin reserves, end\nup in the hands of New Company rather than El Paso,\non the theory that such an allocation may be conducive\nto greater gas competition in California. These general\nand indefinite interests do not even remotely resemble\nthe direct and concrete stake in litigation required for\nintervention of right. The Court's decision not only\noverturns established general principles of intervention,\nbut, as will be shown below in detail, also repudiates\na large and long-established body of decisions specifi-\ncally, and correctly, denying intervention in government\nantitrust litigation.\nThis Court is all too familiar with the fact that anti-\ntrust litigation is inherently protracted. Indeed, it is\njust such delay which seems to so concern the Court in\nthis case. But nothing could be better calculated to\n\n6 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nconfuse and prolong antitrust litigation than the rule\nwhich the Court today announces. The entrance of\nadditional parties into antitrust suits can only serve\nto multiply trial exhibits and testimony, and further\nconfound the attempt to bring order out of complicated\neconomic issues. For these reasons, federal courts have\nbeen most reluctant to grant intervention under 24 (a.)(3)\neven in private antitrust litigation. For example, in\nCommonwealth Edison Co. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,\n315 F. 2d 564 (C. A. 7th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U. S.\n834, the State of Illinois, representing consumers' in-\nterests in a possible rate rebate, was denied interven-\ntion in a suit brought by a utility charging equipment\nmanufacturers with price fixing.11\nThe reasons for denying intervention are even stronger\nwhen intervention is sought in an antitrust suit brought\nby the Government. To the extent that the would-be\nintervenor seeks to press his own private antitrust claims\nagainst the defendant, intervention must be denied be-\ncause Congress has carefully provided separate statutory\nprocedures for private and public antitrust litigation.\"\nAs the Court observed in United States v. Borden Co.,\n347 U. S. 514, 518-519, the thrust of the Clayton Act \"is\nsharply to distinguish between Government suits, either\ncriminal or civil, and private suits for injunctive relief\nor for treble damages. Different policy considerations\ngovern each of these. They may proceed simultaneously\n11 Cf. American Louisiana Pipe Line Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 158\nF. Supp. 13 (D. C. E. D. Mich.)

United States,\n366 U. S. 683, at 693. A fortiori, intervention is im-\nproper when a private party appears in order to vindi-\ncate his theory of the public interest in an action brought\nby the Government. For as the Court has consistently\nrecognized, it is the \"United States, which must alone\nspeak for the public interest\" in antitrust litigation.\nBuckeye Coal & Ry. Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry.

But the determina-\ntion of what the public interest requires is the statutory\nduty and responsibility of the Government. The law ex-\nplicitly requires that suits brought by the Government for\ninjunctive relief shall be \"under the direction of the At-\ntorney General.\" 15 U. S. C. §§ 4 and 25.

Thus, in In re Engelhard & Sons Co., 231 U. S.\n646, intervention was denied to a subscriber seeking to\nenter a suit between a municipality and a telephone\nutility involving the validity of the city's rate ordinance\nand the disposition of rate overcharges. Similarly, in\nCity of New York v. Consolidated Gas Co. of New York,\n253 U. S. 219, and City of New York v. New York Tele-\nphone Co., 261 U. S. 312, the City of New York was not\nallowed to intervene on behalf of consumer residents of\nthe city in litigation between state authorities and public\nutilities over the validity of state rate regulation.

When the\nGovernment later sought modifications of the decree, we held that\nthe decree gave Panhandle the right to intervene.

There were over 20 applications to intervene\nin the decree proceedings below. The Court's construc-\ntion of 24 (a) (3) would require the District Court to\ngrant most if not all of them. El Paso gas goes to\nmillions of consumers, and under the Court's decision\nany or all of them are entitled to intervene as of right.\nAnd there is nothing in the Court's opinion which sug-\ngests that this right to intervene is limited to litigation\nover remedy. If consumers and others have an interest\nin making sure that a government antitrust decree meets\ntheir standards of effectiveness, they have an even\ngreater interest in insuring that a violation is found.\nThus the Court's reasoning gives any consumer a right\nto intervene in government antitrust litigation at the\nvery outset. The Court invites a scope of intervention\nthat will make the delays in this case seem mercifully\nshort.\nThe Court's decision would not be of such concern,\nnor merit so much discussion, if it were simply limited\nto 24 (a) (3), a provision which has been superseded.\nBut the same approach which creates a right to inter-\n17 The policy behind these decisions was stated in United States\nv.

GAS. 11\nvene for California and the Southern California Edison\nCo. under the old Rule 24 (a) (3) appears in the Court's\nconstruction of the new Rule 24, under which it says\nCascade has a right to intervene. The New Rule 24 (a)(2)\nreplaces the previous Rule 24 (a)(2) and (3), and provides\nfor intervention of right:\n\"[W]hen the applicant claims an interest relating\nto the property or transaction which is the subject\nof the action and he is so situated that the disposi-\ntion of the action may as a practical matter impair\nor impede his ability to protect that interest, unless\nthe applicant's interest is adequately represented by\nexisting parties.\"\nThis and other amendments to the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure were promulgated by this Court to \"take\neffect on July 1, 1966, and . . . govern all proceedings in\nactions brought thereafter and also in all further pro-\nceedings in actions then pending . . . .\" 384 U. S. 1031.\nSince the District Court denied Cascade's motion to in-\ntervene in 1965, before the effective date of the amended\nRule, the new Rule was inapplicable to Cascade's mo-\ntion.ls But even if the new Rule were applicable, neither\nCascade nor the other appellants could claim intervention\nof right under it.\n18 In Klapprott v. United States, 335 U. S. 601, the petitioner\nsought to reopen a default judgment denaturalizing him, relying on\namendments to Rule 60 (b). Several Justices thought that the\npetitioner should be able to obtain relief under the amended Rule\neven though the District Court had denied the petitioner's applica-\ntion before the effective date of the amendments. Cascade's interest\nhere bears no resemblance to the extraordinary hardship and injus-\ntice claimed by the petitioner in Klapprott, where it could be per-\nsuasively argued that it was \"more consonant with equitable consid-\nerations to judge the case on the basis of the Rule now in force, even\nthough the lower court did not have the opportunity to apply it.\"\n335 U. S., at 629 (dissenting opinion).\n\n12 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nThe purpose of the revision was to remedy certain\nlogical shortcomings in the construction of the former\n24 (a) (2), see Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States,\nsupra, and to give recognition to decisions such as\nFormulabs, Inc. v. Hartley Pen Co., supra, which had\nexpanded intervention under the former 24 (a) (3) beyond\nthe strict pro interesse suo model it embodied.' But an\napplicant is still required to have an \"interest\" in the\nlitigation sufficiently direct and immediate to justify his\nentry as a matter of right. The remote and general con-\ncerns that appellants State of California and Southern\nCalifornia Edison Co. have with this government suit\nhave already been discussed. And Cascade's interest is\neven more insubstantial. While it purchases gas from\nEl Paso in Oregon, it seeks intervention to vindicate gas\ncompetition in California.20 Even if it should be thought\nthat the amended Rule might encompass such remote\ninterests in some conceivable circumstances, it is clear\nthat such interests may never justify intervention of\nright in public antitrust litigation, where Congress has\ncarefully entrusted the conduct of government suits to\nthe \"direction of the Attorney General.\" But even if\nCascade should pass this hurdle, it would also have to\nshow that there was a failure of \"adequate representa-\ntion\" by the Justice Department in this case.\nThe Court states that the Government \"knuckled\nunder to El Paso\" and has \"fallen far short of represent-\ning\" Cascade's interest. Since the interest that Cascade\nclaims to be representing is that of the public, the Court\nis charging the Justice Department with dereliction of\nduty or serious incompetence. I regard this charge as\n19 See Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 24 (1966 Supp.).\n20 The FPC will protect Cascade's existing supply of gas when\nNew Company applies for certification. See, e. g., Michigan Con-\nsolidated Gas Co. v. FPC, 283 F. 2d 204 (C. A. D. C. Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 364 U. S. 913.\n\n•\nCASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS. 13\nwholly unjustified. The Government did settle for less\nthan all the relief that it sought at the outset. But this\nis a wholly familiar phenomenon of negotiation. Bar-\ngaining for consent decrees and stipulated remedies is a\nnormal and necessary element in the Government's en-\nforcement of the antitrust laws. Moreover, it is perfectly\nconceivable that in the course of negotiations the Gov-\nernment may become aware of errors in its opening posi-\ntion. If, as the Court's opinion seems to suggest, the\nGovernment is required to press its original negotiating\nposition unceasingly and to the bitter end, the number\nof cases which the Government can afford to undertake\nwill be sharply reduced, and the enforcement of the anti-\ntrust laws will ultimately become less effective. And of\ncourse the delay in antitrust litigation, which so concerns\nthe Court, will markedly increase.\nThe Court's standard of \"adequate representation\"\ncomes down to this: If, after the existing parties have\nsettled a case or pursued litigation to the end, some vol-\nunteer comes along who disagrees with the parties' assess-\nment of the issues or the way they have pursued their\nrespective interests, intervention must be granted to that\nvolunteer as of right. This strange standard is not only\nunprecedented and unwise; it is also unworkable.\nThe requirement of inadequate representation by exist-\ning parties as a precondition of the right to intervene\nunder the new Rule 24 is obviously an adaptation of the\nsimilar standard contained in the former 24 (a) (2). De-\ncisions under that standard allowed intervention of right\nwhen the intervenor could show a conflict of interest\nbetween himself and the party supposed to represent his\ninterest,21 a complete failure of representation by existing\n21 Pyle-National Co. v. Amos, 172 F. 2d 425 (C. A. 7th Cir.) ;\nMack v. Passaic National Bank & Trust Co., 150 F. 2d 474, 154\nF. 2d 907 (C. A. 3d Cir.); In re Standard Power and Light Corp.,\n48 F. Supp. 716 (D. C. D.

GAS.\nparties,\" or collusion or the likelihood of collusion be-\ntween them.23 Mere tactical disagreement over how\nlitigation should be conducted is obviously insufficient to\nsupport intervention of right.24 In ignoring these prece-\ndents, the Court also overlooks the sound policies which\nunderlie them. The Court's approach draws judges into\nthe adversary arena and forces them into the impossible\nposition of trying to second-guess the parties in the pur-\nsuit of their own interests. It is also wasteful and pro-\nductive of delay, because under this strange standard a\nperson's right to intervene in litigation cannot be ascer-\ntained until that litigation is concluded and the existing\nparties' conduct evaluated.\nWrong as the Court's approach is with respect to liti-\ngation generally, it is even more wrong when a would-be\nintervenor seeks to challenge the adequacy of the Gov-\nernment's representation of the public interest. The\nseparation of powers in our federal system generates prin-\nciples that make it peculiarly inappropriate for courts to\nassume the role of supervision over policy decisions of\nthe Executive. Yet the Court presumes to tell the Jus-\ntice Department that it made tactical errors in conducting\nlitigation, failed in its assessment of the public interest,\n22 Pellegrino v.

This\nCourt does not have the constitutional power to second-\nguess decisions of the Attorney General made within the\nbounds of his official discretion. That is the responsi-\nbility of the President and, ultimately, the electorate.\nIn words appropriate here, we long ago stated in the\ncontext of an attack on the Government's settlement of\nan antitrust case : \". . . we do not find in the statutes\ndefining the powers and duties of the Attorney General\nany such limitation on the exercise of his discretion as\nthis contention involves. His authority to make deter-\nminations includes the power to make erroneous decisions\nas well as correct ones.\" Swift & Co. v. United States,\n276 U. S. 311, 331-332. The Court today gives only lip\nservice to these principles. It states that \"We do not\nquestion the authority of the Attorney General to settle\nsuits after, as well as before, they reach here.\" Ante, at\n—. But it then proceeds to take the direction of a gov-\nernment lawsuit out of the hands of the Attorney General\nand into its own.\nThe Court relies on the fact that we have previously\nrendered a judgment in this case and cites dictum from\nthe opinion in United States v. E. I. DuPont & Co., 366\nU. S. 316, to justify the extraordinary course it takes.\nBut in the absence of outright fraud, it has never been\nthought that the fact that parties have initially resorted\nto the courts gives judges power to set aside later settle-\nment agreements and impose others on the parties. And\ncertainly when it is the Executive Branch of the Govern-\nment that has made the settlement as representative of\nthe public interest, only the grossest bad faith or malfea-\nsance on its part could possibly support such a step.\nEither the Court is saying the Government was guilty of\nsuch misconduct—a charge totally without support in\nthe record—or the Court has grossly overreached the per-\nmissible limit of judicial power.\n\n16 CASCADE NAT. GAS v. EL PASO NAT. GAS.\nNot only concern for the constitutional position of\nthis Court, but more directly pragmatic considerations\nunderlie my disagreement with today's decision. To\npermit volunteers to intervene and second-guess the\nJustice Department is especially inappropriate when the\nissues involved, like those in the antitrust field, require\ntechnical experience and an assessment and balancing of\ninterests essentially administrative and political. Formu-\nlation of effective and consistent government antitrust\npolicy is unlikely to result from \"piecemeal intervention\nof a multitude of individual complainants\" 25 in litigation\nbrought by the Government. Less than six years ago we\nfully recognized this principle:\nit\n. . . sound policy would strongly lead us to decline\n[the] invitation to assess the wisdom of the Gov-\nernment's judgment in negotiating and accepting\nthe . . . consent decree, at least in the absence of\nany claim of bad faith or malfeasance on the part\nof the Government in so acting.\" Sam Fox Pub-\nlishing Co. v. United States, supra, at 689.26\nToday the Court ignores all this and grants interven-\ntion of right to any volunteer claiming to speak for the\npublic interest whenever he can convince a court that\nthe Government might have used bad judgment in con-\nducting or settling a lawsuit.

The District Court did not err in deny-\ning intervention to the appellants,\" and these appeals\nshould therefore be dismissed.'\nBut even if I am completely wrong, and the Court\nis right in concluding that the District Court erred' in\ndenying appellants the right to intervene, the proper\ncourse would be simply to remand the case to the Dis-\ntrict Court so that the appellants' contentions may be\nmet by the Government or El Paso and passed on by a\ntrial court that is intimately familiar with the massive\nrecord in this case. Instead, the Court brushes aside the\n\"threshold\" question of appellants' right to intervene\nin a few pages and devotes most of its opinion to pro-\nnouncements on gas reserves, delivery contracts, and\nother intricacies of gas competition in the western United\nStates. These issues were never the subject of adversary\nproceedings in the District Court. They were never\nresolved through findings by the District Court.

In so doing the Court roams at large,\nunconfined by anything so mundane as a factual record\ndeveloped in adversary proceedings.\n\"The obvious must be restated. We do not sit to\ndraft antitrust decrees de novo. This is a court of\nappeal, not a trial court. We do not see the wit-\nnesses, sift the evidence in detail, or appraise the\ncourse of extended argument . . . . In short, this\nCourt does not partake of the procedure and is not\ncharged with the responsibility demanded of the\ncourt entrusted with the task of devising the details\nof a decree appropriate for the governance of a\nvastly complicated situation arising out of unique\ncircumstances.\" United States v. E. I. DuPont &\nCo., 366 U. S. 316, 371 (dissenting opinion).\nThe Court has decided this case on little more than\nrepugnance for \"the attitude or philosophy of the Dis-\ntrict Court\" and the unjustified and extraordinarily op-\nprobrious conclusion that the Government \"knuckled\nunder.\" This is not a happy foundation for radical ex-\ntensions of intervention doctrine. And it is not a proper\nbasis for deciding how stock in the New Company should\nbe marketed, or how gas reserves in New Mexico should\nbe divided. In its zeal to censure the District Judge and\nreprimand the Justice Department, the Court has rushed\nheadlong into a jurisprudential quagmire far more dan-\ngerous than the \"evil\" it purports to discern in the decree\nentered by the trial court.\nFinally, I must note my emphatic disagreement with\nthe Court's extraordinary action in directing that further\nproceedings in this case must be conducted by a different\ndistrict judge. Federal reviewing courts have taken this\nserious step only in the rarest circumstances, when the\ntrial judge's personal or emotional involvement in a case\nhas been demonstrated. See Offutt v.

Nobody has requested his replace-\nment at any stage of the proceedings. For this Court,\non its own motion, to disqualify a trial judge in the\nmiddle of a case because it disagrees with his \"philosophy\"\nis not only unprecedented, but incredible.",
