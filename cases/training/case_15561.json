    "summary": "<p>On January 15, 2015, a deaf, Ethiopian-born American citizen filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The plaintiff sued the Arlington County Sheriff and Virginia Department of Corrections. The suit was brought under two federal statutes: Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The plaintiff, represented by both private counsel and counsel from the National Association of the Deaf, sought compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees. </p><p>In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he was not provided with American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters during his detention at the Arlington County Detention Facility (Detention Facility) following his arrest at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for allegedly stealing an iPad. Because the plaintiff is originally from Ethiopia, he struggles to understand, read, and write English. His primary way of communicating is through ASL. When he was arrested, the plaintiff attempted to ask for an ASL interpreter because he did not understand why he was being detained. The officers responded by writing notes to the plaintiff; however, he could not understand what they were writing. </p><p>Plaintiff remained at the Detention Center for approximately six weeks. During that time, he did not have access to an interpreter to communicate his dietary and medical needs. He also did not have access to a videophone to speak to his public defender. Throughout his stay at the Detention Center, plaintiff made multiple requests for interpreters and other services to allow him to communicate with the Detention Facility’s staff, but these requests were denied.  He eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of receiving stolen property in exchange for a sentence of time served.  He later explained that he did not understand why he was arrested until he went to court and that he pleaded guilty only to get out of jail. His alleged victim — another deaf, homeless man who was sleeping at the airport — eventually withdrew the allegation, saying he had made a mistake and that the missing iPad had been found.</p><p>The defendants immediately moved to dismiss the claims. On April 28, 2015 Judge James C. Cacheris granted the state-level officials’ motion to dismiss and denied the sheriff’s motion to dismiss. The judge reasoned that the plaintiff’s allegations, if true, showed the sheriff did not do anything to accommodate the plaintiff’s disability under Title II of the ADA. </p><p>The plaintiff’s allegations in the complaint compelled the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to investigate the case. The investigation substantiated the majority of the plaintiff’s allegations and uncovered the Arlington County Sheriff’s Office’s general failure to comply with the ADA. As a result, ACSO entered settlement negotiations with the Department of Justice (represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia). On November 16, 2016, the ACSO signed a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. The agreement stipulated that Arlington County had to pay the plaintiff $250,000. Furthermore, the settlement required that ACSO take steps to better accommodate inmates with disabilities. ACSO agreed to, amongst other things, appoint employees to coordinate ADA compliance, modify policies/procedures to screen prisoners who have disabilities, provide additional auxiliary aids and interpretive services to inmates who are deaf or hearing disabled, and revamp procedures to keep track of services provided to prisoners. It will stay in effect for three years, after which the matter will be closed.  </p><p>Back in the court case, on December 20, 2016, the court entered a voluntary dismissal.  </p>",

      "title": "Settlement Agreement Between the United States of America and Elizabeth F. Arthur, In Her Official Capacity as the Arlington County Sheriff",
      "text": "SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND  \nELIZABETH F. ARTHUR, IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACITY  \nAS THE ARLINGTON COUNTY SHERIFF \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DJ # 204-79-325 \nBACKGROUND \n1.  The parties (“Parties”) to this Settlement Agreement \n(“Agreement”) are the United States of America (“United States”) \nand Elizabeth F. Arthur in her official capacity as the Arlington \nCounty Sheriff. \n2.  This matter was initiated by a complaint filed with the United \nStates against the Arlington County Sheriff’s Office (“ACSO”), \nalleging violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990, as amended (the “ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, \nand its implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part 35, and seeking to \nrecover compensatory damages for the alleged discrimination \ncaused by the violations. Specifically, Complainant PJ (the \n“Complainant”), who is deaf, alleged that the ACSO personnel \nfailed to take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with \nhim were as effective as communications with others, and failed to \nprovide auxiliary aids and services that were necessary to ensure \neffective communication with the Complainant while he was \nincarcerated in the Arlington County Detention Facility (“ACDF”) \nfor 40 days. Further, the Complainant alleges that the ACSO failed \n\nto furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services that would have \nafforded him an equal opportunity to use telecommunication \nservices that the ACSO permits other detainees without disabilities. \n3.  The ACSO has fully cooperated with United States’ investigation \nof this matter. The ASCO without any delay responded to each and \nevery request made by United States, including a personal meeting \nbetween Sheriff Arthur and representatives of the United States. \nThe Parties have determined that the complaint filed with the \nUnited States can be resolved without litigation and have agreed to \nthe terms of this Agreement \nINVESTIGATION AND FINDINGS \n4.  The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia \n(“USAO”) is authorized under 42 U.S.C.§ 12131-34 and 28 C.F.R. \nPart 35, Subpart F, to investigate the allegations of the complaint in \nthis matter to determine the ACSO’s compliance with Title II of \nthe ADA. The USAO has the authority to, where appropriate, \nnegotiate and secure voluntary compliance agreements, to resolve \ninvestigations through informal resolution such as settlement \nagreements, and to bring civil actions enforcing Title II of the ADA \nshould it fail to secure voluntary compliance. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.172(c). \n5.   The Complainant is deaf and as such is an individual with a \n“disability” within the meaning of the ADA. 42 U.S. C. § 12102; \n28 C.F.R. § 35.104. The Complainant communicates using \n\nAmerican Sign Language (“ASL”), and is unable to communicate \nby reading or writing in English, or reading lips. \n6.  The ADA applies to the ACSO because it is a “public entity” \npursuant to Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131. Title II of the \nADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with \ndisabilities on the basis of disability in the “services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Pursuant to \nVirginia law, the ACSO operates the ACDF. Va. Code § 53.1-\n116.2. \n7.  On the basis of its investigation, the USAO has determined that: \na.  PJ was arrested late in the evening at Reagan Washington \nNational Airport on February 2, 2014. Soon after his arrest, \nPJ was transferred to the Arlington County Detention \nFacility (“ACDF”), where he was detained until March 14, \n2014. \nb.  The ACSO had an obligation to ensure effective \ncommunication with PJ while he was in its custody, and had \nan obligation to furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and \nservices where necessary to ensure effective communication \nwith PJ. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160. \nc.  ACSO failed to give primary consideration to PJ’s request \nfor certain types of auxiliary aids and services as required by \n28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2). Instead, the ACSO provided a \nrandom assortment of ineffective “auxiliary aids.” The \n\nACSO failed to take appropriate steps required to comply \nwith 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2), such as consulting with PJ \nregarding the type of auxiliary aids and services that he \nrequired for effective communication, conducting an \ninformed evaluation of the types of auxiliary aids and \nservices necessary to ensure effective communication with \nPJ, and giving primary consideration to PJ’s request for \nspecific auxiliary aids and services. \nd.  Despite the ACSO’s failure to undertake an informed \ninquiry into the type of auxiliary aids and services that \nwould establish effective communication with PJ, PJ \nexpressly requested an ASL interpreter on multiple \noccasions, including during the following: \n1.  ACDF’s initial housing assessment; \n2.  ACDF’s medical assessment; \n3.  ACDF’s classification assessment; and \n4.  When meeting with ACDF’s ADA Coordinator. \ne.  During PJ’s incarceration at the ACDF, he attempted to \nexplain to multiple ACDF staff members that he could not \nread or write in English and could not read lips. Further, the \nphysician who attempted to conduct a medical exam of PJ \nnoted in his inmate medical records that PJ could not read \nlips effectively. \n\nf.  During PJ’s incarceration, the ACSO failed to provide \neffective communication for multiple complex \ncommunications with the Complainant, including: \n1.  Communications about the types of auxiliary aids or \nservices that would ensure effective communication; \n2.  Communications regarding PJ’s eligibility for \nfinancial assistance for legal representation; \n3.  An attempted arraignment of PJ that was held at the \nACDF via video hookup; \n4.  PJ’s initial housing assessment; \n5.  PJ’s initial classification assessment; \n6.  PJ’s medical assessment, medical examination and \nother interactions with the medical staff, which would \nhave enabled PJ to explain and receive treatment for \nhis medical conditions; \n7.  PJ’s case management plan; \n8.  ACSO’s orientation of PJ to the ACDF; \n9.  ACDF’s Handbook provided to PJ in written English; \nand \n10. Discussions on how PJ could make bond and be \nreleased from incarceration. \n\ng.  The ACSO’s failure to provide appropriate auxiliary aids \nand services to ensure effective communication with PJ for \nthese complex interactions violates 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 \nC.F.R. §§ 35.152(b)(1) & 35.160. \nh.  A nurse employed by Corizon, ACDF’s medical contractor, \nnoted in PJ’s infirmary record that he refused to provide \nconsent to medical treatment because there was no sign \nlanguage interpreter. Notwithstanding the fact that PJ never \nreversed his refusal of consent for medical treatment, \nACDF’s medical contractor still performed medical \nprocedures on PJ. \ni.  The ACSO enlisted three of its staff members, who did not \nhave the requisite skills to be qualified interpreters, to \nfacilitate communication during interactions with PJ that \nrequired complex communication, including a medical \nexamination, his initial housing assessment, and his \nclassification review. Prior to enlisting these staff members \nto facilitate communication, the ACSO failed to have the \nstaff members evaluated to determine whether they had the \nrequisite ASL skills to perform as a sign language \ninterpreter. As part of the investigation, the United States \narranged to have the sign language interpreting abilities of \nthe three ACSO staff members evaluated. These evaluations \nrevealed that these individuals did not have the requisite \nskills to be “qualified interpreters” pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.104 because they could not “interpret effectively, \n\naccurately, and impartially, both receptively and \nexpressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary.” \nj.  Pursuant to Virginia state regulations, 6 VAC 15-40-660, \n730 & 1270, and ACDF’s internal policies, the detention \nfacility permits inmates to make telephone calls to, among \nothers, counsel, family, and friends. An ACSO staff member \nerroneously informed the Arlington County Public \nDefender’s Office, which represented PJ in a criminal case, \nthat PJ could not communicate using a telephone because he \nis deaf. The ACSO offered to furnish a TTY device, but \nbecause a TTY requires knowledge of written English, it \nwas not an appropriate auxiliary aid for PJ and the \nComplainant attempted to explain that he could not use the \nTTY device. The ACSO’s failure to furnish an auxiliary aid \nor service that would have afforded PJ telecommunication \nservices, such as a device that would have afforded video \ntelephone calls, violates 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. §§ 35 \n35.160 & 35.161. Further, the ASCO’s failure to give \nprimary consideration to PJ’s request for certain auxiliary \naids that would provide effective communication for \ntelecommunication violated 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2). \n8.  Our Investigation also revealed additional general areas of ADA \nnon-compliance, including: \na.  The ACSO was unable to demonstrate that it had conducted \nan ADA self-evaluation, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 35.105. \n\nb.  The ACSO failed to ensure that interested persons, including \npersons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain \ninformation as to the existence and location of accessible \nservices, activities, and facilities, as required by 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.163. \nc.  The ACSO is required to have an ADA Coordinator who is \nfamiliar with the requirements of the ADA and whose \nresponsibilities include ensuring that individuals who are \ndealing with a large public entity are able to easily find a \nresponsible person who is familiar with the requirements of \nthe ADA and the ADA regulations and can communicate \nthose requirements to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. 28 C.F.R. § 35.107; \n28 C.F.R. Part 35, Appendix B. At the time of the events in \nPJ’s complaint, the ACSO assigned the ADA Coordinator \nposition to an employee who did not have the requisite \nknowledge to perform the responsibilities of this position. 28 \nC.F.R. Part 35, Appendix B. ACSO’s ADA Coordinator was \nnot knowledgeable of the requirements of the ADA, the \nstatute’s implementing regulations, or the relevant \nDepartment of Justice’s Technical Assistance Materials. \nDEFINITIONS \n9.  “ACSO Personnel” means all employees, both full and part-time, \nand contractors and employees of contractors with contracts to \nwork for or with the ACSO, including, without limitation, uniform \n\nofficers of the Sheriff’s Department, Inmate Service Counselors, \nnurses, physicians, social workers, administrative staff, therapists, \nand volunteers, who have or are likely to have direct contact with \nInmates or Companions as defined herein. \n10. “Auxiliary aids and services” includes qualified interpreters on-\nsite or through video remote interpreting (VRI) services; \nnotetakers; real-time computer-aided transcription services; written \nmaterials; exchange of written notes; telephone handset amplifiers; \nassistive listening devices; assistive listening systems; telephones \ncompatible with hearing aids; closed caption decoders; open and \nclosed captioning, including real-time captioning; voice, text, and \nvideo-based telecommunications products and systems, including \ntext telephones (TTYs), videophones, and captioned telephones, or \nequally effective telecommunications devices; videotext displays; \naccessible electronic and information technology; or other effective \nmethods of making aurally delivered information available to \nindividuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n11. “Companion” means a family member, friend, legal \nrepresentative, or associate of an individual seeking access to a \nservice, program, or activity of a public entity, who, along with \nsuch individual, is an appropriate person with whom the public \nentity should communicate. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(a)(2). \n12. “Disability” is defined as it is in the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n12102(2). See also 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. Specifically, a person is \n“deaf” or “hard of hearing” for the purposes of this Agreement if \n\nshe or he has a physical impairment that substantially limits the \nmajor life activity of hearing, with or without mitigating measures \nsuch as hearing aids or cochlear implants. \n13. \"Effective communication” means communication with persons \nwith disabilities that is as effective as communication with others. \nEffective communication is achieved by furnishing appropriate \nauxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford qualified \nindividuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in \nor benefit from the services, programs, or activities of a public \nentity. \n14. “Inmate” shall be broadly construed to include any individual who \nis being held or detained at the ACDF. \n15. “Inmate Records” means the files and related records for an \nindividual inmate, including both the paper and electronic records, \nand any infirmary records. \n16. “Qualified interpreter” means an interpreter who, via a video \nremote interpreting (VRI) service or an on-site appearance, is able \nto interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively \nand expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary, \ngiven the deaf or hard of hearing individual’s language skills and \neducation. Qualified interpreters include, for example, sign \nlanguage interpreters, oral transliterators, and cued-language \ntransliterators. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. Not all interpreters are qualified \nfor all situations. For example, an interpreter who is qualified to \ninterpret using American Sign Language (ASL) is not necessarily \n\nqualified to interpret orally. Also, someone who has only a \nrudimentary familiarity with sign language or finger spelling is not \na “qualified sign language interpreter.” Likewise, someone who is \nfluent in sign language but who does not possess the ability to \nprocess spoken communication into the proper signs or to observe \npeople signing and translate their signed or finger-spelled \ncommunication into spoken words is not a qualified sign language \ninterpreter. 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A. To be a qualified interpreter, \nthe interpreter must be able to interpret in the language the \nindividual with a disability uses (e.g., American Sign Language or \nSigned English). \n17. “Video Remote Interpreting service” or “VRI” will mean an \ninterpreting service that uses video conference technology over \ndedicated lines or wireless technology offering high-speed, wide-\nbandwidth video connection that delivers high-quality video \nimages that do not produce lags, choppy, blurry, or grainy images, \nor irregular pauses in communication as provided in 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.160(d). \nEQUITABLE RELIEF \n18. ADA Self-Evaluation. The ACSO will complete an ADA self-\nevaluation within one year of the effective date of this agreement. \n28 C.F.R. § 105. The ADA self-evaluation will include the \nelements discussed in the ADA Title II Technical Assistance \nManual, at II-8.2000, which will be limited to policies and \npractices maintained by the ACSO. The ACSO will provide a copy \n\nof the ADA self-evaluation to the United States once it is \ncompleted. \n19. ADA Coordinators For Inmates \na.  Designation \nThe ACSO has designated at least one employee with \nresponsibility to coordinate the ACSO’s efforts to comply with \nand carry out its responsibilities under the ADA with respect to \ninmates, whose title is the “ADA Coordinator for Inmates.” \nFurther, the ACSO has designated at least one employee as an \nADA Deputy Coordinator for Inmates (“ADA Deputy \nCoordinator”), who is available in case the ADA Coordinator is \nnot available. \nDuties and Responsibilities \n1) The ADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy Coordinator for \nInmates shall have the responsibility and authority to: ensure that \nprocedures for the prompt and equitable resolution of ADA \ncomplaints by inmates and/or requests by inmates with disabilities \nfor reasonable modifications or appropriate auxiliary aids or \nservices or addressing physical access issues are in place, \npublicized, and implemented; process, investigate, and promptly \nact upon inmate complaints and/or requests for reasonable \nmodifications or auxiliary aids or services; ensure that all ACDF \nstaff who interact with inmates with disabilities are provided with \nadequate and appropriate information and training on ADA issues; \n\nensure that inmates with disabilities are housed in facilities that \naccommodate their disabilities and that all applicable ACDF \nfacilities and programs are ADA compliant; compile and maintain \nsuch information concerning inmates with disabilities in the \ncustody of ACDF as is necessary to carry out the duties and \nresponsibilities of the position; develop and maintain an inventory \nof written materials and other resources concerning ADA \ncompliance (including, without limitation, laws, regulations, \nreference materials, educational materials, DOJ publications, and \ncontact information); and otherwise coordinate ACDF’s efforts to \ncomply with and carry out its responsibilities under the ADA with \nrespect to inmates. The ADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy \nCoordinator for Inmates shall also serve as a resource for inmates, \nother ACDF employees, and for representatives of federal, state, \nand county government agencies who have questions regarding \nACDF inmates with disabilities, ACDF's obligations with respect \nto inmates with disabilities, and ACDF procedures concerning \nADA compliance. \n2) The ACSO has received funding for an additional Full Time \nEquivalent (“FTE”) position at the Lieutenant rank or above to \nhandle the ADA Coordinator’s responsibilities. \n3) The ADA Coordinator for Inmates shall be generally available \nduring normal business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays) to \nrespond to inmate requests and complaints and answer questions \nfrom and provide advice and assistance to the ACDF personnel. \n\nThe ADA Deputy Coordinator shall be available when the ADA \nCoordinator is not available. If neither the ADA Coordinator or \nthe Deputy ADA Coordinator are available, the Chief Deputy will \nappoint an interim ADA Coordinator of Captain or above until \none of the Coordinators returns or one is newly appointed. \n4) The ACSO has developed a job description for the position for \nthe ADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy Coordinator for Inmates. \nThe job description includes all duties, responsibilities, and \nqualifications set forth in this Agreement. The ACSO shall \nprovide a copy of the job description to the United States \nAttorney’s Office for its review and approval. Upon receipt of the \nUnited States’ comments, the ACSO will address all of the United \nStates’ concerns, if any, and will resubmit a draft for final \napproval, if any changes are necessary. The adoption of the final \njob description will occur within 90 days of the ACSO’s receipt of \napproval by the United States. \nb.  Qualifications \nThe ACSO has established qualifications for the positions of \nADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy Coordinator for \nInmates sufficient to ensure that the ADA Coordinator and \nADA Deputy Coordinator for Inmates possess the \neducational background, experience, and skills necessary to \ncarry out all of the duties and responsibilities of the position, \nand knowledge and experience dealing with the legal rights \nof persons with disabilities and the obligations of public \n\nentities under federal and state disability laws. The ACSO \nshall not designate any person to serve as the ADA \nCoordinator or ADA Deputy Coordinator, or maintain any \nperson in that position, who does not possess the requisite \nbackground, experience, and skills in carrying out the duties \nand responsibilities of the position. \nc.  Training For ADA Coordinators \n1) Within 90 days of the effective date of this Agreement, \nthe ACSO shall ensure that the ADA Coordinator and ADA \nDeputy Coordinator for Inmates have the training necessary \nto ensure that the ADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy \nCoordinator for Inmates are fully knowledgeable about the \nlegal rights of inmates with disabilities and the legal \nobligations of the ACSO with respect to inmates with \ndisabilities. Further, during the duration of this agreement, \nthe ACSO shall ensure that the ADA Coordinator and ADA \nDeputy Coordinator attend at least 24 hours of training per \nyear on ADA requirements and new developments. \n2) Specifically, with regard to ACSO’s obligation to ensure \neffective communication with qualified individuals with \ndisabilities, the ADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy Coordinator \nfor Inmates will be trained in the following areas: \na.  To promptly identify communication needs of \ninmates, visitors and other members of the public who \n\nare deaf or hard of hearing and which auxiliary aids \nand services are necessary in different circumstances; \nb.  To secure qualified interpreter services as quickly as \npossible when necessary; \nc.  To work with ACDF staff members to comply with \nthe effective communication provisions of the ADA \nand this Agreement; \nd.  To use, when appropriate, flash cards and pictographs \n(in conjunction with any other available means of \ncommunication that will augment the effectiveness of \nthe communication); \ne.  How and when to use video remote interpreting \nservices; \nf.  Making and receiving telephone calls using auxiliary \naids and services such as videophones, captioned \nphones, telephone handset amplifiers, TTYs and the \nrelay service; and \ng.  ACSO’s grievance resolution procedure described in \nparagraph 54 of this agreement. \n20. Information Concerning Inmates with Disabilities \n\nThe ACSO has modified existing directives, rules, policies, and \nprocedures concerning the screening and classification of inmates upon \nentry into the custody of the ACSO: \na.  To ensure that, when a person with or claiming a disability is \nreceived into the custody of the ACSO, the ACSO Zone \nSupervisor shall contact the Shift Commander and the ADA \nCoordinator immediately. The ACSO Zone Supervisor shall \ninform the Shift Commander and the ADA Coordinator of \nthe inmate's name, the nature of the inmate's disability, and \nany request for an auxiliary aid or service for \ncommunication, or related to physical accessibility or \nreasonable modifications of policies or procedures made by \nthat inmate upon intake; \nb.  To require ACSO intake staff to document the inmate’s \ndisability and any request made by the inmate for an \nauxiliary aid or service or related to physical accessibility or \nreasonable modifications of policies, practices or procedures \nin the inmate’s record; \nc.  To require the ADA Coordinator or the ADA Deputy \nCoordinator to meet with an inmate with a disability within \nthe next business day of his/her arrival at the ACDF and at \nleast weekly thereafter. Within 24 hours of the ACSO Zone \nSupervisor providing notification to the ADA Coordinator or \nADA Deputy Coordinator of the inmate with a disability or \nthe in-person meeting with the inmate, whichever is earlier, \n\nthe ADA Coordinator or ADA Deputy Coordinator shall \nensure that the needs of the inmate with a disability are \nbeing met; and \nd.  To require that the monthly Medical Audit Committee \nincludes a discussion of ADA issues. \n21. Dissemination of Contact Information \nThe ACSO shall make available to visitors, inmate advocates, inmate \nfamily members, and representatives upon request, the name, office \naddress, and telephone number of the ADA Coordinator and ADA \nDeputy Coordinator for Inmates. Further, such information shall be \navailable in an accessible manner on the front page of ACSO’s web site \nin a location that is at least as conspicuous as the “Detention Center At-\na-Glance” section of the current web site. 28 C.F.R. § 35.107. The \nidentity of the ADA Coordinator and Deputy ADA Coordinator shall be \non conspicuous posters of suitable size posted in locations in each \nfacility where notices to inmates are normally posted, which are \nidentified in Exhibit C. Moreover, the ACDF inmate handbook shall \ninform inmates that they can contact the ADA Coordinator and ADA \nDeputy Coordinator for Inmates through the housing unit deputy for \neach housing unit. Id. \nProhibitions on Discrimination \n22. Nondiscrimination. With respect to all of its programs, services, \nand activities, the ACSO agrees not to engage in any act or \npractice, directly or through contracting, licensing, or other \n\narrangements, that has the purpose or effect of unlawfully \ndiscriminating against any person with a disability in violation of \nTitle II of the ADA. \n23. Coverage of Involuntary Participation. Throughout this \nAgreement, terms such as “enjoyment,” “benefit,” or “seek” that in \nother contexts might imply the voluntary and willing participation \nof a member of the public in ACSO programs, services, or \nactivities, shall also refer to a member of the public’s involuntary \nparticipation in the Sheriff’s Department’s programs, services, and \nactivities, such as arrest or detention. 28 C.F.R. § 35.152. \n24. Retaliation and Coercion. The ACSO shall not retaliate against or \ncoerce in any way any person who made, or is making, a complaint \naccording to the provisions of this Agreement or exercised, or is \nexercising, his or her rights under this Agreement or the ADA. 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.134. \nEffective Communication \n25. Provision of Appropriate Auxiliary Aids and Services. The \nACSO will ensure that appropriate auxiliary aids and services, \nincluding qualified interpreters, are made available to inmates, \nvisitors, and other members of the public who interact with the \nACSO, who are deaf or hard of hearing, where such aids and \nservices are necessary to ensure effective communication, so that \nthey may participate in or benefit from the ACSO’s services, \nprograms, or activities on an equal basis with others. While this \n\nSettlement Agreement focuses on the effective communication \nneeds of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, the ACSO \nrecognizes that it is required by the ADA to provide appropriate \nauxiliary aids and services to ensure effective communication with \nindividuals with other disabilities, such as blindness. \n26. Primary Consideration. In determining the type of auxiliary aid \nor service necessary to comply with the ADA, the ACSO agrees to \ngive primary consideration to the expressed preference for a \nparticular auxiliary aid or service by an individual who is deaf or \nhard of hearing. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160. “Primary consideration” will \nmean that personnel will inquire as to the choice of auxiliary aid or \nservice of the individual with a disability and will honor the \nexpressed choice unless the ACSO can demonstrate that another \nequally effective means of communication is available. \nSpecifically, to determine whether someone who is deaf or hard of \nhearing wants a qualified sign language interpreter, in all non-\nemergency circumstances, personnel will use the American Sign \nLanguage pictogram for “sign language interpreter” available at \nExhibit B to inquire as to the person’s preference. \n27. Consultation Requirement. In order to provide primary \nconsideration to the expressed preference of the individual with a \ndisability regarding the type of auxiliary aids or services to \nprovide, the ACSO will consult with the individual with a \ndisability regarding the appropriate auxiliary aids or services, and \nthe timing, duration, and frequency with which they will be \nprovided. The ACSO personnel will provide a Communication \n\nAssessment Form and take into account all relevant facts and \ncircumstances, including, for example, the individual’s \ncommunication skills and knowledge, and the nature and \ncomplexity of the communication at issue. A Model \nCommunication Assessment Form is attached to this Agreement as \nExhibit A, and the ACSO will develop a form similar to Exhibit A \nwithin thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement to \nbe used at the ACDF. The ACSO shall provide a copy of the \nCommunication Assessment Form that it develops to the USAO for \nreview and approval prior to ACSO’s implementation of the Form. \nACSO shall ensure that a completed Form is obtained from each \nindividual inmate or companion who agrees to complete the Form. \nACSO shall provide assistance in completing the Form at the \nInmate’s or Companion’s request, including a sign language \ninterpreter if the ACSO has any reason to believe that the inmate or \ncompanion does not understand the form. After being completed, \nthe Form(s) shall be maintained in the inmate’s record, whether \nkept in paper or electronic form. If at any point during an inmate’s \ndetention, a companion identifies himself or herself as deaf or hard \nof hearing, the ACSO shall promptly provide him/her with the \nForm, if it has not done so already. \n28. Ongoing Need for Communication Assessments and \nConsultation. In addition to the initial communication assessment \ndone at the time the need for auxiliary aids and services is first \nidentified, ACSO personnel will reassess communication \neffectiveness regularly throughout the period of incarceration and \n\nwill consult with the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing on a \ncontinuing basis to assess the measures required to ensure effective \ncommunication. See 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A. For inmates, such \nreassessment will take place on a monthly or more frequent basis. \n29. Documentation of Refusal of Auxiliary Aids or Services. If an \ninmate who is deaf or hard of hearing indicates that he or she does \nnot require any or all of the Auxiliary Aids and Services set forth in \nthe Agreement, he or she will sign a Waiver of Auxiliary Aids and \nServices and that document will be kept in the inmate’s file. The \nWaiver of Auxiliary Aids and Services will be the same as the form \nthat the ACSO provided to the USAO on September 1, 2015. The \nACSO will take steps to ensure that the Waiver of Auxiliary Aids \nand Services form is effectively communicated to inmates with \ndisabilities, including providing auxiliary aids and services for \ndiscussion of the form. The ACSO understands that the lack of a \ncompleted Waiver of Auxiliary Aids and Service form is \npresumptive evidence that there was no refusal of services by the \ninmate. Notwithstanding an inmate’s completion of a waiver form, \nthe ACSO still has a continuing obligation to assess an inmate’s \ncommunication needs on an ongoing basis as discussed in \nparagraph 28. \n30. Qualified Interpreters for Detention Facility Programs. The \nfollowing are examples of circumstances when it may be necessary \nto provide qualified interpreters to ensure effective communication \nwith inmates or detainees who are deaf or hard of hearing: \n\na.  initial intake and classification processing (see below \nfor specifics); \nb.  medical care and health programs, such as medical, \ndental, visual, audiological, mental health \nexaminations or treatment and drug and alcohol \nrecovery services; \nc.  educational classes and activities; \nd.  any court hearing held at the facility, including those \nheld via video hookup with the court; \ne.  official hearings in which the inmate or detainee is a \nparticipant; \nf.  criminal investigations that are conducted at the ACDF \nor that involve the ACSO; \ng.  classification review interviews; \nh.  grievance interviews or processes; \ni.  religious services; and \nj.  formal investigations that are conducted at the ACDF \nor that involve the ACSO. \nThe foregoing list of circumstances is not exhaustive; there may be \nother circumstances not identified here when it may be necessary to \nprovide qualified interpreters for effective communication. Under \n\nsome circumstances other entities may have joint obligation to \nfurnish a qualified interpreter. \n31. Booking and Intake. \na.  Qualified Interpreters. As soon as ACSO personnel learn \nthat a person who is deaf or hard of hearing will arrive at the \ndetention facility, whether pursuant to an arrest or a transfer \nfrom another jurisdiction or facility, personnel will inquire \nthrough all available means (including the use of Exhibit A) \nas to whether the person will need a qualified interpreter for \neffective communication. If so, a qualified interpreter will be \nprovided to facilitate booking, intake, classification, \norientation, and other such processes. \nb.  Video and Transcript. Within 180 days of the effective \ndate of this Agreement, the ACSO will produce a Jail \nOrientation Video and written transcript designed to inform \narrestees who are deaf or hard of hearing about the booking \nprocess. The Jail Orientation Video will feature a qualified \nsign language interpreter communicating what the arrestee \nor detainee should expect, through the fingerprinting, and \nother preliminary processes. The written transcript will \ncommunicate the same information in writing, for persons \nwho are deaf or hard of hearing who do not use sign \nlanguage, but can read English. \n\nc.  Other Booking and Intake Processes. If a person who is \ndeaf or hard of hearing has requested a qualified interpreter \nor responded to the mandatory inquiry that he or she wants a \nsign language interpreter, any booking process that relies on \ncommunication must be delayed until a qualified interpreter \nis present or VRI service is available. Such processes \ninclude, but are not limited to, medical screenings, taking \ncriminal and personal histories, and obtaining or transmitting \ninformation for classification and housing assignments. If a \nperson who is deaf or hard of hearing expresses an urgent \nmedical need that cannot wait for a qualified interpreter, or \npersonnel suspect there is an urgent medical need, personnel \nshould not delay providing whatever medical care or service \nwould be provided to an inmate without disabilities under \nthe similar circumstances and should use the most effective \navailable means of communicating with the person who is \ndeaf or hard of hearing. \nd.  Completion of Booking. Once a qualified interpreter has \narrived or VRI service is available, the booking process may \nbe completed. The interpreter should accompany the inmate \nto the housing unit, if inmates generally receive information \nabout their housing unit rules, expected standards of \nconduct, or other topics upon arrival. \ne.  Inmate Handbook. At the earliest reasonable time, the \nACSO will effectively communicate the contents of the \nInmate Handbook and similar publications to all inmates \n\nwho are deaf or hard of hearing, including those for whom \nwritten English is not an effective means of communication. \nThe ACSO may choose to meet this obligation by providing \na video of a qualified interpreter signing the contents of the \nInmate Handbook, along with appropriate technology for \nviewing, or by providing a qualified interpreter who will \nread and interpret the contents of the Inmate Handbook to \nthe person who is deaf or hard of hearing. At the request of \nan inmate who is deaf or hard of hearing, the ACSO will \nprovide that inmate with the opportunity to meet with an \nACSO staff member and a qualified interpreter to ask any \nquestions regarding the Inmate Handbook and any other \nwritten materials that have been provided to inmates. \nf.  Notice in Inmate Handbook. The ACSO will revise its \nInmate Handbook and all similar publications, including \norientation materials, to include a statement to the following \neffect: \nTo ensure effective communication with inmates and their visitors \nor companions who are deaf or hard of hearing, we provide \nappropriate auxiliary aids and services free of charge, such as: \nqualified sign language interpreters and oral transliterators, \nvideophones, TTY's, notetakers, computer-assisted real time \ntranscription services, written materials, telephone handset \namplifiers, assistive listening devices and systems, telephones \ncompatible with hearing aids, closed caption decoders or TVs \n\nwith built-in captioning, and open and closed captioning of ACDF \nprograms. \nPlease ask an Arlington County Detention Facility staff member \nfor assistance. \n32. Provision of Interpreters in a Timely Manner \na.  Non-scheduled Interpreter Requests: A “non-scheduled \ninterpreter request” means a request for an interpreter made \nby an inmate, visitor, companion, or other member of the \npublic, who is deaf or hard of hearing with less than two (2) \nhours advanced notice. For non-scheduled interpreter \nrequests, the interpreter shall be provided no more than (a) \ntwo (2) hours from the time of the request for an interpreter \nif the service is provided through a contract interpreting \nservice or a staff interpreter who is located off-site or (b) 30 \nminutes from the request for an interpreter if the service is \nprovided through a Video Remote Interpreting service. \nDeviations from this response time will be addressed with \nthe interpreting service provider, and performance goals will \nbe reviewed with the United States. If no interpreter can be \nlocated, ACSO Personnel will take the following additional \nsteps: \ni.  ACSO Personnel will exert reasonable efforts (which \nshall be deemed to require no fewer than five (5) \ntelephone inquiries and/or emails and/or text \n\nmessages unless exceptional circumstances intervene) \nto contact any qualified interpreters or interpreting \nagencies already known to the ACSO and request \ntheir services; \nii.  Inform the ADA Coordinator and/or ADA Deputy \nCoordinator of the efforts made to locate an \ninterpreter and solicit assistance in locating an \ninterpreter; \niii.  Inform the inmate, visitor, or the member of the \npublic of the efforts taken to secure a qualified \ninterpreter and that the efforts have failed, and follow \nup on reasonable suggestions for alternate sources of \nqualified interpreters; and \niv.  Document all of the above efforts. \nb.  Scheduled Interpreter Requests. A “scheduled interpreter \nrequest” is a request for an interpreter made two (2) or more \nhours before the services of the interpreter are required. For \nscheduled interpreter requests, the ACSO will make a \nqualified interpreter available at the time of the scheduled \nappointment. If an interpreter fails to arrive for the \nscheduled appointment, upon notice that the interpreter \nfailed to arrive, the ACSO will immediately use reasonable \nefforts (as defined in paragraph 32(a)(i)) to call an \ninterpreter service for another qualified interpreter. \n\nc.  Data Collection on Interpreter Response Time and \nFeedback. The ACSO will monitor the performance of each \nqualified interpreter it uses to provide communication to \ninmates, visitors, companions, and members of the public, \nwho are deaf or hard of hearing by monitoring their response \ntime and seeking feedback from the individual who requires \nthe services of the interpreter. As part of the Auxiliary Aid \nand Service Log, the ACSO shall collect and document \ninformation regarding response times and feedback for each \nrequest for an interpreter. \n33. Use of Interpreting Service Agency(ies). Within thirty (30) days \nof the effective date of this Agreement, the ACSO agrees: \na.  To contract with one or more qualified oral/sign language \ninterpreter agencies to ensure that interpreting services will \nbe available on a priority basis, twenty-four hours per day, \nseven days a week; \nb.  To confirm that the interpreter services selected have \nscreened their interpreters for quality, skill and reliability. \nACSO will review and update this list annually; \nc.  To provide the United States with documentation that such \ninterpreter services are being made available; and \nd.  To record all requests it receives for oral/sign language \ninterpreters and any action taken or denial of services. That \nrecord shall be provided to the United States for review of \n\ncompliance with this Agreement upon request by the United \nStates and in compliance reports as required in paragraph 55 \nbelow entitled “Compliance Reports.” \n34. Method for Obtaining Interpreters. The ACSO will establish \ninternal procedures for ordering interpreting services that is \nconsistent with the interpreter or interpreter agencies’ procedures. \nAt a minimum, all of the ACSO’s requests for interpreters, \nincluding the time and date, will be confirmed in writing at the \ntime of the request. Further, the ACSO will consider an order for \ninterpreting services to be complete only after receiving written \nconfirmation from the interpreting service that an interpreter will \nbe provided at the time and date requested. The ACSO will file a \ncopy of all written correspondence with interpreting services in the \ninmate’s record. Additionally, for the duration of this Agreement, \nthe ACSO will file a copy of its written correspondence with \ninterpreters and interpreting agencies in the Auxiliary Aid and \nService Log discussed in paragraph 53. \n35. Use of Other Members of the Public to Facilitate \nCommunication. \n  \na.  The ACSO shall not require an individual who is deaf or \nhard of hearing to bring another member of the public to \ninterpret for him or her. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(c)(1). \n\nb.  The ACSO will not rely on an adult accompanying an \nindividual who is deaf or hard of hearing to interpret or \nfacilitate communication except: \nc.  In an emergency involving an imminent threat to the safety \nor welfare of an individual or the public where there is no \ninterpreter available, or \nd.  Where the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing \nspecifically requests that the accompanying adult interpret or \nfacilitate communication, the accompanying adult agrees to \nprovide such assistance, and reliance on that adult for such \nassistance is appropriate under the circumstances. See 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.160(c)(2). \ne.  The ACSO shall not rely on a minor child to interpret or \nfacilitate communication, except in an emergency involving \nan imminent threat to the safety or welfare of an individual \nor the public where there is no interpreter available. 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.160(c)(1). \nf.  The imminent threat exception in this paragraph and its \nsubparts is not intended to apply to the typical and \nforeseeable emergency situations that are a part of the \nnormal operations of the Sheriff’s Department’s programs, \nservices, and activities. Personnel may rely on an \naccompanying individual to interpret or facilitate \ncommunication under this paragraph only in truly \nemergency circumstances, i.e., where any delay in providing \n\nimmediate services to the individual could have life-altering \nor life-ending consequences. See 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A. \nOnce the emergency has lifted, personnel should revisit the \ndecision of what auxiliary aids and services are appropriate \nand give primary consideration to those preferences. \n36. Prohibition on The Use of Employees or Inmates as Sign \nLanguage Interpreters or Oral Transliterators. The ACSO will \nnot use its personnel as sign language interpreters unless the \nemployee’s sign language interpreting skills have been evaluated \nand the ACSO can document that the individual is a “qualified \ninterpreter” pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. Further, the ACSO will \nnot use its employees as sign language interpreters or oral \ntransliterators if the employee or volunteer’s presence poses a \nconflict of interest or raises confidentiality and privacy concerns. \nThe ACSO shall not use inmates as interpreters or assistants to \nthose with disabilities. On occasion, an inmate may possess the \nskill level necessary to provide interpreting services; however, the \nimpartiality concerns remain, and inmate interpreters or \ntransliterators shall not be used due to confidentiality, privacy, and \nsecurity reasons. \n37. Other Means of Communication. The ACSO agrees that between \nthe time an interpreter is requested and the interpreter is provided, \nACSO Personnel will continue to try to communicate with the \ninmate, visitor, companions, or member of the public who is deaf \nor hard of hearing for such purposes and to the same extent as they \nwould have communicated with the person but for the disability, \n\nusing all available methods of communication, including using sign \nlanguage pictographs. This provision in no way lessens the \nACSO’s obligation to provide qualified interpreters in a timely \nmanner as required by paragraph 32. \n38. Video Remote Interpreting (VRI). VRI can provide immediate, \neffective access to interpreting services in a variety of situations \nincluding emergencies and unplanned incidents. When using VRI \nservices, ACSO shall ensure that it provides: (1) Real-time, full-\nmotion video and audio over a dedicated high-speed, wide-\nbandwidth video connection or wireless connection that delivers \nhigh-quality video images that do not produce lags, choppy, blurry, \nor grainy images, or irregular pauses in communication; (2) A \nsharply delineated image that is large enough to display the \ninterpreter’s face, arms, hands, and fingers, and the participating \nindividual’s face, arms, hands, and fingers, regardless of his or her \nbody position; (3) A clear, audible transmission of voices; and (4) \nAdequate training to users of the technology and other involved \nindividuals so that they may quickly and efficiently set up and \noperate the VRI. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(d). VRI shall not be used \nwhen it is not effective due, for example, to an individual’s limited \nability to move his or her head, hands or arms; vision or cognitive \nissues; significant pain; or due to space limitations in a room. If, \nbased on the circumstances, VRI is not providing effective \ncommunication after it has been provided or is not available due to \ncircumstances outside of the ACSO’s control, VRI shall not be \nused as a substitute for an on-site interpreter. Further, if the VRI \n\ndevice is not functioning properly and the ACSO is unable to get \nthe VRI device to function properly within 30 minutes of when it \nstarted to malfunction, it will call an on-site interpreter pursuant to \nparagraph 34. \n39. Reasonable Modification of Handcuffing Policies. When \npersonnel deem it necessary to handcuff a person who is deaf or \nhard of hearing, personnel will, safety permitting, reasonably \nmodify standard operating procedure and handcuff people who are \ndeaf or hard of hearing so their hands remain in front of them to \nfacilitate communication using sign language or writing. \n40. Signs. Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this \nAgreement, at the ACDF’s booking area, in the medical unit, and \nin each housing unit, the ACSO will post conspicuous signs. See 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.163. Such signs will advise persons who are deaf or \nhard of hearing of the availability of appropriate auxiliary aids and \nservices, including qualified interpreters, as follows: \nTo ensure effective communication with individuals who are deaf \nor hard of hearing, the Arlington County Sheriff’s Office will \nprovide auxiliary aids, such as qualified sign language, oral, or \ntactile interpreters; videophones; TTYs; and volume controlled \ntelephones, free of charge. \nPlease ask for assistance by contacting the ACSO’s ADA \nCoordinator, [name and full contact information]. \n\nThe posted signs will include the International Symbol for Hearing \nLoss, the International Symbol for TTYs, and a symbol to indicate \nthe availability of sign language interpreters: \n41. Videophones, Captioned Telephones, TTYs, Hearing-Aid \nCompatible Telephones, and Volume Control \nTelephones. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this \nAgreement, the ACSO agrees to provide, if it has not already done \nso, at least three devices capable of video telephone calls \n(including video relay calls), three TTYs, three captioned \ntelephones, three hearing aid compatible telephones, and three \nvolume control telephones for use by inmates and members of the \npublic at the ACDF. \na.  Where telephones are available to inmates or members of \nthe public, devices that enable video telephone calls \nincluding video relay calls, captioned telephones, TTYs, \nhearing aid compatible telephones, and volume control \ntelephones will be made available upon request. 28 C.F.R. § \n35.161. Signage will be displayed at all telephone areas \nindicating the availability of the device for video telephone \ncalls, TTY, the hearing aid compatible telephone, and the \nvolume control telephone and the procedure for obtaining \nthem. \nb.  The ACSO shall permit non-deaf inmates access to a device \ncapable of video of video telephone calls, captioned \ntelephone, or TTY, as needed to communicate with deaf and \n\nhard of hearing individuals outside the ACDF on the same \nterms that non-deaf individuals outside of the ACDF. \nc.  Where inmate telephone calls are time-limited, the ACSO \nwill provide inmates who are deaf or hard of hearing who \nuse TTYs, captioned telephones, or a telecommunications \nrelay system (including the Video Relay Service) three times \nthe normal length of time to make those calls, due to the \nslower nature of TTY and relayed communications \ncompared with direct voice communications. \nd.  If a device capable of video telephone calls including video \nrelay calls, captioned telephone calls, TTY, hearing aid \ncompatible telephone, or volume control telephone is not \navailable in the same location as telephones used by \narrestees or detainees who are not deaf or hard of hearing, \narrestees or detainees who need to use a device capable of \nvideo telephone calls including video relay calls, captioned \ntelephone, TTY, hearing aid compatible telephone, or \nvolume control telephone will be allocated reasonable \nadditional time to get to and from the location of the \nequipment. \ne.  The ACSO shall maintain all Auxiliary Aids for inmates and \nthe public, who are deaf or hard of hearing, in working \ncondition at all times. The ACSO shall attempt to resolve \ncomplaints about any malfunctioning equipment within a \n\nreasonable time of receiving that complaint, but no later than \n24 hours of receiving the complaint. \nf.  The ACSO shall ensure that sufficient staff members, \nincluding the ADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy \nCoordinator for Inmates, and at least two staff members per \nshift, are adequately trained in the operation of the \ntechnology used as auxiliary aids for telecommunication. \ng.  The ACSO shall not impose a surcharge on inmates for \nusing a telecommunications relay service. \n42. Privacy of Communications. The ACSO will ensure that the \nprivacy of telephone calls by arrestees or detainees using a device \ncapable of video telephone calls, TTY, hearing aid compatible \ntelephones, or volume control telephones is equal to that of other \narrestees’ or detainees’ telephone calls. \n43. Television Programming. Inmates and detainees who are deaf or \nhard of hearing will have access to captioned television \nprogramming that is equivalent to the access to television \nprogramming available to inmates and detainees without \ndisabilities in the same classification level. \n44. Visual Alert Notifications. \na.  Inmates who are deaf or hard of hearing and incarcerated at \nACDF should not miss announcements, alarms, or any other \nauditory information from ACDF staff to the general inmate \npopulation solely because of their disability. \n\nb.  The ACSO shall provide an effective visual notification \nsystem that will notify inmates who are deaf or hard of \nhearing, of ACDF wide events and events specific to \ninmates who are deaf. \nc.  The ACSO will provide inmates who are deaf or hard of \nhearing, with an effective visual notification system which \nwill advise them of an emergency evacuation or other \nemergency. ACSO personnel shall be responsible for the \nevacuation of inmates who are deaf, during an emergency. \nd.  The ACSO shall not rely solely on a “buddy” system, such \nas a system of using inmates or designated personnel, to \ncommunicate emergency information, announcements, \nalarms, or other auditory information to deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates. \n45. Hearing Aid and Cochlear Processor Batteries. Whenever \ninmates or detainees who use hearing aids, cochlear implants, or \nother such personal devices, are housed in the detention facility, the \nACSO will purchase appropriate types of hearing aid and cochlear \nprocess batteries when necessary. Replacement batteries for these \ndevices will be provided to those requesting them as soon as \npossible, but no later than 24 hours after such request. To the extent \nthe ACSO normally charges inmates and detainees for normal \nhealth maintenance items such as toothpaste, the ACSO may \nimpose reasonable fees for batteries required under this paragraph. \nFor inmates with cochlear implants or hearing aids that require \n\nrechargeable batteries, ACSO must permit the inmate to access \nboth rechargeable batteries and a device on which to recharge \nthem. Because of the proprietary nature of such batteries and \nchargers, ACSO must permit such inmates to maintain possession \nof any batteries found on their person at the time they enter ACDF \nand to allow inmates to receive extra batteries or chargers from \nothers. ACSO may maintain control of chargers and unused \nbatteries, but must permit the inmate to have indirect access \nchargers and extra batteries as needed to maintain functionality of \nthe inmate’s hearing aid or cochlear implant. \n46. Repair of Hearing Aids and Other Such Personal Devices. The \nACSO will send inmate and detainee hearing aids, cochlear \nprocessors, and other such devices to appropriate repair companies \nas soon as possible, but no later than the next day for which mail is \npicked up at the ACDF, following a request for the repair of such a \npersonal device. The ACSO shall inform the inmate or detainee \nwhen the device was sent for repair and when it is expected to be \nreturned by the repair company. The inmate or detainee will be \nprovided with written documentation of all such repairs, including \ndetailed information regarding the vendor used, the date of the \nrepair, and the specific repairs performed. Should an inmate or \ndetainee be unable to read this written documentation, then the \nACSO will use appropriate auxiliary aids and services to convey \nthe information in this documentation. \n47. Identification. The ACSO will take appropriate steps to ensure \nthat all personnel having contact with an inmate or detainee who is \n\ndeaf or hard of hearing are made aware of the person’s disability, \nand the person’s preferred auxiliary aids and services, so that \neffective communication with the person will be achieved. A \nperson’s identity as someone needing appropriate auxiliary aids \nand services for effective communication will not be treated as \nconfidential medical information for ACSO personnel. \n48. Prohibition of Surcharges. All appropriate auxiliary aids and \nservices required by this Agreement will be provided free of charge \nto the Inmate, visitor companion, or member of the public who is \ndeaf or hard of hearing. \n49. Effective Communication Policies and Procedures. Within sixty \n(60) days of the effective date of this Agreement, the ACSO will \nsubmit for review and approval to the United States its policies and \nprocedures to implement fully the Settlement Agreement. Upon \nreceipt of the United States’ comments, the ACSO will address all \nof the United States’ concerns, if any, and will resubmit a draft for \nfinal approval, if any changes were needed. The adoption of the \nfinal policies and procedures will occur within 30 days of the \nACSO’s receipt of approval by the United States. \n50. Training. \na.  The ACSO has hired an independent agency or group to \nconduct the trainings described in this Agreement. The \nsyllabus and training materials will be provided to the \nUnited States. \n\nb.  Within 90 days of the effective date of this Agreement, and \nat least once annually throughout the term of this \nAgreement, the ACSO will ensure that all personnel, \nincluding contractors and employees of contractors, who \nhave contact with inmates, companion, visitors to the ACDF \nand other members of the public, will receive training as to \neffective communication with persons who are deaf or hard \nof hearing. The training will be sufficiently detailed to \nenable personnel to effectively implement all provisions of \nthis Agreement, including the relevant Exhibits, all policies \nand procedures developed pursuant to this Agreement, and \nall effective communication requirements under the ADA. \nc.  The ACSO will ensure that all new personnel who will have \ncontact with inmates, visitors to the ACDF and other \nmembers of the public will receive ADA training as a \ncomponent of pre-service training and orientation. \n51. Training Attendance Sheets. The ACSO will maintain in \nelectronic form for the duration of this Agreement, confirmation of \ntraining conducted pursuant to paragraphs 19 and 50 of this \nAgreement, which will include the names, signature, and respective \njob titles of the attendees, as well as the date and time of the \ntraining session. \n52. Report of Training. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of \nthis Agreement, the ACSO will provide the United States with a \ncopy of all training materials used to train its staff, training \n\nattendance sheets required in Paragraph 51, above, and \nphotographs of the notices posted in its offices pursuant to this \nAgreement. \n53. Auxiliary Aid and Service Log. The ACSO will maintain a log in \nwhich requests for qualified interpreters on site or through video \nremote services will be documented. The log will indicate the time \nand date the request was made, the name of the Inmate, companion, \nvisitor or other member of the public who is deaf or hard of \nhearing, the nature of the auxiliary aid or service provided, and the \ntime and date the appropriate auxiliary aid or service was provided. \nIf no auxiliary aid or service was provided, the log shall contain a \nstatement why the auxiliary aid and service was not provided. The \nlog should include the identity of the ACSO personnel who \nconducted the assessment and made the determination. Such logs \nwill be maintained by the ADA Coordinator for the entire duration \nof the Agreement, and will be incorporated into the Compliance \nReports as described in paragraph 55 of this Agreement.  \n54. Disability Rights Grievance Procedures. Within 60 days of the \neffective date of this agreement, the ACSO shall submit to the \nUnited States for its review and approval a grievance procedure \nproviding for the prompt and equitable resolution by the ADA \nCoordinator for Inmates of requests by inmates with disabilities for \nauxiliary aids and services, reasonable modifications of policies, \npractices or procedures, or complaints by inmates alleging any \naction that would be prohibited by the ADA. The ACSO will adopt \nand publish these grievance procedures once approved by the \n\nUnited States. Such procedures shall provide for a written decision \nand, if appropriate, corrective action, on any complete complaint or \ncomplete request within no more than five business days after the \ndate of its submission. If the ADA Coordinator for Inmates \nreceives a complaint or request that is not complete, the ADA \nCoordinator for Inmates shall notify the inmate within one business \ndays that the complaint or request is incomplete and identify the \nadditional information that is needed to complete the complaint or \nrequest. Copies of all grievances related to ADA issues will be \nmaintained by the ADA Coordinator for the entire duration of the \nAgreement, and will be incorporated into the semi-annual \nCompliance Reports as described in paragraph 55 of this \nAgreement. The ADA grievance procedures required to be \nimplemented under this paragraph shall be printed in the Inmate \nHandbook that is provided to all inmates upon admission to the \nACDF. 28 C.F.R. § 35.107(b). \n55. Compliance Reports. Beginning six months after the Effective \nDate of this Agreement and every twelve months thereafter for the \nentire duration of the Agreement, the ACSO will provide a written \nreport (“Compliance Report”) to the United States regarding the \nstatus of its compliance with this Agreement. The Compliance \nReport will include a narrative report of the actions taken by the \nADA Coordinator and the ADA Deputy Coordinator for Inmates \nduring the preceding year and any plans for action concerning \nADA compliance in the coming year. The report shall include as an \nexhibit copies of all inmate complaints or requests for auxiliary \n\naids and services, or reasonable modifications of policies, practices \nor procedures, or requests related to physical access issues received \nby the ADA Coordinator and ADA Deputy Coordinator for \nInmates and all documents reflecting any actions taken or decisions \nrendered by the ADA Coordinator for Inmates in response to such \ncomplaints or requests during the reporting period. The report will \nalso include the Auxiliary Aid and Service Log described in \nparagraph 53. The ACSO will maintain records to document the \ninformation contained in the Compliance Reports and will make \nthem available, upon request, to the United States. The United \nStates may review compliance with this Agreement at any time. \n56. Complaints. During the term of this Agreement, the ACSO will \nnotify the U.S. Attorney’s Office if any person files a lawsuit or \ncomplaint, with a state or federal agency, alleging that the ACSO \nfailed to comply with the ADA. Such notification must be provided \nin writing via certified mail within 30 days of the date the ACSO \nreceived notice of the allegation and will include, at a minimum, \nthe nature of the allegation, the name of the person making the \nallegation, and any non-privileged documentation possessed by the \nACSO relevant to the allegation. The ACSO will reference this \nprovision of the Agreement in the notification to the U.S. \nAttorney’s Office. \nEnforcement and Miscellaneous \n57. This Agreement will be in effect for three (3) years from the \nEffective Date. \n\n58. Monetary Relief. Within thirty (30) days after receiving the \ncomplainant’s signed release, the Virginia Department of Treasury, \nDivision of Risk Management on behalf of the ACSO will issue a \ncheck in the amount of $250,000.00 made out to PJ (using his \nactual name). The check is compensation to the Complainant for \nthe effects of the alleged discrimination suffered as described in \nparagraph 7 above. The checks shall be mailed to: \nFinancial Litigation Unit \nUnited States Attorney’s Office for \nEastern District of Virginia \n101 W.

In consideration of the terms of this Agreement as set forth above, \nthe United States agrees to refrain from undertaking further \ninvestigation or from filing a civil suit under Title II of the ADA \nrelated to PJ’s allegations in paragraph 2, except as provided in \nparagraph 60. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or \nshall be construed as a waiver by the United States of any right to \ninstitute proceedings against the ACSO for violations of any \n\nstatutes, regulations, or rules administered by the United States or \nto prevent or limit the right of the United States to obtain relief \nunder the ADA. \n60.  The United States may review compliance with this Agreement at \nany time and can enforce this Agreement if the United States \nbelieves that it or any requirement thereof has been violated by \ninstituting a civil action in the U.S. District Court. If the United \nStates believes that this Agreement or any portion of it has been \nviolated, it will raise its claim(s) in writing with the ACSO, and the \nparties will attempt to resolve the concern(s) in good faith. The \nUnited States will allow the ACSO thirty (30) days from the date it \nnotifies the ACSO of any breach of this Agreement to cure said \nbreach, prior to instituting any court action to enforce the ADA or \nthe terms of the Agreement. \n61. This Agreement and the attachments hereto constitute the entire \nagreement between the parties on the matters raised herein, and no \nother statement, promise, or agreement, either written or oral, made \nby either party or agents of either party, that is not contained in this \nwritten agreement, shall be enforceable.

Failure by the United States to seek enforcement of this \nAgreement pursuant to its terms with respect to any instance or \nprovision shall not be construed as a waiver to such enforcement \nwith regard to other instances or provisions. \n64. The effective date of this Agreement is the date of the last signature \nbelow. \n65. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which \nconstitutes an original and all of which constitute one and the same \nAgreement. Electronically transmitted signatures shall constitute \nacceptable, binding signatures for purposes of this Agreement. \n66. If any term of this Agreement is determined by any court to be \nunenforceable, the other terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless \nremain in full force and effect, provided, however, that if the \nseverance of any such provision materially alters the rights or \nobligations of the parties, the United States and the ACSO shall \nengage in good faith negotiations in order to adopt mutually \nagreeable amendments to this Agreement as may be necessary to \nrestore the parties as closely as possible to the initially agreed upon \nrelative rights and obligations. \nFOR THE UNITED STATES: \nLauren A.

Defendant Elizabeth F. Arthur, the \nArlington County Sheriff, in her official capacity (the \n1 \n \n\n“Sheriff”) filed a motion to dismiss the Title II ADA claim \nagainst her.  (Sheriff’s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. 30]; Sheriff’s \nMem. in Supp. [Dkt. 31].)  Defendants Virginia Department of \nCorrections (“VDOC”), Harold W. Clarke, VDOC Director, in his \nofficial capacity (the “VDOC Director”), Virginia Board of \nCorrections (the “Board”), and Carl R. Peed, Chairman of the \nBoard, in his official capacity (collectively the “State \nDefendants”) filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint \nagainst them in its entirety.  (State Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss \n[Dkt. 36]; State Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. [Dkt. 37].)  For the \nfollowing reasons, the Court will deny the Sheriff’s motion and \ngrant the State Defendants’ motion. \nI. Background \n    At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must read \nthe complaint as a whole, construe the complaint in a light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff, and accept the facts alleged in the \ncomplaint as true.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \n    Plaintiff is deaf and has no functional ability to \nspeak English or to read lips.  (Am. Compl. [Dkt. 21] ¶¶ 12, \n15.)  Plaintiff was born and raised in Ethiopia but became a \nUnited States citizen in 2008.  (Id. at ¶ 11.)  He does know \nlimited English through courses he took at Gallaudet University, \nbut he “struggles” to read, write, and understand even basic \nEnglish sentences.  (Id. at ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff’s primary language \n2 \n \n\nis ASL and his employment history is limited to manual labor \njobs that do not require proficiency in spoken or written \nEnglish.  (Id. at ¶¶ 14, 16.)   \n    On February 2, 2014, Plaintiff was arrested at Ronald \nReagan Washington National Airport (“National Airport”) after he \nwent there to find somewhere warm to sleep.1  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 18-\n19.)  Shortly after his arrest, in the early morning hours of \nFebruary 3, 2014, Plaintiff was transported to the jail where he \nstarted the booking process.  (Id. at ¶ 25.)  Plaintiff \nattempted to communicate with the National Airport police \nofficers and jail personnel using gestures and in writing.  (Id. \nat ¶¶ 20, 26.)  Plaintiff also requested an ASL interpreter but \none was not provided.  (Id.)  Consequently, Plaintiff did not \nknow why he had been arrested nor did he understand why he was \nbeing detained in the jail.  (Id. at ¶ 27.)  Plaintiff also \nappeared in front of a judge via video conference, but he could \nnot signal to the judge that he was deaf because jail personnel \ninstructed him to remain still.  (Id. at ¶ 28.) \n    As part of the booking process, Plaintiff underwent a \nmedical evaluation, where he made additional requests for \nassistance.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 26-36.)  His requests were again \ndenied.  (Id.)  Without an ASL interpreter, Plaintiff did not \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiff resides in Washington, D.C., but currently has no \nfixed address.  (Id. at ¶ 4.)   \n3 \n \n\nunderstand the medical evaluation process and refused to sign a \nconsent form that he could not read.  (Id. at ¶¶ 37-39.)  Jail \npersonnel then forced a needle into Plaintiff’s arm without his \nconsent and placed him in isolation.  (Id. at ¶¶ 40-43.)  Scared \nand confused, Plaintiff banged on the cell door and repeatedly \ngestured for assistance, still unaware as to why he was being \nincarcerated.  (Id. at ¶ 43.)  Plaintiff had a negative skin \nreaction to the forced medical procedure and underwent an \nadditional medical procedure, but still did not understand what \nwas happening.  (Id. at ¶ 44.) \n    Approximately 24 hours after his arrest, on February \n4, 2014, Plaintiff was arraigned in Arlington County General \nDistrict Court through the assistance of an ASL interpreter.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.)  At his arraignment, Plaintiff first \nlearned he had been arrested and incarcerated for allegedly \nstealing an iPad.  (Id.)  Plaintiff returned to the jail after \nhis arraignment and remained incarcerated for nearly six weeks.  \n(Id. at ¶ 23.)  During his period of incarceration, Defendants \nrefused to provide effective means for Plaintiff to communicate, \nand consequently, Plaintiff was deprived of meals (id. at ¶¶ 46-\n48), recreation (id. at ¶¶ 70-75), and rehabilitative services \nat various times (id. at ¶¶ 76-83).2 \n                                                           \n2 The Jail uses auditory alerts to signal the beginning of meal \nand recreation times.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 71.)  When inmates hear the \n4 \n \n\n    During Plaintiff’s incarceration, the jail also failed \nto provide Plaintiff with an adequate accommodation for \ntelephone access.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 49-65.)  The jail offered to \nprovide Plaintiff with a teletypewriter (“TTY”) to make phone \ncalls.  (Id. at ¶ 56.)  However, Plaintiff could not communicate \neffectively using TTY because TTY requires proficiency in \nEnglish.  (Id. at ¶ 57.)  The jail does not have a videophone or \nany device equipped with videophone software that Plaintiff \ncould have used to make telephone calls.  (Id. at ¶¶ 50-52.)  \nPlaintiff attempted to place a telephone call to a friend using \nTTY, but was unsuccessful.  (Id. at ¶¶ 59-60.)  Subsequently, an \nofficer at the jail placed a call to Plaintiff’s friend, who \neventually visited Plaintiff at the jail.  (Id. at ¶¶ 62-63.)  \nBecause of the lack of a videophone, Plaintiff was unable to \nplace telephone calls for the duration of his incarceration at \nthe jail.  (Id. at ¶ 64.)  Plaintiff also could not regularly \ncommunicate with his court-appointed attorney via telephone, \nunlike other inmates, and instead relied on in-person visits \nmade on the attorney’s own accord.  (Id. at ¶¶ 66-69.) \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nalert, they press a button to open their cell doors.  (Id.)  \nWhen Plaintiff was in isolation, he could not hear the auditory \nalert and repeatedly missed meals and recreation time.  (Id. at \n¶ 73.)  Once in general population, Plaintiff learned how the \nauditory signal worked by observing other inmates.  (Id.)  \nConsequently, Plaintiff missed meals approximately two to three \ntimes per week and missed recreation times approximately one \ntime per week, due to the lack of auxiliary aids.  (Id. at ¶ \n74.)     \n5 \n \n\n    Plaintiff claims that Defendants violated Title II of \nthe ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by knowingly \nand intentionally failing to provide him with an ASL interpreter \nor other auxiliary aids and accommodations, which denied him the \nsame benefits and services available to non-deaf inmates.  (Am. \nCompl. at ¶¶ 108, 121.)  Specifically, as a result of these \nviolations, Plaintiff claims that he was unable to communicate \nwith jail personnel during the booking process and medical \nprocedures, that he was unable to effectively communicate his \ndietary needs, and that he was deprived access to telephone \ncalls, access to counsel, meals and recreation, and \nrehabilitative services.  (Id.)  Plaintiff seeks declaratory and \ncompensatory relief.  (Id. at 27.)   \n    In her motion to dismiss the Title II claim in count \none, the Sheriff argues that she is immune from suit under the \nEleventh Amendment and that Title II does not abrogate her \nsovereign immunity.  (Sheriff’s Mem. at 4-8.)  The Sheriff does \nnot contest the Section 504 claim in count two.  The State \nDefendants present two arguments in their motion to dismiss.  \nFirst, the State Defendants argue that they are not liable on \neither count one or count two for the actions of the Sheriff, \nwho is solely responsible for operation of the jail.  (State \nDefs.’ Mem. at 3-7.)  Second, the State Defendants argue that \nthey are also immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and \n6 \n \n\nask that the Title II claim in count one be dismissed.  (Id. at \n8-10.)  Both motions have been fully briefed and are ripe for \ndisposition. \nII. Legal Standard \n     All Defendants filed their motion to dismiss based on \nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, at least in \npart.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit \nhas not resolved “whether a dismissal on Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity grounds is a dismissal for failure to state a claim \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) or a dismissal for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).”  Andrews v. Dew, 201 F.3d \n521, 525 n.2 (4th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).  “The recent \ntrend, however, appears to treat Eleventh Amendment immunity \nmotions under Rule 12(b)(1).”  Skaggs v. W. Reg’l Jail, Civ. A. \nNo. 3:13-3293, 2014 WL 66645, at *4 (S.D.W. Va. Jan. 8, 2014) \n(citations omitted); see also Roach v. W. Va. Reg’l Jail & Corr. \nAuth., 74 F.3d 46, 48 (4th Cir. 1996) (“[T]he Eleventh Amendment \nlimits the ability of a federal district court to exercise its \nsubject-matter jurisdiction over an action brought against a \nstate or one of its entities.”).  \n    Whether the Court evaluates the pending motions to \ndismiss with respect to the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue \nunder Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) makes little practical \ndifference, however.  See Beckham v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., \n7 \n \n\n569 F. Supp. 2d 542, 547 (D. Md. 2008) (citation omitted).  “A \nRule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction may contend either (1) that the complaint fails to \nallege facts sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction \nor (2) the alleged jurisdictional facts are untrue.”  Id. \n(citing Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982)).  \nDefendants contend the factual allegations are insufficient and \ndo not establish the abrogation of their sovereign immunity \nunder the Eleventh Amendment.  Thus, the Court must accept the \nallegations in the amended complaint as true and construe them \nin a light most favorable to Plaintiff, just as it would under a \nmotion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Id.  \nIII. Analysis \n    The Sheriff and the State Defendants argue that under \nthe Eleventh Amendment, they are immune from Plaintiff’s Title \nII claim in Count One.  The State Defendants additionally argue \nthat Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to establish \nsupervisory liability between the jail, its employees, and the \nState Defendants.  The Court first addresses the State \nDefendants’ supervisory liability. \n    A. Supervisory Liability of the State Defendants \n    The State Defendants contend they are not liable for \nacts that occur in the jail, which is run solely by the Sheriff, \nand ask for dismissal from the lawsuit on this basis.  (State \n8 \n \n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 3-7.)  Stated differently, the State Defendants \nargue that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief because \nunder Virginia law, the State Defendants are too far removed \nfrom the day-to-day operations of the jail and do not perform \nany supervisory function.  (State Defs.’ Reply [Dkt. 57] at 1-\n7.)  Plaintiff argues that the State Defendants are liable under \na theory of supervisory liability.3  (Pl.’s Opp’n to State Defs. \n[Dkt. 40] at 14-18.)  For the following reasons, the Court will \ngrant the State Defendants’ motion and dismiss them from this \nlawsuit. \n    The parties agree that to state claims against the \nState Defendants under a theory of supervisory liability, which \nis most often used in the context of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nlitigation, a “plaintiff must show actual or constructive \nknowledge of a risk of constitutional injury, deliberate \nindifference to that risk, and an ‘affirmative causal link’ \nbetween the supervisor’s inaction and the particular \nconstitutional injury suffered by the plaintiff.”  Carter v. \n                                                           \n3 The amended complaint does not assert liability under a theory \nof respondeat superior, but instead, supervisory liability, \nwhich is the appropriate basis in this circuit.  See Shaw v. \nStroud, 13 F.3d 791, 798 (4th Cir. 1994) (“[L]iability is not \npremised upon respondeat superior but upon ‘a recognition that \nsupervisory indifference or tacit authorization of subordinates’ \nmisconduct may be a causative factor in the constitutional \ninjuries they inflict on those committed to their care.”) \n(quoting Slakan v. Porter, 737 F.2d 368, 372-73 (4th Cir. \n1984)).   \n9 \n \n\nMorris, 164 F.3d 215, 221 (4th Cir. 1999) (“[R]espondeat \nsuperior is not the standard.”) (quoting Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d \n791, 799 (4th Cir. 1994)).  Implicit in the third element of the \nprima facie case is that the State Defendants must act as \nsupervisors or “supervisory employees” whose inaction or \ndeliberate indifference affirmatively caused the particular \nconstitutional injury that Plaintiff has suffered.  See Shaw, 13 \nF.3d at 798 (stating “supervisory officials may be held liable \nin certain circumstances for the constitutional injuries \ninflicted by their subordinates.”).  Moreover, this inaction \nmust itself be a “direct cause” of the injury alleged, which is \na heavy burden.  Newbrough v. Piedmont Reg’l Jail Auth., 822 F. \nSupp. 2d 558, 586 (E.D. Va. 2011).   \n    Plaintiff alleges that Chairman Peed and the Board \nestablish minimum standards regarding the health, safety, and \nwelfare of all correctional facility inmates in Virginia, and \nthat Director Clarke and the VDOC monitors implementation and \nenforcement of those standards.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 85-86.); see \nalso Va. Code §§ 53.1-5, 53.1-10.  But as a matter of law, local \ncounty Sheriffs in the Commonwealth of Virginia are independent \nconstitutional officers solely responsible for the operation of \ntheir local jail.  See Va. Const., art. VII, § 4 (“There shall \nbe elected by the qualified voters of each county and city a \ntreasurer, a sheriff, an attorney for the Commonwealth, a clerk \n10 \n \n\n. . . and a commissioner of revenue.”); see also Va. Code § \n53.1-116.2 (“The sheriff of each county or city shall be the \nkeeper of the jail thereof[.]”).  It is of no import that \nPlaintiff alleges the deliberate indifference of the State \nDefendants actually caused the constitutional injuries he \nsuffered.  This is because it is undisputed that Plaintiff was \nincarcerated at the Arlington County Detention Facility, a local \njail where Sheriff Arthur and the deputies who work under her \ncommand are responsible for applying the standards and policies \nset by the State Defendants.  Therefore, for the following \nreasons, Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief against the \nState Defendants for any alleged injury that occurred during his \nincarceration in the jail.   \n    First, under the Virginia Code, local Sheriffs are \nsolely responsible for running the locality’s jail.  Plaintiff \nalleges the State Defendants, in their policy-setting role, had \nconstructive knowledge of the deficient accommodations and aids \navailable to deaf detainees in local jails throughout the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.  See Guerrero v. Deane, 750 F. Supp. \n2d 631, 657 (E.D. Va. 2010).  On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion the \nCourt assumes this allegation to be true.  Regardless, “[t]he \nprimary responsibility for application of [the Board’s] \nstandards shall be with the sheriff or chief executive officer \nof the jail or lockup.”  6 Va. Admin. Code § 15-40-20; see also \n11 \n \n\nVa. Code § 53.1-116.2 (“The sheriff of each county or city shall \nbe the keeper of the jail thereof[.]”).  Admittedly, the State \nDefendants are responsible for setting policies and auditing \ncorrectional facilities for compliance with those policies.  But \nthe Board and the VDOC do not apply or enforce these policies in \nlocal jails as Plaintiff alleges.  As a matter of Virginia law, \nthat responsibility resides only with the Sheriff.  Instead, \nstate correctional facilities, i.e. state prisons or \npenitentiaries, house convicted offenders sentenced to a year or \nmore of incarceration and are “operated by the Department of \nCorrections[.]”  Va. Code § 53.1-1.  The Virginia Code expressly \ndistinguishes between state correctional facilities (Chapter 2 \nunder Title 53.1) and local correctional facilities like the \njail (Chapter 3 under Title 53.1).  Compare Va. Code § 51.1-18 \nthrough § 53.1-67.8, with Va. Code § 53.1-68 through 53.1-\n133.10.      \n    Second, the State Defendants do not supervise the \nSheriff in the manner contemplated under the prima facie case of \nsupervisory liability.  While the Virginia Code does provide the \nBoard with certain enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance \nwith standards and policies, the mechanisms are indirect and do \nnot give the Board direct supervisory authority over sheriffs or \nthe operation of the local jail.  For one, Sheriffs are not \nemployees of the Commonwealth of Virginia and thus not subject \n12 \n \n\nto supervision by Virginia agencies.  See Doud v. Commonwealth, \n717 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Va. 2011) (“[T]he sheriff of Russell County \nwas not an ‘employee’ of the Commonwealth within the definitions \ncontained in the [Virginia Tort Claims Act].  The sheriff’s \ndeputies and jailors were employees of the sheriff, not of the \nCommonwealth.”).  Instead, Virginia sheriffs are independent \nconstitutional officers who are responsible only to the voters.  \nId. (“Constitutional officers are responsible to the voters who \nelected them but do not depend upon either the government of the \nCommonwealth or upon the governing bodies of their counties or \ncities for their authority.”); see also Va. Const. art. 7, § 4.  \nAs the manager of the jail, the Sheriff is also responsible for \nthe sheriff deputies who work in the jail.  See Va. Code § 53.1-\n68 (“The sheriff shall establish minimum performance standards \nand management practices to govern the employees for whom the \nsheriff is responsible.”).   \n    The Board can indirectly affect the operation of the \njail, but not to the degree required for supervisory liability \nto attach.  For instance, the Board may prohibit confinement and \nrequire transfer of prisoners in substandard jails.  Va. Code § \n53.1-69.  But only the local circuit court can directly penalize \nthe Sheriff for failure to properly operate the jail.  Compare \nVa. Code § 53.1-69, with Va. Code § 53.1-118 (“If it appears to \nthe circuit court having jurisdiction that the sheriff or jail \n13 \n \n\nsuperintendent has in any respect failed to perform his duties \nwith respect to operation of the jail, the court may, after \nsummoning him to show cause against it, summarily fine him not \nmore than fifty dollars.”).  Additionally, under the Virginia \nCode, the Board can file a lawsuit against the Sheriff for \nfailure to comply with any requirements set by the Board.  See \nVa. Code § 53.1-125.  Notably, however, the Virginia Code does \nnot provide any other enforcement mechanism, and if the circuit \ncourt deems the complaint “justified, it shall enter an order \ndirecting the State Compensation Board to withhold approval of \npayment of any further salary to the sheriff . . . until there \nhas been compliance with specified requirements of the Board.”  \nId.  In short, while there are indirect enforcement mechanisms \navailable to the Board and local circuit court to ensure the \nlocal jail’s compliance with standards and requirements, as a \nmatter of Virginia law, these statutory provisions do not \nestablish the “affirmative causal link” necessary between the \nState Defendants and the particular constitutional injury \nsuffered by Plaintiff for supervisory liability to attach.  \nStated differently, by way of analogy, under Virginia law, \nassuming the other elements were satisfied, the Sheriff herself \ncould theoretically be liable for any inaction related to her \ndeputies who she directly manages under a theory of supervisory \nliability.  See Va. Code § 53.1-68.  But the relationship \n14 \n \n\nbetween the State Defendants and the operation of local \ncorrectional facilities throughout Virginia is indirect and \ninsufficient as a matter of law.    \n    Ultimately, Plaintiff’s claims against the State \nDefendants cannot survive given his inability to establish “an \naffirmative causal link between the supervisor’s [State \nDefendants’] inaction and the harm suffered by the plaintiff.”  \nId. (quoting Slakan, 737 F.2d at 376; Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. \n362 (1976)).  Therefore, the Court will grant the State \nDefendants motion to dismiss and dismiss this matter with \nprejudice as to them.  This result does not totally prevent \nPlaintiff’s potential recovery, because as discussed below, both \ncounts will remain against the Sheriff in her official capacity \nas keeper of the jail.   \n    B. The Sheriff’s Motion to Dismiss Title II Claim \n    By enacting Title II of the ADA, Congress “invoke[d] \nthe sweep of congressional authority, including the power to \nenforce the fourteenth amendment . . . in order to address the \nmajor areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with \ndisabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4).  Title II of the ADA \nprovides: \n[N]o qualified individual with a disability \nshall,  by  reason  of  such  disability,  be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied \nthe  benefits  of  the  services,  programs,  or \nactivities  of  a  public  entity,  or  be \n15 \n \n\nsubjected  to  discrimination  by  any  such \nentity. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  For purposes of the pending motions to \ndismiss, it is undisputed that Plaintiff is a “qualified \nindividual with a disability” and the jail is a “public entity” \nunder Title II, which expressly authorizes suits by private \ncitizens for money damages against public entities that violate \nsection 12132.  42 U.S.C. § 12133 (incorporating 29 U.S.C. § \n794a).  To state a claim for relief under Title II of the ADA, \nPlaintiff must allege: (1) he has a disability; (2) he is \notherwise qualified to receive the benefits of a public service, \nprogram, or activity; and (3) he was excluded from participation \nin or denied the benefits of such service, program, or activity, \nor otherwise discriminated against, on the basis of his \ndisability.  Constantine v. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason \nUniv., 411 F.3d 474, 498 (4th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).  \nStated differently, “if a person is disabled and otherwise \nqualified, the state must ensure that the person is not denied \nthe benefits of services, activities, or programs because of his \nor her disability.”  Chase v. Baskerville, 508 F. Supp. 2d 492, \n498 (E.D. Va. 2007).   \n    The Sheriff does not contest the sufficiency of \nPlaintiff’s allegations to support a prima facie case under \nTitle II.  Instead, the Sheriff contends she is immune from suit \n16 \n \n\nunder the Eleventh Amendment and that Congress did not validly \nabrogate her sovereign immunity by enacting Title II. \n    1. Abrogation of Sovereign Immunity \n    Sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment \napplies not only to the state itself but “extends also to ‘state \nagents and state instrumentalities’ . . . or stated otherwise to \n‘arm[s] of the State.’”  Cash v. Granville Cnty. Bd. of Educ., \n242 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).  It is \nwell-established that a suit against a state official in his or \nher official capacity should be treated as an action against the \nstate.  Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991); see also Kitchen \nv. Upshaw, 286 F.3d 179, 183-84 (4th Cir. 2002) (“The Eleventh \nAmendment limits the Article III jurisdiction of the federal \ncourts to hear cases against States and state officers acting in \ntheir official capacities.”).  Here, filing suit against the \nArlington County Sheriff in her official capacity is treated as \nan action against the state subject to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity.  See Vollette v. Watson, 937 F. Supp. 2d 706, 714 \n(E.D. Va. 2013) (“Based on [Virginia law], federal district \ncourts applying Virginia law have repeatedly held that Virginia \nSheriffs, and their deputies, are ‘state officers’ for the \npurpose of the Eleventh Amendment.”).  \n    Nonetheless, the Sheriff is still subject to suit if \n(1) she unambiguously consents to that suit or (2) Congress, \n17 \n \n\nacting under powers granted to it in section five of the \nFourteenth Amendment, has clearly abrogated her immunity.  \nSee Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54-55 \n(1996); see also Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. \n234, 242 (1985).  Because it is undisputed that the Sheriff did \nnot consent to this suit under Title II, count one in the \namended complaint survives only if Congress acted within its \npower to clearly abrogate her immunity.4  To make this \ndetermination, the Court “must resolve two predicate questions: \nfirst, whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to \nabrogate that immunity; and second, if it did, whether Congress \nacted pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.”  \nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 517 (2004) (quoting Kimel v. \nFla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 73 (2000)).   \n    The first question is well-settled: Congress \nunequivocally expressed its intent under Title II to abrogate a \nstate’s Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  Lane, 541 U.S. \nat 518 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12202 (“A State shall not be immune \nunder the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates from an action in Federal or State court of competent \n                                                           \n4 The Sheriff validly waived her immunity from suit under Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act in count two of the amended \ncomplaint.  See Constantine, 411 F.3d at 496 (holding that \nrecipients of federal financial assistance waive sovereign \nimmunity under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act).  Indeed, \nthe Sheriff does not seek dismissal of count two. \n18 \n \n\njurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.”)).  Thus, the \nthrust of this Court’s inquiry concerns the second question: \nwhether Congress enacted Title II pursuant to a valid grant of \nconstitutional authority, i.e. the enforcement power in Section \n5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 517; see also Nev. Dep’t \nof Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 727-28 (2003) (“[T]he \nEleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which \nit embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement \nprovisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.”) (quoting \nFitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976) (citation \nomitted)); Chase, 508 F. Supp. at 498 (“[T]he only question ‘is \nwhether Congress had the power to give effect to its intent.’”) \n(quoting Lane, 541 U.S. at 518).   \n    Congress has the power under Section 5 of the \nFourteenth Amendment to enforce the provisions in Section 1 of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment “by creating private remedies against \nthe States for actual violations of those provisions.”  United \nStates v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 158-59 (2006) (holding a \nparaplegic inmate’s Title II claims for money damages were \nbased, at least in part, on conduct that actually violated the \nEighth Amendment and thus actually violated Section 1 of the \nFourteenth Amendment, including the deliberate refusal of prison \nofficials to accommodate the inmate’s disability-related needs \n19 \n \n\nin such fundamentals as mobility, hygiene, medical care, and \nalmost all other prison programs) (emphasis in original).   \n    Here, first, Plaintiff has not alleged actual \nviolations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Instead, his amended \ncomplaint states two statutory causes of action: one under the \nADA and the second under the Rehabilitation Act.  Chase is \ninstructive on this issue.  There, the deaf Virginia state \nprisoner filed a civil rights action alleging “the failure to \nprovide him with an interpreter to assist him in his school work \nviolated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment, the Rehabilitation \nAct, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).”  \n508 F. Supp. 2d at 497.  Here, in contrast, Plaintiff’s amended \ncomplaint alleges the failure to provide him with an ASL \ninterpreter in the jail violated only his rights under Title II \n(count one) and Section 504 (count two).  (See generally Am. \nCompl. at 21-26.)  He does not expressly allege that the jail’s \nfailure to provide an interpreter actually violated his rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.  Stated differently, Plaintiff \ndoes not raise a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate any \nactual violations of his constitutional rights.  Thus, the \nCourt’s decision on this issue is not controlled by Georgia. \n    Instead, the issue now before this Court is, and the \nquestion left unanswered in Georgia was--assuming Plaintiff \n20 \n \n\nfailed to allege an actual Fourteenth Amendment violation--\nwhether Title II is within the scope of Congress’s prophylactic \nenforcement powers in Section 5 as an appropriate remedy for \nPlaintiff’s alleged injuries.  See Hibbs, 538 U.S. at 728 \n(“Section 5 legislation reaching beyond the scope of § 1’s \nactual guarantees must be an appropriate remedy for identified \nconstitutional violations, not ‘an attempt to substantively \nredefine the States’ legal obligations.”) (quoting Kimel, 528 \nU.S. at 88); see also Lane, 541 U.S. at 518 (recognizing \nCongress’s power under Section 5 is broad and includes “the \nauthority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights [by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment and] by prohibiting a somewhat broader \nswath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden \nby the Amendment’s text.”) (quoting Kimel, 528 U.S. at 81 \n(quoting City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 518 (1997))).  \nSection 5 authorizes the enactment of “prophylactic legislation \nproscribing practices that are discriminatory in effect, if not \nin intent, to carry out the basic objectives of the Equal \nProtection Clause.”  Lane, 541 U.S. at 520.  The scope of \nCongress’s power in this regard remains unsettled.  See Georgia, \n546 U.S. at 158 (“[T]he Members of this Court have disagreed \nregarding the scope of Congress’s ‘prophylactic’ enforcement \npowers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . .”) \n(citations omitted).     \n21 \n \n\n    Generally, legislation enacted pursuant to Section 5 \nof the Fourteenth Amendment is within Congress’s prophylactic \nenforcement power if there is “congruence and proportionality \nbetween the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means \nadopted to that end.”  Boerne, 521 U.S. at 520.  The parties \nagree that to make this determination, the Court employs a \nthree-part test first announced by the Supreme Court in Boerne, \n521 U.S. at 518, and re-affirmed in Lane, 541 U.S. at 522-30: \n(1) identify the scope of the constitutional right Congress \nsought to enforce when enacting Title II; (2) determine whether \nCongress identified a history and pattern of  unconstitutional \ndisability discrimination; and (3) determine whether the \nremedies created by Title II are congruent and proportional to \nthe constitutional violation.  See also Bd. of Trustees of Univ. \nof Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365-74 (2001).  With these \nstandards in mind, the Court now turns to Plaintiff’s \nallegations under the Title II claim in count one of the amended \ncomplaint against the Sheriff.   \n    2. Application of the Boerne Test \n    The Sheriff argues that count one must be dismissed \nbecause Plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead an actual \nFourteenth Amendment violation.  (Sheriff’s Mem. at 4-8.)  \nMoreover, the Sheriff argues that under the Boerne test, Title \nII does not validly abrogate her Eleventh Amendment sovereign \n22 \n \n\nimmunity because the accommodations provided for in Title II \nextend beyond Congress’s prophylactic power in Section 5 of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  (Sheriff’s Mem. at 4-6.)  As support for \nher argument, the Sheriff relies heavily on this Court’s holding \nin Chase v. Baskerville, 508 F. Supp. 2d 492, 499 (E.D. Va. \n2007), and the general proposition that a prisoner’s Fourteenth \nAmendment claims must be “analyzed in light of the special \nscrutiny and management concerns in the prison system.” \n(Sheriff’s Mem. at 5-8 (citing Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d \n648, 655 (4th Cir. 2001).)  But the facts of this case, as \nalleged in the amended complaint and when taken as true for \npurposes of this motion, require a different result for the \nfollowing reasons.5 \n    In Chase, this Court held that “in the context of \nstate prisons, Title II validly abrogates state sovereign \nimmunity and ‘creates a private cause of action for damages \n                                                           \n5 Unlike the district court that ultimately decided Morrison on \nsummary judgment, this matter is now before the Court on a \nmotion to dismiss, where the allegations in the amended \ncomplaint are taken as true, and the Court cannot resolve \nfactual disputes of the validity of defenses or other \njustifications.  At this early stage, and without any evidence \nin the record, it would be premature for the Court to address \nwhether the Sheriff had a rational basis for her actions.  See \nButler v. United States, 702 F.3d 749, 752 (4th Cir. 2012) \n(“[I]mportantly, [a Rule 12(b)(6) motion] does not resolve \ncontests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the \napplicability of defenses.”) (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Instead, this Court assumes the allegations in \nthe Complaint are true for purposes of this motion, and \nconstrues them in a light most favorable to Plaintiff.  \n23 \n \n\nagainst the States’ only ‘for conduct that actually violates the \nFourteenth Amendment.’”  508 F. Supp. 2d at 506 (emphasis in \noriginal).  The deaf pro se prisoner in Chase claimed “that the \nfailure to provide him with an interpreter to assist him in his \nschool work [and to allow him to access the prison’s educational \nprograms] violated his rights under . . . Title II of the \n[ADA].”  Id. at 497.  After applying the three-part test from \nBoerne, the Court concluded, under the facts of that case and in \nthe context of a state prison, that “Title II’s comprehensive \nremedial scheme” is incongruent and disproportionate “for those \nrights and the policy of judicial restraint in the prison \ncontext.”  Id. at 501-506.   \n    Put simply, in Chase, the district court was faced \nwith conduct that did not violate the prisoner’s constitutional \nrights, and the facts of that case are readily distinguishable \nfrom the allegations here regarding Plaintiff’s pretrial period \nof incarceration in a local jail.  Moreover, the Chase court was \nconcerned with much broader implications, including the \npossibility of setting a costly precedent where the requirements \nof Title II could be applied “to almost every interaction \nbetween inmates and prison officials[, which would impose \nsignificant] monetary liability upon the States for a host of \nactions in operating its prisons that are far removed from the . \n. . Due Process Clause . . . .”  Id. at 502.  Here, application \n24 \n \n\nof the Boerne test to Plaintiff’s allegations compels a much \nnarrower holding: Title II validly abrogates a local sheriff’s \nsovereign immunity in the pretrial, temporary detention setting \nof a local jail.  As in Chase, “the pivotal inquiry is the third \nstep of the City of Boerne test.”  Id. at 499. \n    a. Step One: The Constitutional Rights at Issue \n    In Constantine, the Fourth Circuit recognized that \n“Title II seeks to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nprohibition on irrational disability discrimination.”  411 F.3d \n474, 486 (4th Cir. 2005) (“Importantly, the Fourteenth Amendment \ndoes not forbid all discrimination based on disability . . . \n[and] States may make distinctions on the basis of disability so \nlong as ‘there is a rational relationship between the disparity \nof treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.’”) \n(quoting Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993)).  Indeed, \n“Title II seeks to curb arbitrary or irrational exclusion of \ndisabled inmates from the services, programs, or benefits \nprovided by the state and to prevent cruel and unusual \npunishment flowing from the denial of adequate facilities or \nservices to disabled inmates.”  Id. at 499-500 (citing Georgia, \n546 U.S. 151 (2006); Lane, 541 U.S. at 525 n.11; Miller v. King, \n384 F.3d 1248, 1272 (11th Cir. 2004), vacated and superseded by, \n449 F.3d 1149 (11th Cir. 2006)); see also Georgia, 546 U.S. at \n162-63 (Stevens, J., concurring) (recognizing the “constellation \n25 \n \n\nof rights applicable in the prison context” under Title II).  \nThus, like in Lane and Constantine, at issue here is the \nFourteenth Amendment’s prohibition on irrational disability \ndiscrimination.  \n    b. Step Two: History and/or Pattern of Conduct \n    Under the second step, the Court must “consider \nwhether Title II represents a legislative response to a pattern \nof unconstitutional disability discrimination in public \nservices, programs, or activities generally.”  Constantine, 411 \nF.3d at 487.  Lane conclusively established that Title II of the \nADA as a whole survives the historical inquiry under the second \nstep of the Boerne test.  See id. (“After Lane, it is settled \nthat Title II was enacted in response to a pattern of \nunconstitutional disability discrimination by States and \nnonstate government entities with respect to the provision of \npublic services.”); see also Chase, 508 F. Supp. 2d at 500 \n(citation omitted).  Thus, the second step is satisfied. \n    c. Step Three: Congruence and Proportionality \n    “The remaining question is whether the remedial \nmeasures contained in Title II represent a congruent and \nproportional response to this demonstrated history and pattern \nof unconstitutional disability discrimination.”  Constantine, \n411 F.3d at 487-88 (citing Lane, 541 U.S. at 530).  Following \nLane and Constantine, this Court must consider Title II’s \n26 \n \n\nremedial measures only as applied to the right to be free from \nirrational disability discrimination in pretrial detention \nfacilities like the jail.  Id.  There are two competing notions \nat play here.  On the one hand, Congress’s remedy “may not work \na substantive change in the governing law.”  Chase, 508 F. Supp. \n2d at 501 (quoting Lane, 541 U.S. at 250 (quoting Boerne, 521 \nU.S. at 519)).  Indeed, any remedy that “is so out of proportion \nto a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be \nunderstood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, \nunconstitutional behavior” does not fall within Congress’s \nenforcement power under Section 5.  Chase, 508 F. Supp. 2d at \n501 (quoting Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532).  On the other hand, \nhowever, Congress is given “wide latitude,” and the remedy need \nnot be a “perfect fit for the pattern of discrimination” at \nissue, so long as it falls “within the sweep of Congress’ \nenforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct \nwhich is not itself unconstitutional.”  Constantine, 411 F.3d at \n490 (quoting Boerne, 521 U.S. at 518).   \n    Plaintiff alleges that he is a qualified individual \nwith a disability and Defendants are public entities as defined \nunder Title II.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 96-107 (citing 42 U.S.C. § \n12131).)  Specifically, Plaintiff claims that with “the \nprovision of auxiliary aids and services, [he] meets the \nessential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services \n27 \n \n\nor the participation in programs or activities provided by” the \njail through Defendants.  (Id.)  Under Title II, Congress \nauthorized the Attorney General to promulgate regulations that \nimplement these provisions.  42 U.S.C. § 12134.  Notably, \n“qualified inmates or detainees with disabilities shall not . . \n. be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits \nof, the services, programs or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subjected to discrimination by any public entity.”  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.152(b)(1).  Under the regulations implementing Title II, \njails are thus required to “furnish appropriate auxiliary aids \nand services where necessary to afford individuals with \ndisabilities . . . an equal opportunity to participate in, and \nenjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity of [the \njail].”  28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(1); see also 28 C.F.R. § \n35.104(1) (“Auxiliary aids and services includes Qualified \ninterpreters on-site or through video remote interpreting (VRI) \nservices . . . video-based telecommunications products and \nsystems, including text telephones (TTYs), videophones . . . or \nequally effective telecommunications devices . . . or other \neffective methods of making aurally delivered information \navailable to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.”).  \nThe question before the Court is whether this “remedial scheme \nis an appropriately calibrated enforcement mechanism for those \nrights” in the context of local jails.  Chase, 508 F. Supp. 2d \n28 \n \n\nat 501.  For the reasons discussed below, Title II’s remedies \nare a congruent and proportional response to the pattern of \ndisability discrimination as applied to local jails.  See \nConstantine, 411 F.3d at 487-88 (citing Lane, 541 U.S. at 530).   \n    i. Application and Distinction from Chase \n    Unlike the pro se plaintiff in Chase, a convicted and \nsentenced Virginia state prisoner who sought an interpreter only \nto access educational services in the state penitentiary, the \nconstitutional dimension of the temporary-detainee Plaintiff’s \nallegations here are congruent and proportional to the remedial \nscheme of Title II.  Plaintiff’s factual allegations implicate \nimportant rights under the Fourteenth Amendment in at least \nthree ways, and the remedial scheme under Title II is \nproportional to vindicate those rights, thus compelling \nabrogation of the Sheriff’s sovereign immunity under Title II.     \n    First, inmates “possess[] a significant liberty \ninterest in avoiding the unwanted administration of \nantipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.”  Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221-\n22 (1990) (citations omitted).  Plaintiff claims that during the \nmedical evaluation shortly after arriving at the jail, he was \nhanded a consent form to sign for a medical procedure, which he \ncould not read or understand and therefore refused to sign.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 38.)  Subsequently, after asking in writing for an \n29 \n \n\ninterpreter, a jail employee held down Plaintiff’s “arm and \nforced a needle into it” without Plaintiff’s consent and without \nany knowledge regarding the procedure.  (Id. at ¶¶ 39-40.)  \nPlaintiff’s “skin had a negative reaction to the forcible \nmedical procedure that was conducted on his arm . . . [and he] \nunderwent an additional medical procedure,” again without the \nassistance of the interpreter and without knowing the purpose of \nthe procedure.  When taking these facts as true and construing \nthem in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, even though the \nexact nature of the forced intravenous procedure remains unknown \nat this early stage, Plaintiff’s allegations implicate his \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Harper, 494 U.S. \n221-26.   \n    Second, Plaintiff also alleges he appeared in front of \na judge via closed circuit television during the booking process \nbut could not understand or participate in the proceeding.  “The \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the \nConfrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as applied to the \nStates via the Fourteenth Amendment, both guarantee to a \ncriminal defendant . . . the ‘right to be present at all stages \nof the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of \nthe proceedings.”  Lane, 541 U.S. at 523 (quoting Faretta v. \nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 806, 819 n.15 (1975)).  The Tenth Circuit \naddressed this issue in Robertson v. Las Animas Cnty. Sheriff’s \n30 \n \n\nDep’t, 500 F.3d 1185 (10th Cir. 2007).  There, a deaf pretrial \ndetainee was escorted to a room in the jail “to observe and \nparticipate in his probable cause hearing by closed-circuit \ntelevision” when his attorney was present in the courtroom.  Id. \nat 1189.  The deaf pretrial detainee “did not know that he was \nattending his probable cause hearing, and he could not hear what \nthe judge and his attorney were saying.  He told the detention \nofficer that he could not hear what was going on, but she did \nnothing about it.”  Id.  The Tenth Circuit held that because the \ndeaf detainee was eligible to participate in the hearing, Title \nII applied, and he was denied the ability to participate in the \nhearing to the same extent as non-disabled individuals in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Plaintiff alleges similar \nfactual circumstances here. \n    During the booking process, jail personnel placed \nPlaintiff “in front of a web camera, a microphone, and a \ncomputer monitor that appeared to show a judge on the screen.”  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 28.)  Plaintiff saw that the judge appeared to be \nspeaking, but naturally could not hear, understand, or \nparticipate in the proceeding.  (Id.)  Moreover, when Plaintiff \n“attempted to signal that he was deaf . . . officers in the room \n. . . directed him to stay still . . . [and Plaintiff] does not \nknow what occurred during that interaction with the judge.”  \n(Id.)  These allegations constitute more flagrant violations \n31 \n \n\nthan those in Robertson.  Not only did Plaintiff not understand \nthe judicial proceeding, but jail personnel actively prevented \nhis attempted participation, thus frustrating his right to be \npresent at all stages of his trial.  Lane, 541 U.S. at 523.  \nAccordingly, at this stage, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges facts \nthat constitute an actual Fourteenth Amendment violation in this \nregard as well. \n    Third, Plaintiff alleges his access to counsel was \nrestricted in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as applicable to \nthe States under the Fourteenth Amendment.  “The Sixth Amendment \nright to counsel would be implicated if plaintiff was not \nallowed to talk to his lawyer for the entire four-day period.”  \nTucker v. Randall, 948 F.2d 388, 390-91 (7th Cir. 1991) \n(citations omitted).  Here, in sum, Plaintiff alleges that \nbecause he uses ASL to communicate, he was unable to use the \ntelephone for the duration of his six-week period of \nincarceration.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 49-69.)  To be clear, the jail \ndoes offer TTY services, and on at least one occasion, jail \npersonnel seemed amenable to assist Plaintiff in making a \ntelephone call to a friend.  But TTY services were useless for \nPlaintiff, who does not effectively read or write in English.  \nAnd ultimately, he was unable to initiate communication with his \ncourt-appointed attorney via telephone, and instead, “could \naccess his attorney only when the attorney came to the [jail] of \n32 \n \n\nhis own accord.”  (Id. at ¶ 67.)  The factual allegations \nsupport a claim that Plaintiff was prevented from seeking and \nreceiving the assistance of counsel throughout his six-week \nperiod of detention in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to \ncounsel.  See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 419 (1974) \n(“This means that inmates must have a reasonable opportunity to \nseek and receive the assistance of attorneys.”), overruled in \npart on other grounds by, Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 \n(1989).6 \n    The allegations at issue here also stand in stark \ncontrast to the allegations and context of Chase.  The Court in \nChase concluded that “Title II imposes an affirmative \naccommodation obligation in the administration of state prisons \nthat far exceeds what” is required by the Eighth Amendment, Due \nProcess Clause, and Equal Protection Clause.  508 F. Supp. 2d at \n501-505.  Stated differently, the Court determined that in the \nprison context, Title II was not tailored to remedy likely \nconstitutional violations.  Id. at 505-506.  The Court found \nthat to hold otherwise would open Virginia to potential \nliability under Title II in most aspects of prison operation, \n                                                           \n6 The Court need not address all of Plaintiff’s allegations, \nincluding his alleged deprivation of medical care and access to \nmeals, recreational, and educational programming, having found \nthe above-mentioned allegations implicated his rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment, and that ultimately, count one will \nsurvive against the Sheriff.   \n33 \n \n\nincluding educational, rehabilitative, and vocational \nprogramming, “pervasive part[s] of prison life” that are offered \nfree and apart from any constitutional obligation.  Id. at 505 \n(“Thus, where the States had no constitutional obligation to \noffer such programs, Title II potentially imposes liability on \nthe States unless they adequately justify the lack of an \ninterpreter or some other device to assist an inmate in enjoying \nthe full benefits of the program.”).   \n    But here, the allegations at issue implicate \nPlaintiff’s constitutional rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  The legislative history of the ADA indicates \ncongressional intent to specifically remedy the disparate \ntreatment of inmates in local jails through enactment of Title \nII of the ADA.  See id. at 161-62 (citing 2 House Committee on \nEducation and Labor, Legislative History of Public Law 101-336: \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 1331 \n(Comm. Print 1990) (stating that persons with hearing \nimpairments “have been arrested and held in jail over night \nwithout even knowing their rights nor what they are being held \nfor”)).  That is exactly the factual allegation here.  Moreover, \nthe Supreme Court has suggested in dicta that Title II’s \nremedial scheme was not limited to remedy only violations of the \nEighth Amendment as applicable to the states through the \nFourteenth Amendment.  See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 161 (Stevens, \n34 \n \n\nJ., concurring).  Thus, public entities do have a statutory \nobligation under Title II to accommodate access to the most \nbasic jail services for deaf pretrial detainees, including, as \nrelevant here, access to medical procedure information and \naccess to the courts or counsel, as guaranteed under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  See, e.g., Georgia, 546 U.S. at 158.  The \nprovisions of Title II and the implementing regulations target \nprecisely the sort of discrimination that Congress sought to \naddress.   \n    The Chase court also recognized that this obligation \nunder Title II is limited by the “reasonable modification” \nprinciple, which requires public entities “only to make \nreasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the \nnature of the service or activity of the public entity or impose \nan undue burden.”  Chase, 508 F. Supp. 2d at 506 (citing Bircoll \nv. Miami-Dade Cnty., 480 F.3d 1072, 1082-83 (11th Cir. 2007) \n(citing Lane, 541 U.S. at 531-32)).  But the district court in \nChase did not acknowledge the full breadth of the limitations \nunder the regulations, and thus ultimately concluded that Title \nII’s remedies were too far reaching.  Title II “does not require \na public entity to permit an individual to participate in or \nbenefit from the services, programs, or activities of that \npublic entity when that individual poses a direct threat to the \nhealth or safety of others.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.139.  And public \n35 \n \n\nentities are only required to provide necessary accommodations, \nthose “that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the \nservice provided . . . [or] impose an undue financial or \nadministrative burden.”  Lane, 541 U.S. at 532; see also 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.164.  At this stage, the Court need not speculate as \nto the appropriate limitation of services and accommodations in \nthe pre-trial detention context of a local county jail.  \nHowever, here, as pled in the amended complaint, no \naccommodation was provided that would have allowed Plaintiff to \naccess services in the jail in the same manner as non-disabled \ninmates.  With these limits included in Title II’s statutory \nscheme, Title II’s prophylactic and remedial scheme is congruent \nand proportional to the pattern of disability discrimination.  \nSee Georgia, 546 U.S. at 162 (Stevens, J., concurring); see also \nConstantine, 411 F.3d at 490.  \n    Lastly, there is an important distinction between \ntemporary pretrial detention in a local jail and incarceration \nin a state prison after conviction.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 411 \nU.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979) (“Due Process requires that a pretrial \ndetainee not be punished.  A sentenced inmate, on the other \nhand, may be punished, although that punishment may not be \n‘cruel and unusual’ under the Eighth Amendment.”) (citing \nIngraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 671-72 n.40 (1977)).  This \nfactual difference distinguishes this case from Chase, where the \n36 \n \n\nCourt was concerned only with the context of state \npenitentiaries operated by the VDOC and not local correctional \nfacilities like the jail that are solely operated by the \nSheriff.  Chase, 508 F. Supp. 2d at 506.  As such, Plaintiff was \nnot required to endure “routine discomfort [as] part of the \npenalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against \nsociety.”  Id. at 502-503 (quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. \n1, 9 (1992)); see also Slade v. Hampton Roads Reg’l Jail, 407 \nF.3d 243, 250 (4th Cir. 2005) (“The Government concededly may \ndetain a criminal defendant to ensure his presence at trial and \nmay subject him to the restrictions and conditions of the \ndetention facility, so long as those conditions and restrictions \ndo not amount to punishment . . . .”) (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, \n441 U.S. 520, 536-37 (1979)).  Thus, this holding does not alter \nthe Court’s holding in Chase, nor is it inconsistent, due to \nthis important factual distinction. \n    In short, Plaintiff’s allegations, if true, \ndemonstrate that Defendants wholly failed to accommodate \nPlaintiff’s disability as required by Title II and the \nassociated regulations, and consequently, Plaintiff was \ncompletely unable to communicate with jail personnel regarding \nmedical procedures, unable to access the courts and participate \nin the initial judicial proceeding conducted via closed circuit \ntelevision, and denied the right to counsel for approximately \n37 \n \n\nsix weeks.  Based on Plaintiff’s allegations, at the motion to \ndismiss stage, it cannot be said that Title II “is so out of \nproportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it \ncannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, \nunconstitutional behavior” and does not fall within Congress’s \nenforcement power under Section 5.  Chase, 508 F. Supp. 2d at \n501 (quoting Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532).  Instead, under the “wide \nlatitude” given to Congress, while not a “perfect fit for the \npattern of discrimination” at issue, within the context of a \nlocal jail, Title II falls “within the sweep of Congress’ \nenforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct \nwhich is not itself unconstitutional.”  Constantine, 411 F.3d at \n490 (quoting Boerne, 521 U.S. at 518).  Accordingly, at this \nstage, the Eleventh Amendment poses no bar to Plaintiff’s Title \nII claim in count one against the Sheriff.  Lane, 541 U.S. at \n517; Constantine, 411 F.3d at 490.  Thus, the Court will deny \nthe Sheriff’s motion to dismiss count one. \nIV.

Abreham  Zemedagegehu  (“Plaintiff”  or  “Mr.  Zemedagegehu”),  an  individual  who \nis  deaf,  brings  this  case  against  the  Defendants  for  failing  to  provide  him  with  qualified \nAmerican  Sign  Language  (“ASL”)  interpreter  services  and  other  auxiliary  aids  or  services \nnecessary  to  ensure  effective  communication  during  his  nearly  six-week-long  detention  at  the \nArlington  County  Detention  Facility.  This  failure,  and  the  resulting consequences,  violated  Title \nII  of the Americans  with  Disabilities Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§  12131-12165  (“Title  II”),  and  Section \n504  of the  Rehabilitation Act  of  1973,  29  U.S.C.  §  794  (“Section  504”).  Mr.  Zemedagegehu \nseeks  declaratory  relief,  compensatory  damages,  and  attorneys’  fees  and  costs. \nJURISDICTION AND  VENUE \n2.  This  Court  has  subject  matter jurisdiction  over  this  action  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1331. \n3.  Venue  is  proper  in  this judicial  district  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391  because  a \nsubstantial  part  of the  acts  or  omissions  giving  rise  to  this  action  occurred  in Arlington,  Virginia. \nTHE  PARTIES \n4,  Plaintiff Abreham  Zemedagegehu  resides  in  Washington,  D.C.  and  does  not  have \na  permanent  residential  address  at  this  time.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  is  deaf and  communicates \nprimarily  in ASL. \n5.  Defendant Arlington  County  Board  (the  “County  Board”)  is  the  governing  body \nfor Arlington  County.  The  County  Board  allocates  funds  for  and  engages  in  oversight  over \nDefendant Arlington  County  Sheriff’s  Office.  The  County  Board  is  a  public  entity  subject  to  Title \nIl.  The  County  Board  distributes  federal  financial  assistance,  including  federal  prisoner \nreimbursements,  and  is  subject  to  Section  504.\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  3  of  19  PagelD#  3 \n6.  Defendant Arlington  County  Sheriff’s  Office  (the  “Sheriff’s  Office”)  manages  the \nArlington  County  Detention  Facility  (the  “Detention  Facility”).  The  Sheriff’s  Office  is  a  public \nentity  subject to Title  II.  The  Sheriff’s  Office  is  a  recipient  of federal  financial assistance, \nincluding  federal  prisoner expense  reimbursements,  and  is  subject  to  Section 504. \n7.  Defendant  Detention  Facility  is  the jail  for Arlington  County. The  Detention \nFacility  is  a  public entity  subject  to Title  II.  The  Detention  Facility  is  a  recipient of federal \nfinancial  assistance,  including federal  prisoner  expense  reimbursements,  and  is  subject  to  Section \n504. \nFACTUALALLEGATIONS \nBackground \n8.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  born  and  raised  in  Ethiopia.  He  immigrated  to  the  United \nStates  in  2001,  and  became  a  United  States  citizen  in  2008. \n9.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  is  deaf and  has  limited  English  proficiency. \n10.  Asachild,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  first  learned Amharic,  the  language  of Ethiopia. \nLater  in  his  childhood,  he  learned  Ethiopian  Sign  Language,  the  language  of the  deaf community \nin  Ethiopia. \n11.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  began  learning ASL after  immigrating  to  the  United  States  in \n2001.  He  considers  himself fluent  in ASL. ASL is  a  complete,  complex  language  that  employs \nSigns  made  with  the  hands  and  other  movements,  including  facial  expressions  and  postures  of the \nbody.  It  is  a  language  distinct  from  English  — it  is  not  simply  English  in  hand  signals  —  and  has  its \nown  vocabulary  and  rules  for  grammar  and  discourse  structure. \n12.  _ English  is  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  fourth  language.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  learned  the \nlittle  English  he  knows by  taking courses  through  the  English  Language  Institute  at  Gallaudet\n  \nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  4  of  19  PagelD#  4 \nUniversity.  He  struggles  to  write  and  understand  even basic English  sentences.  He  has  no \nfunctional  ability  to  speak English  or  to  read  lips. \n13.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  employment  history  is  limited  to  manual  labor jobs  that  did \nnot require proficiency  in  spoken  or  written  English.  For example,  he  worked  loading and \nunloading trucks  at Federal  Express. \n14.  —_ In  2010,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  left  his job  with  Federal  Express  due  to  a  lower back \ninjury  that  had  occurred  in  2008.  This  injury  requires  him  to  wear  a  back brace  and  take daily \nmedication. \nPlaintiff's Arrest \n15.  On  the  evening of February  2,  2014,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  went  to  Ronald  Reagan \nWashington  National Airport  (“National Airport”)  to  find  a warm  place  to  sleep. \n16.  Shortly  after entering  National Airport,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  arrested by \nofficers  of the  Metropolitan  Washington Airports Authority. \n17.  Using gestures  and  in  writing,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  informed  the  officers  that  he  is \ndeaf and  did  not  understand  them.  He  also  requested  an ASL interpreter  in  writing.  The  officers \ndenied  his  request.  Instead,  the  officers  attempted  to  communicate  with  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  by \nwriting  information  on  a  notepad. \n18.  Because  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  cannot  read  written  English  well,  he  did  not  know \nwhy  he  had been  arrested. \n19.  | Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  in  the  custody  of the  Metropolitan  Washington Airports \nAuthority  for only  a  short period  of time  before being transported  to  the  Detention  Facility, \nwhich  is  located  in Arlington  County,  Virginia,  close  to  National Airport.\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  5  of  19  PagelD#  5 \n20.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  detained  at  the  Detention  Facility  for  nearly  six  weeks. \nDuring  this  time,  despite  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  repeated  requests,  Defendants  refused  to  provide \nany  effective  means for  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  to  communicate. As  a  result,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did \nnot  understand why  he  had  been  arrested,  could  not  communicate  his  needs  or  understand  what \nwas  being said  during booking  or his  medical  evaluations,  and  could  not  inform  the  Detention \nCenter  of his  medical  needs  and  dietary  restrictions.  Because  he  could  not  understand  the \nannouncements  and  other  communications  made  orally  at  the  Detention  Center,  Mr. \nZemedagegehu missed  out  on  meals,  recreation  times,  rehabilitative  services,  and  other  events  at \nthe  Detention  Facility.  He  also  was  unable  to  place  telephone  calls while  at  the  Detention  Center. \n21.  On  many  occasions  when  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  requested  interpreter services  either \nin writing or using gestures,  he  believes  he was  informed  that  interpreters  were  prohibited  at  the \nDetention  Facility. \nBooking Process \n22.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  arrived  at  the  Detention  Facility  during the  early  hours  of \nFebruary 3,  2014.  Officers who  worked  for  Defendants  attempted  to  communicate  with  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  by  speaking.  However,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  unable  to  understand  what  the \nofficers were  saying. \n23.  During this process,  both  in  writing  and  using  gestures,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu \nrequested  an ASL interpreter.  Defendants  refused  to  provide  one. \n24.  Because  Defendants  did  not provide  an  interpreter,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  not \nknow why  he  had  been  arrested  or what  to  expect while  he  was  detained. \n25.  During  the booking process,  the  officers  placed  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  in  front  of a \nweb  camera,  a  microphone,  and  a  computer monitor that  appeared  to  show  a judge  on  the  screen. \nThe judge  on  the  monitor  appeared  to  be  speaking  to  Mr.  Zemedagegehu,  but  he  could  not \n5\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  6  of  19  PagelD#  6 \nunderstand  what the judge was  saying.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  attempted  to  signal  that  he  was  deaf, \nbut  officers  in  the  room  with  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  directed  him  to  stay  still.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu \ndoes  not know what  occurred  during that  interaction with  the judge. \n26.  At  one  point,  one  of Defendants’  officers  handed  Mr.  Zemedagegehu a  piece  of \npaper  that was  filled with writing.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  not  understand what  it  said  and \nrequested  an ASL interpreter by  writing on  the  paper. After  requesting  an  interpreter,  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  observed  an  officer placing a  phone  call.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  phone \ncall  relayed  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  request for  an  interpreter  to  another prison  officer. \n27,  When  the  phone  call  concluded,  the  officer denied  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s \ninterpreter request. \n28.  Without  an  interpreter,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  not  understand  what was  taking \nplace  during the  booking process. Thus,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  could  not  understand  any  of the \nDetention  Facility’s  rules  or procedures  that might  have  been explained  to  him.  Similarly,  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  was  unable  to  advise  the  Detention  Facility  personnel  of critical  information \nconcerning himself,  such  as  his  dietary  restrictions  and  medical  needs. \n29.  On  February  4,  2014,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  arraigned.  The Arlington  General \nDistrict  Court provided  an  interpreter for his  arraignment. \n30.  Not until  his  arraignment,  more  than  24  hours  after  his  arrest,  did  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  first learn  that  he  had  been  arrested  and  incarcerated for  allegedly  stealing an \niPad. \nMedical Evaluations \n31.  After booking,  but before  his  arraignment,  Defendants’  employees  sent  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  for  a  medical  evaluation.\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  7  of  19  PagelD#  7 \n32.  The  employee  conducting the  evaluation  attempted  to  communicate  with  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  in  writing,  but  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  not  understand  what was  written.  He \ninformed  the  evaluator  that  he  did  not  understand  and  requested  in  writing  an ASL interpreter. \nThe  evaluator refused  to  provide  one. \n33.  Without  an  interpreter,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  unable  to  explain  to  the  employee \nthat  he  had  back  problems  and  required a  prescription.  Consequently,  throughout  his  entire  six \nweek  incarceration  at  the  Detention  Facility,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  not  receive  the  medicine  he \nrequires  to  alleviate  his back  pain. \n34.  The  evaluator handed  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  what  is  now  believed  to be  a  consent \nform  to  sign  for  a  medical  procedure.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  could  not  read  the  form.  He  refused  to \nsign  it and  asked  in writing for an  interpreter. \n35.  The  evaluator  summoned  a  second  employee  into  the  room.  Mr. Zemedagegehu \nasked,  in  writing,  for  the  second  employee  to  provide  an  interpreter. \n36.  Instead  of providing an  interpreter,  the  second employee  held  down  Mr. \nZemedagegehu’s  arm  and  forced  a  needle  into  it. At  the  time,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  confused \nas  to  what  they  were  doing  to  his  arm. \n37.  After  the medical  evaluation,  an  officer put  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  into  a jail  cell  by \nhimself.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  know why  he  was  being placed  in  isolation. \n38.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was scared  and  confused  during  this  time. \n39.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  repeatedly banged  on  the  door  and gestured  at  the  cameras  to \nget  an  officer’s  attention  to  obtain  an  interpreter.  He wanted  the  Detention  Facility  officers  to \nexplain  to  him what was  happening:  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  still  did  not  know why  he  had been\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  8  of  19  PagelD#  8 \narrested,  why  he  was  incarcerated,  when  he  might be  released,  what  had just  been  done  to  his \narm,  when  he might be  fed,  or  any  other vital  information. \n40.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  skin  had  a  negative  reaction  to  the  forcible  medical \nprocedure  that was  conducted  on  his  arm.  Following  this  reaction,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  underwent \nan  additional  medical  procedure.  Once  again,  Defendants  refused  to  provide  an  interpreter  to \nexplain  this  medical  procedure.  Because  of the  lack  of communication,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did \nnot know what was  happening to  him  or why.  He  remained  in  isolation  for  several  days. \nDietary Needs \n41.  At  some  point  during  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  isolation,  one  of Defendants’  officers \nslid  a  tray  of food  into  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  cell.  The  food  tray  contained  pork.  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  does  not  eat  pork for  religious  reasons. \n42.  Because  Defendants  refused  to  provide  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  with  an  interpreter,  he \nwas  unable  to  inform  Defendants  of his  dietary  restrictions. \n43.  Asa  result of the  loneliness  and  frustration  of being  unable  to  effectively \ncommunicate  with  anyone,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  protested  by  refusing  to  eat for an  extended \nperiod  of time. \nTelephone Access \n44.  After  his  arraignment,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  attempted  to  communicate  to \nDefendants’ officers  that  he  needed  to  place  a telephone  call.  In  response,  Defendants’  officers \ngestured  to  a  traditional  telephone.  Defendants’ officers  appeared  to  suggest to  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  to  use  the  traditional  telephone  on  multiple  occasions  when  he  requested  to  make \na phone  call. \n45.  Because  he  is  deaf,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  cannot place a call  using a  traditional \ntelephone.  Instead,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  places  calls  through  a  videophone. \n8\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  9  of  19  PagelD#  9 \n46.  Avideophone  is  a  device  with  a camera  and  a video  monitor that  allows both \nparties  to  see  each  other  simultaneously,  similar  to  Skype  and  FaceTime.  Videophones  allow  deaf \nindividuals  to  communicate  with  one  another directly  in ASL without  having  to  communicate \nthrough written  English. Any  computer  or smartphone  with  a  camera  and  appropriate  software \ncan be  used  to  place  a videophone  call. \n47.  Although  Defendants  state  that  the  Detention  Facility  is  “[o]ne  of the  most \ntechnically  advanced  ‘Direct  Supervision’ jails  in  the  country,” upon  information  and  belief,  it \ndoes  not have  a  videophone  or any  device  equipped  with videophone  software. \n48.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  repeatedly pleaded  with  Defendants’  officers  to  let  him  place \na  Call  to  his  public  defender.  Finally,  one  of Defendants’  officers  took  the  piece  of paper with  the \npublic  defender’s phone  number on  it  and  gestured  to  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  that  the  officer would \nplace  the  call  for him. \n49.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  waited  for  the  officer  to  return,  but the  officer  never  did. \n50.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  not find  out whether  the  officer  had  followed  through with \nplacing the  call  for  Mr.  Zemedagegehu,  or what  else  had  happened,  until  days  later,  when  a \npublic  defender appeared  at  the  Detention  Facility  to  see  Mr.  Zemedagegehu. \n51.  More  than one  week  after Mr.  Zemedagegehu began  asking to  make  a  phone  call, \nDefendants’  officers  provided  him  with  a teletypewriter (“TTY”). \n52.  ATTY is  an  electronic device  that  allows  typed  communication  to  be  sent  to \nanother TTY via  a  telephone  line.  Based  on  sixty-year-old  technology,  the  TTY  is  basically  a \ntelephone  equipped  with  a  keyboard  and  a  screen  capable  of displaying  a  single  line  of text, \ngiving it  less functionality  than  the  text-messaging function of a cellular phone.  For  two  parties \nto  have  a TTY conversation,  each party  must  have  a TTY.  Though  a TTY may be  a  helpful\n~  Case  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1.  Filed  01/15/15  Page  10  of  19  PagelD#  10 \ncommunication  tool,  it  ultimately  relies  on  the  user’s  ability  to  communicate  in  written  English \nand,  in  all  events,  is  a  much  more  time-intensive  communication  tool  than  a  telephone,  computer, \nor any  other modern  communication  device. ATTY conversation  does  not  enable  parties  to \ncommunicate  in ASL.  TTY has been  almost  entirely  supplanted  by  the videophone  and  most  deaf \nindividuals  no  longer  have  TTYs. They  communicate by videophone  or by  using  any  number  of \ncomputer programs  that  provide  for  more  efficient video-  and  text-based  communication,  such  as \nFaceTime,  email,  and  instant  messaging programs. \n23.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  cannot  communicate  effectively  using  a TTY because  a TTY \nrequires proficiency  in  English.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  cannot  read  or write  English  well  enough  to \ncarry  on  a  conversation  using written  English.  He  can  communicate  effectively  using a \nvideophone  because  a  videophone  allows  him  to  communicate  in ASL. \n24.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  attempted  to  use  the TTY provided  to  call  a  friend,  who  is \nalso  deaf.  Like  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  and  most  other  deaf individuals,  she  uses  a  videophone  in \nplace  of a  standard  telephone. Also  like  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  and  most other  deaf individuals,  she \ndoes not own  a TTY;  she  owns only  a videophone. ATTY cannot  connect  directly  to  a \nvideophone. \n55.  Consequently,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  attempted  to  but  could  not place  a  telephone \ncall  to  his  friend  or  anyone  else,  including his  attorney. \n56.  | Upon  information  and  belief,  inmates  at  the  Detention  Center who  can  hear  have \naccess  to  a telephone  to  place  outgoing calls. \n57.  Instead  of Mr.  Zemedagegehu  placing the  call  to  his  friend,  one  of Defendants’ \nofficers  placed  the  call  for  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  through  a standard  telephone.  Because  the  officer \nwas  calling a  deaf individual,  the  officer’s  call  connected  automatically  to  a  videophone  relay \n10\n|  Case  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  11  of  19  PagelD#  11 \nservice  operator,  who  used  a videophone  to  attempt  to  contact  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  friend  and \nrelay  the  guards  communication  in ASL to  the  friend.  Because  the  friend  did  not  answer  and  due \nto  the  communication  limitations  between  the  officer  and  Mr.  Zemedagegehu,  the  officer \napparently  left  a message  for  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  friend  to  come  to  the  Detention  Facility.  The \nmessage  the  friend  received  was  in  the  format  of a  video  message  of the  relay  service  operator \nusing ASL to  translate  the  officer’s  message.  The  video  relay  service  can  translate  spoken \nEnglish  to ASL, but such  relay  service  cannot  receive TTY calls  and  translate  those  into ASL. \nMr.  Zemedagegehu  could  not  use  the  relay  service  himself because  he  would  have  had  to  use  the \nstandard  telephone. \n58.  Because  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  could  not communicate  with  his  friend  via  telephone, \nhis  friend  had  to  come  to  the  Detention  Facility  to  communicate  with  Mr.  Zemedagegehu. \n39.  The  Defendants  never provided  a  different  device  other  than  a  TTY for  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  to  make  a  telephone  call.  Because  of the  lack of a videophone,  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  was unable  to  place  telephone  calls  for  the  entire  time  he  was  detained. \nMeal and Recreation  Times \n60.  The  Defendants’  failure  to  provide  auxiliary  aids  and  services  to  ensure  effective \ncommunication  caused  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  to  miss  meals  and  recreation  times. \n61.  | Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants’ personnel  signaled  the  beginning of \nmeal  and  recreation  times by  using  an  auditory  alert.  When  inmates  heard  the  alert,  they  could \npress  a  button  that would  open  their  cell  doors.  With  the  cell  doors  open,  inmates  could  leave \ntheir cells  and  proceed  to  the  cafeteria  or  recreation  yard. \n62.  Because  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  is  deaf,  he  could  not  hear  the  auditory  alerts. \n63.  After  Detention  Facility  personnel  moved  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  out  of isolation  to \nthe  floor  with  the  general  population,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  placed  in a  cell  by  himself.  Mr. \n11\n|  Case  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  12  of  19  PagelD#  12 \nZemedagegehu would  know  that he could  leave  his  cell  only  if he  was  looking outside  his  cell  at \nthe  time  the  alert sounded.  He  would  observe  other  inmates  open  their cell  doors.  Initially,  Mr. \nZemedagegehu  did  not  understand  that  he  had  to  press  a button  inside  the  cell  for  his  door to \nopen  and  so  when  he  attempted  to  open  the  door,  it  would  not open.  Only  after being placed  in  a \ncell  with  another  inmate  the  next day,  did  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  learn  that he  had  to  press  a button \nfor  the  door  to  open. \n64.  On multiple  occasions,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  not  looking outside  his  cell  at  the \ntime  the  alert  sounded,  often because  he was  sleeping.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  would  awaken  to  see \nthat  other inmates were  outside  of their cells. At  that  time,  he  would  press  the  button  to  open  his \ncell  door,  but  the  door would  not  open.  He  would  attempt  to  signal  to  Defendants’  officers  to \nhave  them  open  his cell  door,  but  they  would  not  respond,  causing  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  to  miss \nmeals  approximately  two  to  three  times per week  and  recreation  times  approximately  once  per \nweek  due  to  the  lack  of auxiliary  aids  or  services,  such  as  visual  alerts. \nRehabilitative Programming and Other Services \n65.  Defendants  deprived  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  of access  to  rehabilitative  programming \nand  other  services  due  to  the  lack  of an ASL interpreter  and  other  auxiliary  aids  and  services. \n66.  Defendants’ failure  to  provide  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  with  an ASL interpreter  or \nother  auxiliary  aids  and  services  resulted  in  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  being  unable  to  understand  what \ninformation,  if any,  Defendants  might  have  provided  about  rehabilitative  programming  or other \nservices  during booking  or throughout  the  nearly  six  weeks  he  spent  at  the  Detention  Facility,  As \na  result,  he  was  unaware  of these  programs  or  services  while  at  the  Detention  Facility  and \ntherefore  could  not  take  advantage  of them. \n67.  If Defendants  had  provided  an ASL interpreter  and  other  auxiliary  aids  and \nservices,  such  as  visual  alerts  and  notifications,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  could  have  learned  of and \n12\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  13  of  19  PagelD#  13 \nwould  have  participated  in  the  various  rehabilitative  programming and  other services  offered  by \nthe  Defendants  at the  Detention  Facility. \n68.  Even  in cases  when  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  did  learn  of available  services  from  other \ninmates,  he  was unable  to  participate  in  or benefit  from  the  services  because  Defendants  failed  to \nprovide  auxiliary  aids  and  services  necessary  for  him  to  have  access  to  the  services. \n69.  For example,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  believed  that  he  could  visit  the  Detention \nCenter’s  library by putting his  name  on a certain  list.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  wrote  his  name  on  what \nhe  believed  to  be  the  library  list.  Defendant’s,  however,  never  allowed  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  to \naccess  the  library.  He  does  not  know  why.  It  is  possible  that  Defendants  called  his  name  to  visit \nthe  library,  but  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  could  not  hear  his  name  being called  and  therefore  was \nunable  to  respond. \n70.  Each  of the  many  times  that  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  requested  a  sign  language \ninterpreter either  in writing  or using gestures,  the  Defendants refused  to  provide  one. \n71.  By  the  time  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  was  released  from  Defendants’  custody,  he  had \nspent  six  weeks  in  near-isolation,  unable  to  effectively  communicate  with  anyone  at  the \nDetention  Center  but  the  sole  visitor  he  briefly  had. \n72.  Throughout  his  detention,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  suffered  anxiety,  stress,  loss  of \ndignity,  and  frustration  due  to  the  intense  isolation  and  repeated  instances of exclusion  from  or \nlimited  participation in Defendants’  programs,  services,  and  activities. \nCOUNTI  \n(Title  II  of the Americans  With  Disabilities Act) \n73.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  repeats  and  re-alleges  each  and  every  allegation  above  as  if \nfully  set  forth  herein. \n13\n|  Case  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  14  of  19  PagelD#  14 \n74,  On  July  12,  1990,  Congress  enacted  the Americans  with  Disabilities Act  (“¢ADA”) \n“to provide  a clear  and  comprehensive  national  mandate  for  the  elimination  of discrimination \nagainst  individuals with  disabilities.” 42  U.S.C.  §  12101(b)(1). \n73.  Title  Il  of the ADA states  that  “no  qualified  individual  with  a  disability  shall,  by \nreason  of such  disability,  be  excluded  from  participation  in  or be  denied  the  benefits  of the \nServices,  programs,  or  activities  of a  public entity,  or be  subjected  to  discrimination  by  any  such \nentity.” 42  U.S.C.  §  12132, \n76.  Title  Il of the ADA defines “qualified  individual  with  a  disability”  as  “an \nindividual  with  a  disability  who,  with  or without reasonable  modifications  to  rules,  policies,  or \npractices,  the  removal  of architectural,  communication,  or  transportation  barriers,  or  the \nprovision  of auxiliary  aids  and  services,  meets  the  essential  eligibility  requirements  for  the \nreceipt  of services  or  the  participation in  programs  or  activities  provided  by  a  public entity.”  42 \nU.S.C.  §  12131(2). \n77.  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  has a  disability because  he  is  substantially  limited  in  the \nmajor  life  activities  of hearing and  speaking.  He  also  meets  the  essential  eligibility  requirements \nfor the  receipt of services  or  the  participation  in  programs  or  activities  provided  by  a  public \nentity.  He  is  therefore  a  “qualified  individual  with  a  disability”  under Title  II  of the ADA. \n78.  The  County  Board  is  the  governing body  for Arlington  County;  as  such,  it  is  a \n“public  entity”  within  the  meaning of the ADA, 42  U.S.C.  §  12131(1)(B). \n79.  The  Sheriff’s  Office  is  a  department,  agency,  special  purpose  district,  or other \ninstrumentality  of Arlington  County;  as  such,  it  is  a  “public  entity”  within  the  meaning  of the \nADA,  42  U.S.C.  §  12131(1)(B). \n14\n|  Case  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  15  of  19  PagelD#  15 \n80.  The  Detention  Facility  is  a  department,  agency,  special  purpose  district,  or other \ninstrumentality  of Arlington  County;  as such,  it  is  a “public entity”  within  the  meaning of the \nADA,  42  U.S.C.  §  12131(1)(B). \n81.  Atall  times  relevant to  this  action,  the ADA was  in  full  force  and  effect  in  the \nUnited  States  and  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  had a  right  not  to  be  subjected  by  Defendants  to \ndiscrimination  on  the basis  of his  disability.  42  U.S.C.  §  12132. \n82.  Defendants  knowingly  failed  to  provide  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  with  an ASL \ninterpreter  and  other  necessary  auxiliary  aids  or services  resulting in  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  being: \na.  Unable  to  effectively  communicate  with  Defendants’  officers  and  other personnel \nduring the  booking process; \nb.  Unable  to  effectively  communicate with  Defendants’ personnel  performing \nmedical  functions; \nUnable  to  effectively  communicate  dietary  needs; \n \n9 Deprived  of access  to  telephone  calls; \n2\nDeprived  of access  to  meals  and  recreation  times;  and \n \ne\no Deprived  of knowledge  of and  access  to  rehabilitative  programming  and  other \nh\nservices. \n83.  These  failures violated  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  rights under Title  I  of the ADA. \n84.  Defendants  knew  of the  substantial  likelihood  of a  violation  of Mr. \nZemedagegehu’s  federally  protected  rights  and  failed  to  act  on  this  likelihood. \n85.  | Upon  information  and  belief,  the  failure  to  provide  effective  communication  to \ndeaf individuals,  such  as  Mr.  Zemedagegehu,  and  the  failure  to  provide  comparable  access  to \nservices,  programs,  and  activities  as provided  to  hearing individuals  are  policies,  regular \npractices,  or customs  of the  Defendants.  This  failure  is  ongoing and  continues  to  date. \n86.  As a  result  of Defendants’  violation  of the ADA,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  has  suffered \ndiscrimination,  exclusion  from  services,  benefits,  activities,  programs,  and  privileges,  loss  of \n15\n|  Case  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  16  of  19  PagelD#  16 \ndignity,  frustration,  humiliation,  emotional  pain  and  suffering,  anxiety,  trauma,  embarrassment, \nand  injury  to  his physical  and  mental  health. \nCOUNT II \n(Section  504  of The  Rehabilitation Act  of 1973) \n87.  Plaintiff repeats  and  re-alleges each  and  every  allegation  above  as  if fully  set forth \nherein. \n88.  Section 504  states  “No  otherwise  qualified  individual  with  a  disability  in  the \nUnited  States  .  .  .  shall,  solely  by  reason  of her or  his  disability,  be  excluded  from  the \nparticipation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or be  subjected  to  discrimination  under any  program  or \nactivity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance  ...  .” \n89.  Plaintiff is substantially  limited  in  the  major  life  activities  of hearing  and \nspeaking;  as  such,  he  is  an  individual  with  a  disability  under  29  U.S.C.  §  705(20)(B)  who  is \nqualified  under Section  504. \n90.  The  County  Board  is  a program  or activity  that  distributes  federal  financial \nassistance  within  the  meaning of 29  U.S.C.  §  794(b)(1),  because  it  distributes  money  to  the \nSheriff’s  Office  from  the  General  Fund.  Upon  information  and  belief,  this  money  includes \nfederal  prisoner expense  reimbursements. \n91.‘  The  Sheriff’s  Office  is  a  recipient  of federal  financial  assistance  within  the \nmeaning  of 29  U.S.C.  §  794(b)(1),  (4) because  it  receives  federal  financial  assistance,  including \nbut  not limited  to  federal  prisoner expense  reimbursements. \n92,  The  Detention  Facility  is  a  program  or  activity  receiving federal  financial \nassistance within  the  meaning of 29  U.S.C.  §  794(b)  because  it  receives  federal  financial \nassistance,  including  federal  prisoner  expense  reimbursements. \n16\nCase  1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN  Document  1  Filed  01/15/15  Page  17  of  19  PagelD#  17 \n93.  At  all  times  relevant  to  this  action,  Section  504 was  in  full  force  and  effect  in  the \nUnited  States  and  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  had  a  right  not  to  be  subjected  to  discrimination  on  the \nbasis  of his  disability by  Defendants. \n94.  Defendants  knowingly  failed  to  provide  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  with  an ASL \ninterpreter  and  other necessary  auxiliary  aids  or services  resulting in  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  being: \na.  Unable  to  effectively  communicate with  Defendants’ guards  and  other \npersonnel  during  the  booking process; \nb.  Unable  to  effectively  communicate  with  Defendants’ employees \nperforming medical  functions; \nUnable  to  effectively  communicate  dietary  needs; \n \nn Deprived  of access  to  telephone  calls; \no\nDeprived  of access  to  meals  and  recreation  times;  and \no\nm Deprived  of knowledge  of and  access  to  rehabilitative  programming  and \nother  services. \n95.  These  failures  violated  Mr.  Zemedagegehu’s  rights  under  Section  504. \n96.  Defendants  knew  of the  substantial  likelihood  of a  violation  of Mr. \nZemedagegehu’s  federally  protected  rights  and  failed  to  act  on  this  likelihood. \n97.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  failure  to  provide  effective  communication  to \ndeaf individuals,  such  as  Mr.  Zemedagegehu,  and  the  failure  to  provide  comparable  access  to \nServices,  programs,  and  activities  as  provided  to  hearing  individuals  are  policies,  regular \npractices,  or  customs  of the  Defendants.  This  failure  is  ongoing  and  continues  to  date. \n98.  Asa  result  of the  Defendants’  violation  of Section  504,  Mr.  Zemedagegehu  has \nsuffered  discrimination,  exclusion  from  services,  benefits,  activities,  programs,  and privileges, \nloss  of dignity,  frustration,  humiliation,  emotional  pain  and  suffering,  anxiety,  trauma, \nembarrassment,  and  injury  to  his  physical  and  mental  health. \nJURY  DEMAND \n99.

Arthur in her official capacity, the Virginia Department of \nCorrections (“VDOC”), Harold W. Clarke in his official capacity as VDOC’s Director, the \nVirginia Board of Corrections (the “Board”), and Carl R. Peed in his official capacity as the \nBoard’s Chairman (collectively, the “Defendants”) and states: \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Abreham Zemedagegehu (“Plaintiff” or “Mr. Zemedagegehu”), an individual who \nis deaf, brings this case against the Defendants for failing to provide American Sign Language \n(“ASL”) interpreter services and other auxiliary aids or services necessary to ensure effective \ncommunication during his nearly six-week-long detention at the Arlington County Detention \nFacility (the “Detention Facility”), intentional discrimination, and maintaining policies and \nprocedures that had a disparate impact on Mr. Zemedagegehu because of his disability. These \nactions and inactions, and the resulting consequences, violated Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165 (“Title II”), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”). Mr. Zemedagegehu seeks compensatory damages \nand attorneys’ fees and costs. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n3.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a \nsubstantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Arlington, Virginia. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 3 of 27 PageID# 68\nTHE PARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff Abreham Zemedagegehu resides in Washington, D.C. and does not have \na permanent residential address at this time. Mr. Zemedagegehu is deaf and communicates \nprimarily in ASL.  \n5.  Defendant Arlington County Sheriff Elizabeth F. Arthur, in her official capacity, \n(the “Sheriff”) manages and directs the Arlington County Sheriff’s Office and the Arlington \nCounty Detention Facility (the “Detention Facility”). The Sheriff is responsible for the day-to-\nday operations of the Sheriff’s Office and the Detention Facility. All personnel who work at the \nDetention Facility are employees of the Sheriff and/or the Sheriff’s Office. The Sheriff’s Office, \nwhich is managed and directed by the Sheriff, is a public entity subject to Title II. The Sheriff \nand her Office are recipients of federal financial assistance, including federal prisoner expense \nreimbursements, and are subject to Section 504. \n6.  Defendant Virginia Board of Corrections (the “Board”) is a nine-member, policy-\nmaking Board appointed by the Governor of Virginia and subject to confirmation by the Virginia \nGeneral Assembly. The Detention Facility, where Plaintiff was detained, is a correctional \ncomplex that must meet the minimum standards set by the Board. The Board is a public entity \nsubject to Title II, and, upon information and belief, is also a recipient of federal financial \nassistance, making it subject to Section 504. \n7.  Carl R. Peed is the Chairman of the Board. As head of the Board, Chairman Peed \nis responsible for setting the minimum standards for the Commonwealth’s jails, which include, \nbut are not limited to: (1) requiring that upon intake each inmate be provided with information on \nhow to obtain medical treatment and all other rules of conduct and policies and procedures \ngoverning inmate discipline; (2) requiring that upon intake all inmates receive a medical \nscreening to include obtaining any information on special dietary requirements, current \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 4 of 27 PageID# 69\nmedications, and other health conditions; (3) providing telephone access during booking and \ndetention, including for deaf and hard of hearing individuals; (4) ensuring each inmate is aware \nof all jail programs and is provided educational opportunities; (5) allowing for participation in \nreligious services or counseling; (7) maintaining a written statement of the jail’s policies and \nprocedures; and (8) providing access to a grievance procedure for all inmates. Chairman Peed is \nsued in his official capacity. \n8.  Defendant Virginia Department of Corrections (“VDOC”) is the Virginia state \nagency responsible for the supervision and custody of inmates and offenders and ensuring that \neach Virginia jail meets all minimum standards set by the Board. As a department of the \nCommonwealth, VDOC is a public entity subject to Title II, and is also a recipient of federal \nfinancial assistance including federal prisoner expense reimbursements, Medicaid funds, and a \nfederal grant made pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, making it subject to Section \n504. \n9.  Harold W. Clarke is the Director of VDOC. Director Clarke is responsible for the \nmanagement and oversight of VDOC’s jails and correctional institutions as well as any other \ncorrectional facilities managed by Virginia sheriffs, superintendents, or regional institutions or \nauthorities. Upon information and belief, the majority of inmates in Virginia’s correctional \nfacilities are in local and regional jails managed by Virginia sheriffs or superintendents. Each jail \nmust meet all minimum standards set by the Board to be certified by VDOC. Director Clarke is \nsued in his official capacity. \n10.  All individual named defendants are sued in their official capacities.  At all \nrelevant times, all Defendants were acting under color of state law, pursuant to their authority as \nofficials, agents, contractors, or employees of the Commonwealth of Virginia; within the scope \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 5 of 27 PageID# 70\nof their employment as representatives of public entities, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1); and \nas representatives of a “department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a \nState” under 29 U.S.C. § 794. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nBackground \n11.  Mr. Zemedagegehu was born and raised in Ethiopia. He immigrated to the United \nStates in 2001, and became a United States citizen in 2008.  \n12.  Mr. Zemedagegehu is deaf and has limited English proficiency. \n13.  As a child, Mr. Zemedagegehu learned Ethiopian Sign Language, the language of \nthe deaf community in Ethiopia.  \n14.  Mr. Zemedagegehu began learning ASL after immigrating to the United States in \n2001. He currently uses ASL as his primary language. ASL is a complete, complex language that \nemploys signs made with the hands and other movements, including facial expressions and \npostures of the body. It is a language distinct from English – it is not English in hand signals – \nand has its own vocabulary and rules for grammar and discourse structure.  \n15.  Mr. Zemedagegehu learned the little English he knows by taking courses through \nthe English Language Institute at Gallaudet University. He struggles to write and understand \neven basic English sentences. He has no functional ability to speak English or to read lips. \n16.  Mr. Zemedagegehu’s employment history is limited to manual labor jobs that do \nnot require proficiency in spoken or written English. For example, he worked loading and \nunloading trucks at Federal Express.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 6 of 27 PageID# 71\n17.  In 2010, Mr. Zemedagegehu left his job with Federal Express due to a lower back \ninjury that had occurred in 2008. This injury requires him to wear a back brace and take daily \nmedication.  \nPlaintiff’s Arrest \n \n18.  On the evening of February 2, 2014, Mr. Zemedagegehu went to Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport (“National Airport”) to find a warm place to sleep.  \n19.  Shortly after entering National Airport, Mr. Zemedagegehu was arrested by \nofficers of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. \n20.  Using gestures and in writing, Mr. Zemedagegehu informed the officers that he is \ndeaf and did not understand them. He also requested an ASL interpreter in writing. The officers \ndenied his request. Instead, the officers attempted to communicate with Mr. Zemedagegehu by \nwriting information on a notepad.   \n21.  Because Mr. Zemedagegehu cannot read written English well, he did not \nunderstand what the officers wrote and did not know why he had been arrested.  \n22.  Mr. Zemedagegehu was in the custody of the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority for only a short period of time before being transported to the Detention Facility, \nwhich is located in Arlington County, Virginia, close to National Airport.   \nPlaintiff’s Detention \n23.  Mr. Zemedagegehu was detained at the Detention Facility for nearly six weeks. \nDuring this time, despite Mr. Zemedagegehu’s repeated requests, Defendants refused to provide \nany effective means for Mr. Zemedagegehu to communicate. As a result, Mr. Zemedagegehu did \nnot understand why he had been arrested, could not communicate his needs or understand what \nwas being said during booking or his medical evaluations, and could not inform the Detention \nFacility personnel of his medical needs and dietary restrictions. Because he could not understand \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 7 of 27 PageID# 72\nthe announcements and other communications made orally at the Detention Facility, Mr. \nZemedagegehu missed out on meals, recreation times, rehabilitative services, and other events at \nthe Detention Facility. He also was unable to place telephone calls while at the Detention \nFacility, severely restricting his access to counsel. \n24.  On many occasions when Mr. Zemedagegehu requested interpreter services either \nin writing or using gestures, he believes he was informed that interpreters were prohibited at the \nDetention Facility. \nBooking Process \n25.  Mr. Zemedagegehu arrived at the Detention Facility during the early hours of \nFebruary 3, 2014. Detention Facility personnel attempted to communicate with Mr. \nZemedagegehu by speaking. However, Mr. Zemedagegehu was unable to understand what the \nofficers were saying.  \n26.  During this process, both in writing and using gestures, Mr. Zemedagegehu \nrequested an ASL interpreter. Detention Facility personnel refused to provide one.  \n27.  Because the Detention Facility did not provide an interpreter, Mr. Zemedagegehu \ndid not know why he had been arrested or what to expect while he was detained.  \n28.  During the booking process, the officers placed Mr. Zemedagegehu in front of a \nweb camera, a microphone, and a computer monitor that appeared to show a judge on the screen. \nThe judge on the monitor appeared to be speaking to Mr. Zemedagegehu, but he could not \nunderstand what the judge was saying. Mr. Zemedagegehu attempted to signal that he was deaf, \nbut officers in the room with Mr. Zemedagegehu directed him to stay still. Mr. Zemedagegehu \ndoes not know what occurred during that interaction with the judge. \n29.  At one point, one of the Detention Facility officers handed Mr. Zemedagegehu a \npiece of paper that was filled with writing. Mr. Zemedagegehu did not understand what it said \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 8 of 27 PageID# 73\nand requested an ASL interpreter by writing on the paper. After requesting an interpreter, Mr. \nZemedagegehu observed an officer placing a phone call. Upon information and belief, the phone \ncall relayed Mr. Zemedagegehu’s request for an interpreter to another prison officer.  \n30.  When the phone call concluded, the officer denied Mr. Zemedagegehu’s \ninterpreter request.  \n31.  Without an interpreter, Mr. Zemedagegehu did not understand what was taking \nplace during the booking process. Thus, Mr. Zemedagegehu could not understand any of the \nDetention Facility’s rules or procedures that might have been explained to him. Similarly, Mr. \nZemedagegehu was unable to advise the Detention Facility personnel of critical information \nconcerning himself, such as his dietary restrictions and medical needs.  These actions, among \nothers, unlawfully discriminated against Mr. Zemedagegehu and denied him the due process and \nequal protection afforded to non-deaf inmates. \n32.  On February 4, 2014, Mr. Zemedagegehu was arraigned. The Arlington General \nDistrict Court provided an interpreter for his arraignment. \n33.  Not until his arraignment, more than 24 hours after his arrest, did Mr. \nZemedagegehu first learn that he had been arrested and incarcerated for allegedly stealing an \niPad. \n34.  The lack of access to communication during the booking process exacerbated the \nfeelings of frustration, humiliation, anger, anxiety, isolation, confusion, and loss of dignity that \nMr. Zemedagegehu otherwise would have experienced as a result of his arrest and detention. \nMedical Evaluations \n35.  After booking, but before his arraignment, Mr. Zemedagegehu underwent a \nmedical evaluation at the Detention Facility.    \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 9 of 27 PageID# 74\n36.  The employee conducting the evaluation attempted to communicate with Mr. \nZemedagegehu in writing, but Mr. Zemedagegehu did not understand what was written. He \ninformed the evaluator that he did not understand and requested in writing an ASL interpreter. \nThe evaluator refused to provide one. \n37.  Without an interpreter, Mr. Zemedagegehu was unable to explain to the employee \nthat he had back problems and required a prescription. Consequently, throughout his entire six \nweek incarceration at the Detention Facility, Mr. Zemedagegehu did not receive the medicine he \nrequires to alleviate his back pain. \n38.  The evaluator handed Mr. Zemedagegehu what is now believed to be a consent \nform to sign for a medical procedure. Mr. Zemedagegehu could not read the form. He refused to \nsign it and asked in writing for an interpreter. \n39.  The evaluator summoned a second employee into the room. Mr. Zemedagegehu \nasked, in writing, for the second employee to provide an interpreter. \n40.  Instead of providing an interpreter, the second employee held down Mr. \nZemedagegehu’s arm and forced a needle into it. At the time, Mr. Zemedagegehu was confused \nas to what they were doing to his arm. \n41.  After the medical evaluation, an officer put Mr. Zemedagegehu into a jail cell by \nhimself. Mr. Zemedagegehu did know why he was being placed in isolation.   \n42.  Mr. Zemedagegehu was scared and confused during this time.  \n43.  Mr. Zemedagegehu repeatedly banged on the door and gestured at the cameras to \nget an officer’s attention to obtain an interpreter. He wanted the Detention Facility officers to \nexplain to him what was happening: Mr. Zemedagegehu still did not know why he had been \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 10 of 27 PageID# 75\narrested, why he was incarcerated, when he might be arraigned, when he might be released, what \nhad just been done to his arm, when he might be fed, or any other vital information.  \n44.  Mr. Zemedagegehu’s skin had a negative reaction to the forcible medical \nprocedure that was conducted on his arm. Following this reaction, Mr. Zemedagegehu underwent \nan additional medical procedure. Once again, Defendants refused to provide an interpreter to \nexplain this medical procedure. Because of the lack of communication, Mr. Zemedagegehu did \nnot know what was happening to him or why. He remained in isolation for several days. \n45.  The lack of communication during the medical procedures and the administration \nof these procedures without Mr. Zemedagegehu’s consent exacerbated the feelings of frustration, \nhumiliation, anger, anxiety, isolation, confusion, and loss of dignity that Mr. Zemedagegehu \notherwise would have experienced as a result of his detention. \nDietary Needs \n46.  At some point during Mr. Zemedagegehu’s isolation, one of the Detention \nFacility’s officers slid a tray of food into Mr. Zemedagegehu’s cell. The food tray contained pork. \nMr. Zemedagegehu does not eat pork for religious reasons.  \n47.  Because Defendants refused to provide Mr. Zemedagegehu with an interpreter, he \nwas unable to inform Detention Facility personnel of his religious and dietary restrictions. \n48.  As a result of the loneliness and frustration of being unable to effectively \ncommunicate with anyone and the denial of equal treatment, Mr. Zemedagegehu protested by \nrefusing to eat for an extended period of time. \nTelephone Access \n49.  After his arraignment, Mr. Zemedagegehu attempted to communicate to Detention \nFacility officers that he needed to place a telephone call. In response, the officers gestured to a \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 11 of 27 PageID# 76\ntraditional telephone. The officers appeared to suggest to Mr. Zemedagegehu to use the \ntraditional telephone on multiple occasions when he requested to make a phone call. \n50.  Because he is deaf, Mr. Zemedagegehu cannot place a call using a traditional \ntelephone. Instead, Mr. Zemedagegehu places calls through a videophone. \n51.  A videophone is a device with a camera and a video monitor that allows both \nparties to see each other simultaneously, similar to Skype and FaceTime. Videophones allow deaf \nindividuals to communicate with one another directly in ASL without having to communicate \nthrough written English. Any computer or smartphone with a camera and appropriate software \ncan be used to place a videophone call.   \n52.  Although Defendant Sheriff states that the Detention Facility is “[o]ne of the most \ntechnically advanced ‘Direct Supervision’ jails in the country,” upon information and belief, it \ndoes not have a videophone or any device equipped with videophone software. See Sheriff, \nDetention Facility, http://sheriff.arlingtonva.us/detention-facility/ (last visited February 19, \n2015). \n53.  Mr. Zemedagegehu repeatedly pleaded with the officers to let him place a call to \nhis public defender. Finally, one of the officers took the piece of paper with the public defender’s \nphone number on it and gestured to Mr. Zemedagegehu that the officer would place the call for \nhim. \n54.  Mr. Zemedagegehu waited for the officer to return, but the officer never did.  \n55.  Mr. Zemedagegehu did not find out whether the officer had followed through with \nplacing the call for Mr. Zemedagegehu, or what else had happened, until days later, when a \npublic defender appeared at the Detention Facility to see Mr. Zemedagegehu. However, the \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 12 of 27 PageID# 77\npublic defender did not have an ASL interpreter. As a result, they were unable to effectively \ncommunicate, significantly impairing Mr. Zemedagegehu’s access to counsel. \n56.  More than one week after Mr. Zemedagegehu began asking to make a phone call, \nthe officers provided him with a teletypewriter (“TTY”). \n57.  A TTY is an electronic device that allows typed communication to be sent to \nanother TTY via a telephone line. Based on sixty-year-old technology, the TTY is basically a \ntelephone equipped with a keyboard and a screen capable of displaying a single line of text, \ngiving it less functionality than the text-messaging function of a cellular phone. For two parties \nto have a TTY conversation, each party must have a TTY. Though a TTY may be a helpful \ncommunication tool in some circumstances, it ultimately relies on the user’s ability to \ncommunicate in written English and, in all events, is a much more time-intensive communication \ntool than a telephone, computer, or any other modern communication device. A TTY \nconversation does not enable parties to communicate in ASL. The TTY has been almost entirely \nsupplanted by the videophone and most deaf individuals no longer have TTYs. They \ncommunicate by videophone or by using any number of computer programs that provide for \nmore efficient video- and text-based communication, such as FaceTime, email, and instant \nmessaging programs.  \n58.  Mr. Zemedagegehu cannot communicate effectively using a TTY because a TTY \nrequires proficiency in English. Mr. Zemedagegehu cannot read or write English well enough to \ncarry on a conversation using written English. He can communicate effectively using a \nvideophone because a videophone allows him to communicate in ASL. \n59.  Mr. Zemedagegehu attempted to use the TTY provided to call a friend, who is \nalso deaf. Like Mr. Zemedagegehu and most other deaf individuals, she uses a videophone in \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 13 of 27 PageID# 78\nplace of a standard telephone. Also like Mr. Zemedagegehu and most other deaf individuals, she \ndoes not own a TTY; she owns only a videophone. A TTY cannot connect directly to a \nvideophone. \n60.  Consequently, Mr. Zemedagegehu attempted to but could not place a telephone \ncall to his friend.  \n61.  Upon information and belief, inmates at the Detention Facility who can hear have \naccess to a telephone to place outgoing calls.  Accordingly, Mr. Zemedagegehu was denied equal \naccess to basic services that the Sheriff offers at the Detention Facility. \n62.  Instead of Mr. Zemedagegehu placing the call to his friend, one of the Detention \nFacility’s officers placed the call for Mr. Zemedagegehu through a standard telephone. Because \nthe officer was calling a deaf individual, the officer’s call connected automatically to a \nvideophone relay service operator, who used a videophone to attempt to contact Mr. \nZemedagegehu’s friend and relay the guard’s communication in ASL to the friend. Because the \nfriend did not answer and due to the communication limitations between the officer and Mr. \nZemedagegehu, the officer apparently left a message for Mr. Zemedagegehu’s friend to come to \nthe Detention Facility. The message the friend received was in the format of a video message of \nthe relay service operator using ASL to translate the officer’s message. The video relay service \ncan translate spoken English to ASL, but such relay service cannot receive TTY calls and \ntranslate those into ASL. Mr. Zemedagegehu could not use the relay service himself because he \nwould have had to use the standard telephone. \n63.  Because Mr. Zemedagegehu could not communicate with his friend via telephone, \nhis friend had to come to the Detention Facility to communicate with Mr. Zemedagegehu. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 14 of 27 PageID# 79\n64.  The Sheriff never provided a different device other than a TTY for Mr. \nZemedagegehu to make a telephone call. Because of the lack of a videophone, Mr. \nZemedagegehu was unable to place telephone calls for the entire time he was detained. \n65.  The lack of telephone access exacerbated the feelings of frustration, humiliation, \nanger, anxiety, isolation, confusion, and loss of dignity that Mr. Zemedagegehu otherwise would \nhave experienced as a result of his detention. \nAssistance of Counsel \n66.  Due to the lack of telephone access, Mr. Zemedagegehu could not place or receive \ntelephone calls to anyone, including his attorney. \n67.  As a result, Mr. Zemedagegehu could access his attorney only when the attorney \ncame to the Detention Facility of his own accord. Mr. Zemedagegehu had no other means of \ncontacting his attorney to ask the attorney to come to the Detention Facility or even to ask a \nsimple question. If Mr. Zemedagegehu had had access to a videophone, he could have used the \nrelay service to communicate with his attorney in ASL; consequently, he would have been able to \nask questions, understand the answer, and otherwise participate in his own defense. \n68.  Upon information and belief, inmates who are not deaf can contact their attorneys \nby telephone, ask questions, understand the answer, and thus participate in their own defense. \n69.  The lack of access to counsel exacerbated the feelings of frustration, humiliation, \nanger, anxiety, isolation, confusion, and loss of dignity that Mr. Zemedagegehu otherwise would \nhave experienced as a result of his detention. \nMeals and Recreation Times \n70.  The Defendants’ discrimination and failure to provide auxiliary aids and services \nto ensure effective communication caused Mr. Zemedagegehu to miss meals and recreation \ntimes. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 15 of 27 PageID# 80\n71.  Upon information and belief, Detention Facility personnel signaled the beginning \nof meal and recreation times by using an auditory alert. When inmates heard the alert, they could \npress a button that would open their cell doors. With the cell doors open, inmates could leave \ntheir cells and proceed to the cafeteria or recreation yard. \n72.  Because Mr. Zemedagegehu is deaf, he could not hear the auditory alerts. \n73.  After Detention Facility personnel moved Mr. Zemedagegehu out of isolation to \nthe floor with the general population, Mr. Zemedagegehu was placed in a cell by himself. Mr. \nZemedagegehu would know that he could leave his cell only if he was looking outside his cell at \nthe time the alert sounded. He would observe other inmates open their cell doors. Initially, Mr. \nZemedagegehu did not understand that he had to press a button inside the cell for his door to \nopen and so when he attempted to open the door, it would not open. Only after being placed in a \ncell with another inmate did Mr. Zemedagegehu learn that he had to press a button for the door to \nopen. \n74.  On multiple occasions, Mr. Zemedagegehu was not looking outside his cell at the \ntime the alert sounded, often because he was sleeping. Mr. Zemedagegehu would awaken to see \nthat other inmates were outside of their cells. At that time, he would press the button to open his \ncell door, but the door would not open. He would attempt to signal to Detention Facility officers \nto have them open his cell door, but they would not respond, causing Mr. Zemedagegehu to miss \nmeals approximately two to three times per week and recreation times approximately once per \nweek due to the lack of auxiliary aids or services, such as visual alerts. \n75.  The lack of access to meals and recreation times exacerbated the feelings of \nfrustration, humiliation, anger, anxiety, isolation, confusion, and loss of dignity that Mr. \nZemedagegehu otherwise would have experienced as a result of his detention. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 16 of 27 PageID# 81\nRehabilitative Programming and Other Services \n76.  Defendants deprived Mr. Zemedagegehu of access to rehabilitative programming \nand other services due to the lack of an ASL interpreter and other auxiliary aids and services, \ntheir intentional discrimination, and their implementation and maintenance of policies and \nprocedures that had a disparate impact on Mr. Zemedagegehu because of his disability. \n77.  Those actions and inactions by the Defendants’ resulted in Mr. Zemedagegehu \nbeing unable to understand what information, if any, the Sheriff might have provided about \nrehabilitative programming or other services during booking or throughout the nearly six weeks \nhe spent at the Detention Facility. As a result, he was unaware of these programs or services \nwhile at the Detention Facility and therefore could not take advantage of them.   \n78.  If Defendants had provided an ASL interpreter and other auxiliary aids and \nservices, such as visual alerts and notifications, Mr. Zemedagegehu could have learned of and \nwould have participated in the various rehabilitative programming and other services offered by \nthe Sheriff at the Detention Facility. \n79.  Even in cases when Mr. Zemedagegehu did learn of available services from other \ninmates, he was unable to participate in or benefit from the services because of Defendants’ \nfailure to provide auxiliary aids and services necessary for him to have access to the services and \nother discriminatory actions and inactions. \n80.  For example, Mr. Zemedagegehu believed that he could visit the Detention \nFacility’s library by putting his name on a certain list. Mr. Zemedagegehu wrote his name on \nwhat he believed to be the library list. The officers, however, never allowed Mr. Zemedagegehu \nto access the library. He does not know why. It is possible that an officer called his name to visit \nthe library, but Mr. Zemedagegehu could not hear his name being called and therefore was \nunable to respond. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 17 of 27 PageID# 82\n81.  Each of the many times that Mr. Zemedagegehu requested a sign language \ninterpreter either in writing or using gestures, the Sheriff refused to provide one. \n82.  By the time Mr. Zemedagegehu was released from the Sheriff’s custody, he had \nspent six weeks in near-isolation, unable to effectively communicate with anyone at the \nDetention Facility but the sole visitor he briefly had.  \n83.  Throughout his detention, Mr. Zemedagegehu suffered frustration, humiliation, \nanger, anxiety, isolation, confusion, and loss of dignity due to the intense isolation and repeated \ninstances of exclusion from or limited participation in Defendants’ programs, services, and \nactivities.   \nState Agency Defendants’ Knowledge of Discrimination Against Deaf Inmates \n \n84.  Mr. Zemedagegehu was discriminated against and denied access to effective \ncommunication by the Sheriff at the Detention Facility, which is a VDOC-certified correctional \nfacility. (VDOC, its Director, the Board, and its Chairman are referred to herein as the “State \nAgency Defendants.”) VDOC-certified facilities are required to comply with minimum standards \nset by the Board.  \n85.  The Board establishes minimum standards to ensure the health, safety, and \nwelfare of all correctional facility inmates. The Board’s responsibility to create minimum \nstandards in Virginia’s jails includes maintaining oversight over any policies and procedures \nregarding the treatment of and services provided to disabled inmates and detainees.  \n86.  VDOC monitors and enforces these and other Board standards throughout the \nlocal jails, state correctional facilities, residential centers, probation and parole offices and other \nprograms and facilities that make up the Commonwealth of Virginia’s correctional system. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 18 of 27 PageID# 83\n87.  The State Agency Defendants are – or should be – aware of their obligations \nunder Title II and Section 504, including the requirement that deaf inmates be provided with \naccommodations to enable them to enjoy the same services, privileges, facilities, advantages, and \naccommodations made available to non-deaf inmates. The State Agency Defendants’ knowledge \nof their duties and responsibilities owed to inmates with disabilities stems in part from the self-\nevaluation requirements found in the regulations implementing both Title II, 28 C.F.R. § 35.105, \nand Section 504, 45 C.F.R. § 84.6(c). The State Agency Defendants’ knowledge of their duties \nand responsibilities owed to deaf inmates in particular has been reinforced over the last fifteen \nyears through a series of lawsuits deaf inmates have brought against state entities in Virginia for \ntheir repeated failure to abide by their legal obligations towards deaf inmates and detainees. \n88.  These lawsuits include Hill v. Virginia Dept. of Corrections, No. 948-4 (Va. Cir. \nCt. 2002), wherein Otis Hill, a deaf inmate, sued VDOC for failure to provide him with a sign \nlanguage interpreter that would enable him to participate in prison-run classes. VDOC eventually \nreached a settlement agreement with Hill, requiring VDOC to, among other things, provide Hill \nwith a “qualified, certified sign language interpreter.” \n89.  In 2009, VDOC settled a lawsuit brought by a hard of hearing inmate who \nchallenged a disciplinary action brought against him for missing morning count, on the ground \nthat his hearing impairment prevented him from hearing the prison alerts. Sorrells v. Wheeler, \nNo. 3:08-cv-39 (W.D. Va. 2009). \n90.  Within a year of the Sorrells settlement, VDOC inmates who were deaf or hard of \nhearing filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia \nin Alexandria, alleging that VDOC and other related individuals and entities violated the ADA, \nSection 504, and Virginia State law by failing to provide deaf and hard of hearing inmates with \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 19 of 27 PageID# 84\nnecessary access to qualified sign language interpreters, notification of daily events and safety \nannouncements, and means to communicate with individuals outside of prison. Minnis v. \nJohnson, 1:10-cv-00096-TSE-TRJ (E.D. Va. Jan. 29, 2010). On October 13, 2010, the plaintiffs \nand the VDOC defendants reached a settlement agreement (“Minnis Settlement Agreement”) in \nwhich the defendants agreed to provide qualified sign language interpreters and other auxiliary \naids and services necessary to ensure that deaf inmates “have full and equal enjoyment” of all \nprivileges and services as that of similarly situated non-deaf inmates. Among other things, under \nthe Minnis Settlement Agreement, VDOC agreed to do the following: \nA.  Provide deaf inmates with access to qualified interpreters during the booking \nprocess. \n \nB.  Provide deaf inmates with access to qualified interpreters in situations \nconcerning medical care, including scheduled appointments between deaf \ninmates and medical providers and during unscheduled medical emergencies.  \n \nC.  Provide deaf inmates “with telecommunication devices so that they will have \naccess to communication with people outside of VDOC that is substantially \non the same basis as the access to telecommunication VDOC provides inmates \nwho are not Deaf.” In addition, VDOC agreed to “share a list of \ncommunications equipment available to Deaf inmates upon their arrival at the \nfacility.” Further, VDOC agreed to permit deaf inmates access to videophone \ntechnology. \n \nD.  Provide an effective visual notification system that will notify deaf inmates of \nprison-wide events and events specific to deaf inmates.  VDOC acknowledged \nthat deaf inmates incarcerated at VDOC state correctional facilities should not \nmiss announcements, alarms, or any other auditory information from VDOC \nstaff to the general inmate population solely because of their disability. \n \nE.  “Provide appropriate Auxiliary Aids and Services for all programs offered at \nVDOC facilities in which Deaf inmates are qualified, admitted into, and are \nactively participating in.” Such programs include: Adult Education, \nCommunity College Courses, Vocational Programs, Correctional Enterprises \nPrograms, and Rehabilitative Programs. \n \n91.  In addition to the Minnis Settlement Agreement and other documented widespread \nabuses, VDOC is aware of each correctional facility’s compliance with the Board’s minimum \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 20 of 27 PageID# 85\nstandards and other laws through VDOC’s performance of triennial certification audits for each \nfacility, yearly unannounced life, health, safety inspections of local and regional jails and \nlockups, and other monitoring visits. VDOC’s auditing and monitoring responsibilities include \nmaintaining oversight over any policies and procedures regarding the treatment of and services \nprovided to disabled inmates and detainees. Upon information and belief, through required \nregular audits and inspections of Virginia jails, in particular by VDOC’s Compliance and \nAccreditation Unit’s “PREA and ADA Audits & Compliance” section, VDOC and Director \nClarke are aware of the Sheriff’s policies and practices regarding disabled individuals, and more \nspecifically, the Sheriff’s failure to provide Mr. Zemedagegehu and individuals like Mr. \nZemedagegehu with effective communication in the form of a qualified ASL interpreter or other \nauxiliary aids at the Detention Facility. As a result, Director Clarke is also aware of VDOC’s \ncontinued inaction and deficient inspection and monitoring of the Detention Facility in order to \nensure the health, safety, and welfare of Plaintiff and other offenders under the Sheriff’s custody \nand the Sheriff’s compliance with all other applicable laws, regulations, and procedures. \n92.  Further, through the above-referenced litigation and VDOC’s required regular \naudits and inspections of Virginia jails, the Board and Chairman Peed are, upon information and \nbelief, aware of the Sheriff’s policies and practices regarding disabled individuals, and more \nspecifically, the Sheriff’s failure to provide Mr. Zemedagegehu and individuals like Mr. \nZemedagegehu with effective communication in the form of a qualified ASL interpreter or other \nauxiliary aids at the Detention Facility. As a result, the Board and Chairman Peed are also aware \nof the Board’s failure to institute minimum standards for Virginia’s jails that would ensure \ncompliance with Title II and Section 504. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 21 of 27 PageID# 86\n93.  The State Agency Defendants are or should be aware that access to qualified \ninterpreters, visual alerts, telecommunications devices, and other auxiliary aids are necessary to \nensure that deaf inmates have equal and meaningful access to the services offered to similarly \nsituated non-deaf inmates.  The State Agency Defendants likewise were aware or should have \nbeen aware that maintaining standards and/or certifying jails, like the Detention Facility, that fail \nto provide such reasonable accommodations posed a substantial risk that deaf inmates, like Mr. \nZemedagegehu, would be denied their rights under Title II and Section 504. The State Agency \nDefendants likewise were aware or should have been aware that without their intervention, such \na risk would continue. \nCOUNT I \n(Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act) \n94.  Mr. Zemedagegehu repeats and re-alleges each and every allegation above as if \nfully set forth herein.  \n95.  On July 12, 1990, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) \n“to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  \n96.  Title II of the ADA states that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n97.  Title II of the ADA defines “qualified individual with a disability” as “an \nindividual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or \npractices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the \nprovision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 22 of 27 PageID# 87\nreceipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(2). \n98.  Mr. Zemedagegehu has a disability because he is substantially limited in the \nmajor life activities of hearing and speaking. He also meets the essential eligibility requirements \nfor the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity. He is therefore a “qualified individual with a disability” under Title II of the ADA. \n99.  The Sheriff’s Office, managed and directed by the Sheriff, is a department, \nagency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of the Commonwealth; as such, it is a \n“public entity” within the meaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B).  \n100.  The Board, managed and directed by Chairman Carl Peed, is a department, \nagency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of the Commonwealth; as such, it is a \n“public entity” within the meaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B).  \n101.  VDOC, managed and directed by Director Harold Clarke, is a department of the \nCommonwealth; as such, it is a “public entity” within the meaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1)(B). \n102.  At all times relevant to this action, the ADA was in full force and effect in the \nUnited States and Mr. Zemedagegehu had a right not to be subjected by Defendants to \ndiscrimination on the basis of his disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n103.  The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) regulation implementing Title II of the \nADA clearly requires the provision of effective communication as a part of its nondiscrimination \nmandate. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 23 of 27 PageID# 88\n104.  The regulation states that “[a] public entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure \nthat communications with applicants, participants, and members of the public . . . with \ndisabilities are as effective as communications with others.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(a).  \n105.  Defendants’ failure to provide effective communication for Mr. Zemedagegehu \ndenied, on the basis of his disability, Mr. Zemedagegehu the same access to Defendants’ services, \nbenefits, activities, programs, or privileges as the access provided to hearing individuals.  \n106.  To ensure effective communication, the ADA requires that “a public entity shall \nfurnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford qualified individuals \nwith disabilities . . . an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, \nprogram or activity conducted by a public entity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(1). Auxiliary aids and \nservices include, but are not limited to, “qualified interpreters or other effective methods of \nmaking aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments,” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12103, such as videophones and videotext displays. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n107.  In determining what type of auxiliary aid and service is necessary, “a public entity \nshall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § \n35.160(b)(2).  \n108.  Defendants knowingly and intentionally failed to provide Mr. Zemedagegehu with \nan ASL interpreter and other necessary auxiliary aids or services he requested, subjected him to \ndiscrimination, and/or maintained policies and procedures that had a disparate impact on Mr. \nZemedagegehu because of his disability resulting in Mr. Zemedagegehu being denied the same \nbenefits and services available to non-deaf inmates. Among other things, as a result of \nDefendants’ failures, Mr. Zemedagegehu was: \na.  Unable to effectively communicate with the Sheriff’s officers and other personnel \nduring the booking process; \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 24 of 27 PageID# 89\nb.  Unable to effectively communicate with the Sheriff’s personnel performing \nmedical functions; \nc.  Unable to effectively communicate dietary needs; \nd.  Deprived of access to telephone calls; \ne.  Deprived of access to counsel; \nf.  Deprived of access to meals and recreation times; and \ng.  Deprived of knowledge of and access to rehabilitative programming and other \nservices. \n \n109.  These failures violated Mr. Zemedagegehu’s rights under Title II of the ADA. \n110.  Defendants knew of the substantial likelihood of a violation of Mr. \nZemedagegehu’s federally protected rights and failed to act on this likelihood. \n111.  Upon information and belief, the failure to provide effective communication to \ndeaf individuals, such as Mr. Zemedagegehu, and the failure to provide comparable access to \nservices, programs, and activities as provided to hearing individuals are policies, regular \npractices, or customs of the Defendants. This failure is ongoing and continues to date. \n112.  As a result of Defendants’ violation of the ADA, Mr. Zemedagegehu has suffered \ndiscrimination, exclusion from services, benefits, activities, programs, and privileges, loss of \ndignity, frustration, humiliation, emotional pain and suffering, anxiety, trauma, embarrassment, \nand injury to his physical and mental health. \nCOUNT II \n(Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1973) \n113.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each and every allegation above as if fully set forth \nherein. \n114.  Section 504 states “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the \nUnited States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 25 of 27 PageID# 90\n115.  Plaintiff is substantially limited in the major life activities of hearing and \nspeaking; as such, he is an individual with a disability under 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B) who is \nqualified under Section 504.  \n116.  The Sheriff’s Office, as managed and directed by the Sherriff, is a “program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance” because it is “a department, agency, special \npurpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government” and is recipient of \nfederal financial assistance because it receives federal financial assistance, including but not \nlimited to federal prisoner expense reimbursements. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1), (4). \n117.  The Board is a “program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” \nbecause it is “a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or \nof a local government” and, upon information and belief, is a recipient of federal financial \nassistance. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A), (B).  \n118.  VDOC is a “program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” because it \nis “a department . . . of a State” that receives federal prisoner expense reimbursements, Medicaid \nfunds, and grants pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, among other assistance. 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794(b)(1). \n119.   The operations of Defendants are “program[s] or activit[es]” within the meaning \nof 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A)-(B) and/or (b)(2)(B).  \n120.  At all times relevant to this action, Section 504 was in full force and effect in the \nUnited States and Mr. Zemedagegehu had a right not to be subjected to discrimination on the \nbasis of his disability by Defendants.  \n121.  Defendants knowingly and intentionally failed to provide Mr. Zemedagegehu with \nan ASL interpreter and other necessary auxiliary aids or services he requested, subjected him to \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 26 of 27 PageID# 91\ndiscrimination, and/or maintained policies and procedures that had a disparate impact on Mr. \nZemedagegehu because of his disability resulting in Mr. Zemedagegehu being denied the same \nbenefits and services available to non-deaf inmates. Among other things, as a result of \nDefendants’ failures, Mr. Zemedagegehu was: \na.  Unable to effectively communicate with the Sheriff’s guards and other \npersonnel during the booking process; \nb.  Unable to effectively communicate with the Sheriff’s employees \nperforming medical functions; \nc.  Unable to effectively communicate dietary needs; \nd.  Deprived of access to telephone calls; \ne.  Deprived of access to counsel \nf.  Deprived of access to meals and recreation times; and \ng.  Deprived of knowledge of and access to rehabilitative programming and \nother services. \n \n122.  These failures violated Mr. Zemedagegehu’s rights under Section 504. \n123.  Defendants knew of the substantial likelihood of a violation of Mr. \nZemedagegehu’s federally protected rights and failed to act on this likelihood. \n124.  Upon information and belief, the failure to provide effective communication to \ndeaf individuals, such as Mr. Zemedagegehu, and the failure to provide comparable access to \nservices, programs, and activities as provided to hearing individuals are policies, regular \npractices, or customs of the Defendants. This failure is ongoing and continues to date. \n125.  As a result of the Defendants’ violation of Section 504, Mr. Zemedagegehu has \nsuffered discrimination, exclusion from services, benefits, activities, programs, and privileges, \nloss of dignity, frustration, humiliation, emotional pain and suffering, anxiety, trauma, \nembarrassment, and injury to his physical and mental health. \nJURY DEMAND \n126.  Plaintiff hereby demands that this action be tried before a jury. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00057-JCC-MSN   Document 21   Filed 02/19/15   Page 27 of 27 PageID# 92\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n127.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court provide the \nfollowing relief: \na.
