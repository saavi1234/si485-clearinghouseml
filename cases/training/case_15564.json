    "summary": "<p>On November 30, 2015, a resident of Clark County, Kentucky, who was arrested and admitted to jail filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against the Clark County Detention Center (Jail). The complaint alleged that the Jail wrongly deprived the plaintiffs of property without due process of law and charged costs of their incarceration absent court order, including for plaintiffs who were subsequently acquitted. The complaint alleged that this violated Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) §441.265, and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. </p><p>The individual plaintiff who filed the suit had been arrested and admitted to the Jail on October 26, 2013; he remained incarcerated until his release on December 15, 2014. Plaintiff maintained that the criminal charges for which he was incarcerated were dismissed midway on April 2, 2015, because the plaintiff proved he was entirely innocent of such offenses. After release, plaintiff received a written demand from the Jail to pay in excess of $4,000 in fees relating to his incarceration. As of November 30, 2015, the plaintiff paid $20 and refused to pay the remaining balance on the grounds that KRS §441.265 allowed a jail to charge detainees the costs of their confinement only with a court order and consideration of the detainee's financial obligations. Moreover, the plaintiff alleged, the jail could not charge innocent detainees and was required to accounting for the funds collected. The plaintiff further maintained that if KRS §441.265 is interpreted otherwise, then it violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Kentucky Constitution. </p><p>The plaintiff sought both compensatory and punitive damages arising from the conduct of the defendants, and declaratory judgment and permanent injunction of the practice. </p><p>On January 14, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's claims. On March 11, 2016, the court granted the defendants' motion and dismissed all claims alleged in the complaint with prejudice, and all pending motions were denied moot. </p><p>In the opinion, district judge Joseph Hood found that the plaintiffs were \"prisoners\" within the definition of KRS §441.005(3), which allows courts to impose detention fees without the order of a sentencing court and without respect to guilt or innocence. Judge Hood found, moreover, that the facts pleaded did not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation and that the state had a legitimate interest in recouping costs from inmates. Accordingly, on March 11, 2016, the court ordered judgment in favor of the defendants. 2016 WL 1050743.</p><p>The plaintiffs appealed. On December 19, 2016, the 6th Circuit affirmed in an unpublished opinion. 2016 WL 7338530. In that opinion, by Judge Rodgers, the Court of Appeals explained that at oral argument, counsel for the defendants \"disavowed any further</p><p>efforts to obtain the $4,000 beyond the $20 already received.\"  Because the county was no longer trying to collect the bill, the court said, plaintiff didn't have a property interest to assert. </p><p>Plaintiff sought rehearing en banc, but the 6th Circuit denied that motion. This case is closed. </p><p></p>",

This case presents a federal procedural due process challenge \nto the practice of Kentucky jailers of sending a bill for incarceration costs to jailed prisoners who \nhave  subsequently  been  discharged  without  any  sentence.    After  arrest,  David  Jones  was \nadmitted to the Clark County Detention Center.  He spent fourteen months in jail, then left, and, \nfive months thereafter, the accusations against him were dismissed.  Clark County then billed \nJones $4,000 for the costs of his incarceration.  Jones paid $20, stopped paying, and sued Clark \nCounty and its jailor, asserting § 1983 and state claims both individually and on behalf of a class.  \nThe district court dismissed the federal claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction \nover the state claims.  Jones appeals, arguing once again that he has been deprived of procedural \ndue process by the County and the County Jailor.  Because Kentucky allowed Jones to challenge \n\n      Case: 16-5295     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/19/2016     Page: 2\nNo. 16-5295 \nJones v. Clark Cty. \n \nthe bill by refusing to pay it, Jones’s  procedural  due  process  rights  have  not  been  violated.  We \ndo not have before us the separate question of whether federal substantive due process principles \npermit the state to legislate the reimbursement obligation for which Jones was billed. \nKentucky’s   pay-for-your-own-incarceration  statute  generally  requires  prisoners  to \nreimburse the jailing county for the costs of their incarceration.  KRS 441.265.  Ordinarily, the \nprisoners  “shall  be  required”  to  do  so  “by  the  sentencing  court.”    KRS 441.265(1).  But the \njailing  county  may  compel  at  least  a  part  of  that  reimbursement  without  a  sentencing  court’s  \norder,   because   the   jailing   county   may   “automatically   deduct[]”   funds   “from   the   prisoner’s  \nproperty  or  canteen  account”  to  ensure  payment  of  the  fees.    KRS 441.265(6).  Not all prisoners \nhave  to  pay  for  their  incarceration.    Prisoners  do  not  pay  if  “the  Department  of  Corrections  is  \nfinancially   responsible   for   housing”   the   prisoner,   KRS  441.265(8),  and  the  Department  of \nCorrections  appears  to  be  financially  responsible   for   housing   “prisoners   charged   with   or  \nconvicted  of  violations  of  state  law,”  KRS 441.206(1)–(2).  Convicted and indicted prisoners, \ntherefore, appear not to be billed for their incarceration.  Merely arrested prisoners, who fail to \npost bond and are incarcerated, may be billed after release, even if all charges against them are \nlater dismissed, leaving them with no convictions and no sentences.1 \nHere, accepting as true all of its well-pleaded  factual  allegations,  Jones’s  complaint  sets  \nout the following  facts.    On  October  26,  2013,  David  Jones  was  “arrested  and  admitted”  to  the  \nClark County Detention Center.  He stayed there until December 15, 2014.  On April 2, 2015, the \naccusations against Jones were dropped “because  [Jones]  proved  he  was  entirely  innocent  of  \nsuch  offenses.”    After  his  release,  Jones  received  a  bill  from  the  Clark  County  Detention  Center  \n                                                 \n1 While a Kentucky court has approved the automatic withholdings from non-sentenced prisoners as consistent with \nKentucky law, see Cole v. Warren County, 495 S.W.3d 712 (Ky. Ct. App. 2016), and while this court has approved \nthat practice as consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, see \nSickles v. Campbell Cty., 501 F.3d 726 (6th Cir. 2007), no court appears to have addressed the lawfulness of billing \na released prisoner who was never convicted or sentenced, and whose charges were ultimately dismissed.    \n-2- \n \n\n      Case: 16-5295     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/19/2016     Page: 3\nNo. 16-5295 \nJones v. Clark Cty. \n \nto  pay  “more  than  $4,000  for  the  costs  of  his  confinement.”    Jones  initially  paid  $20;;  he  then \nstopped paying, on  his  counsel’s  advice.     \nThe  complaint  does  not  plead  why  Jones  was  arrested  or  what  Jones’s  bail  was,  if  any.    It  \nalso does not plead when, and with what, Kentucky formally charged Jones, before dismissing \nthose charges.  Thus the complaint does not allege that Jones was billed for incarceration when \nKentucky gave Jones no option but to stay in jail; Jones may have been incarcerated because he \nwas allowed, but failed, to post bond.   \n  Jones sued Clark County and Frank Doyle, the Clark County Jailer, both individually and \non behalf of all persons who were deprived of their property without due process of law when \nthe Clark County Detention Center billed them for the costs of their incarceration without an \norder of a sentencing court.  The complaint alleged that requiring prisoners to pay for their own \nincarceration, where no trial court has convicted the prisoners and no sentencing court has \nordered the payments, violated Kentucky law and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nU.S.  Constitution.    The  complaint  also  asserted  various  state-law  claims  of  conspiracy, \nnegligence, conversion, fraud, and violations of the Kentucky Constitution.   \n  Defendants Clark County and Boyle moved to dismiss all claims.  As a part of that \nmotion, the defendants argued that Jones had not alleged a viable claim of violation of the Fourth \nAmendment.    Jones  responded,  opposing  the  motion  to  dismiss,  but  “not  object[ing]”  to  the  \ndismissal of his Fourth Amendment claims.   \n  The district court granted the motion to dismiss, dismissing the federal claims with \nprejudice, and dismissing the state claims without prejudice.  Jones v. Clark Cty., No. 5:15-cv-\n350-JMH, 2016 WL 1050743 (E.D. Ky. Mar.  11, 2016).  Recognizing that Jones had not \nobjected to the dismissal of his Fourth Amendment claim, Jones, 2016 WL 1050743, at *2 n.1, \n-3- \n \n\n      Case: 16-5295     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/19/2016     Page: 4\nNo. 16-5295 \nJones v. Clark Cty. \n \nthe   district   court   analyzed   only   whether   Jones’s   due   process   rights   under   the   Fourteenth  \nAmendment had been violated, see id. at *2.    In  the  context  of  Jones’s  §  1983  claim,  then,  the  \ntwo  issues  were  whether  Jones  was  deprived  of  a  protected  property  interest  and  whether \nKentucky had failed to provide adequate process for that deprivation.  Id. (citing Ky.  Dep’t  of  \nCorr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989)).  Assuming that Jones had a property interest in \nthe $20 of which he was deprived, id. (citing Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, \n571–73 (1972)),  the  district  court  concluded  that  Jones’s  due  process  rights  had  not  been  violated  \nunder the Mathews v. Eldridge balancing test, id. at *2–*6.   \nIn conducting the Mathews v. Eldridge balancing test, the district court relied heavily on \nthis  court’s  opinion  in  Sickles v. Campbell Cty., 501 F.3d 726 (6th Cir. 2007).  In Sickles, this \ncourt  considered  whether  Kentucky  had  violated  prisoners’  due process rights when it withheld a \nportion  of  the  transfers  by  friends  and  families  into  the  prisoners’  canteen  accounts,  which  \ncontained funds that the prisoners could use to purchase goods from the commissary, without an \norder of a sentencing court.  See Sickles, 501 F.3d at 728–29.  After balancing the factors that the \npanel  identified in  Mathews v. Eldridge, we  concluded that no predeprivation  hearing was \nrequired for the withholdings.  Sickles, 501 F.3d at 731.  Here, the district court found that that \nanalysis controlled this case, because Jones raised no successful grounds on which to distinguish \nSickles.  Jones, 2016 WL 1050743, at *4. \nJones’s  procedural due process rights have not been violated.  The only action taken by \nthe  defendants  to  get  Jones’s  money  was  to  bill  for  it  and  accept  partial  payment.    This  is  not  a  \ncase in which the state has confiscated or converted property,  such  as  property  in  the  prisoner’s  \npockets, or amounts sent to him by friends, or Social Security checks sent to him.  Instead Jones \nwas merely billed.  We are pointed to no authority identifying a procedural due process right not \n-4- \n \n\n      Case: 16-5295     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/19/2016     Page: 5\nNo. 16-5295 \nJones v. Clark Cty. \n \nto be billed by the government for amounts that the billed person contends he does not owe.  The \nbilled party, after all, still possesses and owns the money until some further process is imposed \nupon him. \n  Stated in doctrinal terms, Jones does not have a property interest in not being billed.  \nThe bill from Clark County, on its own, has not deprived Jones of a protected property interest.  \nA  protected  property  interest  is  “defined  by  existing  rules  or  understandings  that  stem  from  an  \nindependent source such as state law—rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and \nthat support claims of entitlement  to  those  benefits.”    Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 \n(1972).  Jones points to no source of law that entitles him to enjoy his money unfettered by \ngovernment bills, correct or incorrect.  An erroneously high bill from the government, without \nmore,  does  not  deprive  the  bill’s  recipient  of  a  protected  property  interest;;  the  IRS  does  not  \ndeprive a taxpayer of protected property interest every time it erroneously bills the taxpayer for \nmore unpaid taxes than is due.  Jones’s  procedural  due  process claim thus fails at the outset. \nEven if the process of billing and receiving partial payment could be thought of as a \ndeprivation of a property interest, such a deprivation is inherently protected by process.  In this \ncase, process inheres in the action the government takes to get payment of the bill.  The prisoner \ncan  refuse  to  pay  the  bill,  leaving  the  burden  on  the  jailer,  who  “may  file  a  civil  action  to  seek  \nreimbursement   from   that   prisoner   for   any   amount   owed   which   remains   unpaid.”      KRS \n441.265(3).  In such a suit the defendant can raise all the state or federal issues he wants to \nchallenge his liability.  In jail-reimbursement cases, in addition, a prisoner  can  “negotiat[e]”  with  \nthe  jailer,  and  the  jailer  may  “release  the  prisoner  from  all  or  part  of  the  prisoner’s  repayment  \nobligation  if  the  jailer  believes  that  the  prisoner  will  be  unable  to  pay  the  full  amount  due.”    KRS \n441.265(7).   \n-5- \n \n\n      Case: 16-5295     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/19/2016     Page: 6\nNo. 16-5295 \nJones v. Clark Cty. \n \nFormally analyzed under the three-factor Eldridge test for what process is due, Jones’s \nargument  fails.    We  balance  “[1]   the   private   interest   that   will   be   affected   by   the  official \naction; . . . [2] the risk of an erroneous deprivation . . . and the probable value, if any, of \nadditional or substitute procedural safeguards; and . . . [3] the Government’s interest, including \nthe function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute \nprocedural  requirement  would  entail.”  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 335. \nBalancing those factors, Jones was not due much process.  In Sickles, this court balanced \nthe factors for a different aspect of this same pay-for-your-own-incarceration regime—the aspect \nthat   allows   Kentucky’s   county   jailers   automatically   to   withhold   a   portion   of   transfers   into  \nprisoners’  canteen  accounts,  which  contain  funds that the prisoners can use at the commissary, \nwithout the order of a sentencing court.  See Sickles, 501 F.3d at 728–29.  We concluded that \nonly  minimal  process  was  due  and  that  Kentucky’s  pay-for-your-own-incarceration statute did \nnot violate due process.  See id. at 731.  The same conclusion is required here.  \nFirst,  the  private  interest  at  stake  is  minimal.    Jones  was  merely  billed  for  the \nreimbursement.  No property was seized.  The lack of a clearly defined property interest in the \nfirst place suggests that the property interest is minimal.  Second, any risk of an erroneous \ndeprivation is minor and, as the district court suggested, less than the risk in Sickles.  Jones, \n2016 WL 1050743, at *4. In Sickles, we assessed the risk of an erroneous deprivation when the \ncounty  automatically  withholds  a  portion  of  transfers  into  prisoners’  accounts.    We reasoned that \nthe   withholding   “involves   elementary   accounting   that   has   little   risk   of   error   and   is   non-\ndiscretionary.”    Sickles, 501 F.3d at 730.    Here,  too,  elementary  accounting  determines  Jones’s  \nbill—a simple multiplication of the per diem rate and the number of days spent in prison before \nformal  charges.    Here,  too,  the  bill  is  non-discretionary—as  the  district  court  explained, \n-6- \n \n\n      Case: 16-5295     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/19/2016     Page: 7\nNo. 16-5295 \nJones v. Clark Cty. \n \n“it applies  to  all  persons  confined  in  the  Jail.”   Jones, 2016 WL 1050743, at *4.  Furthermore, \nhere, the risk of deprivation is diminished by process that the Kentucky statute provides to Jones, \nbut did not provide to Sickles, as indicated above.  Third,  the  government’s  interest  in  being able \nto proceed by billing is huge.  It is hard to imagine how a government can obtain funds allegedly \nowed to it without being able to send a bill.  Moreover, it would be paradoxical to hold that \nprocess should precede a bill.  Due process at its core involves adequate notice, and a bill at its \nessence provides notice of a debt.  It would not make sense to require notice before sending a \nnotice.   \nWe do not address the other argument that Jones makes at length on appeal:  that he has \nno obligation to pay under Kentucky’s  pay-for-your-own-incarceration statute, once it has been \ndetermined that he will not be sentenced.2  This is presented as a state-law issue rather than as a \nfederal issue.  The district court below  declined  to  exercise  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  Jones’s  \nstate law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  We interpret this ruling as extending to claims based \non  the  scope  of  the  Kentucky  statute,  notwithstanding  the  district  court’s  discussion  of  the  issue \nas part of its due process analysis.  See Jones, 2016 WL 1050743, at *6.  Declining to exercise \njurisdiction over the state law issues was appropriate.  “Although  [§  1983]  provides  the  citizen  \nwith an effective remedy against those abuses of state power that violate federal law, it does not \nprovide  a  remedy  for  abuses  that  do  not  violate  federal  law.”    Collins v. City of Harker Heights, \n503 U.S. 115, 119 (1992).  We take no position on the state law issue.  If the state were to sue to \nenforce the obligation, Jones could still contend that the Kentucky statute does not require him to \n                                                 \n2 Jones declined to argue on appeal in this case—at least until oral argument—that federal substantive due process \nrequires  that  result.    Any  such  argument  is  implicit  at  most  in  his  briefing.    “Generally  speaking[,] . . . a party does \nnot  preserve  an  argument  by  raising  it  for  the  first  time  at  oral  argument.”    United States v. Huntington National \nBank, 574 F.3d 329, 331 (6th Cir. 2009).   \n-7- \n \n\n      Case: 16-5295     Document: 34-2     Filed: 12/19/2016     Page: 8\nNo. 16-5295 \nJones v. Clark Cty. \n \npay.  Counsel for the defendants in this case, however, at oral argument disavowed any further \nefforts to obtain the $4,000 beyond the $20 already received. \n  The judgment of the district court is affirmed. \n-8- \n ",

Introduction \n \n             1.         Plaintiff David Jones files this class action complaint in his individual capacity and \non behalf of all persons who, while incarcerated or detained at the Clark County Detention Center \n(“the Jail”), have been wrongfully deprived of their property without due process of law, and in \nviolation of their clearly-established constitutional, statutory, and common law protections, by the \npolicy, custom and/or practice at the Jail of charging persons admitted to the Jail – even those like \nPlaintiff who were subsequently proven innocent – for the costs of their incarceration.  Such costs are \nroutinely levied by the Jail despite the absence of a requirement by a sentencing court for \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 2 of 10 - Page ID#: 2\nreimbursement of the county for expenses incurred by reason of such person’s confinement, in \nviolation of KRS § 441.265, and Plaintiff and the class’ constitutional and common law rights. \n 2.  On information and belief, numerous persons admitted to the Jail have been subjected \nto deprivation of their cash and other property by operation of such policies, customs and/or \npractices and the wrongful conduct described below.  On information and belief, such policies, \ncustoms and/or practices have caused consequential and special damages to some or all such persons \nin addition to the actual damages represented by the funds retained. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n3.  Plaintiff, and all others similarly situated, seek recovery of actual and punitive \ndamages from Defendants under federal, state, and common law.  As Clark County, Kentucky is the \nlocation of all acts pertinent to Plaintiff’s claims, venue is proper in this Court. \nIII.  Parties \n  4.  Plaintiff is a resident of Clark County. \n  5.  Defendant Clark County, Kentucky, at all times mentioned herein, employed, was \nresponsible for the establishment of policies either formally or by custom for, and was responsible \nfor the employment, training, supervision and conduct of, Jailer Frank Doyle, and the officers and \nemployees of the Jail.   \n  6.  Defendant Doyle, at all times mentioned herein, was the Clark County Jailer, and was \nresponsible for the establishment of policies, customs and practices governing the employment, \ntraining, supervision and conduct of, officers and employees staffing the Jail, and the establishment \nof policies, customs and practices governing conduct and practices of the Jail’s officers and \nemployees regarding, inter alia, property of persons like Plaintiff, and, on information and belief, \nindividually participated in the wrongful conduct made the basis of this complaint.   \n- 2 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 3 of 10 - Page ID#: 3\nIV.  Nature of Defendants’ Conduct \n7.  Defendants engaged in the conduct described below under color of state law, and in \naccordance with the policies, customs and practice of the County and the Jail.  The offenses \ndescribed below resulted from the failure of Defendants to employ qualified persons for positions of \nauthority, and/or to properly or conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after \ntheir employment, and/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures either \nformally or by custom and practice to protect the constitutional, statutory, and common law rights of \ninmates in the Jail’s care and custody. Defendants created, approved or knowingly acquiesced in a \npolicy, custom and/or practice under which constitutional, statutory and common law violations \noccurred, and/or promulgated operating policies and procedures either formally or by custom and \npractice which violate the constitutional, statutory, and common law rights of inmates in the Jail’s \ncare and custody and after their release. Defendants’ conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, \nand was indicative not only of deliberate indifference to, but active malice and a total and reckless \ndisregard for the constitutional, statutory, and common law rights of Plaintiff and the class, \njustifying an award of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiff and the \nclass are entitled to recover. \nV.  Class Action \n8.  Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23.01, et seq. of the \nKentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.  The class consists of all persons admitted to, incarcerated in, or \nreleased from the Jail who have been charged the costs of their confinement without an order of a \nsentencing court requiring that they reimburse the county for expenses incurred by reason of such \nperson’s confinement. \n- 3 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 4 of 10 - Page ID#: 4\n9.  Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all class members.  He is a \nmember of the class and his claims are typical of the claims of all class members.  Plaintiff will \naggressively pursue the interests of the entirety of the class.  Plaintiff’s interest in obtaining \ninjunctive relief and actual, special, consequential and punitive damages for the violations of his \nstatutory and common law rights and privileges are consistent with and not antagonistic of those of \nany other person within his class. \n10.  Given the events which transpired upon his admission to, incarceration at, and release \nfrom the Jail, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have a policy, custom and/or practice of charging all \npersons admitted to the Jail the costs of their confinement without an order of a sentencing court \nrequiring that they reimburse the county for expenses incurred by reason of such person’s \nconfinement, and irrespective of such person’s innocence of the charges for which they were \nconfined.   \n11.  Such conduct violates the rights of persons as to whom there exists no order of a \nsentencing court requiring that they reimburse the county for expenses incurred by reason of such \nperson’s confinement.  The only question that remains to be resolved is whether Plaintiff and the \nmembers  of  the  class  are  entitled  to  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  and  to  an  award  of \ncompensatory and punitive damages and, if so, the extent of such an award. \n12.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy because: \na.  A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the Court and Defendants \nshould be avoided; \n \nb.  It may be virtually impossible for all class members to intervene as parties-\nplaintiff in this action; and \n \nc.  Upon adjudication of Defendants’ liability, claims of the class members can \nbe determined by this Court. \n- 4 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 5 of 10 - Page ID#: 5\nVI.  Facts \n13.  KRS 441.265 provides in relevant part that:   \n a.  A prisoner in a county jail shall be required by the sentencing court to \nreimburse the county for expenses incurred by reason of the prisoner's confinement \nas set out in this section, except for good cause shown. \n   \n   b.  The jailer may adopt, with the approval of the county's governing \nbody, a prisoner fee and expense reimbursement policy, which may include, but \nnot be limited to, the following:  \n    i.   An administrative processing or booking fee;  \n    ii.   A per diem for room and board of not more than fifty \n  dollars  ($50) per day or the actual per diem cost, whichever is less, for the \n  entire period of time the prisoner is confined to the jail;  \n    iii.   Actual charges for medical and dental treatment; and  \n  iv.   Reimbursement for county property damaged or any injury \n  caused  by the prisoner while confined to the jail. \n \n c.  Rates charged may be adjusted in accordance with the fee and \nexpense reimbursement policy based upon the ability of the prisoner confined to the \njail to pay, giving consideration to any legal obligation of the prisoner to support a \nspouse, minor children, or other dependents. The prisoner's interest in any jointly \nowned property and the income, assets, earnings, or other property owned by the \nprisoner's spouse or family shall not be used to determine a prisoner's ability to pay. \n \n d.  Payment of any required fees may be automatically deducted from the \nprisoner's property or canteen account. \n \n  14.  Nothing  in  KRS  441.265  permits  a  jail  to  charge  anyone  the  costs  of  their \nconfinement absent a court order, or without such person’s consent, or without consideration of such \nperson’s support obligations or need for such funds to pay for more pressing obligations (such as \nrent, electricity, water, medicine, etc.), or without regard to such person’s guilt of the offense for \nwhich they were arrested or are detained pending trial, or without an accounting of funds collected, \nretained and returned, or without regard to the consequences of such action.  The legislative history \nof KRS 441.265 shows that the statute was enacted only after it was amended to deny counties the \nright to withhold such monies, and to require an order of a sentencing court.     \n- 5 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 6 of 10 - Page ID#: 6\n15.  Plaintiff was arrested and admitted to the Jail on October 26, 2013.  He remained \nthere until his release on December 15, 2014.  On April 2, 2015, all the charges for which Plaintiff \nwas incarcerated were dismissed because Plaintiff had proved he was entirely innocent of such \noffenses. \n16.  After Plaintiff’s release from the Jail, he received a written demand from the Jail that \nhe pay more than $4000.00 for the costs of his confinement. Plaintiff has paid $20.00 toward the \nasserted debt, but on advice of counsel will pay no more. \nVII.  Causes of Action  \nA.  Count I \n17.  Paragraphs 1-16 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n17. \n18.  Plaintiff’s and the class’ treatment by Defendants is the result of a continuing pattern \nof misconduct and is the result of policies, procedures, customs and practices of Defendants, either \nwritten or unwritten, that are systematically applied to all persons admitted to, incarcerated in, and/or \nreleased from the Jail, pursuant to which persons like Plaintiff are deprived of their property without \ndue process of law, in violation of the due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, and are \nsubjected to unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment, all in \nviolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. §1983. Such practices constitute an arbitrary use \nof government power, and evince a total, intentional and unreasonable disregard for and deliberate \nindifference to the constitutional, state and common law rights of persons in the Jail’s care and \ncustody, or who have been released from the Jail, including Plaintiff and the members of the class, \nand the wholesale violations of those rights likely to result from the systematic pursuit of such \npolicies, customs and practices. \n- 6 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 7 of 10 - Page ID#: 7\n19.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff and the class, through Defendants’ intentional or \ngrossly negligent conduct, bad faith and deliberate indifference to their rights, were deprived of their \nproperty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and were subjected \nto an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nall in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. §1983. \nB.  Count II \n20.  Paragraphs 1-19 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n20. \n21.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants were negligent and grossly negligent, all to the \ndamage of the Plaintiffs and the class. \nC.  Count III \n22.  Paragraphs 1-21 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n22. \n23.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants engaged in a conspiracy to wrongfully deprive \nPlaintiff and the class of their property, all to the damage of Plaintiff and the class. \nD.  Count IV \n  24.  Paragraphs 1-23 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n24. \n  25.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants converted the property of the Plaintiffs and the \nclass. \nE.  Count V \n  26.  Paragraphs 1-25 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n26. \n- 7 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 8 of 10 - Page ID#: 8\n  27.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs and the \nclass of their property.  \nF.  Count VI \n  28.  Paragraphs 1-27 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n28. \n  29.  By virtue of the foregoing, Plaintiff and the class seek restitution in equity of all cash \nand checks seized and retained by Defendants without any order of a sentencing court. \nG.  Count VII \n  30.  Paragraphs 1-29 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n30. \n  31.  If KRS 441.265 can properly be interpreted to permit all or any part of Defendants’ \npractice of confiscating and keeping cash and checks in the possession of persons admitted to the Jail \nwithout any requirement of a sentencing court, and/or any adjudication of whether such persons are \neven guilty or innocent of the charges leading to their arrest, and/or any adequate and meaningful \nopportunity to object to or challenge such practice, among other things, such statute violates due \nprocess, constitutes an unreasonable seizure and excessive fine, is unconstitutional, violates the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 1, 2, 10 and 17 of \nthe Kentucky Constitution, and Plaintiffs request that the Court declare it so and permanently enjoin \nits operation and implementation. \nVIII.  Damages \n32.  Paragraphs 1-31 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n32. \n- 8 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 9 of 10 - Page ID#: 9\n33.  As a consequence of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, Plaintiff and the members of the \nclass have been wrongfully deprived of their property, in violation of the Plaintiff’s and the class’ \nconstitutional, statutory, and common law rights.   \n34.  As a result, Plaintiff and the members of the class are entitled to recover all actual, \nconsequential  and  special  damages  arising  from  the  conduct  of  Defendants.    Furthermore, \nDefendants’ violations of the constitutional, statutory, and common law rights of the Plaintiff and the \nclass were knowing, intentional, malicious and evinced a total and reckless disregard for the rights of \nPlaintiff and the class, entitling them to recover punitive damages from Defendants in order to deter \nsuch conduct in the future. \nIX.  Declaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n35.  Paragraphs 1-34  above are incorporated herein by reference and made this Paragraph \n35. \n36.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiff and the class request that this Court issue a \ndeclaratory judgment and injunction enjoining Defendants from any further pursuit of policies, \nprocedures, customs or practices which resulted in persons being charged for the costs of their \nconfinement absent an order of a sentencing court requiring that they reimburse the county for \nexpenses incurred by reason of such person’s confinement.. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the class he represents request (a) that this action proceed as a \nclass action under Rules 23.01, et seq., of the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure; and (b) that they \nand all members of the class (i) be granted the declaratory and injunctive relief requested herein, (ii) \nbe awarded actual, consequential, special and punitive damages, and (iii) be awarded all costs, \nattorney fees, pre- and post-judgment interest and all other relief to which they are entitled. \n \n- 9 - \n\nCase: 5:15-cv-00350-JMH   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/30/15   Page: 10 of 10 - Page ID#: 10\n            Respectfully submitted,  \n \n            /s/ Gregory A.

[DE  4].  \nPlaintiff having filed a response [DE 5], and Defendants having \nreplied in further support of their motion [DE 8], this matter is \nripe for decision.  For the following reasons, the Court will grant \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss.   \nI.   \nPlaintiff brings this putative class action complaint against \nDefendants Clark County, Kentucky and Clark County Jailer, Frank \nDoyle,  individually,  on  behalf  of  all  persons  who,  while \nincarcerated in the Clark County Detention Center (the “Jail”), \nwere wrongfully assessed fees for their incarceration without due \nprocess of law.  Plaintiff alleges that charging persons admitted \nto the Jail for the costs of their incarceration without an order \nof  a  sentencing  court,  including  those  individuals  who  are \nsubsequently proven innocent, violates KRS 441.265 and the due \n\nprocess rights of Plaintiff and putative class members under the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  Plaintiff \nasserts state law claims for conspiracy, negligence, conversion, \nfraud, and violations of the Kentucky Constitution.  Plaintiff \nalso seeks a declaration that KRS 441.265 is unconstitutional and \na return of all monies paid to Defendants.   \n  Plaintiff Jones avers that he was arrested and admitted to \nthe Jail on October 26, 2013, where he remained incarcerated until \nhis release on December 15, 2014.  Plaintiff further maintains \nthat on April 2, 2015, the charges for which he was incarcerated \nwere dismissed upon Plaintiff proving his innocence.  After being \nreleased from the Jail, Plaintiff states that he received a written \ndemand from the Jail to pay in excess of $4,000.00 in fees relating \nto his incarceration in the Jail.  Plaintiff alleges that, to date, \nhe has paid $20.00 of the bill, but on the advice of counsel, \nrefuses to pay the remaining balance.   \n  Defendants  move  to  dismiss  Plaintiff’s  claims  in  their \nentirety pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted.   \nII.   \nA  motion  to  dismiss  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure  12(b)(6)  tests  the  sufficiency  of  the  plaintiff’s \ncomplaint.  If the plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which \n2 \n \n\nrelief can be granted, a court may grant the motion to dismiss.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Rule 8(a)(2) states that, at a minimum, \na pleading should contain “a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”   Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2).  In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), \nthe  Supreme  Court  explained  that  in  order  to  survive  a  Rule \n12(b)(6),  a  complaint  need  not  contain  “detailed  factual \nallegations,” but must present something more than “labels and \nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause \nof action’s elements will not do.”  Id. at 555.   \nAlthough a court must accept as true all of the well-pleaded \nfactual allegations contained in the complaint, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570), courts \nare not bound to accept conclusory allegations as true.  Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 555 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265 (1986)). \nThe factual allegations in a complaint “must be enough to raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that \nall the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in \nfact).”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56 (citations omitted).  Under \nthis standard, only a claim which is “plausible on its face” will \nsurvive dismissal. Id. at 570; Tam Travel, Inc. v. Delta Airlines, \nInc., 583 F.3d 896, 903 (6th Cir. 2009).  “A claim is plausible \nwhen it contains facts that allow the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.”   \n3 \n \n\nAshcroft, 556 U.S. at 678.  If it appears beyond doubt that the \nplaintiff’s complaint does not state facts sufficient to “state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face,” then the claims \nmust be dismissed.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 at 570; Weisbarth v. \nGeauga Park Dist., 499 F.3d 538, 542 (6th Cir. 2007).   \nIII.    \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 Claims \nIn his Complaint, Plaintiff asserts claims under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 for alleged violations of his Fourteenth Amendment rights \nunder the United States Constitution.1  Section 1983 provides a \nprivate cause of action against those who, under color of state \nlaw, violate a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the \nUnited States.  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  A plaintiff may bring a § 1983 \nclaim against persons in their individual or official capacity, or \nagainst a governmental entity.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, \n168 (1985).   \nTo establish a procedural due process claim under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he was deprived of a \nlife,  liberty  or  property  interest  secured  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution by the state, and (2) \nthe state did not afford adequate procedural rights prior to the \ndeprivation of the protected interest.  U.S. Const. amend. XIV; \n                     \n1 Because Plaintiff does not object to the dismissal of his Fourth Amendment \nclaim, see Plaintiff’s Response to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 1, the Court \ndeclines to address this claim and will dismiss it accordingly.   \n4 \n \n\nsee also Ky. Dept. of Corr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989); \nHahn v. Star Bank, 190 F.3d 708, 716 (6th Cir. 1999).  Absent \neither element, the § 1983 claim fails.  Thompson, 490 U.S. at \n460.   \nThe law is clear that individuals have a property interest in \ntheir own money.  Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. \n564, 571–73 (1972).  Thus, assuming Plaintiff has been deprived of \nhis  money,2  as  a  threshold  matter,  Plaintiff  must  plead  an \nunderlying constitutional violation to state a claim for relief \npursuant to § 1983, that is, that the state did not afford adequate \nprocedural  rights  prior  to  the  deprivation  of  his  protected \ninterest.  Therefore, the initial question before the Court is \nwhether charging inmates a fee for their incarceration without an \norder from a sentencing court, as Plaintiff alleges is required by \nKRS 441.265, and even though an inmate later proves his innocence, \namounts  to  a  violation  of  procedural  due  process  under  the \nFourteenth  Amendment.  KRS  441.265  provides  in  its  entirety  as \nfollows: \n                     \n2 In other similar cases involving the constitutionality of jail fees within \nthe Sixth Circuit, the fees were automatically deducted from the inmates’ \ncanteen accounts.  Hodge v. Grayson Cty., No. 4:07-cv-P60-M, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 32295 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 17, 2008); Harper v. Oldham Cty., No. 3:10-cv-P735-\nS, 2011 WL 1399771 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 13, 2011); Whitaker v. Thornton, No. 3:13-\ncv-P859-M, 2014 WL 585323 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 14, 2014); Cole v. Warren Cty., No. \n1:11-CV-00189, 2012 WL 1950419 (W.D. Ky. May 30, 2012).  Here, unlike in the \npreviously  cited  cases,  Jones  was  billed  after  his  release  rather  than \nautomatically debited while incarcerated.   \n5 \n \n\nRequired  reimbursement  by  prisoner  of  costs  of \nconfinement; local policy of fee and expense rates; \nbilling and collection methods. \n(1) A prisoner in a county jail shall be required by \nthe  sentencing  court  to  reimburse  the  county  for \nexpenses  incurred  by  reason  of  the  prisoner's \nconfinement as set out in this section, except for \ngood cause shown. \n(2) (a) The jailer may adopt, with the approval of the \ncounty's governing body, a prisoner fee and expense \nreimbursement policy, which may include, but not be \nlimited to, the following: \n1.  An administrative processing or booking fee; \n2.  A per diem for room and board of not more than \nfifty dollars ($50) per day or the actual per \ndiem cost, whichever is less, for the entire \nperiod of time the prisoner is confined to the \njail; \n \n3.  Actual  charges  for  medical  and  dental \ntreatment; and \n \n4.  Reimbursement for county property damaged or \nany  injury  caused  by  the  prisoner  while \nconfined to the jail. \n(b) Rates charged may be adjusted in accordance with \nthe fee and expense reimbursement policy based upon \nthe ability of the prisoner confined to the jail to \npay, giving consideration to any legal obligation of \nthe prisoner to support a spouse, minor children, or \nother  dependents.  The  prisoner's  interest  in  any \njointly  owned  property  and  the  income,  assets, \nearnings, or other property owned by the prisoner's \nspouse  or  family  shall  not  be  used  to  determine  a \nprisoner's ability to pay. \n(3) The jailer or his designee may bill and attempt to \ncollect  any  amount  owed  which  remains  unpaid.  The \ngoverning body of the county may, upon the advice of \nthe  jailer,  contract  with  one  (1)  or  more  public \nagencies or private vendors to perform this billing \nand collection. Within twelve (12) months after the \ndate of the prisoner's release from confinement, the \n6 \n \n\ncounty attorney, jailer, or the jailer's designee, may \nfile a civil action to seek reimbursement from that \nprisoner for any amount owed which remains unpaid. \n(4)  Any  fees  or  reimbursement  received  under  this \nsection shall be forwarded to the county treasurer for \nplacement in the jail's budget. \n(5) The governing body of the county may require a \nprisoner who is confined in the county jail to pay a \nreasonable  fee,  not  exceeding  actual  cost,  for  any \nmedical treatment or service received by the prisoner. \nHowever, no prisoner confined in the jail shall be \ndenied any necessary medical care because of inability \nto pay. \n(6) Payment of any required fees may be automatically \ndeducted  from  the  prisoner's  property  or  canteen \naccount. If the prisoner has no funds in his account, \na deduction may be made creating a negative balance. \nIf funds become available or if the prisoner reenters \nthe jail at a later date, the fees may be deducted \nfrom the prisoner's property or canteen account. \n(7) Prior to the prisoner's release, the jailer or his \ndesignee may work with the confined prisoner to create \na  reimbursement  plan  to  be  implemented  upon  the \nprisoner's  release.  At  the  end  of  the  prisoner's \nincarceration, the prisoner shall be presented with a \nbilling statement produced by the jailer or designee. \nAfter  the  prisoner's  release,  the  jailer  or  his \ndesignee  may,  after  negotiation  with  the  prisoner, \nrelease the prisoner from all or part of the prisoner's \nrepayment obligation if the jailer believes that the \nprisoner will be unable to pay the full amount due. \n(8) No per diem shall be charged to any prisoner who \nis required to pay a work release fee pursuant to KRS \n439.179, a prisoner that has been ordered to pay a \nreimbursement  fee  by  the  court  pursuant  to  KRS \n534.045,  or  that  the  Department  of  Corrections  is \nfinancially responsible for housing. \n(9) No medical reimbursement, except that provided for \nin KRS 441.045, shall be charged to any prisoner that \nthe  Department  of  Corrections  is  financially \nresponsible for housing. \n \n7 \n \n\nThe  precise  question  before  the  Court  was  examined  and \nanswered in the negative by Judge Bertelsman in Sickles v. Campbell \nCounty, which decision the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  Sickles v. \nCampbell Cty., 439 F. Supp. 2d 751, 755 (E.D. Ky. 2006) aff'd, 501 \nF.3d 726 (6th Cir. 2007).  In Sickles, the money that pretrial \ndetainees had on their person was confiscated upon detention and \nplaced in canteen accounts, in addition to any money provided by \nrelatives or friends, and the canteen accounts were debited a fee \nfor booking and a per diem fee for housing.  Sickles, 439 F. Supp. \n2d at 755.  Looking to KRS 411.265(6) (which provides for the \nautomatic deduction of fees from a prisoner’s account) and the \ndefinition of “prisoner” in KRS 441.005(3)(c)3 (which includes not \njust convicted individuals, but any person confined and charged \nwith an offense), Judge Bertelsman held that “the correct reading \nof [KRS 441.265] is that the fees may be imposed as soon as the \nprisoner is booked into the jail and may be periodically deducted \nfrom  the  prisoner’s  account  as  provided  by  local  regulation.”  \nSickles, 439 F. Supp. 2d at 755.  The Court further concluded that \n“[s]ince the statute is valid, the inmate owes fees that begin to \naccrue immediately upon his or her being booked into the jail.”  \nId.    The  reference  to  “sentencing  court”  in  KRS  411.265(1), \n                     \n3 “Prisoner” is defined as “any person confined in jail pursuant to any code, \nordinance, law, or statute of any unit of government and who is: (a) Charged \nwith or convicted of an offense; or (b) Held for extradition or as a material \nwitness; or (c) Confined for any other reason.” KRS § 441.005(3). \n8 \n \n\naccording to Judge Bertelsman, is to allow the court to impose a \njudgment for any deficiency at sentencing which was not defrayed \nby automatic deduction.  Id.   \n  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s \ndecision, stating as follows:  \nMay a municipal jail, consistent with the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, withhold a portion \nof an inmate’s canteen-account in order to cover the \ncosts of booking, room and board without providing the \ninmate with a hearing before it withholds the money.  \nYes, we hold, and accordingly we affirm the district \ncourt’s rejection of this claim and two others.  \n \nSickles v. Campbell County, 501 F. 3d 726, 728 (6th Cir. 2007).   \nAnalyzing the jail’s practice of imposing fees in light of the \nMathews v. Eldridge balancing test,4 the Sixth Circuit explained \nthat a predeprivation hearing was not required because: (1) the \nprivate interests at stake are “small in absolute and relative \nterms”; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation is minor; (3) the \npotential  benefits  of  additional  safeguards,5  including  a \n                     \n4 In considering a due process claim, the Supreme Court has outlined three \nfactors that courts must balance when determining what procedural process is \nowed, and when that process is due: (1) the private interest that will be \naffected by the official action; [2] the risk of an erroneous deprivation of \nsuch interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of \nadditional  or  substitute  procedural  safeguards;  and  [3]  the  Government's \ninterest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative \nburdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.  \nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). \n \n5 The grievance procedures available in Sickles included the fact that the \ninmates had notice of the collection fee procedures and of the inmates’ rules \nand rights.  Sickles, 439 F. Supp. 2d 751 (E.D. Ky. 2006) aff'd, 501 F.3d 726 \n(6th Cir. 2007).   \n9 \n \n\npredeprivation  hearing,  are  few;  and  (4)  the  government’s \ninterests — sharing the costs of incarceration and further offender \naccountability — are substantial.  Id. at 731 (citing Mathews, 424 \nU.S. 319 (1976)).   \nThe Court finds that none of the Mathews v. Eldridge factors \nas applied here distinguish Plaintiff’s case from Sickles.  As to \nthe first prong of Mathews, Plaintiff argues that the amount of \nmoney at stake exceeds the amount at issue in Sickles.  However, \nPlaintiff has only been deprived of the $20.00 he has paid to \nDefendants, which is comparable to the amount of money at stake in \nSickles.  Sickles, 501 F.3d at 730.  There is no allegation that \nDefendants  have  taken  any  additional  action  to  collect  the \nremaining balance from Plaintiff other than sending him the initial \nbill.   \nLooking to the second prong, as in Sickles, there is a minor \nrisk of erroneous deprivation as the withholding of funds involves \nelementary accounting with little risk of error.  Id. at 730-31.    \nAs Plaintiff alleges, the Jail’s incarceration fee policy is non-\ndiscretionary as it applies to all persons confined in the Jail.  \nMoreover, because Plaintiff was billed after being released, the \nrisk of erroneous deprivation is arguably less than in Sickles \nwhere the plaintiffs were automatically debited while confined.  \nThe Court also finds the process set forth in KRS 441.265(3), which \nstates that counties may file a civil action against a released \n10 \n \n\nprisoner  to  collect  any  amount  owed  which  remains  unpaid,  to \nconstitute an adequate safeguard given the nature and weight of \nthe private interests at stake.  An additional protection, per KRS \n441.265(7), is the opportunity for prisoners to negotiate with the \njailer to be released from all or part of the repayment obligation, \nexist.  Notably, as in Sickles, there is no allegation by Plaintiff \nthat  he  challenged  his  repayment  obligation  through  these \ngrievance procedures nor an allegation that these procedures would \nbe ineffective in protecting his due process rights.  Id. at 731; \nParratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 543–44 (1981), rev'd on other \ngrounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986)).  As to the \nthird  Mathews  factor  —  the  government's  interest  —  this  Court \nfinds, as others have found, that the government's interest in \n“sharing  the  costs  of  incarceration  and  furthering  offender \naccountability ... are substantial.”  Sickles, 501 F.3d at 732.   \n  Plaintiff argues his case is distinguishable from Sickles on \nthe basis that he has proven his innocence, yet was billed for \nincarceration fees, whereas in Sickles, there is no indication \nwhether  any  of  the  plaintiffs  therein  were  subsequently  found \nguilty  or  innocent.    However,  the  Sixth  Circuit  addressed  and \nrejected this argument in Sickles when it stated “to say that a \nsentencing court must do one thing (requiring reimbursement even \nafter the inmate's release) is not to say that another government \nentity (the county jail) may not do another (collecting room-and-\n11 \n \n\nboard fees from inmates while they remain in jail).”  Sickles, 501 \nF. 3d at 732.  In other words, as this Court explained, “[i]f \nsubsection (6) of [KRS 441.265] (which permits the fees to be \n“automatically deducted from the prisoner's property or canteen \naccount,”) is to be given any meaning, imposition of the fees \ncannot be delayed until sentencing.  […] [T]he statutes contemplate \nimposition  of  the  fees  whether  or  not  the  inmate  is  ever \nsentenced.”  Sickles, 439 F. Supp. 2d at 755.  Thus, if automatic \ncollection of fees can occur without regard to the inmate being \nsentenced pursuant to Sickles, an inmate’s conviction is not a \nprerequisite  to  the  charging  and  imposing  of  fees  under  KRS \n441.265.  For this reason, Plaintiff’s attempt to distinguish his \ncase  from  Sickles  fails.    Without  any  contrary  support  for \nPlaintiff’s  interpretation  of  KRS  441.265,  this  Court  finds \nSickles to be controlling.  Sickles, 439 F. Supp. 2d 751 (E.D. Ky. \n2006) aff'd, 501 F.3d 726 (6th Cir. 2007).6   \nThe Court also finds persuasive the decisions of the United \nStates District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, which \n                     \n6 In further support of their argument that the order of a sentencing court is \nnot required to impose fees on an inmate pursuant to KRS 441.265, Defendants \ncite Cole v. Warren Cty., 2015 Ky. App. LEXIS 157 (Ky. App. Nov. 13, 2015), \nwherein the Court of Appeals of Kentucky interpreted KRS 441.265 “unambiguously \npermits the exact practice used by the [Warren County Jail]” of automatically \ndeducting fees without the order from a sentencing court.  However, recognizing \nthat this decision is currently being appealed and, therefore, has not been \nconclusively ruled on by the Kentucky Supreme Court, we give some weight, rather \nthan controlling weight, to the Court of Appeals decision.  Rutherford v. \nColumbia Gas, 575 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir. 2009).  The Court also looks to the \ndecisions of the federal courts within the Sixth Circuit cited herein to help \npredict how the state’s highest court will interpret KRS 441.265.  Id.  \n12 \n \n\nhave followed Sickles and agreed that the billing and collection \nof fees pursuant to KRS 441.265 does not violate the Due Process \nClause when analyzing nearly identical claims to those raised in \nthe instant case.  See Hodge v. Grayson Cty., No. 4:07-cv-P60, \n2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32295 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 17, 2008); Harper v. \nOldham Cty., No. 3:10-cv-P735, 2011 WL 1399771 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 13, \n2011); Whitaker v. Thornton, No. 3:13-cv-P859, 2014 WL 585323 (W.D. \nKy. Feb. 14, 2014); Cole v. Warren Cty., No. 1:11-CV-00189, 2012 \nWL 1950419 (W.D. Ky. May 30, 2012).7  For the same reasons stated \nabove  with  respect  to  Sickles,  the  Court  rejects  Plaintiff’s \nargument that these cases are inapplicable because the majority of \nthe plaintiffs therein were convicted inmates.  In Harper, the \nWestern  District  of  Kentucky  explicitly  recognized  that  one \nplaintiff was a pretrial detainee while the other was a convicted \ninmate,  but  proceeded  to  make  no  further  distinction  in  its \nanalysis regarding conviction status and ultimately concluded that \n“the case law in this circuit is clear that the Oldham County Jail \nwas  not  required  to  provide  Plaintiffs  with  a  predeprivation \nhearing  before  assessing  the  per  diem  fees.    As  such,  their \nFourteenth  Amendment  procedural  due  process  rights  were  not \nviolated.”  Harper, 2011 WL 1399771 at *6.  The Sixth Circuit \n                     \n7 The Court also notes that the Third and Fourth Circuits have held that the \ncollection of fees from arrestees without a predeprivation hearing does not \nviolate due process.  See Tillman v. Lebanon Cnty. Corr. Facility, 221 F.3d 410 \n(3d Cir. 2000); Slade v. Hampton Roads Reg'l Jail, 407 F.3d 243 (4th Cir. 2005).  \n13 \n \n\naffirmed, acknowledging plaintiff’s argument that jail fees should \nnot apply to a pretrial detainee who had not been convicted of an \noffense, but failing to find plaintiff’s conviction status as a \ndistinguishing factor from Sickles. Harper v. Oldham Cty. Jail, \n2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 26511 (6th Cir. Dec. 15, 2011).  \nAs alleged in the Complaint, Plaintiff was a “prisoner” within \nthe definition of KRS 441.005(3) (i.e. a “person confined in jail \npursuant to any code, ordinance, law, or statute of any unit of \ngovernment” who was “(a)charged with an offense” or “(c) confined \nfor any other reason”), therefore, this Court holds that it was \nnot unconstitutional to impose fees on Plaintiff without the order \nof a sentencing court and despite the fact that he later proved \nhis innocence.  For all of the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s \n§ 1983 claim for the alleged violation of his Fourteenth Amendment \nrights fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, \nand accordingly, Plaintiff’s § 1983 claim will be dismissed. \nInterpretation of KRS 441.265 \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants have misconstrued and \nviolated KRS 441.265 by, in part, not requiring the order of a \nsentencing court before imposing fees on a prisoner.  Plaintiff \nargues  that  the  Court  must  look  to  the  statute’s  legislative \nhistory, which would reveal that the statute “was amended prior to \nits enactment specifically to reposit such power in the sentencing \ncourt.”  [DE 5 at 3].  As discussed herein, the Court disagrees \n14 \n \n\nwith  Plaintiff’s  interpretation  that  KRS  441.265  is  ambiguous, \ntherefore, it would be improper to refer to the legislative history \nof the statute.  Sickles, in addition to other persuasive precedent \nwithin the Sixth Circuit, with which this Court agrees, hold that \nthe order of a sentencing court is not required by KRS 441.265.  \nSickles, 439 F. Supp. 2d 751, 755 (E.D. Ky. 2006) aff'd, 501 F.3d \n726 (6th Cir. 2007); Hodge, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32295 (W.D. Ky. \nApr. 17, 2008); Harper, 2011 WL 1399771 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 13, 2011); \nWhitaker v, 2014 WL 585323 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 14, 2014); Cole, 2012 WL \n1950419 (W.D. Ky. May 30, 2012).  Nevertheless, even if Defendants \nwere  misapplying  and  violating  KRS  441.265,  because  the \nmisapplication does not result in a violation of Plaintiff’s due \nprocess rights, Plaintiff may not prevail on his § 1983 claim.  \nHodge, 2008 WL 1805505, at *4 (citing Sickles, 501 F.3d at 732).   \nSubstantive Due Process \n  To the extent Plaintiff may also be alleging a substantive \ndue process violation, he must assert either the “denial of a \nright,  privilege,  or  immunity  secured  by  the  Constitution  or \nfederal statute other than [a] procedural claim,” or an official \nact which “shocks the conscience.”  Mertik v. Blalock, 983 F.2d \n1353, 1367–68 (6th Cir. 1993).  Conduct that violates substantive \ndue  process  is  “‘conduct  intended  to  injure  in  some  way \nunjustifiable by any government interest.’”  Mitchell v. McNeil, \n487 F.3d 374, 377 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Cty. of Sacramento v. \n15 \n \n\nLewis,  523  U.S.  833,  849  (1998)).  The  “shocks  the  conscience” \nstandard is difficult to satisfy, as noted in Lewis, supra, 523 \nU.S. at 846 (internal citation omitted): “only the most egregious \nofficial conduct can be said to be ‘arbitrary in the constitutional \nsense.’”  If the government action does not shock the conscience, \nthat action does not violate substantive due process so long as it \nis rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  Valot v. \nSoutheast Local Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 107 F.3d 1220, 1228 (6th \nCir. 1993). \nBecause Plaintiff pleads no facts that rise to the level of \na substantive due process violation, that is, Defendants’ action \nin  collecting  jail  fees  does  not  “shock  the  conscience,”  and \nbecause  recouping  costs  from  inmates  is  a  legitimate  state \ninterest, any claim alleging a substantive due process violation \nis hereby dismissed.   \nState Law Claims \nPlaintiff has also alleged state law claims against  \nDefendants  for  negligence  (Count  II),  civil  conspiracy  (Count \nIII), conversion (Count IV), fraud (Count V), restitution in equity \n(Count VI), and violations of the Kentucky Constitution (Count \nVII).  Defendants contend that because Plaintiff’s claims pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983 fail to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted, this Court should decline jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s \nstate law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1367(c).   \n16 \n \n\nSection  1367(c)  of  Title  28  of  the  United  States  Code \nprovides, in pertinent part, as follows: “The district courts may \ndecline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim ... if \n... the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has \noriginal jurisdiction.”  28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).  Here, given that \nthe remaining claims are state law claims, and that this case is \nin  its  infancy,  the  Court  finds  that  the  balance  of  judicial \neconomy, convenience, fairness, and comity direct the Court to \ndecline  to  exercise  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  Plaintiff’s \nstate  law  claims.    Accordingly,  Plaintiffs'  pendent  state-law \nclaims will be dismissed without prejudice.  \nDeclaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief \nIn his ninth cause of action, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory \njudgment  and  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from  “any  further \npursuit  of  policies,  procedures,  customs  or  practices  which \nresulted  in  persons  being  charged  for  the  costs  of  their \nconfinement absent an order of a sentencing court requiring that \nthey reimburse the county for expenses incurred by reason of such \nperson’s confinement.”  [DE 1 at 9].  Since Plaintiff has not \nadequately pleaded his substantive claims as set forth above, the \ncourt has no basis upon which to issue declaratory relief, and \ntherefore,  Plaintiff’s  claim  seeking  a  declaratory  judgment  is \ndismissed.    Int'l  Ass'n  of  Machinists  &  Aerospace  Workers  v. \nTennessee  Valley  Auth.,  108  F.3d  658,  668  (6th  Cir.  1997).  \n17 \n \n\nSimilarly, because Plaintiff cannot establish that in the absence \nof an injunction, he or anyone else will suffer irreparable harm \nwith no remedy at law, an injunction is not appropriate here.   \nConclusion \nFor the reasons articulated above, Plaintiff has failed to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Accordingly, IT \nIS HEREBY ORDERED that:  \n(1)  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [DE 4] is GRANTED; \n(2)  All claims alleged in the Complaint [DE 1] against all  \nDefendants are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE; \n(3)  All pending motions or requests for relief are DENIED AS  \nMOOT; \n(4)  All deadlines and scheduled proceedings are CONTINUED  \nGENERALLY; \n(5)  That the Clerk shall STRIKE THIS MATTER FROM THE ACTIVE  \nDOCKET; \n(6)  That this Order is a FINAL AND APPEABLE ORDER and THERE  \nIS NO JUST CAUSE FOR DELAY. \n  This the 11th day of March, 2016.  \n \n  \n \n \n18 \n \n\n \n19 \n ",
