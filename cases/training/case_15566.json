    "summary": "<p>The plaintiffs originally filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky on December 12, 2011. The court dismissed the case on May 30, 2012, holding that the Jail’s seizure policy did not violate due process. Cole v. Warren County, 2012 WL 1950419 (W.D.Ky. 2012). The court declined to rule on whether the policy violated Kentucky law, so in 2012, the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in the state court to address state law claims.  </p><p>The plaintiffs were three former inmates of the Warren County Jail. They filed a lawsuit against the Warren County, Kentucky, and the South Central Bank of Bowling Green under state law and the Uniform Commercial Code, alleging that checks made payable to them were improperly confiscated and the funds were illegally deposited at the Bank and kept by the Jail for costs associated with their confinement. In sum, the plaintiffs argued that when they were arrested, checks they had in their possession were confiscated by the Jail. After deducting the amount related to fees for booking, processing, and housing, the Jail deposited the balance with the Bank.</p><p>The plaintiffs sought to recover all actual, consequential, and special damages arising from the Jail’s and Bank’s conduct, including the sums of all checks that were wrongfully accepted by the Bank and deposited into the Jail’s inmates accounts. The plaintiffs also sought punitive damages and a declaratory judgment permanently ordering the Jail and the Bank to cease the allegedly illegal practice. The plaintiffs also filed a motion requesting the Warren Circuit Court to certify a class consisting of \"all persons admitted to the Jail since December 12, 2006.\"</p><p>Both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. On May 2, 2014, the Warren Circuit Court held that the Jail’s policy of confiscating cash and checks without first obtaining authorization by a sentencing court was lawful. Still, the court held that both the Jail and the Bank violated the UCC by negotiating unendorsed checks, and that the Bank was liable to the inmates for paying checks without the inmates' authorization. Consequently, the court enjoined the Jail and the Bank from illegally endorsing and depositing such checks. However, the court denied the claim for damages, holding that the plaintiffs either benefited from the deposited funds or were refunded in the proper amount. Finally, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class action, because (i) the plaintiffs lacked standing for monetary damages against the Bank, (ii) the plaintiffs’ claims were not typical of the claims of the proposed class, (iii) the proposed class composition was too broad, and (iv) certifying the class would require an individualized inquiry into which individuals had unendorsed checks deposited, defeating the purpose of a class action.</p><p>The Warren Circuit Court denied the plaintiffs’ motions to alter, amend or vacate or to amend the initial complaint to raise constitutional issues not previously raised. The plaintiffs then filed an appeal against these denials, arguing that the court had improperly interpreted the state law, and the Jail should not be permitted to seize cash and checks in the possession of prisoners without an order from a sentencing court. In the alternative, the plaintiffs argued that the statute was unconstitutional, that they were entitled to damages due to the Jail and Bank’s violation of the UCC, and that class certification was erroneously denied.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Bank cross-appealed the Warren Circuit Court’s holding that the policy of honoring checks made payable to inmates and depositing those funds into the Jail’s account violated the UCC. The Bank argued that its policy of depositing inmate checks into the Jail’s account did not violate the UCC because the Bank had no legal obligation or basis for questioning the Jail’s authority to deposit such checks. In the alternative, the Bank claimed that injunctive relief was improper because a cause of action for monetary damages was the only relief provided for in the UCC, specifically KRS 355.3-420(2).</p><p>On November 13, 2015, the Kentucky Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the trial court’s interpretation of the state law and the legality of the Jail’s procedure of confiscating checks and automatically deducting required fees. However, the opinion reversed the trial court’s order enjoining the Jail and the Bank from continuing to endorse and deposit confiscated inmate checks, and reversed the trial court’s finding that the Bank was liable for conversion. Finally, the opinion affirmed the trial court’s order denying the appellants class certification.</p><p>On December 29, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for discretionary review in the state Supreme Court, but the motion was denied on August 17, 2016. The case is now closed.</p>",

Additionally, the trial court denied the claim for damages and the class certification. The appellate court (i) confirmed the legality of the Jail’s procedure of confiscating checks and\r\nautomatically deducting required fees, (ii) confirmed the order denying class certification, (iii) reversed the trial court’s order enjoining the Jail and the Bank from continuing to endorse and deposit confiscated inmate checks, and (iv) reversed the trial court’s finding that the Bank is liable for conversion.

We must decide primarily whether the Warren Circuit Court \n1 Kentucky Revised Statutes.\n-2-\n\ncorrectly upheld the legality of this procedure.  We hold that the trial court \ncorrectly found in favor of the jail, but erred in its determination that the bank \naccepting the deposited checks may be liable for accepting those checks without \nthe consent of the prisoner payees.\nRonda Keabler, Stuart Cole, and Loren Patterson (“appellants”), on behalf of \nthemselves and all others similarly situated, appeal from two Warren Circuit Court \norders: one denying their motion to alter, amend or vacate the trial court’s January \n6, 2014 order addressing motions for summary judgment and class certification, \nand one denying their motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  The \nSouth Central Bank of Bowling Green, Inc. (“Bank”) cross-appeals the court’s \ngrant of partial summary judgment in favor of appellants.  For the following \nreasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND.\nAppellants, as former prisoners of the Warren County Jail, brought suit \nagainst the Bank and Warren County, Kentucky (“Jail”)2,  alleging that checks \nmade payable to them were improperly confiscated and the funds illegally \ndeposited at the Bank and kept by the Jail for costs associated with their \nconfinement.  The Jail and Bank’s procedure took the following form: money and \nchecks seized or received from detainees were deposited into an inmate account \n2 The county’s judge-executive, Mike Buchanon, the county jailer, Jackie Strode, and Deputy \nJailers Jeff Robbins, Pat Watt, Misse Cooper-Edmonds and Gayle Eston were also named \ndefendants.  In addition to the Bank itself, the appellants also named Chairwoman of the Bank’s \nboard, Ellen Lee Bale, and the Bank President, Tommy Ross, as defendants.  For clarity, the \nWarren County defendants will be referred to collectively as the “Jail” and the Bank defendants \nwill be referred to collectively as the “Bank.”  \n-3-\n\nheld at the Bank; checks made payable to detainees were stamped “For Deposit \nOnly, Warren County Jail, Inmate Account” and deposited at the Bank; the Bank \naccepted the unindorsed checks for deposit; and finally, costs of the prisoner’s \nconfinement were automatically deducted from the account, while any excess \nfunds could be used by the inmate at the jail commissary.   \nAppellant Cole was arrested in October 2003, and the Jail confiscated a $33 \ncheck made out to him, which was deposited with the Bank and credited to Cole’s \ninmate account.  Cole was charged a $20 processing fee, a $20 daily housing fee, \nand a $5 bond fee, leaving his account with a negative $12 balance.  Cole was \nadmitted to the Jail again in March 2009 with two checks made payable to him in \nhis possession, one for $200 and one for $59.55.  Cole’s account was charged with \nthe prior $12 balance plus a $75 booking fee.  At the time of his release, he was \nowed a $172.70 refund and despite being mailed a check for that amount, he never \ncashed it.\nAppellant Patterson was arrested in September 2011 and the Jail confiscated \na check made out to him in the amount of $150.  The Jail deducted $100 as a \nbooking fee, and attempted to deposit the check with the Bank.  However, \nPatterson’s check was returned due to a stop payment order and money was never \ndeducted from the payor’s account.  As a result, Patterson was left with a negative \nbalance of $110 in his inmate account after deduction of a $5 bond fee and a $5 \nhandling fee.  \n-4-\n\nAppellant Keabler alleged that the Jail and Bank illegally deposited the \nfunds from a social security check that was mailed to her while she was \nincarcerated in 2007.  Some of the money from that check went into her inmate \naccount, which she used at the Jail commissary.  The Social Security \nAdministration cut off her benefits once it learned of her incarceration.  \nThe appellants filed suit, making three arguments.  First, the appellants \nalleged that the Jail’s policy of indorsing, cashing, and retaining proceeds from \nchecks without the payee’s knowledge violates Kentucky law.  Next, they claimed \nthat the Bank’s policy of honoring the checks violates Kentucky law.  Third, they \nargued that the Jail’s practice of retaining cash and proceeds from checks, without \nan order from a sentencing court, was in violation of KRS 441.265.  The appellants \nmoved the trial court to certify a class consisting of all persons admitted to the Jail \nsince December 12, 2006.  They sought to recover all actual, consequential, and \nspecial damages arising from the Jail’s and Bank’s conduct; specifically, they \nsought to recover the sums of all checks wrongfully accepted by the Bank and \ndeposited into the Jail’s inmate account.  They further sought punitive damages \nand a declaratory judgment permanently ordering the Jail and Bank to cease the \nallegedly illegal practice.\nThis case was previously dismissed by the United States District Court for \nthe Western District of Kentucky on May 30, 2012.  Cole v. Warren County, 2012 \nWL 1950419 (W.D.Ky. 2012).  The federal court held that the Jail’s seizure policy \ndoes not violate due process because the inmates are not technically deprived of \n-5-\n\ntheir property, since, with the exception of fees deducted by the Jail, the funds are \nalways available to them, and because the inmates are informed of the policy as \nwell as the Jail’s internal grievance procedures.  The court declined to rule on \nwhether the policy violates Kentucky law.  \nIn the present case, both the appellants and the Bank and Jail filed motions \nfor summary judgment. The Warren Circuit Court found that the Jail’s policy of \nconfiscating cash and checks without first obtaining authorization by a sentencing \ncourt is lawful.  Still, the trial court held that both the Jail and the Bank violated the \nUniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) by negotiating unindorsed checks, and that \nthe Bank was liable to the payees for conversion by paying a check on an \nunauthorized indorsement of the payee.  Consequently, the trial court enjoined the \nJail and the Bank from illegally indorsing and illegally depositing such checks. \nHowever, the trial court found that the appellants had no judicially recognizable \ninterest in enforcing a claim for damages because they either benefited from the \ndeposited funds or were refunded in the proper amount.  Finally, the trial court \ndenied the appellants’ motion to certify a class action.  Since the appellants were \nfound not to have standing for monetary damages against the Bank, the \nrequirements for a class certification were not met.  Further, the trial court found \nthat the appellants’ claims were not typical of the claims of the proposed class, the \n“all persons admitted to the Jail since December 12, 2006” class composition was \ntoo broad, and certifying the class  would require an individualized inquiry into \n-6-\n\nwhich persons had unindorsed checks deposited, defeating the purpose of a class \naction. \nThe appellants filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate, which the trial court \ndenied.  The appellants also filed a motion to amend their initial complaint in an \nattempt to raise a number of constitutional issues not previously raised.  The trial \ncourt also denied this motion.  From those denials, the appellants seek review.  In \naddition, the Bank cross-appeals the trial court’s holding that its policy of honoring \nchecks made payable to inmates and depositing those funds into the Jail’s account \nviolates the UCC.\nThe appellants make four arguments on appeal.  First, they claim that the \ntrial court improperly interpreted KRS 441.265 and the Jail should not be permitted \nto seize cash and checks in the possession of prisoners without an order from a \nsentencing court.  Second, the appellants claim that if the trial court did interpret \nKRS 441.265 correctly, then the statute is unconstitutional.  Third, the appellants \nargue they are in fact entitled to damages due to the Jail and Bank’s violation of \nthe UCC.  Lastly, the appellants maintain that a class should have been certified.  \nIn its cross-appeal, the Bank argues that its policy of depositing inmate \nchecks into the Jail’s account does not violate the UCC because the Bank had no \nlegal obligation or basis for questioning the Jail’s authority to deposit such checks. \nIn the alternative, the Bank claims that injunctive relief was improper since a cause \n-7-\n\nof action for monetary damages is the only relief provided for in the UCC, \nspecifically KRS 355.3-420(2).3\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW.\nIn general, a trial court has unlimited power to alter, amend, or vacate its \njudgments.  Gullion v. Gullion, 163 S.W.3d 888, 891-92 (Ky. 2005).  A trial \ncourt’s ruling on a CR4 59.05 motion to alter, amend or vacate is reviewed under \nan abuse of discretion standard.  Bowling v. Kentucky Dep’t of Corr., 301 S.W.3d \n478, 483 (Ky. 2009).  “The familiar rule has been that the trial court has a wide \ndiscretion as to the filing of amended pleadings and this court will not interfere \nwith a ruling on the subject unless it is clearly apparent the trial judge has abused \nhis discretion.” S  helley v. Hill,   265 S.W.2d 34, 36 (Ky. 1953).  \nIII. ISSUES AND ANALYSIS. \nA. KRS 441.265.\nFirst, we will address the trial court’s interpretation of KRS 441.265.  The \nappellants allege that the Jail’s procedure of confiscating and keeping cash and \nchecks without an order from a sentencing court violates Kentucky law, \nspecifically, KRS 441.265.  KRS 441.265(1) states: “[a] prisoner in a county jail \nshall be required by the sentencing court to reimburse the county for expenses \nincurred by reason of the prisoner’s confinement as set out in this section, except \n3 The Kentucky Bankers Association, as amicus curiae, has also filed a brief to address the \nindustry-wide check processing issues implicated by this case.  \n4 Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.\n-8-\n\nfor good cause shown.”  The trial court found that given the use of the word \n“reimburse,” KRS 441.265(1) provides a method for repayment of fees past due to \nthe Jail, rather than permission for the automatic charging of fees upon \nincarceration.5  Further, the trial court acknowledged that qualifying the particular \ncourt as “sentencing” implies that Section 1 applies to convicted inmates.  Hence, \nthe trial court held that a sentencing court’s order is not required when the inmate \nhas the funds to pay the required fees available – such an order is only necessary \nwhen the prisoner still owes fees at the time of his sentencing. \nWe agree with the trial court’s interpretation of KRS 441.265.  The language \nof the statute is unambiguous, and seems clearly intended to provide a means for \ncounty jails to automatically deduct required fees when the inmate has the funds \navailable.  “It is well settled that the interpretation of a statute is a matter of law. \nAccordingly, a reviewing court is not required to adopt the decisions of the trial \ncourt as to a matter of law, but must interpret the statute according to the plain \nmeaning of the act and in accordance with the legislative intent.”  Commonwealth \n5 The trial court found that Section 2 of KRS 441.265 is the section that provides the Jail with the \nauthority to establish fees upon booking.  In fact, the trial court indicated that Section 1 of KRS \n441.265 would have been better located after Section 7, making Section 1 only a collection \nmechanism for the Jail.  The trial court stated: \nThe confusion results from the inconsistent placement of Section 1 \nwithin the statute with its intended purpose.  Reading the statute as \na whole, this Court finds that the legislature granted the [Jail] the \nauthority to establish, assess, and collect fees.  The statute allows \nfor automatic deduction of the prisoner’s property i.e.: cash, for \nrequired fees.  It authorized the jailer to negotiate a reimbursement \nplan with the prisoner should such fees fail to be satisfied.  And \nthen, it requires that the sentencing court assist the [Jail] in \ncollection of past due fees from convicted inmates, unless good \ncause is shown. \n-9-\n\nv. Plowman, 86 S.W.3d 47, 49 (Ky. 2002).  In Plowman, the Kentucky Supreme \nCourt directed: \n[t]his Court has repeatedly held that statutes must be \ngiven a literal interpretation unless they are ambiguous \nand if the words are not ambiguous, no statutory  \nconstruction is required.  KRS 446.080 provides for a \nliberal construction of statutes with the view to promote \ntheir objects and to carry out the intent of the \nlegislature. All words and phrases shall be construed\n according to the common and approved usage\n of language.\n  \nId. (internal citations omitted).  \nKRS 441.265(6) states:\n[p]ayment of any required fees may be automatically \ndeducted from the prisoner’s property or canteen \naccount.  If the prisoner has no funds in his account, a \ndeduction may be made creating a negative balance.  If \nfunds become available or if the prisoner reenters the jail \nat a later date, the fees may be deducted from the \nprisoner’s property or canteen account[.]\nWhen KRS 441.265(1) is read in conjunction with KRS 441.265(6), we believe the \nstatute unambiguously permits the exact practice used by the Jail.  Required fees \nmay automatically be deducted from the prisoners’ property or inmate canteen \naccounts, and if a negative balance is created, KRS 441.265(1) permits a \nsentencing court to order a prisoner to reimburse the Jail.  Thus, we disagree with \nthe appellants’ contentions that the trial court wrongly interpreted the statute and \nthat the Jail’s practice violates KRS 441.265(1).\nB. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF KRS 441.265.\n-10-\n\nNext, given our finding that KRS 441.265 permits the Jail’s practices, the \nappellants claim that KRS 441.265 must be unconstitutional.  The appellants raised \na number of constitutional issues in their motion for leave to file a third amended \ncomplaint, which was denied by the trial court.  Yet, the only constitutional issue \nraised in the appellants’ brief is the due process issue.  Appellants allege, as they \ndid before the trial court, that the trial court’s interpretation of KRS 441.265, \npermitting the Jail to confiscate their checks without an order from the sentencing \ncourt, deprives them of their property without due process.  They further claim that \nres judicata does not apply with respect to the dismissal of their federal case, that \nthe court’s reliance on Sickles v. Campbell County, Kentucky, 501 F.3d 726 (6th \nCir. 2007), was erroneous, and that the federal court opinions cited by the trial \ncourt are not controlling.6  \nNonetheless, we must point out that the federal court’s decision in this case \ndid in fact bar the trial court from addressing issues already addressed in the \nfederal court’s decision.  “The judgment of a federal court on the merits of a case \noperates as a bar to a new action in the state courts on the same claim or cause of \n6 In their motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, the appellants re-characterized their \nargument regarding the alleged due process violation to claim that the statute violates Section 10 \nof the Kentucky Constitution in addition to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution.  The trial court denied the motion, and with respect to this argument, \nindicated that the appellants could not raise this issue because the issue had already been raised \nand dismissed in a prior order which the appellants did not appeal.  Further, the trial court held \nthat since Section 10 of the Kentucky Constitution provides no greater protection than the federal \nFourth Amendment, the appellants’ request was inconsequential.  LaFollette v. Commonwealth, \n915 S.W.2d 747, 748 (Ky. 1996).  \nIn their brief, the appellants do not appear to reassert any claims of violation of Section 10 of the \nKentucky Constitution. Therefore, we will not explore this issue in this opinion. \n-11-\n\naction.”  Burlew v. Fidelity & Cas. Co., 122 S.W.2d 990, 995, 276 Ky. 132, 141 \n(1938).   While the federal court did decline to address the appellants’ state law \nclaims in its order dismissing their case, the federal court expressly ruled that the \nJail’s procedure did not violate due process since the appellants were never \nactually deprived of their property and were provided an adequate post-deprivation \nremedy.  The issue was fully and fairly litigated before a competent court in a final \nand appealable order.  As the appellants did not appeal this order, but rather re-\nfiled the case in state court, we are barred from reconsidering this issue by the \nfederal court’s decision.  \nEven if we were not barred from reconsidering the issue of due process, we \nwould not find in favor of the appellants.  We agree with the federal court that the \nappellants were never actually deprived of their property; the funds were deposited \ninto the inmates’ account for safe keeping, and with the exception of the Jail \nlegally withdrawing required fees, the appellants had access to those funds while in \njail and upon release.  Further, each inmate signed an Inmate Rights & Rules and \nServices Offered to Inmates form, attesting that he or she had received a copy of \nand understood the rules and regulations of the jail.  Those rules include the \ngrievance procedures for inmates wishing to challenge the confiscation of property \nor the amount of fees withdrawn.  Despite the appellants’ allegations to the \ncontrary, the grievance procedures were still available to inmates post-release; the \nappellants simply chose not to avail themselves of those procedures.  We agree that \nthis constitutes an adequate post-deprivation remedy.  While Sickles is not \n-12-\n\ncontrolling, it presents an almost identical factual situation, and we find the court’s \nanalysis and reasoning in that case highly persuasive.  501 F.3d at 731.  \nC. CONVERSION.\nIn its cross-appeal, the Bank argues that the trial court erred by finding that \nthe Bank committed conversion by honoring the unindorsed checks for deposit and \nby enjoining the Jail and Bank from continuing their current procedure.7  KRS \n355.3-420(1), in relevant part, defines conversion as follows: \nThe law applicable to conversion of personal property \napplies to instruments.  An instrument is also converted if \nit is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a \nperson not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank \nmakes or obtains payment with respect to the \ninstrument for a person not entitled to enforce the \ninstrument or receive payment.  \n(emphasis added).  The Bank argues that the Jail was, in fact, a person entitled to \nenforce the instruments/checks deposited with the Bank by reason of its authority \nto confiscate those checks under KRS 441.265(6), and therefore, the Bank is not \nliable for conversion.  \nKRS 355.3-301 defines a “[p]erson entitled to enforce” an instrument as \nfollows:\n(1) The holder of the instrument;\n7 The Kentucky Bankers’ Association, amicus curiae, also filed a brief in this case to address the \nindustry-wide check processing issues implicated by this case.  In that brief, the KBA raised the \nissue of the three-year statute of limitations for conversion actions found in KRS 355.3-118(7). \nWhile the Bank also raised this issue in its answer to the appellants’ second amended complaint, \nand in its response to the appellants’ motion for class certification, the trial court did not rule on \nthis issue, and the Bank did not raise it in either its prehearing statement or brief before this \ncourt.  Therefore, we decline to address this issue and will address the conversion claims as \ntimely filed. See CR 76.03(8); Sallee v. Sallee, 142 S.W.3d 697, 698 (Ky. App. 2004).  \n-13-\n\n(2) A nonholder in possession of the instrument who has \nthe rights of a holder; or\n(3) A person not in possession of the instrument who is \nentitled to enforce the instrument pursuant to KRS 355.3-\n309 or KRS 355.3-418(4).  A person may be a person \nentitled to enforce the instrument even though the person \nis not the owner of the instrument or is in wrongful \npossession of the instrument.\nThe trial court found that the Jail did not qualify as a “holder,” which is defined in \nKRS 355.1-201(u) as “[t]he person in possession of a negotiable instrument that is \npayable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession.” \nKRS 355.3-201(2) states:\n“[e]xcept for negotiation by a remitter, if an instrument \nis payable to an identified person, negotiation \nrequires transfer of possession of the instrument and \nits indorsement by the holder.  If an instrument is \npayable to bearer, it may be negotiated by transfer of \npossession alone.\n(emphasis added).  The trial court also cited Kentucky Title Sav. Bank & Trust Co. \nv. Dunavan, 205 Ky. 801, 266 S.W. 667 (1924), a case decided prior to adoption of \nthe UCC, which held that when a bank pays a check on an unauthorized \nindorsement of the payee, such conduct amounts to conversion, rendering the bank \nliable to the payee.  We agree with the trial court that the only person who can \nqualify as a holder is the inmate to which the check is made payable.  \nHowever, the trial court failed to address the Bank’s second contention: that \nKRS 355.3-301(2), entitling “[a] nonholder in possession of the instrument who \nhas the rights of a holder” to enforce an instrument, applies, permitting the Jail to \n-14-\n\nenforce the inmates’ checks.  The Bank further cites KRS 355.3-301(3), which \nprovides that a “person may be a person entitled to enforce the instrument even \nthough the person is not the owner of the instrument or is in wrongful \npossession of the instrument.”  (emphasis added).  The Official Comment8 to KRS \n355.3-301 explains:\nSection 3-301 defines “a person entitled to enforce” the \ninstrument.  The definition recognizes that \nenforcement is not limited to holders.  The quoted \nphrase includes a person enforcing a lost or stolen \ninstrument.  Section 3-309.  It also includes a person in \npossession of an instrument who is not a holder.  A \nnonholder in possession of an instrument includes a \nperson that acquired rights of a holder by subrogation or \nunder Section 3-203(a).  It also includes both a remitter \nthat has received an instrument from the issuer but has \nnot yet transferred or negotiated the instrument to any \nother person and also any other person who under \napplicable law is successor to the holder or otherwise \nacquires the holder’s rights.  \n(emphasis added).  The Bank asserts that the Jail has acquired the holder’s rights \nby reason of KRS 441.265, which permits the automatic deduction of required fees \nfrom a prisoner’s property, and thus KRS 355.3-301(2) gives the Jail the authority \nto enforce the unindorsed inmate checks.  \nWe agree with the Bank that the Jail becomes a “nonholder in possession of \nthe instrument who has the rights of a holder” when the Jail lawfully confiscates \nchecks pursuant to KRS 441.265.  Since KRS 355.3-301(3) makes such an \nindividual a “person entitled to enforce” an instrument, the Jail is entitled to \n8 KRS 355.1-103(3) directs that Official Comments “represent the express legislative intent of \nthe General Assembly and shall be used as a guide for interpretation of this chapter, except that if \nthe text and the official comments conflict, the text shall control.”\n-15-\n\nenforce the confiscated checks.  Accordingly, we do not believe the Bank can be \nliable to the appellants for conversion since it has not made payment with respect \nto an instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument.  In addition, we \ndo not believe the Jail has violated any provision of the UCC since the Jail was \nentitled to enforce the inmate checks by reason of its authority to confiscate those \nchecks.  \nThe appellants argue in their brief that they are entitled to monetary damages \nfor the Bank’s actions.  Since we have found that the Bank is not liable to the \nappellants for honoring their checks deposited by the Jail, we disagree, and thus \nthat part of the trial court’s order is affirmed.  However, due to that same finding, \nwe must reverse the trial court’s order enjoining the Jail and the Bank from \nindorsing and depositing inmate checks.9 \nD.  CLASS CERTIFICATION.\nAppellants maintain that the trial court erred by denying their motion to \ncertify a class consisting of “all persons admitted to the Jail since December 12, \n2006.”  We disagree.  We agree with the trial court that class certification is \ninappropriate when the appellants’ underlying claims lack legal merit.  See \nSprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F.3d 388, 397 (6th Cir. 1998) (“The \nplaintiffs have no basis for complaining of a refusal to certify a proposed class \nwhere the representatives of the class cannot prevail on the merits.”).  While the \ntrial court reached this conclusion since appellants suffered no monetary loss and \n9 For this reason, we will not reach the Bank’s alternative argument concerning injunctive relief \nunder the UCC.\n-16-\n\nthus had no standing to make a claim for monetary damages, given our findings \nthat the Jail and Bank did not violate the UCC, the appellants have no claim \nwhatsoever.  Hence, the appellants cannot be representatives of a class owed \ndamages, if such a class exists.  \nWe further agree with the trial court that even if the appellants did have \nstanding to bring a claim for monetary damages, they do not meet the requirements \nfor a class action certification.  CR 23.01 provides that one or more members of a \nclass may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if:\n(a) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable,\n(b) there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass,\n(c) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class, and\n(d) the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.\nHere, the appellants cannot meet the third requirement.  The appellants have \noffered no proof that anyone in the proposed class suffered monetary damages. \nEven if the appellants could prove as much, they would not be appropriate \nrepresentatives since, as mentioned above, they have not suffered monetary \ndamages.  Therefore, the trial court’s order refusing to certify a class action is \naffirmed.\nIV. CONCLUSION.\n-17-\n\nWe affirm the trial court’s findings with respect to the interpretation of KRS \n441.265, the legality of the Jail’s procedure of confiscating checks and \nautomatically deducting required fees, and the constitutionality of KRS 441.265 as \ninterpreted.  We reverse the trial court’s order enjoining the Jail and the Bank from \ncontinuing to indorse and deposit confiscated inmate checks, and reverse the trial \ncourt’s finding that the Bank is liable for conversion.  Finally, we affirm the trial \ncourt’s order denying the appellants class certification.  \nThus, the order of the Warren Circuit Court is affirmed in part, and reversed \nin part.  \nALL CONCUR.\nBRIEFS FOR APPELLANTS: BRIEF FOR APPELLEES:\nGregory A.
