Represented by private counsel and several advocacy organizations--the University of Minnesota Center for New Americans and the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota -- plaintiffs argued that in preventing valid US visa holders from entering the US, the EO violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, Fifth Amendment equal protection and due process rights, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The complaint sought emergency declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. </p><p>The plaintiffs were two married couples. In each couple, one individual was a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the US petitioning for visas for his/her respective spouses. The visas were granted, and the spouses, who were nationals of one of the seven nations subject to the Executive Order, were prevented from entering the U.S. In both cases, the couples were separated as a result of the Executive Order. </p><p>With their complaint, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order seeking to enjoin the defendants from both revoking the issued visas and prohibiting the visa holders from entering the US.</p><p>The case was assigned to District Judge Tanya Chutkan. On February 5, 2017, plaintiffs' counsel wrote to Judge Chutkan that one of the plaintiffs was allowed to enter the US and had become a Lawful Permanent Resident. A second plaintiff was allowed to board a plane to the US on February 6, 2017. On February 7, 2017, the plaintiffs submitted a notice that they were withdrawing the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order.  </p><p>On Mar. 6, prompted by adverse developments in another lawsuit challenging the Executive Order, in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15606\">Washington v. Trump</a>, the President rescinded the Jan. 27 Executive Order and replaced it with a narrower one, <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states\">Executive Order 13780 (EO-2)</a>. </p><p>On March 8, the parties reached an agreement in this case and stipulated to a dismissal, with each party to bear its own costs and fees. The court granted the dismissal on the same day. </p><p>The case is now closed. </p>",

      "text": "Case 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 5   Filed 02/04/17   Page 1 of 8\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n     \nZADEH, et al.,    Civil Action No. 1:17-cv-00243-TSC \n   \nPlaintiffs, \nvs.  SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM \n  ADDRESSING THE APPLICABILITY \nTRUMP, et al.,   OF THE ORDERS ISSUED IN 17-CV-\n  00786 (C.D. CAL. JAN. 31, 2017) AND \n  2:17-CV-0141 (W.D. WASH. FEB. 3, \nDefendants.  2017) \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs submit this supplemental memorandum in support of their Emergency Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining Order to address the applicability of the orders recently issued in \nMohammed v. United States, No. 17-cv-00786, Dkt. 7 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2017), and Washington \nv. Trump, No. 2:17-cv-00141, Dkt. 52 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 3, 2017). These court orders apply to \nPlaintiffs here and together forbid enforcement of the Executive Order against Plaintiffs as they \nattempt to enter the United States. For that reason, this Court should briefly defer ruling on \nPlaintiffs’ motion while Plaintiffs attempt to travel to the United States. However, lingering \nquestions related to the applicability of the Mohammed and Washington orders remain. The \norders are temporary in nature, and the government has appealed in Washington. The orders may \nbe narrowed in scope or overturned entirely. For these reasons, the Court should proceed with \nthe scheduled hearing on Monday. In the event that the Mohammed and Washington orders fail \nto provide safe passage to the United States for Plaintiffs, the Court should promptly rule on—\nand grant—Plaintiffs’ motion. \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 5   Filed 02/04/17   Page 2 of 8\n \nBACKGROUND \nOn January 31, 2017, the court in Mohammed entered a temporary restraining order \nbarring  the  enforcement  of  the  Executive  Order  and  prohibiting  “removing,  detaining,  or \nblocking the entry of Plaintiffs, or any other person from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria \nand Yemen with a valid immigrant visa.” Mohammed, No. 17-cv-00786, Dkt. 7 at 5. The court \nordered other relief, but limited the scope of that relief to the plaintiffs in that case. For example, \nthe court enjoined and restrained the defendants “from cancelling validly obtained and issued \nimmigrant visas of Plaintiffs.” Id. \nBut  foreign  travelers  soon  discovered  an  additional  problem  not  addressed  by  the \nMohammed order (except as to the plaintiffs in that case). At the same time that President Trump \nissued the Executive Order, the U.S. Department of State issued a memorandum revoking “all \nvalid nonimmigrant and immigrant visas of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and \nYemen,” subject to limited exceptions not relevant here. See State Dept. Memo attached as \nExhibit A. The State Department memorandum was particularly egregious because it ventured \nbeyond the terms of the Executive Order itself, which purported to merely “suspend entry” of \npersons from the seven countries identified for 90 days—not cancel validly obtained visas that in \nmany cases took years to obtain. Executive Order § 3(c).  \nIn the wake of the State Department memorandum, affected persons could not practically \nrely on the Mohammed order because the order applied only to those “with a valid immigrant \nvisa.” Mohammed, No. 17-cv-00786, Dkt. 7 at 5. During a hearing in a pending Virginia action, \na U.S. Department of Justice attorney estimated that 100,000 visas had been canceled pursuant to \nthe  State  Department  memo.  See  Aziz  v.  Trump,  1:17-cv-116  (E.D.  Va.);  see  also \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/government-reveals-over-100000-visas-\nrevoked-due-to-travel-ban/2017/02/03/7d529eec-ea2c-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html. \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 5   Filed 02/04/17   Page 3 of 8\n \nLate yesterday, February 3, shortly after this action was filed, the court in Washington \ngranted the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and enjoined the defendants from \nenforcing the Executive Order nationwide. See Washington, No. 2:17-cv-00141, Dkt. 52. Today, \nthe  State  Department  reversed  the  earlier  visa  revocations  in  light  of  the  Court’s  order  in \nWashington.  See  https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en.html;  https://www.washingtonpost. \ncom/politics/state-dept-reverses-visa-revocations-allows-banned-travelers-to-enter-us/2017/02/0 \n4/0ab5880a-eaee-11e6-bf6f  301b6b443624_story.html?utm_term=.074122aa42a2.  Late  today, \nthe U.S. Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal in Washington. \nIn light of these developments, Plaintiffs have renewed their efforts to travel to the \nUnited States. Plaintiff Abdille departed from Nairobi to Amsterdam at approximately 3 p.m. \nEST today, February 4. She is scheduled to board a flight to Minneapolis early tomorrow and \nland at 1 p.m. EST tomorrow, February 5, 2017. Plaintiff Raghimi has purchased a ticket to \ndepart Tehran for Amsterdam at 6:50 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 5. She departs Amsterdam \nat 4:35 a.m. EST on Monday, February 6, and is scheduled to land in Minneapolis at 1:52 p.m. \nEST on Monday February 6.  \nARGUMENT \nThe orders in Mohammed and Washington cover Plaintiffs here. Even assuming the \nMohammed order was insufficient to prevent the revocation of Plaintiffs’ visas, the court in \nWashington explicitly issued its order on a nationwide basis. And the State Department has since \nexplicitly reaffirmed that Plaintiffs’ visas remain valid.  \n  The Mohammed and Washington orders are binding both on Defendants and on this \nCourt.  See National Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(injunctions issued against an agency are valid on a national basis); United States v. AMC \nEntm’t, Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 770 (9th Cir. 2008) (“Once a court has obtained personal jurisdiction \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 5   Filed 02/04/17   Page 4 of 8\n \nover a defendant, the court has the power to enforce the terms of the injunction outside the \nterritorial jurisdiction of the court, including issuing a nationwide injunction.”). \nHowever, questions remain as to whether the Mohammed and Washington orders will \nallow Plaintiffs to enter the United States. The orders are necessarily temporary in nature, and \nthe courts in Mohammed and Washington will refine their orders at the preliminary injunction \nstage. Moreover, the government has appealed the Washington order. Because both Mohammed \nand Washington arose in the Ninth Circuit, an appeal in one case will likely affect the other. The \noutcome of Ninth Circuit review is, of course, uncertain. The court could narrow the scope of the \nexisting orders or overturn them entirely. Finally, this past week has been marked by a great deal \nof chaos in the enforcement of the Executive Order itself and the court orders it has generated. \nEnforcement has varied from office to office, and even agent to agent.  \nFor these reasons, the Court should proceed with the scheduled hearing on Monday. \nPlaintiffs  will  provide  the  Court  with  up-to-date  information  about  Plaintiffs’  progress  in \ntraveling to and entering the United States. In the event that Plaintiffs are admitted to the United \nStates pursuant to the terms of their visas, Plaintiffs will immediately inform the Court, and meet \nand confer with the Department of Justice attorneys in order to resolve this case.  \nHowever, in the event that the Mohammed and Washington orders fail to grant Plaintiffs \nentry to the United States, the Court should promptly rule on—and grant—Plaintiffs’ motion for \nthe reasons stated therein. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should defer ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion while \nPlaintiffs attempt to enter the United States under the terms of the Mohammed and Washington \norders.  If  Plaintiffs  cannot  enter,  the  Court  should  promptly  grant  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a \ntemporary restraining order. \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 5   Filed 02/04/17   Page 5 of 8\n \n \nDated:  February 4, 2017    COHEN MILSTEIN SELLERS & TOLL  \n            PLLC \n \n            /s/ S.

They have passed all \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 2 of 23\nbackground checks, submitted all necessary documents, and completed all necessary interviews. \nAfter this extensive review, the government issued immigrant visas to Plaintiffs Raghimi and \nAbdille. \nPlaintiffs, who have been married but living thousands of miles apart for years, upended \ntheir lives based on the grant of these visas.  Raghimi quit her job as  a university professor, \nmoved out of her apartment, and sold her car and many of her belongings before boarding a \nflight to the United States.  She did not learn of the Executive Order purporting to ban her entry \nuntil she landed in Amsterdam to  change planes, at which point she  was  sent back to  Iran. \nAbdille's flight is scheduled for February 4, 2017.  She has been told she will not be allowed to \nboard the flight.  She currently lives in Nairobi and cares for her and Plaintiff lye's two young \ndaughters, ages 2 and 4.  One of these little girls has a serious medical condition but is unable to \nget the care she needs in Nairobi.  In anticipation of the move to the United States, Abdille \nterminated the lease on her apartment.  She has no family in Nairobi.  After February 4, 2017, \nshe and the girls will have nowhere to stay. \nDefendants' refusal to allow Raghimi and Abdille entrance to the United States derives \nfrom nothing more than naked prejudice.  Raghimi and Abdille come from majority Muslim \ncountries,  and  Defendants  have  sought  to  effectuate  what  is  essentially  a  ban  on  Muslim \nimmigration.  Such a ban does not comport with the Constitution or the laws of the United \nStates. \nPlaintiffs have filed a Complaint in this matter, and they have a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their claims.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in Washington, California, \nVirginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New York, and in each case the court concluded the \nplaintiffs' claims were likely to succeed.  Because Plaintiffs' claims are likely to succeed, and \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 3 of 23\nbecause plaintiffs  continue to  suffer irreparable harm due to  Defendants'  conduct,  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request  that  the  Court  issue  a  Temporary Restraining  Order and  a  Preliminary \nInjunction in this case that will: (1) restrain and enjoin Defendants from revoking or cancelling \nRaghimi's and Abdille's valid immigrant visas, and (2)  restrain and enjoin Defendants from \nprohibiting Raghimi and Abdille from entering the United States pursuant to their validly issued \nv1sas. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  THE EXECUTIVE ORDER \nOn  Friday,  January  27,  2017,  newly  elected  President  Donald  J.  Trump  signed  an \nExecutive Order entitled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United \nStates\" (the \"Executive Order\").  (Complaint ~~ 31-34.)  In the wake of the execution of the \nExecutive Order, Defendants have announced or have been directed to unlawfully implement a \nmoratorium on refugees and valid visa holders from seven countries from entering the United \nStates: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen (the \"seven countries\"). (Complaint \nThe Executive Order is based on a claimed threat of terrorism at the hands of foreign \nnationals, and, pursuant to the purported threat, imposes substantial modifications to the policies \nand procedures governing the admission of non-citizens to the United States: \na.  A  120-day  moratorium  on  the  United  States  Refugee  Resettlement  Program \n(\"US RAP\"); \nb.  An indefinite suspension of Syrian national refugees from entering the United \nStates,  and the  substantial  reduction of all  refugee  entrants  to  the  United  States  from  over \n100,000 to no more than 50,000 for fiscal year 2017; \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 4 of 23\nc.  The  90-day suspension of \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United \nStates  of aliens  from  countries  referred  to  in  section  217(a)(12)  of the  INA,  8  U.S.C. \n1187(a)(12)\" (because  such  entry would  purportedly \"be detrimental  to  the  interests  of the \nUnited States\"). See Executive Order§ 3(c). (Complaint, 32.) \nNations  meeting  the  criteria  listed  at  INA  Section  217(a)(12),  8  U.S.C.  Section \n1187(a)(12), include the following seven nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and \nYemen (the \"seven countries\").  Executive Order Section 3(c) suspends entry into the United \nStates  by  non-United  States  Citizen  \"immigrant[s]  and  nonimmigrant[s]\"  for  90  days. \n(Complaint, 33.)  The moratorium on and curtailment of refugees, as well as the freeze imposed \non immigrants and nonimmigrants deriving from the seven countries from entering the United \nStates was made  by proclamation alone,  and is not based on any quantitative or qualitative \nanalysis. (Complaint, 34.) \nThe United States Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (\"OLC\") appears to \nhave performed just a superficial review ofthe Executive Order's constitutionality.  The January \n27, 2017 OLC Memorandum evaluating the Executive Order is slightly more than one page in \nlength.  It catalogues the purported aims of the Executive Order and then concludes, baldly, that \n\"[t]he proposed Order is approved with respect to form and legality.\" (Complaint, 35.) \nNotwithstanding  this  bare-bones  approval  from  OLC,  on  January  30,  2017,  Acting \nAttorney General Sally Q. Yates issued a written statement regarding the Order: \nMy responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department \nof Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best \nview of what the  law is after consideration of all the facts.  In \naddition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in \ncourt remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to \nalways seek justice and stand for what is right.  At present, I am \nnot convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 5 of 23\nwith these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the Executive \nOrder is lawful. \nConsequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the \nDepartment of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the \nExecutive Order,  unless and until I become convinced that it is \nappropriate to do so. \nTrump fired Acting Attorney General Yates on January 30, 2017, just a few hours after Yates \nissued this statement. (Complaint~~ 36-37.) \nOn  February  1,  2017,  in  response  to  the  \"reasonable  uncertainty\"  and  \"confusion\" \nregarding the scope of the Executive Order, Donald F. McGahn, Counsel to the President, issued \na \"Memorandum to the Acting Secretary of State, the Acting Attorney General, and the Secretary \nof Homeland Security,\" which purported to provide \"Authoritative Guidance\" on the Executive \nOrder. (Complaint~ 38.) \nMcGahn's Memorandum stated: \nSection 3(c) of the Executive Order entitled \"Protecting the Nation \nfrom  Foreign  Terrorist  Entry  into  the  United  States\"  (Jan.  27, \n2017)  suspends for  90  days the  entry into  the United States of \ncertain aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12). \nSection  3(e )  of the  order  directs  the  Secretary  of Homeland \nSecurity, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to submit to \nthe President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a \nPresidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of certain \nforeign nationals from countries that do not provide information \nneeded to adjudicate visas, admissions, or other benefits under the \nINA.  I understand that there has been reasonable uncertainty about \nwhether those provisions apply to lawful permanent residents of \nthe United States. \nAccordingly, to remove any confusion, I now clarify that Sections \n3(c) and 3(e) do not apply to such individuals.  Please immediately \nconvey this interpretive guidance to all individuals responsible for \nthe administration and implementation of the Executive Order. \n(Complaint~ 39.) \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 6 of 23\nIn other words, individuals currently holding Green Cards are exempt from the Executive \nOrder.  Individuals holding immigrant visas, who will be eligible for and receive Green Cards \nsimply by entering the United States pursuant to their validly issued immigrant visas, are not \nexempt  from  the  Executive  Order.  McGahn's  Memorandum  lacks  any  rationale  for \ndistinguishing between these two groups.  (Complaint~ 40.) \nPresident Trump, both in the past and very recently, promised that as President of the \nUnited States he would ban all Muslims from entering this country.  For example, on or about \nDecember 7, 2015, then-presidential candidate Trump, referring to himself in the third person, \npublicly stated:  \"Donald J.  Trump is  calling for  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims \nentering the United States ....\"   (Complaint~ 41.) \nTrump's campaign surrogate Rudolph Giuliani confirmed that the Executive Order is \nmeant to serve as a Muslim ban.  In a January 28, 2017 interview with Fox News, Giuliani was \nasked, \"How did the president decide the seven countries?\"  He responded, \"I'll tell you the \nwhole history of it.  So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.'  He called me \nup.  He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\"'  Giuliani \nexplained that he convened a \"whole group of other very expert lawyers on this,\" including \nformer U.S. attorney general Michael Mukasey, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Tex.) and Rep. Peter T. \nKing (R-N. Y.).  \"And what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger - the areas \nof the world that create danger for us ... Which is a factual basis, not a religious basis.  Perfectly \nlegal, perfectly sensible.  And that's what the ban is based on.  It's not based on religion.  It's \nbased on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our \ncountry.\"  (Complaint~~ 43-44.) \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 7 of 23\nThe Executive Order further prioritizes admittance into the United States of religious \nminorities deriving from and suffering religious persecution in the seven enumerated countries. \nSee Executive Order§§ 5(b), (e).  No similar prioritization was included in the Executive Order \nor otherwise announced for Muslim minorities in countries with a non-Muslim religious majority \n(e.g., Myanmar, Israel, China, etc.).  (Complaint ,-r,-r 44-47.) \nPresident Trump has explicitly stated that this prioritization provision of his Executive \nOrder  is  for  the  benefit of Christian minorities  in Muslim-majority  countries.  On or  about \nJanuary 29, 2017, an interview between Trump and David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting \nNetwork aired. During the interview, Mr.  Brody asked Trump whether he viewed persecuted \nChristians overseas as a \"priority\" for refugee status, to which Trump unequivocally replied: \n\"Yes.\"  See also Michael D. Shear & Helene Cooper, Trump Bars Refugees and Citizens of 7 \nMuslim Countries, N.Y.

PLAINTIFFS ZADEH AND RAGHIMI \nPlaintiff Zadeh is a lawful permanent resident of the United States and is just several \nmonths away from being eligible for citizenship.  (Complaint ,-r 5.)  His wife, Sameneh Raghimi, \nwas until recently a Professor of Industrial Design at Azad University in Mashadd, Iran, before \nresigning her position to move to the United States.  (Complaint ,-r 5.)  They have been married \nsince November 2013.  (Complaint ,-r 5.)  They have seen each other only intermittently since \ntheir wedding, as Zadeh lives and works in the United States and Raghimi lives and works in \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 8 of 23\nIran.  (Complaint ~ 5.)  After they married in 2013, Zadeh filed an I-130 Petition for Alien \nRelative on Raghimi's behalf.  The I-130 Petition was approved.  (Complaint~ 6.) \nRaghimi  then  underwent,  adhered  to  and  fully  complied  with  Defendants'  policies, \nprocedures and security background checks, including but not limited to: payment of all relevant \nfees  to  USCIS,  National  Visa center and  the  State  Department;  providing  all  the  requisite \ndocumentation  required  by  Defendants;  and  an  interview  of Raghimi  at  the  United  States \nEmbassy in Ankara, Turkey by the U.S. Department of State.  (Complaint~ 7.) \nOn November 18, 2016, the Department of State issued Raghimi an F21 immigrant visa \nto enter the United States as a lawful permanent resident.  (Complaint ~ 10 .)  In anticipation of \nbeginning a new life with her husband in the United States, Raghimi quit her job as a professor at \nAzad University.  (Complaint~ 11.)  She terminated her lease and sold her car and many of her \npersonal belongings in preparation for the move.  (Complaint~ 11.) \nZadeh and Raghimi left Tehran, Iran on January 27, 2017, for the first leg of their flight \nto the United States.  While they were in the air, Trump signed the Executive Order.  When the \ncouple  landed  in  Amsterdam,  Netherlands,  a  U.S.  Customs  or  Immigration  agent  notified \nRaghimi that she would not be allowed to fly to the United States.  Zadeh was informed, on the \nother hand, that he could return to the United States.  (Complaint~ 12.) \nGiven the cost of the international tickets, and the need for Zadeh to return to the United \nStates so that he could complete the last requirements to make him eligible for citizenship, the \ncouple quickly decided that Zadeh should continue on and Raghimi would return to  Tehran \nalone.  Zadeh and Raghimi rushed to make arrangements for Raghimi to return to Tehran before \nZadeh's flight left for the United States.  The couple had just a brief moment to hug and say a \ntearful farewell before Zadeh boarded his plane and left Raghimi behind.  (Complaint~ 13.) \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 9 of 23\nZadeh's and Raghimi's continued separation has been painful for the couple.  Beyond the \nemotional consequences of the separation, the financial burden has been substantial.  Raghimi \nresigned from her job at Azad University and currently has no employment.  She cancelled the \nlease on her apartment and now has nowhere to stay.  She is currently living in a hotel.  She sold \nher car and all her personal belongings.  She has nothing except the luggage she was traveling \nwith, and some of her luggage, including her computer and some of her clothes, ended up in \nMinneapolis with Zadeh.  Raghimi has no family in Tehran to help her during this time. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS lYE AND ABDILLE \nlye was born in Somalia and became a naturalized U.S.  citizen in 2010.  He married \nAbdille in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2011.  Abdille and lye have two daughters together. \nBoth children are U.S. Citizens.  One child, Nimo, was born in July 2012.  The other, Nafisa, \nwas  born  in November  2014.  Nimo  has  microcephaly  and  requires  special  medical  care. \nAbdille, Nimo, and Nafisa live together in Nairobi, Kenya.  (Complaint ,-r 14.) \nIn February, 2012, lye filed an 1-130 Petition for Abdille to come to the United States on \nan immigrant visa.  Abdille's 1-130 Petition was approved.  Abdille then underwent, adhered to \nand  fully  complied  with Defendants'  policies,  procedures  and  security  background  checks, \nincluding but not limited to: payment of all relevant fees to USCIS, National Visa center and the \nState Department; providing all the requisite documentation required by Defendants;  and  an \ninterview of Plaintiff Abdille at the  United States Embassy in Nairobi,  Kenya,  by the U.S. \nDepartment of State.  (Complaint ,-r,-r 15-16.) \nIt took  almost  5 years  of screening  and  vetting,  but on January  18,  2017,  the  State \nDepartment issued Abdille an IR1 visa to enter the United States as a lawful permanent resident. \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 10 of 23\nPlans were made for Abdille, Nimo, and Nafisa, to leave Nairobi and join lye in Minnesota, and \na trip was booked for February 4, 2017.  (Complaint~ 17.) \nOn January 28, 2017, in the wake of the Executive Order, Abdille went to the Nairobi \noffices of KLM Airlines to confirm that she and her children would be allowed to travel to the \nU.S.  They were informed that, because of the Executive Order, they would not be able to board \ntheir February 4, 2017 flight to Amsterdam.  (Complaint~ 18.) \nThe lease on Abdille's apartment terminates on February 4, 2017, and the family has \nnowhere to go after that date.  Neither Abdille nor lye have any other family living in Nairobi. \nThe cost of a hotel will be prohibitive for the family.  Further, Nimo desperately needs medical \ncare for her condition.  She cannot receive the care she needs in Nairobi. (Complaint~ 19.) \nMOTION \nPursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 65 and LCvR 65.1, Plaintiffs hereby the move the Court to \nissue  a Temporary Restraining  Order and Preliminary Injunction enjoinin~ Defendants from \nenforcement of the Executive Order and allowing Raghimi and Abdille to enter the United States \non their valid visas.  In support of this motion, Plaintiffs rely on the points and authorities \ndescribed in the argument below. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Standard for Granting Temporary Relief. \nTo obtain a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs must establish (1) that they are likely \nto succeed on the merits; (2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm is likely in the absence \nof preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs' favor;  and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.  See Singh v.  Carter, 168 F. Supp. 3d 216, 223 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(citing Glossip v.  Gross, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 2737 (2015), reh'g denied, 136 S. Ct. 20 (2015)); see \nalso Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  A district court must balance \n10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 11 of 23\nthe strengths of the requesting party's arguments in each of the four required areas.  Chaplaincy \nof Full Gospel Churches v.  England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing CityFed Fin. \nCorp. v.  Office ofThrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  \"If the showing in one \narea is particularly strong, an injunction may issue even if the showings in other areas are rather \nweak.\"  ld.  Therefore, while Plaintiffs' claim on the merits is strong, temporary relief ought to \nbe granted even if the arguments were less meritorious given how strongly the balance of harms \nweighs in Plaintiffs' favor, and vice versa. \nII.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Prevail on the Merits Because the Executive Order Is Illegal \nfor Several Reasons. \nThe Executive Order violates several provisions of the Constitution and federal statutes. \nIt is so plainly illegal that the then-Acting Attorney General of the United States announced that \nshe would refuse to defend it in court.  Letter from  Sally Yates, Jan.  30, 2017, available at \nhttps:// www.nytimes.com/interactive/20 17 /0113 0/us/d ocument-Letter-From-Sally Ya tes.html. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs are very likely to prevail on the merits. \nA.  The Executive Order Violates the Equal Protection Clause. \nPlaintiffs claim a violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause \nof the  Fifth  Amendment,  on  the  ground  that  the  Executive  Order  constitutes  intentional \ndiscrimination  by  the  federal  government  on  the  basis  of religion  and  national  origin. \n\"Classifications based on alienage, like those based on nationality or race, are inherently suspect \nand subject to close judicial scrutiny.\"  Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365,372 (1971).  While \nthe political branches may have more latitude in an immigration context (see,  e.g., Zadvydas v. \nDavis,  533  U.S.  678,  695  (2001))  the  United  States  does  not  set  aside  its  values  or  its \nConstitution while protecting its borders.  See INS v.  Chada, 462 U.S. 919, 941-42 (Congress \nmust  choose  a  \"constitutionally  permissible  means  of  implementing\"  its  power  over \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 12 of 23\nimmigration).  Religion is also an \"inherently suspect distinction.\"  See City of New Orleans v. \nDukes,  427  U.S.  297,  303  (1976).  In  this  case,  the  Executive  Order  is  at  odds  with  the \nfundamental American promise that all are entitled to equal protection under the law. \nThe Executive Order, on its face,  discriminates based on national origin without any \nsufficient and reasonable justification.  Additionally,  as  discussed in more  detail below,  the \nExecutive Order discriminates based on religion.  On its face,  the Executive Order requires \nimmigration officials to \"prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious \nbased persecution,  provided that the religion of the  individual  is  a minority  religion in  the \nindividual's country of nationality.\"  As detailed above, comments by President Trump and his \nadvisers make clear that the intent of this provision is to give preference to Christians while \ndisadvantaging  Muslims.  Plaintiffs  need  not  show  that  the  intent  to  discriminate  against \nMuslims \"was the sole purpose of the challenged action,  but only that it was a 'motivating \nfactor.\"'  See  Vill.  of Arlington Heights v.  Metro.  Hous. Dev.  Corp.,  429 U.S.  252, 265-66 \n(1977).  There can be no dispute that the executive order uses suspect classifications.  And it \ndoes so not in furtherance of a congressionally-authorized purpose, but rather in direct violation \nof federal law, as discussed further below.  Thus, the Court ought to apply strict scrutiny.  The \nExecutive Order cannot withstand strict scrutiny. \nThe Executive Order cites three rationales to support its temporary ban on admission of \nnationals of seven countries: \"To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies . \n. . , to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening \nof foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration \nby foreign terrorists or criminals.\"  The first rational~ssentially a desire to conserve resources \n12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 13 of 23\nby discriminating-is not compelling.  The Executive Order is not narrowly tailored to achieve \nany ofthese goals. \nThe Executive Order is profoundly overbroad.  It bans those from disfavored countries \nwithout any evidence that any individual poses a threat of terrorism.  Additionally, while the \nExecutive Order recites the tragic events of September 11, 2001, it imposes no entry restrictions \non people from the countries whose nationals carried out those attacks (Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi \nArabia, and the United Arab Emirates).  Strict scrutiny requires a \"perfect fit between the means \nand the ends ....\"   Turner Broadcasting v. F. C. C., 910 F. Supp. 734, 747 (D.D.C. 1995).  Here, \nthere is no \"fit\" between the rationales advanced to support the Executive Order and the means \nused to further those rationales. \nMoreover,  the Executive Order was enacted with a discriminatory purpose and has a \ndiscriminatory effect on followers of the Muslim faith, including citizens of the United States.  A \nlaw that is discriminatory in its purpose violates the Constitution's Equal Protection command. \nSee  Washington v.  Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976); Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. 252.  Courts can \ninfer discriminatory purpose from the \"impact of the official action,\" Arlington Heights,  429 \nU.S. at 266, and the \"historical background of the decision.\" /d. at 267. Here, the evidence of \ndiscriminatory purpose is overwhelming. President Trump campaigned on the explicit promise of \nimplementing  a  \"Muslim  ban.\"  Rudolph  Giuliani  revealed  in  media  appearances  that  the \nExecutive order was crafted to effectuate just such a ban.  A high ranking Justice Department \nofficial declined to enforce the Order because of its discriminatory origins.  And the Order itself \ndisadvantages  Muslims  nearly  exclusively  while  creating  a  gerrymandered  exception  for \nChristians. \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 14 of 23\nPlaintiffs  can  show  a substantial  likelihood  of success  on the  merits  of their Equal \nProtection claim. \nB.  The Executive Order Violates the Establishment Clause. \n\"The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination \ncannot be officially preferred over another.\"  Larson v.  Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982).  Thus, \nwhere a law \"grant[s] a denominational preference, our precedents demand that we treat the law \nas suspect and that we apply strict scrutiny in adjudging its constitutionality.\"  /d.  at 246.  In \nLarson,  the  law at  issue  did not mention any  religious  denomination by name,  but drew a \ndistinction between religious groups based on the percentage of their revenue received from non \nmembers, which had the effect of harming certain religious groups.  /d. at 231-32. Because the \nlaw was focused on religious entities and had the effect of distinguishing between them in a way \nthat favored some, the Court applied strict scrutiny.  /d. at 246-47. These same principles apply \nwhere, as here the law attempts to use neutral language to systematically disadvantage members \nof the targeted religion. See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,  Inc.  v.  Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 \n(1993). \nAs  described above, the  Executive Order was designed in a poor attempt to  create a \n\"legal\" Muslim Ban.  The rhetoric used surrounding the Muslim Ban, the Executive Order's \nexception for Christian minorities, and the disparate impact on both Muslim visa holders and \ntheir legal permanent resident family members show that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the \nmerits. \nC.  The Executive Order Violates Due Process. \nDue Process requires that arriving immigrants be afforded those statutory rights granted \nby Congress and minimum due process rights attach to statutory rights.  Diah v.  Ashcroft, 353 \nF.3d 228, 239 (3d Cir. 2003).  In particular, those with valid immigrant visas (who will become \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 15 of 23\nlawful  permanent residents  upon  arrival)  entering the  United  States  have  constitutional  due \nprocess rights with respect to their entry.  The Fifth Amendment protects all persons who have \nentered the United States \"from deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of \nlaw.\" Mathews v.  Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 69, 77 (1976) (internal citation omitted). This protection \napplies to  all persons within our borders,  regardless of immigration status. ld.  (Due Process \nClause  of the  Fifth  Amendment  extends  even to  those  \"whose  presence  in this  country  is \nunlawful, involuntary, or transitory\"); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001).  The denial \nof entry of valid visaholders, without an opportunity to be heard, is a prima facie violation of \nthose  due  process  principles.  The  Executive  Order  provides  that  all  individuals  from  the \nimpacted countries be denied entry to the United States, irrespective of their immigration status. \nOn its face, the Order bars legal permanent residents from impacted countries from reentry into \nthe United States if they travel aboard.  The de facto travel ban denies Plaintiffs the right to \nconnect with their families, \"a right that ranks high among the interests of the individual.\"  See \nKent v.  Dulles, 357 U.S.  116,  125 (1958).  The denial of entry to all persons from the seven \naffected countries, irrespective of immigration status, and resulting travel ban violate the due \nprocess rights of legal permanent residents and visaholders. \nD.  The Executive Order Violates the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nPlaintiffs are likely to establish that the Executive Order violates the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA).  Enacted in  1965,  8 U.S.C.  § 1152(a)(l)(A) states,  \"no person shall \nreceive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant \nvisa because of the person's race,  sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\" By \nsuspending entry of immigrants holding legal  visas  from  Iraq,  Iran,  Libya,  Somalia,  Sudan, \nSyria, and Yemen, for 90 days, the Executive Order violates the INA.  While the INA refers only \nto discrimination in the issuance of an immigrant visa the statute would be rendered meaningless \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 16 of 23\nif it did not equally prohibit denials of an immigrant's entry into the country altogether. See \nLegal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers v.  Dep 't of State, 45 F.3d 469, 473 (D.C. Cir. \n1995)  (holding  that  Congress,  in  enacting  Section  1152,  \"unambiguously  directed  that  no \nnationality-based  discrimination  shall  occur\")  Gudgement  vacated  on  other  grounds  in  US. \nDepartment ofS tate v. Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers, 117 S. Ct. 37 8 (1996)). \nDefendants may argue that the President has power to suspend the entry of any class of \naliens when their entry is detrimental to the interests of the United States.  See  8 U.S.C.  § \n1182(f).  Section 1182, however, was enacted in 1952, nearly a decade before Section 1152. The \nenactment of the INA in 1965, including Section 1152, marked a \"profound change\" in the law \nby  abolishing  the  national  origin  quota  system,  establishing  a  uniform  quota  system,  and \nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of race and national origin.  Olsen v.  Albright, 990 F. \nSupp. 31, 37 (D.D.C. 1997) (citing Pub. L. No. 89-236).  Passed alongside the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 and the Voti~g Rights Act of 1965, the legislative history ofthe INA \"is replete with the \nbold anti-discriminatory principles of the Civil Rights Era.\" Olsen, 990 F.  Supp.  at 37.  It is \ninconceivable that,  in  enacting  anti-discrimination provisions in  1965,  Congress intended to \nleave the President with the ability to adopt the same sort of overtly discriminatory measures \nCongress was outlawing.  In addition, this interpretation would render Section 1152 a nullity, as \nthe President could waive it at any time for any reason.  See Legal Assistance for Vietnamese \nAsylum Seekers, 45 F.3d at 473.  Under Plaintiffs' proposed interpretation, however, the statutes \ncan be read together and both serve a purpose.  The President can still bar certain classes of \naliens from the United States-just not based on those classes provided in Section 1182. \nE.  The Executive Order Violates the Administrative Procedures Act. \nDefendants actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 17 of 23\nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; and without observance \nof procedure required by law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (AP A), 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 706(2)(A)-(D). \nThe scope of this Court's review is delineated by 5 U.S.C. § 706, which provides that the \n\"reviewing court shall ... hold unlawful and set aside agency action ... found to be \"(A) \narbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of discretion,  or otherwise  not  in  accordance  with law;  (B) \ncontrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity;  (C)  in  excess  of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; ... [or] (D) without observance \nof procedure required by law ....\"   5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (emphasis added). The APA provides \nfurther that, \"[t]o the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall \ndecide all relevant questions of law,  interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and  13 \ndetermine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.\"  /d.  § 706 (emphasis \nadded). \nDefendants actions were based solely pursuant to the Executive Order, which expressly \ndiscriminates against Plaintiff on the basis  of their country of origin and  was  substantially \nmotivated by animus toward Muslims, in violation of the equal protection component of the Due \nProcess  Clause of the  Fifth Amendment,  as  outlined above.  The  Executive  Order exhibits \nhostility  to  a  specific  religious  faith,  Islam,  and  gives  preference  to  other religious  faiths, \nprincipally Christianity.  Respondents' actions were therefore \"contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity,\" in violation of § 706(2)(B).  Further, as discussed above, the \nINA forbids discrimination in issuance of visas based on a person's race, nationality, place of \nbirth, or place of residence.  8 U.S.C. § 1152(a)(l)(A).  As set forth above, Defendants' actions \nalso violated procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which \n17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 18 of 23\ntherefore  violate  §  706(2)(D)  of the  AP A,  which  prohibits  agency  action  taken  ''without \nobservance of procedure required by law.\"  For all of the reasons  set forth  in this  section, \nDefendants' challenged actions were ''arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law.\"  5 U.S.C.  § 706(2)(A).  In addition,  Defendants'  actions were \narbitrary and capricious for their failure to consider \"all relevant issues and factors.\"  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v.  State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.  Co., 463 U.S. 29, 48--49 (1983).  Under State \nFarm,  for  an agency action to  survive arbitrary-and-capricious review,  it \"must examine the \nrelevant  data  and  articulate  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  its  action  including  a  rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\"  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (internal \nquotation omitted). This \"hard look\" standard exceeds the \"rational basis\" standard applied under \nthe Due Process Clause.  !d.  at 43  n.9.  Here,  the government has failed to  consider many \nrelevant issues and factors, including evidence regarding the low risk to U.S. citizens posed by \nimmigrants like Plaintiffs who have already been seriously vetted for several years,  and the \nrelative risk presented by those arriving on different visa categories. \nIII.  Plaintiffs Are Suffering and Will Continue to Suffer Irreparable Harm Due to the \nExecutive Order. \nAn  irreparable  injury  \"must  be  both  certain  and  great;  it  must  be  actual  and  not \ntheoretical.\"  Wise.  Gas Co.  v.  FERC, 758 F.2d 669,  674 (D.C.  Cir.  1985). Additionally, the \ninjury must be beyond monetary remediation.  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v.  England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297-98 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing Wise. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674.)  A party need not \nshow,  however,  that  \"rigor  mortis  will  set  in  forthwith\"  absent  the  requested  relief.  See \nMassachusetts Law Reform Inst. v. Legal Services Corp., 581 F. Supp. 1179, 1188 (D.D.C. 1984) \n(internal citations omitted). \n18 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 19 of 23\nFirst, because Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on their Establishment \nClause claim, harm is presumed.  See Chaplaincy ofF  ull Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d \n290, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\"[W]here a movant alleges a violation of the Establishment Clause, \nthis  is  sufficient,  without  more,  to  satisfy  the  irreparable  harm  prong  for  purposes  of the \npreliminary injunction determination.\").  Second, Raghimi and Abdille planned travel to  the \nUnited States, and upended their lives in their home countries, in reliance on the United States' \npromise that they  would be  allowed  to  enter the  country.  Intending to  become permanent \nresidents, as their visas allowed, they sold belongings and property.  They paid fees and went \nthrough a years-long vetting process.  Yet now, so close to being united as families, they have \n~een turned  away,  and  are  bearing  significant emotional  and  financial  costs  sustaining  the \nseparation they believed was coming to an end.  Additionally, Nimo, child of Plaintiffs lye and \nAbdille,  desperately  needs  medical  care  that  she  cannot  receive  promptly  without grant  of \nimmediate injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if immediate injunctive relief \ndoes not issue. \nIV.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Favor Relief Now. \nAfter concluding that Plaintiffs satisfy the first two factors, the traditional stay inquiry \nthen calls for assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest.  Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  The last two stay factors, considering the impact of the stay \non the other party and considering the public interest, merge in immigration cases beca~se the \nRespondent is both the opposing litigant and the public interest representative.  Id.  As noted in \nNken, \"there is a public interest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, particularly \nto countries where they are likely to face substantial harm.\"  ld. at 436.  While Nken notes that \nthe public's interest in \"prompt execution of removal  orders\"  is  greater where \"the alien is \n19 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 20 of 23\nparticularly dangerous\" or \"has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing the process provided \nto him,\" neither of those concerns are present in this case.  !d. \nIn this case, the balance tips sharply in favor of Plaintiffs.  The balance of equities and \npublic  interest  always  favor  \"prevent[ing]  the  violation  of a  party's  constitutional  rights.\" \nMelendres v.  Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990,  1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitte~). \nPlaintiffs face substantially unstable situations away from the United States.  There is not harm \nin allowing them to enter the United States given the many years of vetting they have already \ngone through.  Given the discriminatory nature of the Executive Order and the humanitarian \ninterests in l.mifying the family, an injunction is also in the public interest. \nV.  Every District Court That Has Addressed Similar Issues Has Issued Injunctive \nRelief. \nSeveral similar cases have been filed around the Country in the last week.  Counsel has \nnot reviewed all of them in depth-more than fifty cases have been filed.  But in every action \nthat Counsel is aware of where a court has made similar considerations, the court has come to the \nsame conclusion and has issued a temporary restraining order.  See Darweesh v.  Trump, No. \n1: 17-cv-00480 (E.D.N.Y filed Jan. 28, 2017) (enjoining, nationwide, defendants from removing \nindividuals with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant \nvisas,  and  any  other  individuals  legally  authorized  to  enter  the  United  States.);  see  also \nTootkaboni v.  Trump, No. 17-cv-10154 (D. Mass. filed Jan. 29, 2017); see also Aziz v.  Trump, \nNo.  1:17-cv-116 (E.D.  Va.  filed Jan.  28, 2017) (similar injunction, but limited to the Dulles \nInternational Airport.); see also Mohammed v.  Trump, No. CV 17-00786 (C.D. Ca. filed Jan. 31, \n2017) (enjoining defendants, nationwide, from removing, detaining, or blocking the entry of \npersons with a valid immigrant visa.); see also Doe v.  Trump, No.  17-cv-00126 (W.D. Wash. \nfiled  Jan.  28,  2017)  (enjoining  respondents  from  removing  the  petitioners);  see  also  Arab \n20 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 21 of 23\nAmerican  Civil  Rights  League  v.  Trump,  No.  17-10310  (E.D.  Mich.  filed  Feb.  3,  2017) \n(permanently enjoining application of the Executive Order against lawful permanent residents of \nthe United States.). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary \nrestraining order. \nDated: February 3, 2017  COHEN MILSTEIN SELLERS &  TOLL \nPL~-\nK.itAPiefSOil{DE.o~23) \nS.

ZADEH, SAMANEH  Civil Action No. \nRAGHIMI, MOHAMED lYE, and SAIDO A. \nABDILLE, \nPlaintiffs, \nvs.  [PROPOSED] TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity \nas President of the United States of America; \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA; UNITED \nSTATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND \nSECURITY; UNITED STATES \nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION \nSERVICES; UNITED STATES \nDEPARTMENT OF STATE; U.S. \nCUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL; \nDANA J.

The Court has considered the motion and documents filed therewith, \nincluding Plaintiffs' Complaint seeking injunctive relief and/or a writ of mandamus, and the \narguments  of counsel  provided  at  an emergency hearing held __,   at _ __ a.m./p.m. \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2-2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 2 of 3\nHaving  considered  the  foregoing,  the  Court  hereby  enters  the  following  finds  of fact  and \nconclusions of law. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  Plaintiffs face an immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and \nimplementation of the Executive Order by Defendant President Donald J. Trump on January 27, \n2017.  These injuries are ongoing and significant. \n2.  The claims in Plaintiffs' complaint are likely to succeed on the merits. \n3.  A temporary restraining order against Defendants, as provided below, is necessary \nuntil a determination ofthe merits of Plaintiffs' claims can be held. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n4.  The Court has jurisdiction over Defendants and the subject matter of this action. \n5.  Plaintiffs'  efforts to  contact Defendants reasonably and  substantially complied \nwith the requirements ofFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 65(b) and LCvR 65.1. \n6.  The  Court  deems  no  security  bond  is  required  under  Federal  Rule  of Civil \nProcedure 65(c). \n7.  To obtain a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs must establish (1) that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm is likely in the \nabsence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs' favor; and (4 ) that \nan injunction is in the public interest.  See Singh v.  Carter, 168 F. Supp. 3d 216, 223 (D.D.C. \n2016). \n8.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, there is a strong likelihood that \nPlaintiffs  will  succeed  on  the  merits  of their  claims  and  irreparable  injury  is  likely  if the \nrequested restraining order is not issued. \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 2-2   Filed 02/03/17   Page 3 of 3\n9.  The balance of equities tips toward the Plaintiffs and the public interest weighs in \nfavor of entering temporary relief. \nNow, therefore, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n1.  Defendants  and  their  officers,  agents,  servants,  employees  and  attorneys,  and \npersons  in  active  concert  or  participation  with  them  are  hereby  fully  ENJOINED  AND \nRESTRAINED  from  enforcing  Defendant  President  Donald  J.  Trump's  January  27,  2017 \nExecutive Order by removing, detaining, or blocking the entry of Plaintiffs to the United States; \n2.  Defendants and Defendant United States Department of State in particular, are \nhereby  ENJOINED  AND  RESTRAINED  from  cancelling  validly  obtained  and  disused \nimmigrant visas of Plaintiffs; \n3.  Defendants  are  hereby  ORDERED  to  IMMEDIATELY  inform  all  relevant \nairport, airline, and other authorities that Plaintiffs are permitted to travel to the United States on \ntheir valid imniigrant visas; and \n4.  Defendants shall remain enjoined until an expedited hearing can be held at __ \na.m./p.m. on_ day of __ 2017. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated:  February 3, 2017 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGE \n3 ",

R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1)(A), Donald J. Trump, et al. (“Defendants”), by and \nthrough the undersigned counsel, respectfully request this enlargement of time until midday \n(12:00pm) tomorrow, February 5, 2017, to file Defendants’ Opposition to the Emergency Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining Order filed by Farshid M. Zadeh, et al. (“Plaintiffs”).  In support \nhereof, Defendants state the following: \n1.  Plaintiffs commenced this action for “emergency declaratory and injunctive \nrelief”, ECF No. 1 at 1, seeking an order “to permit Plaintiffs lawful entry into the United States \npursuant to the terms of their immigrant visas.”  Id. at 18-19.  The action is allegedly “in \nresponse to President Donald Trump’s unconstitutional and unlawful executive order barring \nentry into the United States by nationals of seven majority-Muslin countries.”  Id. at 1.   \n  2.  After the close of business yesterday, Defendants learned that the Court had \nordered a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for Monday at 2 p.m. and that the Government’s \nOpposition to Plaintiffs’ motion is due today at 8 p.m.  Due to the nature and complexity of the \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 6   Filed 02/04/17   Page 2 of 5\nissues involved in this action as well as the fact that there are several other similar actions filed \nacross the Country along with various related court orders (at least one referenced by this Court), \nDefendants respectfully request this enlargement of time until midday tomorrow to file an \nOpposition to Plaintiffs’ emergency motion.   \n  3.  Pursuant to LCvR 7(m), the undersigned conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel who \ngraciously consented only to this request for an enlargement of time until midday tomorrow to \nfile Defendants’ Opposition.   \n  4.  However, in the course of conferring with Plaintiffs’ counsel, the undersigned \nlearned that, of the two couples who are Plaintiffs in this action, one of the spouses is supposed \nto arrive in Minnesota around midday tomorrow (Sunday).  Per the express terms of Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint, if this spouse that is scheduled to arrive tomorrow is granted “entry,” the emergency \nrelated to that couple would be rendered moot. \n  5.   The undersigned also learned that a spouse in the other couple is scheduled to \narrive, also in Minnesota, around 3 p.m. on Monday afternoon.  Plaintiffs’ motion hearing is \nscheduled for 2 p.m.  If that spouse is granted “entry,” that emergency claim, too, would be \nrendered moot.  \n  WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant the requested relief.  \nA proposed Order reflecting the requested relief is respectfully attached for the Court’s \nconsideration, but a Minute Order would be just as welcome if the Court prefers. \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 6   Filed 02/04/17   Page 3 of 5\nFebruary 4, 2017         Respectfully submitted, \n \n \nCHANNING D.

ZADEH, SAMANEH \nRAGHIMI, MOHAMED lYE, and SAIDO \nA.ABDILLE,  Civil Action No. \nPlaintiffs, \nCOMPLAINT \nvs. \nDONALD J. TRUMP, President of the \nUnited States of America; UNITED \nSTATES OF AMERICA; UNITED \nSTATES DEPARTMENT OF \nHOMELAND SECURITY; UNITED \nSTATES CITIZENSHIP AND \nIMMIGRATION SERVICES; UNITED \nSTATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE; U.S. \nCUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL; \nDANA J.

Plaintiff \nRAGHIMI is a citizen of Iran and holds a valid Irani passport; she is married to Plaintiff \nZADEH.  Plaintiff lYE  is  a United States  Citizen and resident of the United  States. \nPlaintiff ABDll..LE is  a citizen of Somalia and holds a valid Somali passport;  she is \nmarried to  Plaintiff lYE.  Plaintiffs  ZADEH  and  lYE  both  filed  1-130  and  obtained \napproved Petitions for  alien relatives with United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (\"USCIS\") with respect to Plaintiffs RAGIHMI and ABDll..LE. \nAfter  navigating  and  fully  complying  with  all  of  the  rigorous  procedural \nrequirements and security background checks that make up US CIS's petitioning process \nand the STATE DEPARTMENT'S visa issuance process, Defendant UNITED STATES \nOF AMERICA-by and through the collective actions  of all  other named Defendant \nentities and individuals acting in their official capacities, as well as their agents, servants, \nofficers,  employees  and  legal  counselors,  and  all  persons  acting  in  participation  or \nconcert with them or under their direction and/or command--determined that Plaintiffs \ndo  not  pose  a  security  threat  to  the  United  States.  Accordingly,  THE  STATE \nDEPART~NT issued Plaintiffs RAGHIMI  and ABDILLE valid immigrant visas to \nenter  the  United  States.  Ms.  RAGHIMI  obtained  her  visa  in  Ankara,  Turkey  on \nNovember 18,2016.  Ms. ABDILLE obtained her visa on January 18,2017. \nOn Friday,  January 27,  2017,  newly elected Defendant President DONALD J. \nTRUMP (hereinafter referred to interchangeably as  \"President\" and \"TRUMP\") signed \nan Executive Order entitled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the \nUnited States\" (the \"Executive Order\").  In the wake of the execution of the Executive \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 3 of 21\nOrder,  Defendants have announced or have been directed to unlawfully implement a \nmoratorium on refugees and valid visa holders from seven countries from entering the \nUnited  States:  Iran,  Iraq,  Libya,  Somalia,  Sudan,  Syria  and  Yemen  (the  \"seven \ncountries\").  The Executive Order is unlawful as applied to Plaintiffs, as it violates their \nrights  under  (1)  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the  Fourteenth Amendment  (which \napplies  to  the  federal  government  through  the  Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fifth \nAmendment, see Bolling v.  Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954)); (2) the Establishment Clause \nof the First Amendment; (3) the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (4) the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 500, et seq. \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the relief being sought herein to \nredress the extreme hardship and irreparable injury that Plaintiffs have suffered and will \ncontinue to suffer because of Defendants' unlawful actions. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  the  following \nprovisions: 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (because questions of federal law are present); 5 U.S.C. § \n701,  et  seq.  (Administrative -Procedure  Act),  and  28  U.S.C.  §  2201  (Declaratory \nJudgment Act). \n2.  This Court also has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to compel \nagency action under 28  U.S.C.  §  1361  as  Plaintiffs'  claims  are  against  officers  and \nemployees of the United States and agencies thereof. \n3.  There are no administrative remedies available to Plaintiffs to redress their \ngrievances  described  in  this  Complaint.  This  action  challenges  (1)  Defendants' \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 4 of 21\nprocedural policies, practices, interpretations of law and their actions or failures to act; \nand  (2)  Defendants'  substantive  policies  and  practices  insofar  as  those  policies  and \npractices violate Plaintiffs' rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (which applies to the federal government through the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment, see Bolling v.  Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954)), the Fifth Amendment \nDue Process Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and other relevant provisions of \nlaw.  This  action  does  not  challenge  the  mere  discretionary  granting  or  denial  of \nindividual  petitions  or  applications.  Therefore,  the  jurisdictional  limitations  under  5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2) and 8 U.S.C. § 1252 do not apply. \n4.  Venue is proper in the District of Columbia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause the Defendants named herein reside in the district. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nPlaintiffs \n5.  Plaintiff Farshid ZADEH  is  a  lawful  permanent resident  of the  United \nStates. He currently resides in Minnesota. His wife, Plaintiff Sameneh RAGHIMI, was \nrecently a Professor of Industrial Design at Azad University in Mashadd, Iran, before \nresigning her position to  move to the United  States.  They have  been married since \nNovember 2013.  They have seen each other only intermittently since their wedding, as \nZADEH lives and works in the United States and RAGHIMI had lived and worked in \nIran. \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 5 of 21\n6.  RAGIDMI  petitioned for  an  I-130  immigrant visa.  RAGIDMI'S  I-130 \nPetition was approved. Plaintiff ZADEH was at all times relevant the husband of Plaintiff \nRAGIDMI-the principal beneficiary on an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative. \n7.  RAGHIMI  then  underwent,  adhered  to  and  fully  complied  with \nDefendants' rigorous policies, procedures and security background checks, including but \nnot limited to: payment of all relevant fees to USCIS, National Visa center and the State \nDepartment;  providing  fingerprints  and  biometric  data  to  the  Department  of State; \nproviding all the requisite documentation required by Defendants; and an interview of \nRAGHIMI  at  the  United  States  Embassy  in  Ankara,  Turkey  by  Defendant  U.S. \nDEPARTMENT OF STATE. \n8.  Issuance by Defendant U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE of an immigrant \nvisa to an applicant for such a visa authorizes the visa's holder to enter the United States \nas a lawful permanent resident, also known as a green card holder. \n9.  Lawful  Permanent  Residents  have  the  same  rights,  responsibilities  and \nprotections as United States Citizens, save some exceptions, such as the right to vote in \nstate and federal elections. \n10.  On  November  18,  2016  Defendant  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  STATE \nissued RAGHIMI an F21 immigrant visa to enter the United States as a lawful permanent \nresident. \n11.  In anticipation of beginning a new life with her husband in the United \nStates, RAGHIMI quit her job as  a professor at Azad University.  She terminated her \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 6 of 21\nhousing lease, and sold her car and many of her personal belongings in preparation for \nthe move. \n12.  ZADEH and RAGHIMI left Tehran, Iran on January 27, 2017, for the first \nleg of their flight to the United States.  While they were in flight, Defendant TRUMP \nsigned the Executive Order.  When the couple landed in Amsterdam, Netherlands, a U.S. \nCustoms or Immigration agent notified RAGHIMI that she would not be allowed to fly to \nthe United States.  ZADEH was informed, on the other hand, that he could return to the \nUnited States. \n13.  Given the  cost of the international tickets,  and the need for ZADEH to \nreturn to the United States so that he could complete the last requirements to make him \neligible for citizenship, the couple quickly decided that ZADEH should continue on and \nRAGHIMI  would  return to  Tehran  alone.  ZADEH  and  RAGHIMI  rushed  to  make \narrangements  for  RAGHIMI  to  return  to  Tehran before ZADEH's flight  left  for  the \nUnited States.  The couple had just a brief moment to hug and say a tearful farewell \nbefore ZARED boarded his plane and left RAGHIMI behind. \n14.  Plaintiff Mohamed lYE was born in Somalia and became a U.S. citizen in \n2010.  He married Plaintiff Saido ABDILLE  in Nairobi,  Kenya,  in  September 2011. \nABDILLE and lYE have two children together.  Both children are U.S. Citizens.  One \nchild, Ni.S., was born in July 2012.  The other, Na.S., was born in November 2014.  Ni.S. \nhas microcephaly and requires special medical care.  ABDILLE, Ni.S., and Na.S. live \ntogether in Nairobi, Kenya. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 7 of 21\n15.  lYE was  at all  times  relevant the husband  of ABDILLE-the principal \nbeneficiary on an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative.  In February 2012, lYE filed the 1-\n130  Petition  for  ABDILLE  to  come  to  the  United  States  on  an  immigrant  visa. \nABDILLE'S 1-130 Petition was approved. \n16.  ABDILLE then underwent, adhered to and fully complied with Defendants' \nrigorous policies, procedures and security background checks, including but not limited \nto: payment of all relevant fees to USCIS, National Visa center and the State Department; \nproviding all the requisite documentation required by Defendants; providing fingerprints \nand biometric data to the Department of State; and an interview of Plaintiff ABDILLE at \nthe United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, by Defendant U.S. DEPARTMENT OF \nSTATE. \n17.  It took almost 5 years of screening and vetting, but on January 18, 2017, \nDefendant U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE issued ABDILLE an IR1 visa to enter the \nUnited States as a lawful permanent resident.  Plans were made for ABDILLE, Ni.S., and \nNa.S., to leave Nairobi and join lYE in Minnesota, and a trip was booked for February 4, \n2017. \n18.  On January 28, 2017, in the wake of the Executive Order, ABDILLE went \nto the Nairobi offices of KLM Airlines to confirm that she and her children would be \nallowed to travel to the U.S.  They were informed that, because of the Executive Order, \nthey would not be able to board their February 4, 2017 flight to Amsterdam. \n19.  The lease on ABDILLE's apartment terminates on February 4, 2017, and \nthe family has nowhere to go after that date.  Neither ABDILLE nor lYE have any other \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 8 of 21\nfamily living in Nairobi.  The cost of a hotel will be prohibitive for the family.  Further, \nNi.S. desperately needs medical care for her condition.  She cannot receive the care she \nneeds in Nairobi. \n20.  As a result of the Executive Order and restriction on entry into the United \nStates by ABDILLE, Defendants are refusing to allow ABDILLE to  enter the United \nStates. \nDefendants \n21.  Defendant UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is the sovereign entity with \nthe power and constitutional mandate to  adhere to  and  enforce the provisions  of the \nUnited States Constitution and all federal laws and regulations of the United States of \nAmerica, including those provisions of the Constitution and laws and regulations of the \nUnited States herein enumerated. \n22.  Defendant DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (\"DHS\") is the \noverarching Federal Agency of the Executive Branch of the United States Government \nthat  has  been  delegated  the  authority  over,  inter  alia,  (1)  visa  applications  and \napplications to adjust status, including coordinating the timely completion of background \nchecks with the Federal Bureau of Investigation; (2) immigration generally; (3) customs; \nand (4) border security. \n23.  Defendant  UNITED  STATES  CITIZENSHIP  AND  IMMIGRATION \nSERVICES (\"USCIS\") is a bureau within DHS, and is the agency charged with direct \nand immediate responsibility for the proper and timely adjudication of visa applications \nand applications to adjust status. \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 9 of 21\n24.  Defendant U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE is the Agency responsible for \nthe international relations of the United States and consular visa processing. \n25.  Defendant  U.S.  CUSTOMS  AND  BORDER  PATROL  (\"CBP\")  is  the \nAgency  responsible  for  enforcing  United  States  regulations,  including  customs  and \nimmigration. \n26.  Defendant President DONALD J.  TRUMP is the President of the United \nStates of America.  Defendant President TRUMP is the official of the Executive Branch \nof Defendant UNITED STATES OF AMERICA who possesses the authority to execute \nlawful  executive  orders,  and  who  did  in  fact  sign  and  execute  the  above-described \nExecutive Order on January 27, 2017.  This action is brought against Defendant TRUMP \nin his official capacity. \n27.  Defendant DANA J.  BOENTE is the Acting Attorney General,  and this \naction is brought against him in his official capacity.  The Attorney General is the head of \nthe United States Department of Justice, which is  concerned with legal affairs  of the \nUnited States of America. \n28.  Defendant JOHN KELLY is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (\"DHS\"), and this action is brought against him in his official capacity.  DHS is \nthe agency responsible for implementing the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). \nDefendant JOHN KELLY is generally charged with the enforcement of the INA and is \nresponsible for implementing the provisions of the INA.  Defendant JOHN KELLY is \nfurther authorized to delegate such powers and authority to subordinate DHS employees. \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a); 8 C.P.R.§ 2.1. \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 10 of 21\n29.  Defendant LORI SCIALABBA is the Acting Director ofUSCIS, an agency \nwithin and under the purview of DHS, to which the Secretary's authority has, in part, \nbeen delegated,  and this  action is  being brought against her  in her official  capacity. \nDefendant  LORI  SCIALABBA,  as  Acting  Director  of USCIS,  is  subject  to  the \nSecretary's  supervision.  Defendant Acting  Director LORI  SCIALABBA  is  generally \ncharged  with  the  overall  administration  of  immigration  benefits  and  immigration \nservices.  See 8 C.F.R. §100.2(a). \n30.  Defendant  KEVIN  K.  McALEENAN  is  the  Acting  Commissioner  of \nUnited States Customs and Border Patrol and this action is being brought against him in \nhis official capacity. \nThe Executive Order \n31.  Defendant TRUMP signed the above-described Executive Order on January \n27, 2017.  The Executive Order purports to \"protect the American people from terrorist \nattacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.\" \n32.  The Executive Order is based on a purported threat of terrorism at the hands \nof  foreign  nationals,  and,  pursuant  to  the  purported  threat,  imposes  substantial \nmodifications to the policies and procedures governing the admission of non-citizens to \nthe United States: \na.  A 120-day moratorium on the United States Refugee Resettlement Program \n(\"US RAP\"); \n10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 11 of 21\nb.  An  indefmite  suspension  of Syrian  national  refugees  from  entering the \nUnited States, and the substantial reduction of all refugee entrants to the United States \nfrom over 100,000 to no more than 50,000 for fiscal year 2017; \nc.  The  90-day suspension  of \"immigrant and  nonimmigrant entry  into  the \nUnited States of aliens from  countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA,  8 \nU.S.C.  1187(a)(12)\"  (because  such  entry  would  purportedly  \"be  detrimental  to  the \ninterests of the United States\"). See Executive Order§ 3(c). \n33.  Nations  meeting the  criteria listed at INA  Section 217(a)(12),  8 U.S.C. \nSection  1187(a)(12), include the  following  seven nations:  Iran,  Iraq,  Libya,  Somalia, \nSudan, Syria and Yemen (the \"seven countries\").  Executive Order Section 3(c) suspends \nentry  into  the  United  States  by  non-United  States  Citizen  \"immigrant[s]  and \nnonimmigrant[s]\" for 90 days. \n34.  The  moratorium  on  and  curtailment  of refugees,  as  well  as  the  freeze \nimposed  on  immigrants  and  nonimmigrants  deriving  from  the  seven  countries  from \nentering the United States was made by proclamation alone,  and is  not based on any \nquantitative or qualitative analysis. \n35.  The United States Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (\"OLC\") \nappears to  have  subjected the Executive Order to  only the  most bare-bones  (if any) \nreview for its constitutionality.  The January 27, 2017 OLC Memorandum evaluating the \nExecutive Order is slightly more than one page in length.  It catalogues the purported \naims of the Executive Order and then conCludes, baldly, that \"[t]he proposed Order is \napproved with respect to form and legality.\" \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 12 of 21\n36.  Notwithstanding this bare-bones approval from OLC, on January 30, 2017, \nActing Attorney General Sally Q. Yates issued a written statement regarding the Order, \nwhich explained: \"My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of \nJustice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is \nafter consideration of all the facts.  In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the \npositions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to \nalways seek justice and stand for what is right.  At present, I am not convinced that the \ndefense  of the  Executive  Order  is  consistent  with  these  responsibilities,  nor  am  I \nconvinced that the Executive Order is  lawful.  Consequently, for as  long as I  am the \nActing Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense \nof the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do \nso.\" \n3 7.  TRUivfP fired Acting Attorney General Yates on January 30, 20 17, just a \nfew hours after Yates issued the written statement criticizing the Executive Order and \ncalling its legality into question. \n38.  On  February  1,  2017,  in  response  to  the  \"reasonable  uncertainty\"  and \n\"confusion\" regarding the scope of the Executive Order, Donald F. McGahn, Counsel to \nthe  President,  issued  a  \"Memorandum  to  the  Acting  Secretary  of State,  the  Acting \nAttorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security,\" which purported to provide \n\"Authoritative Guidance\" on the Executive Order. \n39.  McGahn's  Memorandum  stated:  \"Section  3(c)  of the  Executive  Order \nentitled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\" (Jan. \n12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 13 of 21\n27, 2017) suspends for 90 days the entry into the United States of certain aliens from \ncountries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), \n8  U.S.C.  1187(a)(12).  Section  3(e)  of the  order  directs  the  Secretary  of Homeland \nSecurity, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to submit to the President a list of \ncountries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit \nthe  entry of certain foreign  nationals  from  countries that do  not provide information \nneeded to adjudicate visas, admissions, or other benefits under the INA.  I understand that \nthere has been reasonable uncertainty about whether those provisions apply to  lawful \npermanent residents of the United States.  Accordingly, to remove any confusion, I now \nclarify that Sections 3( c) and 3( e) do not apply to such individuals.  Please immediately \nconvey this interpretive guidance to all individuals responsible for the administration and \nimplementation of the Executive Order.\" \n40.  In other words, individuals currently holding Green Cards are exempt from \nthe Executive Order.  Individuals holding immigrant visas, who will be eligible for and \nreceive Green Cards simply by entering the United States pursuant to their validly issued \nvisas,  are not exempt from  the Executive Order.  McGahn's Memorandum lacks any \nrationale for distinguishing between these two groups. \n41.  Defendant  President  DONALD  J.  1RUMP,  both  in  the  past  and  very \nrecently, promised that as President of the United States he would ban all Muslims from \nentering this country.  The Executive Order and concomitant proclamatory seven-country \nfreeze has a disparate effect on Muslims. The Executive Order is based on discrimination \nand animus against Muslims. \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 14 of 21\n42.  On or about December 7, 2015, Defendant, and then-presidential candidate \nTRUMP, referring to himself in the third person, publicly stated: \"Donald J.  Trump is \ncalling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States ....\"  \n43.  TRUMP's  campaign  surrogate  Rudolph  Giuliani  confirmed  that  the \nExecutive Order is meant to serve as a Muslim ban, with the Order's seven-country scope \nacting as a fig leaf to obscure the Order's obvious unconstitutionality. \n44.  In a January 28, 2017 interview with Fox News, Giuliani was asked, \"How \ndid the president decide the seven countries?\"  He responded, \"I'll tell you the whole \nhistory of it.  So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me \nup.  He said,  'Put a commission together.  Show me the right way to do  it legally.'  \" \nGiuliani explained that he convened a \"whole group of other very expert lawyers on \nthis,\" including former U.S. attorney general Michael Mukasey, Rep. Mike McCaul (R \nTex.) and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).  \"And what we did was, we focused on, instead \nof religion, danger - the areas of the world that create danger for us . . . Which is a \nfactual basis, not a religious basis.  Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible.  And that's what \nthe ban is based on.  It's not based on religion.  It's based on places where there are \nsubstantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.\" \n45.  The Executive Order further prioritizes admittance into the United States of \nreligious  minorities  deriving  from  and  suffering  religious  persecution  in  the  seven \nenumerated countries.  See Executive Order§§ 5(b), (e). \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 15 of 21\n46.  No similar prioritization was included in the Executive Order or otherwise \nannounced for Muslim minorities in countries with a non-Muslim religious majority (e.g., \nMyanmar, Israel, China, etc.). \n4 7.  The  Executive  Order  affords  preferential  treatment to  Christians,  while \ndenying entry into the United States by valid visa holders or visa applicants in seven \nMuslim-majority countries, further  demonstrating that the Order is  based on religious \ndiscrimination  and/or  animus toward  and  against  (a)  United  States  Citizens pursuing \nfamily reunification with family alien relatives who are Muslim; and (b)  valid United \nStates-visa holding Muslim citizens of the seven countries. \n48.  TRUMP  has  explicitly  stated  that  this  prioritization  provision  of his \nExecutive Order is for the benefit of Christian minorities in Muslim-majority countries. \nOn or about January 29, 2017, an interview between TRUMP and David Brody of the \nChristian Broadcasting Network aired.  During the interview, Mr. Brody asked TRUMP \nwhether he viewed persecuted Christians overseas as a \"priority\" for refugee status, to \nwhich TRUMP  unequivocally replied:  \"Yes.\"  See  also  Michael  D.  Shear &  Helene \nCooper, Trump Bars Refugees and Citizens of7 Muslim Countries, N.Y. Times (Jan. 27, \n2017), (\"[President Trump] ordered that Christians and others from minority religions be \ngranted  priority  over  Muslims.\");  Carol  Morello,  Trump  Signs  Order  Temporarily \nHalting Admission of Refugees,  Promises Priority for Christians, Wash. Post (Jan. 27, \n2017). \n49.  The Executive Order has left Plaintiffs without any administrative options \nfor relief.  As a result, Plaintiffs have been forced to commence suit against Defendants \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 16 of 21\nto seek an Injunction halting Defendants' enforcement of the Executive Order and/or a \nwrit of mandamus compelling Defendants to allow RAGIDMI and ABDILLE to enter the \nUnited States on their valid visas. \nCOUNT ONE \nFIFTH AMENDMENT-EQUAL PROTECTION \n50.  Plaintiffs  repeat and  incorporate by reference  each  and  every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n51.  The  Executive  Order  discriminates  against  Plaintiffs  because  of their \nnational  origin  and  religion,  in  violation  of the  Constitution's  guarantee  of Equal \nProtection. \n52.  Equal Protection requires that similarly-situated individual be treated the \nsame under the law.  The Executive Order discriminates on its face.  It targets exclusively \nresidents of Muslim-majority countries while creating a gerrymandered preference for \nChristian minorities.  Moreover, the Executive order was motivated by animus towards \nmembers  of the  Muslim  faith  and  affects  such  members  almost  exclusively.  As  a \nconsequence, the Executive Order violates Plaintiffs' right to equal protection of the law. \nCOUNT TWO \nFIRST AMENDMENT-ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE \n53.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  incorporate by reference  each  and  every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n54.  The First Amendment's Establishment Clause erects \"a wall of separation \nbetween church and State.\"  Everson v. Bd. ofE  duc., 330 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1947) (quotation \nmarks omitted).  Its \"clearest command\" is \"that one religious denomination cannot be \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 17 of 21\nofficially preferred over another.\"  Larson v.  Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982).  This \nprohibits government action that  discriminates  among religions unless  such  action is \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  !d. at 246-47, 254-55; Awad \nv. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1130-31 (lOth Cir. 2012). \n55.  The  Executive  Order  violates  the  Establishment  Clause  by  creating  a \npreference for one religion and explicitly disfavoring another.  The Executive Order is \nnot narrowly tailored to serve any compelling interest; indeed, the Order was motivated \nby anti-Muslim animus and serves no permissible purpose whatsoever. As a result, the \nExecutive Order violates the Establishment Clause. \nCOUNT THREE \nFIFTH AMENDMENT-DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n56.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  incorporate  by reference  each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n57.  All non-citizens entering the United States are entitled to the protections of \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  See,  e.g., Dia v.  Ashcroft, 353 F.3d \n228, 239 (3d Cir. 2003) (non-citizens must be afforded those statutory rights granted by \nCongress  and \"[m]inimum  due  process  rights  attach  to  statutory rights\");  Landon v. \nPlasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982). \n58.  The Executive Order violates Due Process by prohibiting Plaintiffs, who \nhave been thoroughly vetted and approved and complied with all requirements for entry \nunder  United  States  immigration  law.  The  Order  fails  to  provide  even  minimal \n17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 18 of 21\nprocedural  safeguards,  instead  arbitrarily  blocking  a  vast  swath  of  visa-holders, \npermanent residents, and refugees on the basis of their national origin and religion. \nCOUNT FOUR \nADMINSITRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n59.  Plaintiffs repeat  and  incorporate  by reference  each and every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n60.  The Immigration and Nationality Act forbids  discrimination in issuance of \nvisas based on a person's race, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1152(a)(l)(A). \n61.  Defendants actions in preventing Plaintiffs' travel into the United States \nwere arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw, in violation of APA § 706(2)(A); contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor  immunity,  in  violation  of AP A  §  706(2)(B);  in  excess  of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority or limitations, or short of statutory right, in violation of AP A § 706(2)(C); and \nwithout observance of procedure required by law, in violation of§ 706(2)(D). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray that this Court grant the following relief: \n(1) issue an  injunction and/or writ of mandamus ordering Defendants to permit \nPlaintiffs lawful entry into the United States pursuant to the terms of their immigrant \nVISas; \n(2) enter a judgment declaring that Defendants' refusal to admit Plaintiffs to the \nUnited States is and will be unauthorized by statute and contrary to law; \n18 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00243-TSC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/17   Page 19 of 21\n(3)  declare  that  Sections  3(c),  5(a)-(c),  and  5(e)  of the  Executive  Order  are \nunauthorized by and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States; \n(4) enjoin Defendants from implementing or enforcing Sections 3(c), 5(a)-(c), and \n5(e ) of the Executive Order; and \n(5) grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \nDated: February 3, 2017  ~~::zm SELLERS & TOLL \n-\nKit.
