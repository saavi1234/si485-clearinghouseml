    "summary": "<p>On May 11, 2016, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio filed this lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The plaintiffs sued the Ohio Department of Health under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from cutting off the plaintiffs' access to state and federal funding. </p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that on February 21, 2016, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed a law to bar Ohio Planned Parenthoods from receiving government funding for non-abortion services and programs. The plaintiffs alleged that the funding in question was necessary for vital health and education services used by the men, women, and teenagers of Ohio. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the law violated the First Amendment, and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying funding in retaliation for the plaintiffs' constitutionally protected advocacy for abortion rights. </p><p>On May 23, 2016, Judge Michael R. Barrett granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the defendants from cutting off funding until June 6, 2016. He held in abeyance the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. For the next few months both parties carried out discovery. 188 F.Supp.3d 684.</p><p>On August 12, 2016, Judge Barrett granted the plaintiffs' motions for preliminary and permanent injunctions. The court found that the law in question did violate the plaintiffs' First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights. Judge Barrett permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing the law against the plaintiffs and other similarly situated. 2016 WL 10333130.</p><p>On September 6, 2016, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On April 18, 2018, a unanimous panel of the Sixth Circuit (Circuit Judges Helene N. White, Eugene E. Siler, Jr., and Eric L. Clay) affirmed the district court’s grant of plaintiffs’ motions for judgment on the merits and for a permanent injunction. 888 F.3d 224.</p><p>However, the full court of the Sixth Circuit then voted for a rehearing en banc. On March 13, 2019, Circuit Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, writing for the full court, reversed the district court’s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court found that the plaintiffs did not have a due process right to perform abortions. Furthermore, the court found no evidence that the ban posed an undue burden on a woman’s right to abortion. Although the plaintiffs argued that it had no obligation to establish an undue burden because the funding condition itself was unconstitutional, the court rejected that argument because the plaintiffs—who were providers, not women—did not possess the constitutional right to perform abortion; since there was no constitutional right, there was no unconstitutional condition. Circuit Judge White, who wrote the opinion for the April 2018 panel, dissented. 917 F.3d 908.</p><p>The case was remanded to the district court, but the plaintiff stipulated to dismissal shortly thereafter. The case was officially dismissed on July 1, 2019. This case is now closed. </p>",

Judge Michael R. Barrett \n \nRichard Hodges, et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n  OPINION & ORDER  \n \n  This matter is before the Court upon Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder  and  Preliminary  Injunction.    (Doc.  7).    Defendant  Timothy  Ingram,  Health \nCommissioner, Hamilton County General Health District, has filed a Memorandum in \nOpposition.  (Doc. 16).  Defendant Richard Hodges, Director of the Ohio Department of \nHealth, has also filed a Memorandum in Opposition.  (Doc. 17).  Plaintiffs filed a Reply.  \n(Doc. 18).  The parties agreed to waive oral argument on Plaintiffs’ Motion as to the \ntemporary restraining order.  (Doc. 14). \n  For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order \nand Preliminary Injunction is granted as to the temporary restraining order; and held in \nabeyance as to the preliminary injunction.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs  Planned  Parenthood  of  Greater  Ohio  (“PPGOH”)  and  Planned \nParenthood Southwest Ohio Region (“PPSWO”) filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nbased on an alleged violation of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to associate and \n\nengage in constitutionally protected activities, as well as an alleged violation of Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.    Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  Defendants  Richard  Hodges,  in  his  official \ncapacity as the Director of the Ohio Department of Health (“ODH”), and Timothy Ingram, \nin his official capacity as Health Commissioner, Hamilton County General Health District \n(“Hamilton  County”),  from  enforcing  Ohio  Revised  Code  §  3701.034  or  terminating \nPlaintiffs’ funding pursuant to that provision. \nA. PPGOH and PPSWO \nPlaintiffs operate twenty-eight health centers throughout the State of Ohio. (Doc. \n7-1, Iris E. Harvey Decl. ¶ 9; Doc. 7-2, Jerry H Lawson Decl. ¶ 8).  At three of the health \ncenters,  Plaintiffs  provide  abortion  services  to  women  who  want  to  terminate  a \npregnancy.  (Harvey Decl. ¶ 13; Lawson Decl. ¶ 12).  Plaintiffs also engage in advocacy \nfor a woman’s right to a safe and lawful abortion.  (Harvey Decl. ¶ 15; Lawson Decl. ¶ \n14).    Although  Plaintiffs  are  independent  entities,  they  are  affiliates  of  Planned \nParenthood Federation of America, Inc., which advocates for a woman’s access to \ncomprehensive  reproductive  health  care,  including  abortion.    (Harvey  Decl.  ¶  16; \nLawson Decl. ¶ 15).       \nAt  all  of  their  health  centers,  Plaintiffs  provide  educational  and  counseling \nservices to thousands of women, men, and teens, along with a wide range of health \ncare  services,  including  reproductive  health  and  family-planning  services  and \naccompanying health care services, breast and cervical cancer examinations, testing \nand treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (“STDs”), and relationship, parenting, \nand sex education programs.  (Harvey Decl. ¶ 9; Lawson Decl. ¶ 8). \n2 \n \n\nFor  over  twenty  years,  Plaintiffs  have  received  federally-funded  grants  and \ncontracts administered by the ODH to provide these non-abortion related services.1  \nRelevant  to  the  discussion  here, Plaintiffs have  received  funds  under the following \nprograms:  (1)  The  Infertility  Prevention  Project/STD  Prevention  Program,  a  federal \nprogram  that  subsidizes  diagnostic  tests  and  treatments  for  STDs.  Through  this \nprogram,  PPGOH  provides  approximately  64,300  STD  tests  annually  and  PPSWO \nprovides approximately 3,970 STD tests annually. (Harvey Decl. ¶¶ 23-26; Lawson \nDecl.  ¶¶  21-24);  (2)  The  Breast  and  Cervical  Cancer  Project,  a  federal  program \ndesigned  to  provide  cancer  screening  and  follow-up  services  for  low-income  and \nminority  women.  Through  this  program,  Plaintiffs  provide  pap  tests,  breast  exams, \ncolposcopies, and cervical biopsies to low-income women over the age of 40 who are at \nrisk for cancer but are not yet Medicare-eligible.  (Harvey Decl. ¶¶ 27-31; Lawson Decl. \n¶¶ 25-28); (3) The Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, a federal program designed to promote \nHIV  testing  and  education  for  racial  and  ethnic  groups  that  are  disproportionately \nimpacted  by  the  disease;  and  the  HIV  Prevention  Program,  a  federal  prevention \nprogram intended to reduce new infections, increase access to care, improve health \noutcomes for people living with HIV, and promote health equity.  (Harvey Decl. ¶¶ 32-\n39;  Lawson  Decl.  ¶¶  29-34);  (4)  The  Infant  Mortality  Initiative,  a  federally-funded \nprogram which provides community-based outreach and care coordination services in \ntargeted communities to at-risk, low-income, African-American pregnant women and \n                                                 \n1For example, the STD Prevention Program funds are granted by the United States \nCenters for Disease Control to states or state agencies, such as ODH, (“grantees”) which then \nmay then enter into agreements with other entities (“subgrantees”) to provide services under the \nprogram.  (Doc. 1, ¶ 30).  PPGOH has served as a subgrantee in the STD Prevention Program \nfor more than 15 years.  (Doc. 1, ¶ 31). PPSWO has served as a subgrantee in the STD \nPrevention Program for more than 14 years.  (Doc. 1, ¶ 32). \n3 \n \n\ntheir  families.    PPGOH  uses  this  funding  for  its  “Healthy  Moms  Healthy  Babies” \nprogram, which provides case management work for women before pregnancy, during \npregnancy, and up to two years after the birth, including education and assistance in the \nareas of health, housing, nutrition, and employment.  (Harvey Decl. ¶¶ 40-45); (5) The \nPersonal  Responsibility  Education  Program,  a  federal  grant  program  designed  to \neducate  young  people  regarding  abstinence  and  contraception,  with  the  goal  of \nreducing teen pregnancy and STD rates.  Plaintiffs use this funding to provide training to \nstaff who work with the targeted populations.  (Harvey Decl. ¶¶ 46-53; Lawson Decl. ¶¶ \n35-39); and (6) The Violence Against Women Act Sexual Violence Prevention Program, \nwhich aims to reduce the incidence of sexual violence through primary prevention and \neducation. Under this program, PPSWO educates approximately 700 students in middle \nand high schools in Montgomery, Clark, Greene, and Preble Counties each year about \nhealthy  relationships,  sexual  assault  recognition,  and  bystander  intervention  skills.  \n(Lawson Decl. ¶¶ 40-45). \nIt  is  undisputed  that  in  providing  service  to  Ohio  residents  under  these  six \nprograms, Plaintiffs have routinely passed audits and program reviews.  (Doc. 1, ¶ 2).  \nThere is also no dispute that Plaintiffs have not used the funding they received through \nthese programs to provide abortions. \nB. Section 3701.034 \nOhio Revised Code § 3701.034 was signed into law on February 21, 2016 and \ntakes  effect  on  May  23,  2016.    Section  3701.034  will  impact  the  funding  Plaintiffs \nreceive  under  the  six  programs  listed  above.    Section  3701.034  identifies  these \nprograms by name and requires ODH to ensure the funds and materials that ODH \n4 \n \n\nreceives and distributes through the programs “are not used to do any of the following:” \n(1) Perform nontherapeutic abortions; \n \n(2) Promote nontherapeutic abortions; \n \n(3)  Contract  with  any  entity  that  performs  or  promotes  nontherapeutic \nabortions; \n \n(4) Become or continue to be an affiliate of any entity that performs or \npromotes nontherapeutic abortions. \n \nOhio Rev. Code § 3701.034(B)-(G).  Under the statute, “promote” means “to advocate \nfor, assist with, encourage, or popularize through advertising or publicity.”  Ohio Rev. \nCode § 3701.034 (A)(8). \n  After the passage of Section 3701.034, Plaintiffs received letters from ODH and \nlocal  health  departments  that  their  current  contracts  under  the  impacted  programs \nwould be terminated.  (Harvey Decl. Exs. A-J; Lawson Decl. Exs. A-G).  On an annual \nbasis, PPGOH will lose $640,000 in grant funds as well as $420,000 worth of diagnostic \ntesting and treatment under these programs.  (Harvey Decl., ¶ 5).  PPSWO will lose \n$469,460 in grant funds annually as well as $49,500 worth of diagnostic testing and \ntreatment.  (Lawson Decl.  ¶ 5).    \n  Plaintiffs  argue  that  Section  3701.034  violates  the  First  Amendment  by \nconditioning  eligibility  for  government  funds  on  recipients  agreeing  to  forgo \nconstitutionally  protected  speech  and  activities.  Plaintiffs  also  argue  that  Section \n3701.034 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by placing an  \nunconstitutional condition on a woman’s right to an abortion.  Finally, Plaintiffs argue \nthat Section 3701.034 violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against \nentities, such as Plaintiffs, who perform or “promote” abortion. \n5 \n \n\nII.  ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, the purpose of a temporary restraining \norder “is to preserve the status quo so that a reasoned resolution of a dispute may be \nhad.”  Procter & Gamble Co. v. Bankers Trust Co., 78 F.3d 219, 227 (6th Cir. 1996). \nThe Sixth Circuit has held that the standard for obtaining a temporary restraining \norder and the standard for obtaining a preliminary injunction are the same.  Workman v. \nBredesen, 486 F.3d 896 (6th Cir. 2007).  In determining whether to grant or deny a \ntemporary restraining  order, this Court must consider four factors: “(1)  whether the \nmovant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant would \nsuffer irreparable injury without the injunction; (3) whether issuance of the injunction \nwould cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be \nserved by issuance of the injunction.”  City of Pontiac Retired Emps. Ass'n v. Schimmel, \n751 F.3d 427, 430 (6th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (en banc) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n“These factors are not prerequisites which must be met, but are interrelated \nconsiderations that must be balanced together.”  Northeast Ohio Coalition for Homeless \nand  Service  Employees,  467  F.3d  999,  1009  (6th  Cir.  2006)  (quoting  Radioactive \nMaterial Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir.1991)). “For example, \nthe probability of success that must be demonstrated is inversely proportional to the \namount of irreparable injury the movants will suffer.”  Id. \nB. Delay in seeking injunctive relief \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs could be denied relief based upon their delay in \n6 \n \n\nseeking  injunctive  relief  alone.    Plaintiffs  respond  that  there  was  uncertainty  as  to \nwhether  ODH  would  interpret  the  statute  to  require  the  termination  of  all  existing \ncontracts on May 23, 2016, or whether after the effective date, the statute prohibited \nODH from entering into new contracts with entities that “promote” or provide abortions.  \nPlaintiffs explain that on March 24, 2016 ODH confirmed that it would interpret Section \n3701.034 to require termination of existing contracts as of May 23, 2016.  Plaintiffs \nexplain that they requested injunctive relief on May 11, 2016, which was seven weeks \nafter ODH’s position was made clear and only two weeks after receiving termination \nletters from several grantees. \n“Where a plaintiff seeks solely equitable relief, his action may be barred by the \nequitable defense of laches if (1) the plaintiff delayed unreasonably in asserting his \nrights and (2) the defendant was prejudiced by this delay.”  Am. Civil Liberties Union of \nOhio, Inc. v. Taft, 385 F.3d 641, 647 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing Brown–Graves Co. v. Central \nStates, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 206 F.3d 680, 684 (6th Cir. \n2000)). \nThe  Court  finds  that  under  the  circumstances,  Plaintiffs  have  not  delayed \nunreasonably in asserting their rights.  Plaintiffs’ delay was attributable to a lack of \ncertainty regarding the effect of Section 3701.034.  Cf. Bell v. Rankin, No. 2:11-CV-168, \n2011 WL  761544,  at  *4  (S.D.  Ohio  Feb.  24,  2011)  (denying  motion  for  temporary \nrestraining order on several alternative basis, including laches; plaintiff was aware of his \nlegal position and the facts giving rise to claims for several years); Advocacy Org. For \nPatients & Providers v. Mercy Health Servs., 987 F. Supp. 967, 970 (E.D. Mich. 1997) \ndenying  motion  for  temporary  restraining  order  under  doctrine  of  laches,  but  also \n7 \n \n\nbecause  plaintiffs  did  not  demonstrate  irreparable  harm;  plaintiffs  knew  about  the \nmerger at least three months before requesting the TRO, as evidenced by a complaint \nfiled with the FTC in an attempt to stop the merger). \nEven if the Court were to find that Plaintiffs’ delay was unreasonable, the Court \nfinds  that  Defendants  have  not  been  prejudiced  by  the  delay.    Defendants  claim \nprejudice  based  on  their  work  to  develop  plans  for  transitioning  services  to  other \nproviders.  Specifically, Defendants have reassigned providers to cover the geographic \nareas  previously  served  by  Plaintiffs.    (Doc.  17-5,  Angela  Norton  Aff.,  ¶¶  10-12).  \nDefendants also explain that it is their understanding that the Mahoning County District \nBoard of Health will be hiring staff previously employed by Plaintiffs.  (Doc. 17-6, Dyane \nGogan Turner Aff., ¶ 6).2  Defendants explain that it is also their understanding that the \nlocal health districts who contracted with Plaintiffs have entered into contracts with other \nproviders,  or  are  in  negotiations  with  prospective  providers.    (Doc.  17-4,  Amanda \nDennison Aff., ¶ 16).  Other than this effort expended, most of which did not involve \nDefendants, Defendants have not identified any other form of prejudice.  Cf. Kay v. \nAustin,  621  F.2d  809,  813  (6th  Cir.  1980)  (doctrine  of  laches  bars  equitable  relief \nbecause “the state's interest in proceeding with the election increases in importance as \nresources are committed and irrevocable decisions are made, and the candidate's claim \nto be a serious candidate who has received a serious injury becomes less credible by \nhis having slept on his rights.”).  \nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief is not barred by the equitable \ndefense of laches. \n                                                 \n2However, Defendants have not explained what role they played in making these \narrangements or whether Defendants will have any obligation after the Mahoning County District \nBoard of Health hires these employees. \n8 \n \n\nC. Discussion of four factors \n1.  Likelihood of success on the merits \na.  First Amendment: Freedom of Speech and Association \nPlaintiffs argue that Section 3701.034 violates Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights \nof freedom of speech and association because it imposes unconstitutional conditions on \nthe receipt of government funds. \nUnder the “modern ‘unconstitutional conditions’ doctrine  . . . the government \n‘may  not  deny  a  benefit  to  a  person  on  a  basis  that  infringes  his  constitutionally \nprotected . . . freedom of speech’ even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.”  Bd. of \nCnty. Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996).  \nAs the Supreme Court has explained, “if the government could deny a benefit to a \nperson because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of \nthose freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited . . . allow[ing] the government \nto ‘produce a result which [it] could not command directly.’”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 \nU.S. 593, 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 \nU.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)). \nThe principle that a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on \nFirst Amendment rights was discussed in depth by the Supreme Court in Agency for Int'l \nDev. v. Alliance for Open Soc'y Int'l, 133 S.Ct. 2321, 186 L.Ed.2d 398 (2013).  The \nSupreme Court explained that an unconstitutional funding condition is not limited to \nthose situations where the condition is not relevant to the objectives of the program, or \n“when the condition is actually coercive, in the sense of an offer that cannot be refused.”  \nId. at 2328.  Instead, the Supreme Court explained, “the relevant distinction that has \n9 \n \n\nemerged from our cases is between conditions that define the limits of the government \nspending program—those that specify the activities Congress wants to subsidize—and \nconditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the \nprogram itself.”  Id.  This distinction echoed the Supreme Court’s earlier decision in Rust \nv. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 197, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 1774, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), wherein \nthe  Court  held  that  unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine  is  violated  where  the \ngovernment  places  “a  condition  on  the  recipient  of  the  subsidy  rather  than  on  a \nparticular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in \nthe protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.” \nHere,  the  federal  Hyde  Amendment  and  Ohio’s  own  laws  have  long  barred \nPlaintiffs from using state or federal funds to provide abortions.3  However, Section \n3701.034 bars any entity that engages in advocacy in favor nontherapeutic abortions \nfrom receiving funds administered by ODH, even though those funds would not be used \nto “promote” or perform abortions.  Section 3701.034 allows ODH to leverage its control \nover government funds to prevent recipients of government funds from engaging in \nconstitutionally protected speech and association, even if that speech is undertaken \nwith private funds.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Section 3701.034 “compels as a \ncondition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be \n                                                 \n3As the Sixth Circuit has explained: \n \nThe Hyde Amendment prohibits federal reimbursement for abortions except in \ncircumstances Congress, rather than a doctor, deems medically necessary. . . .  \nEvery  year  since  1976,  Congress  has  passed  some  version  of  the  Hyde \nAmendment. . . . Following passage of the first Hyde Amendment, many states \npromulgated  laws  restricting  Medicaid  coverage  to  those  abortions  federally \nfunded under the Hyde Amendment. \n \nPlanned Parenthood Affiliates of Michigan v. Engler, 73 F.3d 634, 636 (6th Cir. 1996).  \n10 \n \n\nconfined within the scope of the Government program.  In so doing, it violates the First \nAmendment and cannot be sustained.”  Alliance, 133 S.Ct. at 2332; see also Planned \nParenthood  of  Cent.  &  N.  Ariz.  v.  Arizona,  718  F.2d  938,  942-44  (9th  Cir.  1983) \n(although the state need not fund abortions, the state “may not unreasonably interfere \nwith the right of Planned Parenthood to engage in abortion or abortion-related speech \nactivities”)). \nODH relies on the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Planned Parenthood Association of \nHidalgo County. Texas, Inc. v. Suehs, 692 F.3d 343 (5th Cir. 2012) in support of its \nposition that Ohio can choose to adopt a policy of disfavoring abortion with its own \nsubsidies.  Like Section 3701.034, the program created by the Texas Legislature, the \nWomen’s Health Program (“WHP”), denied funding to entities who perform or “promote” \nelective  abortions.    Id.  at  347.    However,  unlike  Section  3701.034,  the  WHP  was \ndesigned to “expand access to preventative health and family planning services for \nwomen.”  Id. at 346.  The Fifth Circuit concluded that although the WHP’s restriction on \npromoting elective abortions “functions as a speech-based funding condition, it also \nfunctions as a direct regulation of the content of a state program, and is therefore \nconstitutional under the reasoning of Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, \n114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991).”  In contrast, Section 3701.034 is unconstitutional because it \nplaces the speech-based funding condition on the recipient for activities outside the six \nimpacted programs.  See Planned Parenthood of Mid–Mo. & E. Kan., Inc. v. Dempsey, \n167 F.3d 458, 462 (8th Cir. 1999) (“Legislation that simply dictates the proper scope of \ngovernment-funded programs is constitutional, while legislation that restricts protected \ngrantee activities outside government programs is unconstitutional”).  \n11 \n \n\nTherefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success \non the merits of their First Amendment claims. \nb.  Fourteenth Amendment: Due Process \nPlaintiffs argue that Section 3701.34 violates the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment because Ohio may not use its control over government funds to \ndo indirectly what it could not do directly under the Constitution: stop abortion providers \nfrom providing safe and legal abortions. \nDefendants  seem  to argue  that  Plaintiffs  are  not  proper  parties  to  raise  this \nFourteenth Amendment claim.  However, abortion providers have standing to enforce \ntheir patients’ right to choose to have an abortion under the Due Process Clause.  See \nSingleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (concluding that “it generally is appropriate \nto allow a physician to assert the rights of women patients as against governmental \ninterference with the abortion decision”); Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Cincinnati, Inc. v. \nCity  of  Cincinnati,  822  F.2d  1390,  1396  (6th  Cir.  1987)  (concluding  that  Planned \nParenthood has standing to assert the due process rights of women seeking right to \nhave an abortion). \n“[W]hile  the  unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine  has  been  most  consistently \napplied to protect First Amendment rights, it has also been applied by the Supreme \nCourt to other constitutional provisions.”  R.S.W.W., Inc. v. City of Keego Harbor, 397 \nF.3d 427, 434 (6th Cir. 2005); see Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 133 S. \nCt. 2586, 2594, 186 L. Ed. 2d 697 (2013) (“We have said in a variety of contexts that \n‘the  government  may  not  deny  a  benefit  to  a  person  because  he  exercises  a \nconstitutional right.’”) (quoting Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 \n12 \n \n\nU.S. 540, 545, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983)).  Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit \nhas  held  that  “[t]he  doctrine  should  equally  apply  to  prohibit  the  government  from \nconditioning  benefits  on  a  citizen's  agreement  to  surrender  due  process  rights.”  \nR.S.W.W, 397 F.3d at 434 (citing Vance v. Barrett, 345 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir. \n2003)).   \nIn Planned Parenthood of Indiana v. Commissioner of Indiana State Department \nof Health, 699 F.3d 962 (7th Cir. 2012), plaintiffs sought to enjoin an Indiana law which \nprohibited abortion providers from receiving any state contracts and grants, including \nthose involving state-administered federal funds.  Id. at 969.  The Seventh Circuit began \nits  analysis  by  explaining  that  the  plaintiffs’  “unconstitutional-conditions  claim \nnecessarily derives from a woman's constitutional right to obtain an abortion.” Id. at 986 \n(citing Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 \nL.Ed.2d 674 (1992)).  The court explained this constitutional right derives from the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 986-87.  The court then explained \nthat under Casey, the government may not impose an “undue burden” on a woman’s \nright to have an abortion, which exists if the challenged law has “purpose or effect is to \nplace a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus \nattains viability.”  Id. at 987 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality \nopinion)).  However, the court also noted that the Supreme Court has held that “[t]he \nGovernment has no constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because the \nactivity  is  constitutionally  protected  and  may  validly  choose  to  fund  childbirth  over \nabortion.”  Id. (quoting Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 \n(1991)).   \n13 \n \n\nApplying this analysis, the Seventh Circuit found that plaintiffs were not likely to \nsucceed on their unconstitutional-conditions claim.  Id. at 988.  The court noted that \nplaintiffs did not argue that the loss of funding imposed an undue burden on a woman’s \nright to obtain an abortion.  Id.  The court concluded that a state funding condition can \nviolate the constitutional right to abortion only if the effect of the funding condition itself \nis to place an undue burden on women’s ability to choose to have an abortion.  Id. \n(explaining  that  if  “the  government's  refusal  to  subsidize  abortion  does  not  unduly \nburden a woman's right to obtain an abortion, then Indiana's ban on public funding of \nabortion providers—even for unrelated services—cannot indirectly burden a woman's \nright to obtain an abortion.”).   \nPlaintiffs argue that in contrast to the plaintiffs in Planned Parenthood of Indiana, \nPlaintiffs can show that the effect of Section 3701.034 is to place an undue burden on a \nwoman’s right to obtain an abortion. \nPlaintiffs explain that they provided approximately 30% (approximately 6,257 of \n21,186) of the abortions in the State of Ohio in calendar year 2014.  Plaintiffs point out \nthat in 2014, PPGOH provided approximately 36% (approximately 1,500 of 4,137) of the \nabortions in Franklin County and 23% (approximately 2,000 of 8,548) of the abortions in \nCuyahoga County.  (Harvey Decl., ¶ 8).  Plaintiffs explain that the loss of these services \nin Franklin and Cuyahoga counties would likely overwhelm existing providers, expand \nwait  times,  and  leave  some  women  in  those  counties  with  no  feasible  option  for \nexercising their constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.  (Harvey Decl., ¶ 8).  \nPlaintiffs explain that PPSWO operates the only surgical abortion clinic in the Cincinnati \narea, and in 2014 performed 2,757 abortions there. (Lawson Decl., ¶ 7).  Plaintiffs \n14 \n \n\nmaintain  that  if  they  were  to  comply  with  Section  3701.034’s  funding  condition, \nCincinnati would become the largest metropolitan area in the country without a surgical \nabortion clinic.  (Lawson Decl., ¶ 7).   \nThe  Court  concludes  that  for  purposes  of  deciding  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for \nTemporary  Restraining  Order,  Plaintiffs  have  established  that  the  effect  of  Section \n3701.034 is to impose an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to have an abortion. \nThere is also no doubt that the Ohio Legislature enacted Section 3701.034 for \nthe purpose of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking to obtain \nan abortion.  In a statement on the floor of the Ohio Senate, Senator Peggy Lehner \nexplained that the law was: \nnecessary only because Planned Parenthood has chosen—you like the \nword choice—they have chosen to be the leading abortion provider in this \nnation.  You say, but oh, but that’s only three percent of what they do.  \nWell if it’s only three percent, then perhaps they should be looking to say, \nlet’s drop abortion, and concentrate on all those other things. … [W]e have \nan obligation … to say … to Planned Parenthood, until you get out of the \nbusiness of termination of pregnancy, the destruction of human life, we \nare not going to choose to fund you. \n \nSenate Floor Debate, Statement of Sen. Peggy Lehner (Jan. 27, 2016). \nTherefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success \non the merits of their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claims.   \nc.  Equal protection \nThe  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  “prohibits \ndiscrimination  by  government  which  either  burdens  a  fundamental  right,  targets  a \nsuspect class, or intentionally treats one differently than others similarly situated without \nany rational basis for the difference.”  Bench Billboard Co. v. City of Cincinnati, 675 F.3d \n974, 986 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting TriHealth, Inc. v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 430 F.3d 783, 788 \n15 \n \n\n(6th Cir. 2005)). \nPlaintiffs argue that Section 3701.034 violates the Equal Protection Clause by \nsingling out entities that perform or promote abortions and those who contract or affiliate \nwith those entities.  Plaintiffs argue that Section 3701.034 is subject to strict scrutiny \nbecause the State of Ohio lacked any legitimate reason for distinguishing Plaintiffs from \nthe  other  similarly-situated  service  providers  whose  contracts  were  approved.  \nDefendants  respond  that  Section  3701.034  is  only  subject  to  rational-basis  review \nbecause Plaintiffs are not a suspect class.  See United States Dept. of Agriculture v. \nMoreno,  413  U.S.  528,  93  S.Ct.  2821,  37  L.Ed.2d  782  (1973)  (explaining  that  an \nindigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within a category of a suspect \nclass).  \n“[E]ven in the absence of a suspect class, a classification warrants strict scrutiny \nif it burdens the exercise of a fundamental right.”  League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. \nBredesen, 500 F.3d 523, 534 (6th Cir. 2007).  While Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 \nS.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973) established a fundamental right to abortion, the Court \nconcludes that Section 3701.034 cannot satisfy the rational basis test, and therefore it is \nunnecessary to address a strict scrutiny analysis. \nDefendants explain that Section 3701.034 is rationally related to Ohio’s interest \nin  favoring  childbirth.    However,  Defendants  fail  to  explain  how  the  prohibition  on \nfunding found in Section 3701.034 is necessary to prevent state funds from being used \nto fund abortion services.  Defendants do not claim that any of the funds from the six \nimpacted programs have ever been used to fund abortions.  Instead, it appears that the \ninterest of Ohio, in the words of Senator Lehner, was to have Plaintiffs “get out of the \n16 \n \n\nbusiness of termination of pregnancy.”  \nThe Supreme Court has explained that the “desire to harm a politically unpopular \ngroup” does not constitute a legitimate governmental interest.  Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534, \n93 S.Ct. 2821.  For example, in Planned Parenthood of Minn. v. Minnesota, the Eighth \nCircuit explained that the record demonstrated that “Planned Parenthood of Minnesota \nin  its  abortion  stance  has  made  itself  unpopular  among  some  segments  of  the \npopulation.”  612 F.2d 359, 361 (8th Cir. 1980).  However, the court explained that \n“Planned  Parenthood's  unpopularity  in  and  of  itself  and  without  reference  to  some \nindependent considerations in the public interest” did not justify a Minnesota statute \nprohibiting the state health commissioner from issuing grants to nonprofit corporations \nthat perform abortions.  Id. at 361; see also Planned Parenthood Greater Memphis \nRegion  v.  Dreyzehner,  853  F.  Supp.  2d  724,  737  (M.D.  Tenn.  2012)  (same  and \ncollecting cases). \n  Because Section 3701.034 bears no rational relationship to Ohio’s stated interest \nof favoring childbirth, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their Equal Protection claims.   \n  Based on the foregoing, the factor of likelihood of success on the merits weighs \nin favor of granting a temporary restraining order. \n2.  Irreparable injury \nThe Supreme Court has held that “[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, even \nfor  minimal  periods  of  time,  unquestionably  constitutes  irreparable  injury.”  Elrod  v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); see also Planned \nParenthood Ass'n of Cincinnati v. City of Cincinnati, 822 F.2d 1390, 1400 (6th Cir. 1987) \n17 \n \n\n(finding irreparable injury where plaintiff has shown substantial likelihood of success on \nmerits of constitutional challenge to abortion regulation). \n  Moreover, Plaintiffs explain that without the funds at issue here, Plaintiffs will be \nforced to stop providing services such as pap smears and other cancer screenings, \ntests for HIV/AIDS and tests and treatment for other STDs, infant mortality prevention \nprograms, and sexual health education programs.  Plaintiffs maintain that it would be \ndifficult to reconstitute those programs if and when the statute is held unconstitutional. \nTherefore, the Court concludes that for purposes of deciding Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs have established irreparable injury.  This factor \nweighs in favor of granting a temporary restraining order. \n3.  Substantial harm to others \nThe Court finds that Defendants will not suffer substantial harm if the Section \n3701.034 is enjoined.  See Planned Parenthood Association of Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of \nCincinnati, 822 F.2d 1390, 1400 (6th Cir. 1987) (no substantial harm in preventing city \nfrom enforcing ordinance that was likely to be found unconstitutional, as the state has \nno valid interest in enforcing an unconstitutional ordinance); Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. \nMetro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cty., Tenn., 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. 2001) (“[I]f \nthe plaintiff shows a substantial likelihood that the challenged law is unconstitutional, no \nsubstantial harm to others can be said to inhere in its enjoinment.”). \n  Defendants  argue  that  it  has  already  begun  working  with  local  health \ndepartments and service providers to develop transition plans to implement Section \n3701.034.    While  ODH  has  not  specifically  identified  any  new  contracts  or  other \nobligations, Hamilton County has explained that it has entered into a contract with the \n18 \n \n\nnonprofit  organization  Caracole  to  provide  HIV  testing  and  counseling  services  in \nHamilton County.  (Doc. 15-1, Ex. D).  Plaintiffs maintain that any harm to Caracole can \nbe avoided by tailoring the TRO to exclude the contract with Caracole.  The same \nexclusion can be made for any other contracts where Defendants have already replaced \nPlaintiffs’ contract with a contract with another organization. \nTherefore, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have established that the harm to others \nis minimal.  This factor weighs in favor of granting a temporary restraining order. \n4.  Public interest \nThe Sixth Circuit has explained that “it is always in the public interest to prevent \nthe violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”  Liberty Coins, LLC v. Goodman, 748 F.3d \n682, 690 (6th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 950 (2015). \n  Moreover, Plaintiffs explain that if Section 3701.034 is enforced, Plaintiffs will be \nforced to end health care and education programs and terminate employees, depriving \nthousands of Ohioans of high-quality, affordable health care services and education \nprograms.  For example, Plaintiffs conduct approximately 50 percent of the STD tests in \nthe state of Ohio each year.  (Doc. 18-2, Lawson 2d. Decl. ¶ 2).  In addition, Plaintiffs \nexplain that only certified and trained HIV testers can provide testing under the HIV \nPrevention Program, and officials in Canton have reported that they have not been able \nto locate a replacement for PPGOH under this program.  (Doc. 18-1, Harvey 2d Decl. ¶ \n3). \nTherefore, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have established that the public interest \nfactor weighs in favor of granting a temporary restraining order. \n \n19 \n \n\nII.  CONCLUSION \nBased on the on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order \nand Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 7) is GRANTED as to the temporary restraining order; \nand HELD IN ABEYANCE as to the preliminary injunction.  It is hereby ORDERED that: \n1.  Defendants Richard Hodges, Director of the Ohio Department of Health, and \nTimothy Ingram, Commissioner of Hamilton County Public Health, and their \nagents,  employees,  appointees,  and  successors  are  temporarily \nRESTRAINED from enforcing Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.034; \n2.  While  this Temporary  Restraining  Order  is  in  place,  Defendants  shall  not \nterminate Plaintiffs’ funding pursuant to Section 3701.034, shall accept and \nconsider without regard to Section 3701.034 Plaintiffs’ applications for grants \nand funding, and shall reinstate Plaintiffs’ contracts which were terminated \npursuant  to  Section  3701.034,  except  where  Defendants  have  already \nreplaced Plaintiffs’ contract with a contract with another organization that has \nalready become effective and under which another organization is already \nproviding services; \n3.  There is evidence in the record that Hamilton County has replaced Plaintiff \nPPSWO’s HIV Prevention Program services by entering into a contract with  \nCaracole, Inc., and that the contract was effective April 1, 2016.  Out of \nconcern for disrupting ongoing care and services, the Court will not at this \ntime order reinstatement of PPSWO’s contract with Hamilton County for these \nservices. This does not prevent the Court from ordering reinstatement of such \ncontract in the future, and Defendants must refrain from terminating Plaintiffs’ \nother contracts; \n4.  This Temporary Restraining Order shall expire on June 6, 2016 at 11:59 p.m., \nunless extended by the Court; \n5.  This Temporary Restraining Order is effective upon its entry; and \n6.  There is no requirement of any bond. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.                              \n                /s/ Michael R. Barrett             \nJUDGE MICHAEL R. BARRETT \n \n20 \n ",

Himes  Page 2\n \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nHELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge.  Enacted in 2016, Ohio Revised Code § 3701.034 \nrequires the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) to ensure that all funds it receives through six \nnon-abortion-related  federal  health  programs  are  not  used  to  contract  with  any  entity  that \nperforms or promotes nontherapeutic abortions, or becomes or continues to be an affiliate of any \nentity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions.1   \nPlaintiffs  Planned  Parenthood  of  Greater  Ohio  (PPGOH)  and  Planned  Parenthood \nSouthwest Ohio Region (PPSWO) filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that § 3701.034 violates 1) their First Amendment rights “by denying \nstate and federal funds” to Plaintiffs “because of–and in retaliation for–their constitutionally \nprotected advocacy for abortion rights and affiliation with other organizations that also advocate \nfor abortion rights and/or provide abortion services”; 2) the Due Process Clause “by denying \nstate  and  federal  funds”  to  Plaintiffs  “because  of––and  in  retaliation  for––[Plaintiffs’]  own \nconstitutionally  protected  right  to  provide  abortions  and  their  patients’  exercise  of  the \nconstitutional right to choose to have abortion”; and 3) the Equal Protection Clause “by singling \nout abortion providers and those who ‘promote’ abortions, including Plaintiffs, for unfavorable \ntreatment  without  a  constitutionally  sufficient  justification.”    PID  1/Complaint;  PID  27-28.  \nPlaintiffs sought to enjoin ODH from enforcing § 3701.034 or terminating Plaintiffs’ funding \nunder the six federal programs pursuant to that statute.  PID 309.   \nThe district court entered a temporary restraining order on the day § 3701.034 was to take \neffect.  PID 308/Dist. Ct. Op. 5/23/16.  Following expedited discovery, Plaintiffs filed motions \nfor judgment on the merits and to permanently enjoin ODH from enforcing § 3701.034, Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(a)(2).  PID 2122-23/Dist. Ct. Op. 8/12/16.  Applying the unconstitutional-conditions \n                                                 \n1\nThe statutory language, quoted infra at pp. 3–5, can be read to prohibit the recipient’s use of program \nfunds to perform or promote abortion, or to contract or affiliate with organizations that do.  However, ODH has \nmade clear that it reads the provisions as prohibiting ODH from using program funds to contract with organizations \nthat perform or promote abortions or affiliate with entities that do so, even if the funds are used strictly for program \npurposes, which by definition are unrelated to abortion.  See PID 883. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 5 of 33      P AGEID #: 2217 (5 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 3\n \ndoctrine, the district court determined that § 3701.034 impermissibly conditions funding under \nprograms that are unrelated to abortion based on a recipient’s foregoing exercise of its First \nAmendment rights to free speech or association outside the contours of the six programs, and \nforegoing  provision  of  abortion  services  protected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause.2  Planned \nParenthood of Greater Ohio v. Hodges, 201 F. Supp. 3d 898 (S.D. Ohio 2016).  The district \ncourt granted Plaintiffs’ motions for judgment on the merits and a permanent injunction.  Id. \nODH appeals, challenging Plaintiffs’ standing to assert the due process claims, and \narguing  that  we  should  not  reach  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment  claim  because  the  statute’s \n“conduct provision,” which bars funding for entities that perform abortions, does not violate due \nprocess.  ODH challenges the district court’s ruling on the First Amendment claim as well.  \nRelying on Planned Parenthood of Indiana, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Department \nof  Health,  699  F.3d  962  (7th  Cir.  2012),  cert.  denied,  569  U.S.  1004  (2013),  ODH  also \nchallenges the district court’s application of the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine to Plaintiffs’ \ndue process claim, asserting that in the abortion context, the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine \nat most bars conditions that impose an undue burden on women’s access to abortion, which is \nnot present here.  Because we conclude the district court properly applied the unconstitutional-\nconditions doctrine and that § 3701.034 is unconstitutional under that doctrine, we AFFIRM. \nI. \nOhio Revised Code § 3701.034 \nOhio Revised Code § 3701.034, which was to take effect on May 23, 2016, provides: \nProhibition on use of certain funds concerning nontherapeutic abortions \n(A) As used in this section: \n(1)  “Affiliate” means an entity that has with another entity a legal \nrelationship  created  or  governed  by  at  least  one  written \ninstrument that demonstrates any of the following: \n                                                 \n2\nThe district court did not reach Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 6 of 33      P AGEID #: 2218 (6 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 4\n \n(a)  Common ownership, management, or control; \n(b)  A franchise agreement; \n(c)  The granting or extension of a license or other \nagreement that authorizes an entity to use the other \nentity’s  brand  name,  trademark,  service  mark,  or \nother registered identification mark. \n(2)  “Violence  Against  Women  Act”  means  section  1910A  of \nsection  40151  of  the  “Violent  Crime  Control  and  Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994,” part A of Title XIX of the “Public \nHealth and Human Services Act,” 108 Stat. 1920 (1994), former \n42 U.S.C. 300w, 42 U.S.C. 280b-1b, as amended.  \n(3) “Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act” means \nthe  “Breast  and  Cervical  Cancer  Mortality  Prevention  Act  of \n1990,” 104 Stat. 409 (1990), 42 U.S.C. 300k, as amended. \n(4) “Infertility prevention project” means the infertility prevention \nproject operated by the United States centers for disease control \nand prevention. \n(5) “Minority HIV/AIDS initiative” means the minority HIV/AIDS \ninitiative operated by the office of minority health in the United \nStates department of health and human services. \n(6)  “Personal  responsibility  education  program”  means  the \nprogram  administered  by  the  administration  for  children  and \nfamilies  in  the  United  States  department  of  health  and  human \nservices to educate adolescents on abstinence and contraception for \nthe prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. \n(7) “Nontherapeutic abortion” has the same meaning as in section \n9.04 of the Revised Code.[3] \n(8) “Promote” means to advocate for, assist with, encourage, or \npopularize through advertising or publicity.[4] \n(B) – (G)[5] The department of health shall ensure that all funds it receives \nthrough [the Violence Against Women Act, Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality \n                                                 \n3\nOhio law defines “nontherapeutic abortion” as “an abortion that is performed or induced when \nthe life of the mother would not be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or when the pregnancy of \nthe mother was not the result of rape or incest reported to a law enforcement agency.”  Ohio Rev. Code \n§ 9.04(A)(1). \n4\nThe prohibition on funding entities that “promote” nontherapeutic abortions is found in § 3701.034(B)(2), \n(C)(2), (D)(2), (E)(2), (F)(2), and (G)(2). \n5\nSections (B) through (G), which address each of the programs separately, share identical language in \nsubsections (1) through (4), and are condensed for brevity. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 7 of 33      P AGEID #: 2219 (7 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 5\n \nPrevention  Act,  Infertility  prevention  project,  Minority  HIV/AIDS  initiative, \ninfant mortality reduction or infant vitality initiatives] are not used to do any of \nthe following: \n(1) Perform nontherapeutic abortions; \n(2) Promote nontherapeutic abortions; \n(3)  Contract  with  any  entity  that  performs  or  promotes \nnontherapeutic abortions; \n(4)  Become  or  continue  to  be  an  affiliate  of  any  entity  that \nperforms or promotes nontherapeutic abortions. \nOhio Rev. Code § 3701.034.   \nPlaintiffs \nPlaintiffs PPGOH and PPSWO are not-for-profit corporations organized under Ohio law.  \nPID 84, 126; PPSWO President & CEO Jerry Lawson Decl., PPGOH President & CEO, Iris \nHarvey Decl.  PPGOH and PPSWO are independent entities; however, both are affiliates of \nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (PPFA), which advocates for women’s access to \ncomprehensive reproductive healthcare, including abortion.  PID 86, Harvey Decl.; 2123/Dist. \nCt. Op. 8/12/16.  Plaintiffs now operate twenty-seven6 health centers throughout Ohio, which are \nstaffed with physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, who provide well-woman \nexams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, screenings for breast and cervical \ncancer and HIV, and contraception and contraceptive counseling.  Three of the twenty-seven \nhealth centers also provide abortion services.  PID 86/Harvey Decl.; 126, 127/Lawson Decl.  \nSeparate from their government-funded health services and education programs, PPGOH and \nPPSWO advocate for a woman’s right to safe and lawful abortion through public awareness \ncampaigns and public education activities.  PID 86, 127-28.   \nNo government funds are used to pay for or subsidize Plaintiffs’ abortion services or \nadvocacy; Plaintiffs operate within the confines of federal and Ohio law, which for decades have \nprohibited  the  use  of  public  funds  to  pay  for  abortions.    PID  87/Harvey  Decl.;  PID  128-\n29/Lawson Decl; see also infra n.8.  It is undisputed that Plaintiffs “maintain measures to ensure \n                                                 \n6\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, Plaintiffs’ counsel advised that one of the twenty-eight health centers \nhas closed for reasons unrelated to this case.  The district court’s opinion states that Plaintiffs operate twenty-eight \nhealth centers; that number was accurate at the time. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 8 of 33      P AGEID #: 2220 (8 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 6\n \nthat none of the funds received from the state or federal government are used, directly or \nindirectly, to subsidize the promotion of abortion or performance of abortion services.”  PID \n2136/Dist. Ct. Op. 8/12/16. \nLargely through competitive grant processes, Plaintiffs have for years received funds \n(and material assistance) distributed by ODH and county health departments under the six \nfederal programs impacted by § 3701.034:  the Infertility prevention project, Breast and Cervical \nCancer Mortality Prevention Act, Violence Against Women Act, Minority HIV/AIDS initiative, \nSTD Prevention Program, and Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP).7   \nThroughout those years, Plaintiffs passed all state and local audits and program reviews.  \nAfter § 3701.034 was enacted, however, ODH and local health departments notified Plaintiffs \nthat their contracts under the six federal programs would be terminated and they would not be \neligible for funding.  PID 883-908/ODH letters to ODH subcontractors and Plaintiffs, and letters \nfrom  local  agencies/subcontractors  to  Plaintiffs  advising  of  termination  of  contracts;  PID \n2124/Dist. Ct. Op. 8/12/16.   \nStandard of Review \nThis court reviews a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute de novo.  Entm’t \nProds., Inc. v. Shelby Cty., Tenn., 721 F.3d 729, 733 (6th Cir. 2013).  The district court’s factual \nfindings are reviewed for clear error, its legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, and the scope of \ninjunctive relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Sec’y of Labor, U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. \n3Re.com, Inc., 317 F.3d 534, 537 (6th Cir. 2003).  “A party is entitled to a permanent injunction \nif it can establish that it suffered a constitutional violation and will suffer continuing irreparable \ninjury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.”  Lee v. City of Columbus, Ohio, 636 F.3d \n245, 249 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting Wedgewood Ltd. P’ship I v. Twp. of Liberty, Ohio, 610 F.3d \n340, 349 (6th Cir. 2010)).  “Injunctive relief involving matters subject to state regulation may be \n                                                 \n7\nPlaintiffs’ counsel advised the court by letter dated July 27, 2017, that PPGOH did not reapply for grant \nfunding under the PREP program when its contract expired on July 31, 2017, and that it appears that ODH will no \nlonger be responsible for allocating PREP funds as of August 1, 2017; thus “there is a question as to whether [this \ncourt] need consider PREP in its analysis of Section 3701.034.” \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 9 of 33      P AGEID #: 2221 (9 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 7\n \nno  broader  than  necessary  to  remedy  the  constitutional  violation.”    Kallstrom  v.  City  of \nColumbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1069 (6th Cir. 1998). \nII. \nWe  first  address  ODH’s  standing  argument.    ODH  asserts  that  the  district  court \nerroneously transformed a woman’s abortion right into a provider’s right by treating Plaintiffs as \nif they hold an independent due process abortion right.  Challenging the district court’s reliance \non Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106 (1976), ODH asserts that the doctrine of third-party standing \npermits a party to assert the rights of another only if the party shows that the missing party’s \nrights have been violated; and because abortion providers lack any abortion right of their own, no \nburden on them could ever amount to an unconstitutional burden without a separate showing of \nan unconstitutional effect on women.  Appellant Br. 42–44.  According to ODH, “That abortion \nproviders must rely on the rights of women confirms that they do not hold the constitutional \nrights here.”  Appellant Br. 44.   \nODH does not grapple with precedent, which clearly holds that abortion providers have \nstanding to enforce their patients’ abortion rights.  See PID 2138; Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. \n106, 118 (1976) (“[I]t generally is appropriate to allow a physician to assert the rights of women \npatients as against governmental interference with the abortion decision.”); Planned Parenthood \nof Cent. Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 62 (1976) (physicians who supervised abortions at \nPlanned Parenthood had standing to challenge constitutionality of Missouri statute); Planned \nParenthood Ass’n of Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, 822 F.2d 1390, 1396 (6th Cir. 1987) \n(holding that Planned Parenthood and its Medical Director had standing to assert third-party \nrights (of women) as well as their own rights); see also Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. \nHerbert, 828 F.3d 1245, 1260 (10th Cir. 2016) (“[B]ecause abortion is a medical procedure, . . . \nthe full vindication of the woman’s fundamental right necessarily requires that her” medical \nprovider  be  afforded  the  right  to  “‘make  his  best  medical  judgment,’”  which  includes \n“implementing [the woman’s decision] should she choose to have an abortion.”) (quoting City of \nAkron v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 427 (1983), overruled in part on \nother grounds in Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 870 (1992)); Planned \nParenthood of Wis. v. Doyle, 162 F.3d 463, 465 (7th Cir. 1998) (“The standing of the physician \n\nCase: 1: 1  6  - cv-00539-MRB  D   o c #: 66 Filed: 04 / 2  0 /18 Page: 10 of 3 3      PAGEID #: 2222 (10 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 8\n \nplaintiffs, and of Planned Parenthood as the owner of abortion clinics in Wisconsin, to maintain \nthis suit is not open to question.”).  ODH cites no case holding that an abortion provider lacks \nstanding to challenge a law concerning abortion. \nODH’s remaining arguments go to the merits and are addressed below. \nIII. \nODH asserts that the “conduct provision” of § 3701.034 (precluding entities that perform \nabortions from obtaining funding under six federal programs) comports with due process under \nMaher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), and Rust v. Sullivan, \n500 U.S. 173 (1991), and argues that we should decide the case on this basis alone, without \nreaching the First Amendment claim because any ruling on that claim would be an improper \nadvisory opinion in violation of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.   \n  We need not address ODH’s constitutional-avoidance argument because we conclude that \n§ 3701.034 violates Plaintiffs’ due process rights by imposing unconstitutional conditions. \nA. \nThe Supreme Court remarked decades ago that the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is \nwell-established:   \nFor at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though a person \nhas no ‘right’ to a valuable government benefit and even though the government \nmay deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon \nwhich the government may not rely.  It may not deny a benefit to a person on a \nbasis  that  infringes  his  constitutionally  protected  interests––especially,  his \ninterest in freedom of speech.  For if the government could deny a benefit to a \nperson  because  of  his  constitutionally  protected  speech  or  associations,  his \nexercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited.  This \nwould allow the government to ‘produce a result which (it) could not command \ndirectly.’  Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526 [(1958)].  Such interference with \nconstitutional rights is impermissible. \nPerry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972) (emphasis added); see also Koontz v. St. Johns \nRiver Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595, 612 (2013) (“A predicate for any unconstitutional \nconditions claim is that the government could not have constitutionally ordered the person \n\nCase: 1: 1  6  - cv-00539-MRB  D   o c #: 66 Filed: 04 / 2  0 /18 Page: 11 of 3 3      PAGEID #: 2223 (11 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v.

Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59–60 (2006)).   \nMore recently, in Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance for Open Soc’y Int’l, 570 U.S. 205 \n(2013)  (hereafter  AOSI),  the  Supreme  Court  invalidated  a  statutory  provision  requiring \norganizations receiving program funds to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex \ntrafficking, finding the provision imposed an unconstitutional condition by requiring that a \nrecipient  affirm  “a  belief  that  by  its  nature  cannot  be  confined  within  the  scope  of  the \nGovernment program.”  AOSI, 570 U.S. at 221.  Chief Justice Roberts wrote for the Court: \nThe United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act \nof 2003 . . . outlined a comprehensive strategy to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS \naround the world.  As part of that strategy, Congress authorized the appropriation \nof billions of dollars to fund efforts by nongovernmental organizations to assist in \nthe fight.  The Act imposes two related conditions on that funding:  First, no funds \nmade available by the Act “may be used to promote or advocate the legalization \nor practice of prostitution or sex trafficking.”  [28 U.S.C.] § 7631(e).  And second, \nno funds may be used by an organization “that does not have a policy explicitly \nopposing prostitution and sex trafficking.”  7631(f).  This case concerns the \nsecond of these conditions, referred to as the Policy Requirement.  The question is \nwhether that funding condition violates a recipient’s First Amendment rights. \n. . . . \nBy demanding that funding recipients adopt—as their own—the Government’s \nview on an issue of public concern, the condition by its very nature affects \n“protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.”  Rust, 500 \nU.S.,  at  197.    A  recipient  cannot  avow  the  belief  dictated  by  the  Policy \nRequirement when spending Leadership Act funds, and then turn around and \nassert a contrary belief, or claim neutrality, when participating in activities on its \nown time and dime.  By requiring recipients to profess a specific belief, the Policy \nRequirement goes beyond defining the limits of the federally funded program to \ndefining the recipient.  See ibid. (“our ‘unconstitutional conditions’ cases involve \nsituations in which the Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the \nsubsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting \nthe recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the \nfederally funded program”). \nAOSI, 570 U.S. at 208, 218–19.  AOSI thus reiterated that the government may not require the \nsurrender of constitutional rights as a condition of participating in an unrelated government \nprogram.  Id. at 214; see also Rust, 500 U.S. at 197.   \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 12 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2224 (12 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 10\n \n  The unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is not limited to First Amendment rights, but \nrather, applies in a number of contexts, Koontz, 570 U.S. at 604 (“We have said in a variety of \ncontexts  that  ‘the  government  may  not  deny  a benefit  to  a  person  because  he  exercises  a \nconstitutional right.’”) (citation omitted), including, as this court has recognized, to vindicate \n“due process rights,” R.S.W.W., Inc. v. City of Keego Harbor, 397 F.3d 427, 434 (6th Cir. 2005) \n(“Under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, ‘a state actor cannot constitutionally condition \nthe receipt of a benefit, such as a liquor license or an entertainment permit, on an agreement to \nrefrain from exercising one’s constitutional rights.’”) (quoting G&V Lounge, Inc. v. Mich. Liquor \nControl Comm’n, 23 F.3d 1071, 1077 (6th Cir. 1994)). \nB. \nODH characterizes Plaintiffs’ claims as resting on an asserted entitlement to government \nfunding.  See Appellant Br. 2, 5 (“Ohio decided to favor childbirth over abortion when it \ndistributes public funds for six health and education programs.  Unhappy with Ohio’s choice, \nPlanned Parenthood seeks a different allocation . . . . It seeks a constitutional guarantee to public \nfunding—a guarantee that forces Ohio, against its own judgment, to give public money to large \nabortion providers.  The Constitution contains no such guarantee.”)   \nODH mischaracterizes Plaintiffs’ argument.  Plaintiffs do not claim an entitlement to \ngovernment funds.  They acknowledge the government’s right to define the parameters of its \nown programs, and have complied with all program requirements.  What they do claim is a right \nnot to be penalized in the administration of government programs based on protected activity \noutside the programs.  As the district court noted, § 3701.034 is unnecessary to accomplish \nOhio’s choices to favor childbirth and refrain from subsidizing abortions; the program funds here \nhave nothing to do with abortion and for decades both federal and Ohio law8 have prohibited the \nuse of government funds to pay for abortions.  PID 2139-42.   \n                                                 \n8\nSee McRae, 448 U.S. at 302 (“Since September 1976, Congress has prohibited—either by an amendment \nto the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or by a joint resolution—the \nuse of any federal funds to reimburse the cost of abortions under the Medicaid program except under certain \nspecified circumstances.  This funding restriction is commonly known as the ‘Hyde Amendment,’ after its original \ncongressional sponsor, Representative Hyde.”) (footnote omitted); Ohio Rev.Code § 9.04, titled “State funding for \nnontherapeutic abortion coverage prohibited.”  \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 13 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2225 (13 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 11\n \nMaher, McRae, and Rust hold that the government may constitutionally make policy and \nvalue judgments in allocating public funds under government programs, and is not required to \nsubsidize abortion by including coverage for abortion in public-benefits programs.  Maher, \n432 U.S. at 470–71, 474 (rejecting challenge to Connecticut Welfare Department regulation \nlimiting  state  Medicaid  benefits  for  first-trimester  abortions  to  those  that  are  medically \nnecessary);  McRae,  448  U.S.  at  322–23  (rejecting  challenge  to  Medicaid  Act’s  Hyde \nAmendment’s limitation of funding to those abortions necessary to save life of mother, while \npermitting funding of costs associated with childbirth.); Rust, 500 U.S. at 192–94 (rejecting \nchallenge to regulations providing funding for family-planning services but prohibiting funds for \nabortion counseling and referral).  The Constitution does not require that the government fund all \nfamily-planning activities equally.  See Rust, 500 U.S. at 194.  Further, the failure to subsidize \nthe exercise of a constitutional right does not abridge the right.  See Maher, 432 U.S. at 474; \nMcRae, 448 U.S. at 316–17; Rust, 500 U.S. at 193.  \nNone of these principles are implicated here.  The issue in the instant challenge is \ndifferent:  whether Ohio may require a provider to surrender the right to provide safe and lawful \nabortions on its own “time and dime” as a condition of participating in government programs \nthat have nothing to do with abortion.  \nMcRae and Maher do not suggest that such a requirement is constitutional.  In fact, \nMcRae acknowledged that a “substantial constitutional question would arise if Congress had \nattempted to withhold all Medicaid benefits from an otherwise eligible candidate simply because \nthat candidate had exercised her constitutionally protected freedom to terminate her pregnancy \nby abortion.”  448 U.S. at 317 n.19.   \nAnd Rust makes clear that the Maher line of cases is inapposite here.  In Rust, the \nSupreme Court addressed regulations implementing Title X of the Public Health Services Act, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 300–300a-6, which “provides federal funding for family-planning services,” and \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to “make grants and \nenter into contracts with public or nonprofit private entities to assist in the establishment and \noperation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and \neffective family planning methods and services.”  500 U.S. at 178 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 300(a)).  \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 14 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2226 (14 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 12\n \nThe challenged regulations prohibited use of Title X funds “in programs where abortion is a \nmethod of family planning.”  Id.  The plaintiffs, Title X grantees and doctors who supervise Title \nX funds, attacked the facial validity of the regulations and sought declaratory and injunctive \nrelief on behalf of themselves and their patients.  The Second Circuit “upheld the regulations, \nfinding them to be a permissible construction of the statute as well as consistent with the First \nand Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.”  Id.   \nIn addressing the petitioners’ First Amendment challenge to the regulations on the basis \nthat they impermissibly discriminated based on viewpoint by prohibiting “all discussion about \nabortion as a lawful option––including counseling, referral, and the provision of neutral and \naccurate information about ending a pregnancy––while compelling the clinic or counselor to \nprovide information that promotes continuing a pregnancy to term,” the Rust Court observed: \nThere is no question but that the statutory prohibition contained in § 1008 is \nconstitutional.  In Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 [] (1977), we upheld a state welfare \nregulation  under  which  Medicaid  recipients  received  payments  for  services \nrelated to childbirth, but not for nontherapeutic abortions.  The Court rejected the \nclaim that this unequal subsidization worked a violation of the Constitution.  We \nheld that the government may “make a value judgment favoring childbirth over \nabortion, and . . . implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.”  Id., \n432 U.S., at 474 [].  Here the Government is exercising the authority it possesses \nunder Maher and Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 [] (1980), to subsidize family \nplanning services which will lead to conception and childbirth, and declining to \n“promote or encourage abortion.”  The Government can, without violating the \nConstitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes \nto be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative \nprogram which seeks to deal with the problem in another way.  In so doing, the \nGovernment has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen \nto fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.  “[A] legislature’s decision not \nto subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.”  \nRegan [v. Taxation with Representation of Wash.,] 461 U.S. [540], 549 [1983] \n. . . . “There is a basic difference between direct state interference with a protected \nactivity  and  state  encouragement  of  an  alternative  activity  consonant  with \nlegislative policy.”  Maher, supra, 432 U.S., at 475 [].   \n. . . .  \nPetitioners’ assertions ultimately boil down to the position that if the government \nchooses to subsidize one protected right, it must subsidize analogous counterpart \nrights.  But the Court has soundly rejected that proposition.  Regan v. Taxation \nwith Representation of Wash., supra; Maher v. Roe, supra; Harris v. McRae, \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 15 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2227 15 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 13\n \nsupra.  Within far broader limits than petitioners are willing to concede, when the \nGovernment appropriates public funds to establish a program it is entitled to \ndefine the limits of that program. \nRust, 500 U.S. at 192–94.  Rust thus simply reiterated that the government is not required to \nsubsidize the provision or promotion of abortion, even when it chooses to fund other family-\nplanning programs and services.  Critically, the regulations at issue in Rust, unlike § 3701.034, \nwere directly related to the use of the program funds:  Title X family-planning funds could not be \nused to fund family-planning programs where abortion is a method of family planning.  Here, the \nstatute restricts funds in programs that are completely unrelated to family planning or abortion.  \nFurther, the regulations challenged in Rust, unlike the statute here, did not penalize abortion \nproviders for activities outside the federally funded family-planning program.   \nRust itself observed, “our ‘unconstitutional conditions’ cases involve situations in which \nthe Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather than on a particular \nprogram or service, thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected \nconduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.”  Id. at 197 (emphasis in original).  \nUnlike in Rust, that is precisely what § 3701.034 does.   \nFurther, in rejecting the petitioners’ reliance on the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, \nthe Rust Court distinguished the Rust petitioners’ situation from alternative scenarios similar to \nthe one presented here:  \nPetitioners also contend that the restrictions on the subsidization of abortion- \nrelated  speech  contained  in  the  regulations  are  impermissible  because  they \ncondition  the  receipt  of  a  benefit,  in  these  cases  Title  X  funding,  on  the \nrelinquishment of a constitutional right, the right to engage in abortion advocacy \nand counseling.  Relying on Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 [] (1972), \nand FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 [] (1984), petitioners \nargue that “even though the government may deny [a] . . . benefit for any number \nof reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.  \nIt may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally \nprotected interests—especially, his interest in freedom of speech.”  Perry, supra, \n408 U.S., at 597 []. \nPetitioners’  reliance  on  these  cases  is  unavailing,  however,  because  here  the \nGovernment is not denying a benefit to anyone, but instead simply insisting that \npublic funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized.  The \nSecretary’s regulations do not force the Title X grantee to give up abortion-related \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 16 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2228 (16 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 14\n \nspeech; they merely require that the grantee keep such activities separate and \ndistinct from Title X activities.  Title X expressly distinguishes between a Title X \ngrantee and a Title X project.  The grantee, which normally is a health-care \norganization,  may  receive  funds  from  a  variety  of  sources  for  a  variety  of \npurposes.  The grantee receives Title X funds, however, for the specific and \nlimited  purpose  of  establishing  and  operating  a  Title  X  project.    42  U.S.C \n§ 300(a).  The regulations govern the scope of the Title X project’s activities, and \nleave the grantee unfettered in its other activities.  The Title X grantee can \ncontinue to perform abortions, provide abortion-related services, and engage in \nabortion  advocacy;  it  simply  is  required  to  conduct  those  activities  through \nprograms that are separate and independent from the project that receives Title X \nfunds.  42 CFR § 59.9 (1989). \nId. at 196–97 (emphasis in original).  In contrast, the statute here does not distinguish between \nthe grantee and the project; it does not permit the grantee to keep the abortion-related speech and \nactivities separate from governmental programs; it does not leave the grantee unfettered in its \nother activities; and it does not permit the grantee to “continue to perform abortions, provide \nabortion-related  services,  and  engage  in  abortion  advocacy  .  .  .  through  programs  that  are \nseparate and independent from the project[s] that receive[] the [six program funds].”  Rust, \n500 U.S. at 197.   \n  Thus, we do not agree with ODH that § 3701.034 “comports with due process” under \nMaher, McRae, and Rust. \nC. \nWe turn to ODH’s argument, rejected by the district court, that the unconstitutional-\nconditions doctrine, at most, bars unconstitutional conditions only when they actually operate to \nimpose an undue burden.  ODH relies on the Seventh Circuit’s divided decision in Planned \nParenthood of Indiana, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Department of Health, 699 F.3d \n962 (7th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (hereafter PPI).9  Appellant Br. 36–37, \n47-48; Reply Br. 4, 14.

No. 11-2464, 2011 WL \n3274237.  Planned Parenthood then filed a conditional cross-petition for certiorari, requesting that if the Court grants \nIndiana’s petition, it also grant review of the Seventh Circuit’s unconstitutional-conditions holding.  Conditional \nCross-Petition for Certiorari filed in No. 12-1559, 2013 WL 1191187.  The Supreme Court denied certiorari.   \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 17 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2229 (17 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 15\n \nincome patients who used its services, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the \nconstitutionality of an Indiana law that prohibited state agencies from contracting with or making \ngrants  to  any  entity  that  performs  abortions.    The  district  court  did  not  rule  on  PPI’s \nunconstitutional-conditions claim, but the Seventh Circuit panel majority addressed it, observing \nthat the government need not be neutral between abortion providers and other medical providers, \nparticularly regarding the use of public funds, and that as long as the difference in treatment does \nnot unduly burden a woman’s right to obtain an abortion, the government is free to treat abortion \nproviders differently from other medical providers:  \nThe first step in any unconstitutional-conditions claim is to identify the nature and \nscope of the constitutional right arguably imperiled by the denial of a public \nbenefit.  .  .  .  Here,  Planned  Parenthood’s  unconstitutional-conditions  claim \nnecessarily derives from a woman’s constitutional right to obtain an abortion.  See \nPlanned  Parenthood  of  Se.  Pa.  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833,  846  []  (1992) \n(“Constitutional protection of the woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy \nderives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” (emphasis \nadded)).  Under existing precedent any protection for Planned Parenthood as an \nabortion provider is “derivative of the woman’s position.”  Id. at 884 [] (plurality \nopinion). \nTwo aspects of the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence are important here.  \nFirst, the Court has explained that the constitutional right to obtain an abortion is \na right against coercive governmental burdens; the government may not “prohibit \nany woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy” before \nfetal viability or impose an “undue burden on a woman’s ability to make this \ndecision.”  Id. at 874, 879 []; see also Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 146 [] \n(2007).  An “undue burden” exists if the challenged law has the “purpose or \neffect” of placing “a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an \nabortion before the fetus attains viability.”  Casey, 505 U.S. at 878 [] (plurality \nopinion); see also Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 146 []. \nAccordingly,  the  Court  has  conceptualized  the  right  as  “a  constitutionally \nprotected  interest  ‘in  making  certain  kinds  of  important  decisions’  free  from \ngovernmental compulsion.”  Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 473 (1977) (quoting \nWhalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599–600 & nn. 24 & 26 [] (1977)). \nThis brings up the second important point.  The Court has explicitly rejected a \nneutrality-based view of abortion rights.  Thus, the Court has held that although \nthe abortion right recognized in Roe v. Wade “protects the woman from unduly \nburdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her \npregnancy[,] [i]t implies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value \njudgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and to implement that judgment by \nthe allocation of public funds.”  Id. at 473–74 [].  In Maher the Court upheld \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 18 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2230 (18 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 16\n \nConnecticut’s ban on public funding for non-therapeutic abortions because it \n“places no obstacles—absolute or otherwise—in the pregnant woman’s path to an \nabortion.”  Id. at 474 [].  The Court reaffirmed Maher in Harris v. McRae, \n448 U.S.  297,  314–17  []  (1980),  upholding  the  Hyde  Amendment.    And  in \nWebster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 508–11 [] (1989), the \nCourt  upheld  Missouri’s  statutory  ban  on  the  use  of  public  employees  and \nfacilities to perform or assist in the performance of an abortion. \nFinally, in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 [] (1991), the Court rejected a challenge \nto federal regulations prohibiting recipients of Title X family-planning grants \nfrom advocating abortion as a method of family planning or referring patients for \nabortion.  Under the regulations, grant recipients with abortion-related practices \ncould continue to receive Title X money only if they segregated their abortion-\nrelated activities in a separate affiliate.  Id. at 179–81 [].  Rust held that the \nregulations did not place an unconstitutional condition on Title X grant recipients. \nId. at 203.  This was so whether the claim was premised on the speech rights \nof the providers, id. at 196–99 [], or the abortion rights of their patients, id. at \n201–03  [].    As  relevant  here,  the  Court  reaffirmed  the  holdings  of Webster, \nHarris, and Maher that “[t]he Government has no constitutional duty to subsidize \nan  activity  merely  because  the  activity  is  constitutionally  protected  and  may \nvalidly choose to fund childbirth over abortion.”  Id. at 201.  Because the Title X \nregulations did not place an undue burden on a woman’s right to obtain an \nabortion or otherwise impose an unconstitutional condition on grant recipients, \nthe Court upheld the regulatory scheme.  Id. at 203 []. \nAs these cases make clear, the government need not be neutral between abortion \nproviders and other medical providers, and this principle is particularly well-\nestablished in the context of governmental decisions regarding the use of public \nfunds.  As long as the difference in treatment does not unduly burden a woman’s \nright to obtain an abortion, the government is free to treat abortion providers \ndifferently. \nApplying these principles here, the unconstitutional-conditions claim is not likely \nto succeed.  Planned Parenthood does not argue that the loss of its block-grant \nfunding imposes an undue burden—directly or indirectly—on a woman’s right to \nobtain an abortion.  If, as the foregoing cases hold, the government’s refusal to \nsubsidize abortion does not unduly burden a woman’s right to obtain an abortion, \nthen Indiana’s ban on public funding of abortion providers—even for unrelated \nservices—cannot indirectly burden a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. \nPPI, 699 F.3d at 986–88 (emphasis in original).10 \n                                                 \n10\nJudge Cudahy dissented in part, concluding that the record was insufficiently developed to permit \nconsideration of the state’s restrictions on block-grant funding (Medicaid funding was also at issue) and that “the \nissue of unconstitutional conditions should be remanded to the district court for development of the record with \nrespect to any possible imposition of a burden on access to abortions.”  699 F.3d at 988–89. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 19 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2231 (19 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 17\n \nWe are not persuaded by the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning or ODH’s arguments.  The \nSeventh Circuit did not directly address the unconstitutional-conditions argument.  It identified \nthe right at issue as a woman’s right to obtain an abortion free of the government’s imposition of \nan undue burden; noted that the cases make clear that the government is not required to remain \nneutral on abortion and has no obligation to fund abortion or abortion advocacy, even when \nfunding other family-planning activity; noted that there was no claim or showing that the loss of \nthe block-grant money imposed an undue burden on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion; and \nconcluded without further explanation that if “the government’s refusal to subsidize abortion \ndoes not unduly burden a woman’s right to an abortion, then Indiana’s ban on public funding of \nabortion providers––even for unrelated services––cannot indirectly burden a woman’s right to \nobtain an abortion.”  PPI, 699 F.3d at 988 (emphasis in original).  This analysis completely \nelides the unconstitutional-conditions argument by concluding, in effect, that because Ohio has \nthe right to refuse to fund abortion, it necessarily has the right to refuse to provide any funds to \nabortion providers, regardless of how the funds are to be used; and this right is subject only to \nthe requirement that it not unduly burden a woman’s right to obtain an abortion, which the \nchallenged provision did not.   \nIn discussing Rust, the PPI court appeared to recognize that the undue burden and \nunconstitutional-conditions doctrines are different––“[b]ecause the Title X regulations did not \nplace  an  undue  burden  on  a  woman’s  right  to  obtain  an  abortion  or  otherwise  impose  an \nunconstitutional condition on grant recipients, the Court upheld the regulatory scheme,” id. at \n988 (emphasis added)––but then went on to ignore the latter.  Its analysis does not grapple with \nthe argument that although the government may constitutionally place conditions on the use of \nprogram funds, favoring one public policy over others even in the face of a constitutional right to \npursue the disfavored policy, the government may not constitutionally exclude a recipient from \nfunding based on the recipient’s exercise of constitutional rights outside the parameters of the \nprogram that have no bearing on or nexus to the program.  PPI fails to acknowledge that if the \ngovernment cannot directly prohibit Plaintiffs from providing and advocating for abortion on \ntheir own time and dime, it may not do so by excluding them from government programs for \nwhich they otherwise qualify and which have nothing to do with the government’s choice to \ndisfavor abortion. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 20 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2232 (20 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 18\n \nWe note that PPI was decided before AOSI, which may account for the failure to give \ndue consideration to the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine.  Other courts have applied the \nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine in similar circumstances without engaging in an undue-\nburden analysis.  In Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Herbert , 828 F.3d 1245 (10th Cir. \n2016) (hereafter PPAU), Utah’s governor, one of the defendants, issued a directive instructing \nstate  agencies  to  cease  acting  as  intermediaries  for  pass-through  federal  funds  to  Planned \nParenthood for four federal programs unrelated to abortion.  828 F.3d at 1250.  The directive was \nissued  in  response  to  videos  released  by  an  organization  purportedly  showing  Planned \nParenthood staff discussing its fetal-tissue donation program.  PPAU sought declaratory and \ninjunctive  relief  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  alleging  violations  of  its  Equal  Protection,  First \nAmendment,  and  Due  Process  rights,  the  latter  two  under  the  unconstitutional-conditions \ndoctrine.  Id. at 1258.  PPAU’s motion for preliminary injunction argued that its “association \nwith other Planned Parenthood providers who participate in lawful programs that allow abortion \npatients to donate fetal tissue for scientific research . . . is protected under the First Amendment,” \nand that the governor’s directive violated its rights and its patients’ due process rights “to \nprovide and access abortion services by imposing a penalty on PPAU for the provision of and/or \nassociation with abortion services without adequate justification.”  Id. at 1251.  The district court \ndenied the motion for temporary restraining order and PPAU sought interlocutory review.   \nThe  Tenth  Circuit  reversed  on  the  First  Amendment  and  Due  Process  claims  and \nremanded for entry of a temporary restraining order in PPAU’s favor, observing:  \nPPAU’s unconstitutional conditions claims . . . . alleged . . . that Herbert took a \ndiscretionary executive action, i.e., issuing the Directive, that terminated PPAU’s \ncontractual relationships with [the Executive Director of the Utah Department of \nHealth] and was motivated by PPAU’s engagement in the following activities:  \n“associat[ing] with other Planned Parenthood providers who participate in lawful \nprograms  that  allow  abortion  patients  to  donate  fetal  tissue  for  scientific \nresearch,” Dist. Ct. Docket No. 3 at 3; advocating for legal abortions, App. at 475; \nassociating with organizations for political, social and education reasons, id. at \n476; and providing abortion services to its patients. \n. . . . \nPPAU has also alleged in Count 3, without serious challenge from defendants, a \nFourteenth  Amendment  right.    The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  “the \nFourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 21 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2233 (21 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 19\n \naction . . .  encompass[es] a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her \npregnancy.”    Roe  v.  Wade,  410  U.S.  113,  153  (1973).    The  Court  has  also \nrecognized that, “because abortion is a medical procedure, . . . the full vindication \nof the woman’s fundamental right necessarily requires that her” medical provider \nbe afforded the right to “‘make his best medical judgment,’” which includes \n“implementing [the woman’s decision] should she choose to have an abortion.”  \nCity of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 427 [] (1983) \n(quoting Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 192 [] (1973)), overruled on other grounds \nby Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 [] (1992). . . . \nHaving  determined  that  PPAU  has  identified  valid  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights, that leaves the question of whether PPAU can establish that \nHerbert issued the Directive in retaliation for PPAU’s exercise of those rights.  \nThe district court concluded that PPAU failed to establish a likelihood of success \non this point . . . . \n. . . . [disagreeing with district court’s determination that PPAU did not establish \nthat the governor’s opposition to abortion was a substantial or motivating factor \nfor the directive/termination of contracts] \n. . . . \nConsidering all of th[e] evidence together, we conclude that a reasonable finder of \nfact is more likely than not to find that Herbert issued the Directive to punish \nPPAU for the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights it has identified in this \nlitigation . . . . \n. . . . \nIn summary, we conclude that PPAU has established a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of its unconstitutional conditions claims and that the district \ncourt erred in concluding otherwise. \nPPAU, 828 F.3d at 1259–63.  The PPAU court did not find it necessary to ask whether the \nGovernor’s directive would unduly burden the availability of abortion services in Utah.  It was \nenough that the directive likely11 amounted to an unconstitutional penalty for PPAU’s abortion-\nrelated conduct and association.  \nIn Planned Parenthood of Southwest & Central Florida v. Philip, 194 F. Supp. 3d 1213 \n(N.D. Fla. 2016) (hereafter PPSCF), the district court rejected the argument of the defendants, \nFlorida’s State Surgeon General and Secretary of Health Care Administration, that the only \nrestriction the Constitution places on abortion legislation is that the state cannot impose an undue \n                                                 \n11\nBecause the court was reviewing the denial of a preliminary injunction, it evaluated the likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 22 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2234 (22 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 20\n \nburden on a woman’s right to an abortion.  194 F. Supp. 3d at 1220.  PPSCF and other affiliates \nchallenged a newly enacted “defunding provision,” Fla. Stat. § 390.0111(15), which provided, as \npertinent here, that a state agency or local government entity “may not expend funds for the \nbenefit of, pay funds to, or initiate or renew a contract with an organization that owns, operates, \nor  is  affiliated  with  one  or  more  clinics  that  are  licensed  under  this  chapter  and  perform \nabortions.”  194 F. Supp. 3d at 1215.  The district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary injunction, observing: \nUnder the defunding provision, as a condition of receiving state or local funds for \nunrelated services, the plaintiffs must stop providing abortions that women are \nconstitutionally entitled to obtain.  But as the defendants acknowledged at oral \nargument,  the  state  could  not  constitutionally  prohibit  the  plaintiffs  from \nproviding  these  abortions.    The  Supreme  Court  has  repeatedly  said  that  a \ngovernment  cannot  prohibit  indirectly—by  withholding  otherwise-available \npublic funds—conduct that the government could not constitutionally prohibit \ndirectly. \n. . . .  \nHere . . . the constitutional right at issue—or, at least, the primary constitutional \nright  at  issue—belongs  to  the  plaintiffs’  patients.    A  patient  has  a  right  to \nan abortion,  within  limits.    See,  e.g.,  Whole  Woman’s  Health  v.  Hellerstedt, \nNo. 15–274, ––– U.S. –––, 136 S. Ct. 2292, 195 L. Ed. 2d 665 (U.S. June 27, \n2016); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 \n[] (1982); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 [] (1973).  The plaintiffs have a right to \nprovide abortions, but the right is derivative of the patients’ rights. \n. . . . \nIf, as the Court said in Rust, Congress can prohibit the use of federal funds for \nabortion services but cannot restrict a recipient of federal funds from separately \nproviding abortion services, then the Florida legislature likewise can prohibit the \nuse of state funds for abortion services but cannot prohibit a recipient of state \nfunds from separately providing abortion services.  Rust is fatal to the defunding \nprovision, which was enacted precisely and only for a prohibited purpose:  to \nreach other, unrelated activities that are separate from the recipient’s abortion \nservices.  That this was the only purpose of the defunding provision is clear \nbecause Florida law already prohibited the use of state funds for abortions. \nPPSCF, 194 F. Supp. 3d at 1216–19.  Similar to ODH’s argument here, the Florida defendants \nargued that the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine does not apply in the abortion context and \nthat the statute was limited only by Casey’s requirement that the state cannot impose an undue \nburden on women’s right to an abortion.  The PPSCF court rejected that argument: \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 23 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2235 (23 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 21\n \nThe defendants’ assertion that the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine does not \napply in this context is incorrect.  Nothing in Whole Woman’s Health or Casey \nsuggests in any way that those decisions were intended to supplant the wholly \nseparate unconstitutional-conditions doctrine.  And Rust’s analysis is squarely to \nthe contrary. \nPPSCF, 194 F. Supp. 3d at 1220.12  We agree. \nFinally, in Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina v. Cansler, 877 F. Supp. 2d \n310 (M.D. N.C. 2015) (hereafter PPCNC), PPCNC alleged that a North Carolina statute violated \nits rights under the Due Process Clause by denying non-abortion related funding based on its \nactivity as an abortion-rights advocate and abortion provider.  877 F. Supp. 2d at 314–15.  The \ndistrict court granted PPCNC’s motion for summary judgment and a permanent injunction, \nconcluding that the provision violated PPCNC’s due process (and First Amendment) rights \nbecause only PPCNC and its affiliates were excluded and, since there was no evidence that it \nwould have used government funds for abortion-related services, the provision limited access to \ngovernment funding in a manner that impeded the organization’s constitutional rights and was \nnot necessary to serve a compelling government interest.  Id. at 318–21.  The PPCNC court \nstated: \n[I]t is undisputed that only Planned Parenthood and its affiliates are excluded \nfrom DHHS-administered contracts and grants under Section 10.19.  It is also \nundisputed that Planned Parenthood is an entity that would be otherwise eligible \nto  receive  funding,  but  for  Section  10.19.    Moreover,  although  Defendant \ncontends that Section 10.19 operates merely as an exercise of discretion with \nregard to funding decisions, based on the State’s objective in favoring childbirth \nover abortion, it is undisputed that the government funding at issue in this case \nwould not be used to fund abortion-related services or advocacy.  In that regard, \nthe  Court  notes  that  Defendant  has  provided  no  evidence  that  the  funding \nprohibition in Section 10.19 is necessary to ensure that government funds are not \nused for abortion-related services, as both federal and North Carolina legislation \nalready  exist  to  bar  government  funds  from  being  used  for  abortion-related \nservices.  Furthermore, Defendant has presented no evidence or even allegation \nthat Plaintiff would use, or has ever used, government funds for abortion-related \nservices.    Rather,  “there  is  no  dispute  that  Section  10.19  prohibits  Planned \nParenthood and its affiliated organizations, including PPCNC, from receiving \nfunding for non-abortion-related projects based on their other activities for which \n                                                 \n12\nNo appeal was taken in PPSCF. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 24 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2236 (24 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 22\n \nthey have not sought funding.”  (Prelim. Inj. Order, 804 F. Supp. 2d at 493).  \nTherefore, based on the evidence before the Court, and the line of precedent \ndescribed herein, the Court finds that Section 10.19 limits access to government \nfunding  for  Plaintiff,  as  a  recipient,  in  a  manner  that  impedes  Plaintiff’s \nconstitutional  rights,  and  which  is  not  necessary  to  serve  a  compelling \ngovernment  interest.    [Planned  Parenthood  of  Mid-Mo.  &  E.  Kan.,  Inc.  v.] \nDempsey, 167 F.3d [458,] 461 [(8th Cir. 1999)] (“[F]unding classifications that \ninterfere with the exercise of constitutional rights must be necessary to promote a \ncompelling interest.” (internal quotations and citations omitted)). \nPPCNC, 877 F. Supp. 2d at 320–21 (most internal citations to record omitted).13  The same is \ntrue here. \n  We reject the Seventh Circuit’s analysis in PPI in favor of the reasoning in these cases, \nwhich parallels our own. \nIn sum, as reaffirmed in AOSI, which was decided after PPI, although the government \nhas no obligation to subsidize constitutionally protected activity, it may not use its control over \nfunds  to  curtail  the  exercise  of  constitutionally  protected  rights  outside  the  scope  of  a \ngovernment-funded program.  In the instant case, § 3701.034 imposes conditions on funding \nunder the six non-abortion related federal programs and the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine \nis  thus  applicable.    We  do  not  find  PPI  persuasive;  as  the  district  court  determined,  its \nimportation of Casey’s undue-burden analysis is questionable.  See PPSCF, 194 F. Supp. 3d at \n1213.  Neither Casey, 505 U.S. 833, nor Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292 \n(2016), discussed infra, suggests that the undue-burden analysis was intended to replace the \nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine.   \nIV. \nEven accepting ODH’s assertion that in the “abortion” context we must engage in an \nundue-burden analysis, Plaintiffs established that § 3701.034 is unnecessary to advance the \ninterests ODH asserts. \nSeveral years after the Seventh Circuit issued PPI, the Supreme Court clarified the \nundue-burden standard in Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. 2292, as revised (June 27, 2016), \n                                                 \n13\nNo appeal was taken in PPCNC. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 25 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2237 (25 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 23\n \nexplaining that “[t]he [undue-burden] rule announced in Casey . . . requires that courts consider \nthe burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.”  \nWhole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. at 2309–1014 (citing Casey, 505 U.S. at 887–898) [] (opinion \nof the Court) (performing this balancing with respect to a spousal notification provision); id., at \n899–901 [] (joint opinion of O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.) (same balancing with respect \nto a parental notification provision)).   \nA. \nODH asserts that the “conduct provision,” which bars funding for entities that perform \nabortions, furthers the following important state interests:  1) the interest in promoting life, \n2) “prevent[ing] entanglement between program services and abortion services–ensuring that \ntaxpayer  dollars  do  not  subsidize  abortion,”  3)  serving  “administrative  considerations”  by \nensuring that taxpayer funds do not directly or indirectly subsidize abortion (“it is much easier \nfor the government simply to preclude abortion providers from participating in the programs than \nto allow their participation subject to costly oversight and audits”), and 4) “help[ing] Ohio \nconvey its childbirth preference” “[b]y separating abortion providers from these programs, the \nConduct Provision clarifies Ohio’s message.”  Appellant Br. 39–41. \n  However, Ohio’s important interests in preferring childbirth to abortion, promoting life, \nand not subsidizing abortions have only the most tenuous relationship to § 3701.034.  Precluding \nPlaintiffs from funding under the six federal preventive-health programs that have nothing to do \nwith abortion does little to promote these interests.  Separate and apart from § 3701.034, no \nprogram funds are or can be used to perform, promote or support abortion.  See McRae, 448 U.S. \nat 303.  Nor does ODH’s asserted interest in preventing entanglement between program services \nand abortion services have any weight, since the six government programs have nothing to do \nwith  abortion  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  history  of  entanglement.   Regarding   the \nadministrative burden of “costly oversight and audits,” ODH neither cites the record nor points \nto evidence in support.  \n                                                 \n14\nCiting Whole Woman’s Health and Casey, Plaintiffs correctly assert that Ohio indisputably could not ban \nPPGOH and PPSWO from providing “nontherapeutic abortions.”  Appellees Br. 35. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 26 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2238 (26 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 24\n \nB. \nODH  argues  that  §  3701.034’s  “conduct  provision”  neither  directly  nor  indirectly \nimposes any burden on a woman’s right to an abortion.  Appellant Br. 36–38.  \nODH does not contest that if Plaintiffs acquiesce in the unconstitutional conditions by \nceasing all abortion activity and advocacy in favor of continuing to participate in the six federal \nprograms, women in Ohio will suffer an undue burden on their ability to obtain legal abortions.  \nRelying on deposition testimony regarding funding for Plaintiffs’ various activities, ODH argues \nthat Plaintiffs will not abandon their abortion activities, and thus women’s abortion rights will \nnot be unduly burdened.  ODH cites no case in support of its argument that a plaintiff who \nestablishes  an  unconstitutional  condition  must  also  show  that  it  would  yield  to  the \nunconstitutional coercion.  ODH’s argument sidesteps that the Supreme Court has recognized \nthat the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine prohibits the imposition of the condition itself.  See \nAOSI, 570 U.S. at 214 (government action need not be “actually coercive” to constitute an \nunconstitutional condition).  \nODH further argues that abortion rights are different because the right belongs to women, \nnot their health-care providers, and although Plaintiffs might be disadvantaged, § 3701.034 does \nnot unduly burden women’s right to access abortion because Plaintiffs will continue to operate as \nusual.  It has been recognized repeatedly that because the abortion right depends on providers to \noffer the service, conditions on abortion providers inherently affect women seeking abortions.  \nSee Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (observing that since a woman “cannot safely \nsecure an abortion without the aid of a physician,” “the constitutionally protected abortion \ndecision is one in which the physician is intimately involved,” and “[a]side from the woman \nherself, therefore, the physician is uniquely qualified to litigate the constitutionality of the State’s \ninterference with, or discrimination against, that decision.”); Planned Parenthood of Mid-Mo. & \nE. Kan., 167 F.3d at 464 (addressing the effect of the challenged Missouri law on “Planned \nParenthood’s  constitutional  right[]”  to  “provide  abortion  services”);  Planned  Parenthood  of \nCent. & N. Ariz., 718 F.2d at 944 (determining “whether the State unduly interfered with Planned \nParenthood’s exercise of its right to perform abortion and abortion-related services”).   \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 27 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2239 (27 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 25\n \nFurther, there is no complete separation between the Plaintiff providers and their patients \nthat ODH would have us accept.  Although Plaintiffs’ choice to resist ODH’s unconstitutional \nattempt to coerce them to abandon all abortion activity and advocacy means that women in Ohio \nwill not suffer the drastic reduction in abortion services that would have occurred if Plaintiffs \nhad made a different choice, § 3701.034 still has a substantial effect on women, in addition to \nproviders.  It is undisputed that Plaintiffs are among the largest providers of health services in the \nareas their twenty-seven clinics serve under the federal programs at issue,15 and provide many of \nthose services free of charge to low-income and underserved communities.16  If Plaintiffs are \nexcluded from the federal programs, they will no longer be able to provide the services for \nfree.17    Thus,  as  a  condition  of  retaining  access  to  abortion  free  of  undue  governmental \ninterference, Ohio women must forego the extensive and subsidized access to health services \nunder federal programs that they previously enjoyed.  Although Ohio women do not have a right \nto the programs, they do have a right not to have their access to important health services \ncurtailed because their major abortion providers opted to protect women’s abortion rights rather \nthan yield to unconstitutional conditions. \n                                                 \n15\nPlaintiffs provide more than half of all STD tests administered in Ohio under the STD Prevention \nProgram.

Himes  Page 26\n \nV.  FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIM \nWe turn to ODH’s argument that § 3701.034’s speech provision, which prohibits the \nallocation of program funds to any entity that promotes abortions, does not violate the First \nAmendment.  Appellant Br. 49–55.   \nIn some cases, a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on First \nAmendment rights.  See AOSI, 570 U.S. at 218 (“By requiring recipients to profess a specific \nbelief, the Policy Requirement goes beyond defining the limits of the federally funded program \nto defining the recipient.”); Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 59 (the First Amendment supplies “a limit on \nCongress’ ability to place conditions on the receipt of funds”).   \nA. \nAs discussed, ODH is correct that states are free to “make a value judgment favoring \nchildbirth over abortion, and . . . implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.”  \nPID 2129, citing Maher, 432 U.S. at 474; see also McRae, 448 U.S. at 302.  For decades Ohio \nlegislation has been in place that bars the use of public funds to pay for abortion services.  PID \n2129, citing Ohio Rev. Code § 5101.56 (providing that “[u]nless required by the United States \nConstitution or by federal statute, or decisions of federal courts, state or local funds may not be \nused for payment or reimbursement for abortion services” unless certain circumstances apply, \nnone applicable here).  Plaintiffs accept this as a given. \n  Relying on Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Hidalgo County Texas, Inc. v. Suehs, 692 F.3d \n343 (5th Cir. 2012), ODH argues that § 3701.034’s speech provision does no more than is \nconstitutionally permissible by seeking “to ensure that contractors who convey Ohio’s messages \ndo so efficiently and effectively,” Appellant Br. 52–53.  In Suehs, the Texas legislature created \nthe “Women’s Health Program (WHP),” 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 2817, 2871, in 2005, which was \ndesigned to “expand access to preventative health and family planning services for women.”  \n692 F.3d. at 346 (citation omitted).  Since the WHP’s inception, the Texas Legislature prohibited \nthe Texas Health and Human Services Commission (THHSC), which administers the WHP, from \ncontracting with “entities that perform or promote elective abortions or are affiliates that perform \nor promote elective abortions.”  Id. at 346 (citation omitted).  However, THHSC did not exclude \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 29 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2241 (29 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 27\n \nPlanned Parenthood from receiving WHP funds until 2011, when the Texas Legislature re-\nauthorized the WHP and promulgated regulations.  The plaintiff health-clinic operators alleged \nthat the regulations violated their First Amendment rights of free-speech and association, and the \nguarantee of Equal Protection.  Applying the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, the district \ncourt determined the regulations likely violated these constitutionally guaranteed rights and \nissued a preliminary injunction.  The Fifth Circuit vacated the district court’s order granting a \npreliminary injunction and remanded, explaining: \nWe begin with the restriction on promoting elective abortions.  The THHSC \nregulations  exclude  health  care  providers  from  the  WHP  who  “promote  [  ] \nelective abortions as . . . abortion facilit[ies] licensed under [the] Health and \nSafety Code.”  1 Tex. Admin. Code § 354.1363(a)(2)(A).  This restriction, in a \nsense, imposes a speech-based condition on organizations receiving the benefit of \nWHP funding.  If an organization wishes to receive WHP funding, it may not \n“[a]dvocate[ ] or popularize[ ] [elective abortions] by, for example, advertising or \npublicity”  as  a  licensed  abortion  facility.   Id.  §  354.1362(6).    Although  this \nrestriction functions as a speech-based funding condition, it also functions as a \ndirect regulation of the content of a state program, and is therefore constitutional \nunder the reasoning of Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 [] (1991).  In Rust v. \nSullivan, the Supreme Court considered federal regulations limiting the abortion-\nrelated speech of clinics receiving funds under Title X of the Public Health \nService Act.  500 U.S. at 178 [].  The disputed regulations broadly prohibited a \nTitle X project from promoting or advocating abortion as a method of family \nplanning, including advocating abortion in the political arena.  Id. at 180 [].  The \nCourt  upheld  the  regulations,  reasoning  that  the  government  could  disfavor \nabortion within its own subsidized program, and that exclusively subsidizing non-\nabortion family planning speech did not penalize abortion speech.  Id. at 192–93 \n[].  Subsequent opinions have recognized Rust as affirming the government’s \nauthority to enact viewpoint-based restrictions on speech when the government is, \nin effect, the speaker.  Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 540–41 [] \n(2001); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833 [] \n(1995).    “[W]hen  the  government  appropriates  public  funds  to  promote  a \nparticular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes.”  Rosenberger, \n515 U.S. at 833 [] (citing Rust, 500 U.S. at 194 []). . . . \n. . . . We hold that Texas may deny WHP funds from organizations that promote \nelective  abortions.    This  specific  restriction  on  the  breadth  of  the  program \nfunctions as a direct regulation of the definitional content of a state program, and \nit  is  therefore  unnecessary  to  examine  it  within  the  framework  of  the \nunconstitutional conditions doctrine.  The district court erred in enjoining this \nprovision of the regulations. \nSuehs, 692 F.3d 343, 349–50. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 30 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2242 (30 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 28\n \nWe agree with the district court that Suehs is distinguishable and inapposite: \nDefendant  points  out  that  even  though  Texas’s  funding  condition  applied  to \nprogram participants, rather than just program activities, the Fifth Circuit found \nthe funding restriction was proper.  However, there are key differences between \nSection 3701.034 and the WHP, as the [Fifth Circuit’s] explanation of its holding \nillustrates: \nTexas’s  restriction  on  promoting  elective  abortions  directly \nregulates the content of the WHP as a state program.  The policy \nexpressed in the WHP is for public funds to subsidize non-abortion \nfamily  planning  speech  to  the  exclusion  of  abortion  speech.  \n§ 1.19(b),  2011  Tex.  Gen.  Laws  at  335.    Texas’s  authority  to \npromote that policy would be meaningless if it were forced to \nenlist organizations as health care providers and message-bearers \nthat  were  also  abortion  advocates.    The  authority  of  Texas  to \ndisfavor  abortion  within  its  own  subsidized  program  is  not \nviolative of the First Amendment right, as interpreted by Rust v. \nSullivan.  Consequently, Texas’s choice to disfavor abortion does \nnot unconstitutionally penalize the appellees’ speech. \n[692 F.3d] at 350.  In contrast, Section 3701.034 is not a direct regulation of the \ncontent of a state program.  Instead, Section 3701.034 places the speech-based \nfunding condition on the recipient of the funds [based on] activities conducted \noutside the six programs impacted . . . As a result, Section 3701.034 does not \n“leave the grantee unfettered in its other activities.”  Rust, 500 U.S. at 196.   \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, 201 F. Supp. 3d at 905.  \nB. \n  We also reject ODH’s related argument that the State of Ohio may, consistent with the \nFirst Amendment, ensure that its message favoring childbirth over abortion is not garbled.  As \nthe district court found, this case involves no state “message” related to or regarding abortion; \n§ 3701.034 affects programs that have nothing to do with abortion or family planning, and seeks \nto impose restrictions on recipients’ speech outside the six government programs the statute \nfunds.  PID 2132/Dist. Ct. Op.; see, e.g., AOSI, 570 U.S. at 218 (a recipient of government \nfunding is free under the First Amendment to express its own views “when participating in \nactivities on its own time and dime”).  \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 31 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2243 (31 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v. Himes  Page 29\n \nC. \nAs the district court determined, because “the conditions imposed by Section 3701.034 \nseek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the six programs impacted by \nSection 3701.034,” the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine applies.  Planned Parenthood of \nGreater Ohio, 201 F. Supp. 3d at 906 (emphasis added).  Nothing within the scope of these six \nprograms relates to performing or promoting abortion.  Therefore, the district court correctly \ndetermined that § 3701.034 cannot condition participation in funding for these programs on a \nrecipient’s  foregoing  the  exercise  of  its  rights  of  free  speech  or  association  outside  these \nprograms.  PID 2133.  Accord Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 462  (“Legislation that simply dictates the \nproper scope of government-funded programs is constitutional, while legislation that restricts \nprotected  grantee  activities  outside  government  programs  is  unconstitutional[.]”);  Planned \nParenthood of Cent. & N. Ariz. v. Ariz., 718 F.2d 938, 942–44 (9th Cir. 1983) (although the state \nneed not fund abortions, the state “may not unreasonably interfere with the right of Planned \nParenthood to engage in abortion or abortion-related speech activities”); Hill v. Kemp, 645 F. \nSupp. 2d 992, 1002 (N.D. Okla. 2009) (“The State is free to fund adoption services to exclusion \nof any abortion-related services, but it may not deny [the plaintiff motorists and non-profit pro-\nchoice association] funding [for specialty license plate fees] conditioned upon [the plaintiff’s] \nwaiver of its right to engage in protected speech activity with its private funds.”); see also In re \nTam, 808 F.3d 1321, 1348–50 (Fed. Cir. 2015), as corrected (Feb. 11, 2016), aff’d sub nom. \nMatal v. Tam, 137 S.

[AOSI], 133 S. Ct. at \n2328.  However, Congress does not have the authority to attach ‘conditions that seek to leverage \nfunding to regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself.’  Id.”).  \nThe district court correctly determined that § 3701.034 violates Plaintiffs’ rights of free \nspeech and association. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 66 Filed: 04  / 2  0/18 Page: 32 of 3  3     PAGEID #: 2244 (32 of 33)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, et al. v.

Ohio, like many governments, often partners with nonprofit \norganizations  to  promote  policies  of  the  State.    Through  one  such  partnership,  the  State \ndistributes government funds to several organizations to address a wide range of public health \nissues.  For many years, Planned Parenthood participated in these programs.  In 2016, Ohio \npassed  a  law  that  bars  its  health  department  from  funding  organizations  that  “[p]erform \nnontherapeutic  abortions.”    Ohio  Rev.  Code  § 3701.034(B)(1).    Two  Planned  Parenthood \naffiliates challenged the statute, claiming that it imposes an unconstitutional condition on public \nfunding in violation of the Due Process Clause.  The affiliates are correct that the Ohio law \nimposes a condition on the continued receipt of state funds.  But that condition does not violate \nthe Constitution because the affiliates do not have a due process right to perform abortions.  See \nPlanned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 884 (1992) (plurality).  We reverse the \ndistrict court’s contrary decision. \nI. \n  Ohio  distributes  funds  to  organizations  that  participate  in  six  government-sponsored \nhealth and education programs.  The programs target sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer \nand cervical cancer, teen pregnancy, infant mortality, and sexual violence. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 6 of 39     P  AGEID #: 2262 (6 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 3 \n \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio manage \ntwenty-seven health centers across the State.  They have participated in these programs for \nseveral years.  Both entities provide abortions at surgical centers in Bedford Heights, Columbus, \nand Cincinnati.     \nFor several decades, both federal and state laws have prohibited recipients of public funds \nfrom using the money to provide abortions.  The Planned Parenthood affiliates comply with \nthese requirements.   \n  In 2016, the Ohio legislature enacted, and Governor Kasich signed into law, House Bill \n294 to “Prohibit[] [the] use of certain funds concerning nontherapeutic abortions.”  It requires the \nOhio Department of Health to “ensure” that all of the funds it receives for the six programs “are \nnot  used  to  do  any  of  the  following:    (1)  Perform  nontherapeutic  abortions;  (2)  Promote \nnontherapeutic abortions; (3) Contract with any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic \nabortions; (4) Become or continue to be an affiliate of any entity that performs or promotes \nnontherapeutic abortions.”  Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.034(B)–(G).  The point of the limitation, the \nState maintains, is to promote childbirth over abortion, to avoid “muddl[ing]” that message by \nusing abortion providers as  the  face of state  healthcare programs,  and to  avoid  entangling \nprogram funding and abortion funding.  Appellant’s Br. 39–41.   \nOhio’s  health  department  and  its  local  counterparts  notified  Planned  Parenthood  of \nGreater Ohio and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio that the new law would require the \nState to end their contracts under the programs.  Both entities perform abortions, advocate for \nabortion, and affiliate with other entities that do the same.     \nBoth of the affiliates, from now on referred to as Planned Parenthood in the singular, \nsued, claiming that the law violates the First  and Fourteenth  Amendments by conditioning \ngovernment funding on giving up their rights to provide abortions and to advocate for them.  The \ndistrict court agreed and permanently enjoined the State from enforcing the law.   \nAfter a panel of this court affirmed the district court, 888 F.3d 224 (2018), the full court \ndecided to review the appeal, 892 F.3d 1283 (2018) (mem.). \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 7 of 39     P  AGEID #: 2263 (7 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 4 \n \nII. \nAs the district court saw it, the Ohio law imposes two unconstitutional conditions on \nPlanned Parenthood.  It denies the organization funding if it continues to perform abortions—\nwhat the court perceived to be a due process violation.  And the law denies the organization \nfunding if it continues to promote abortion—what the court perceived to be a free speech \nviolation.  To prevail, Planned Parenthood must show that both limitations—the conduct and \nspeech  requirements—violate  the  U.S.  Constitution.    Ohio  may  deny  funding  to  Planned \nParenthood in other words if either limitation satisfies the Constitution.  Because the conduct \ncomponent of the Ohio law does not impose an unconstitutional condition in violation of due \nprocess, we need not reach the free speech claim.   \nFirst a word or two about unconstitutional conditions.  The United States Constitution \ndoes not contain an Unconstitutional Conditions Clause.  What it does contain is a series of \nindividual rights guarantees, most prominently those in the first eight provisions of the Bill of \nRights and those in the Fourteenth Amendment.  Governments generally may do what they wish \nwith public funds, a principle that allows them to subsidize some organizations but not others \nand to condition receipt of public funds on compliance with certain obligations.  See Rust v. \nSullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192–94 (1991).  What makes a condition unconstitutional turns not on a \nfreestanding prohibition against restricting public funds but on a pre-existing obligation not to \nviolate constitutional rights.  The government may not deny an individual a benefit, even one an \nindividual has no entitlement to, on a basis that infringes his constitutional rights.  Agency for \nInt’l  Dev.  v.  All.  for  Open  Soc’y  Int’l,  Inc.,  570  U.S.  205,  214  (2013).    Otherwise,  the \ngovernment could leverage its spending authority to limit, if not eliminate, the exercise of this or \nthat constitutional right.  In the words of the Supreme Court, the principle “forbids burdening the \nConstitution’s enumerated rights by coercively withholding benefits from those who exercise \nthem.”  Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595, 606 (2013).  \nWhat is the enumerated right at issue here?  The guarantee of due process established by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  That provision, as the United States Supreme Court has come to \nconstrue it, prohibits a State from imposing an “undue burden” on a woman’s access to an \nabortion before fetal viability.  Casey, 505 U.S. at 877 (plurality).    \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 8 of 39     P  AGEID #: 2264 (8 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 5 \n \nThese principles establish the following line between what Ohio may do and what it may \nnot do.  It may choose not to fund a private organization’s health and education initiatives.  \nPrivate  organizations  do  not  have  a  constitutional  right  to  obtain  governmental  funding  to \nsupport their activities.  The State also may choose not to subsidize constitutionally protected \nactivities.  Just as it has no obligation to provide a platform for an individual’s free speech, say a \nSpeaker’s Corner in downtown Columbus, it has no obligation to pay for a woman’s abortion.  \nCase after case establishes that a government may refuse to subsidize abortion services.  Rust, \n500 U.S. at 201–02; Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 315–17 (1980); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. \n464, 474 (1977).  Both the United States and Ohio have done exactly that, whether through the \nHyde Amendment, see Pub. L. No. 115-31, §§ 613–14, 131 Stat. 135, 372 (2017), or through \nOhio Revised Code § 9.04(B).   \nBy contrast, the State may not condition a benefit by requiring the recipients to sacrifice \ntheir constitutional rights.  Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 545 \n(1983).  Just as the State may not directly order someone to stop exercising his rights, it may not \ncoerce him into “giving them up” by denying the benefits if he exercises those rights.  Koontz, \n570 U.S. at 604, 612.   \nThe Ohio law falls on the permissible side of this line.  Today’s plaintiffs do not have a \nFourteenth Amendment right to perform abortions.  The Supreme Court has never identified a \nfreestanding right to perform abortions.  To the contrary, it has indicated that there is no such \nthing.  “Whatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation may have as a general matter,” \nthe Court has explained, “in the present context it is derivative of the woman’s position.  The \ndoctor-patient relation does not underlie or override the two more general rights under which the \nabortion right is justified:  the right to make family decisions and the right to physical autonomy.  \nOn its own, the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other \ncontexts.”  Casey, 505 U.S. at 884 (plurality) (emphasis added). \nAny doubt about the point is confirmed by the debate at hand in Casey.  The abortion \nproviders claimed that a Pennsylvania law, requiring them to inform their patients of the abortion \nprocedure’s details and alternatives at least 24 hours beforehand, violated their patients’ due \nprocess rights and their own due process rights that arose from their relationship with the \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 9 of 39     P  AGEID #: 2265 (9 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 6 \n \npatients.  The plurality rejected both claims.  Abortion rights do not arise from the provider-\npatient relationship “[o]n its own,” the Court reasoned.  Id.  After explaining that the law did not \nunduly burden women’s rights, the plurality concluded that the law had no more constitutional \nimport as to the providers than if its requirements dealt with “a kidney transplant.”  Id. at 883.  In \nthe absence of a constitutional right to perform abortions, the plaintiffs have no basis to bring an \nunconstitutional-conditions claim. \nAt the same time, the Ohio law does not violate a woman’s right to obtain an abortion.  It \ndoes not condition a woman’s access to any of these public health programs on refusing to obtain \nan abortion.  It makes these programs available to every woman, whether she seeks an abortion \nor not.  Nor, on this record, has there been any showing that the Ohio law will limit the number \nof clinics that offer abortions in the State.  Cf. Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. \n2292, 2309–18 (2016).   \nA review of the Supreme Court’s decisions in the area fails to reveal a single one in \nwhich the plaintiff obtained relief based on a restriction of unprotected activity.  The dissent to \nits credit concedes as much.  Infra, at 26 n.8.  A benefits condition becomes unconstitutional \nonly when it violates a recipient’s constitutional rights, as the following cases confirm.  See, e.g., \nKoontz, 570 U.S. 595 (permit condition on landowner burdened his Fifth Amendment rights); \nAll. for Open Soc’y Int’l, 570 U.S. 205 (funding condition on aid organization burdened its First \nAmendment rights); Rust, 500 U.S. 173 (funding condition on Title X grantees did not violate \ntheir First Amendment rights); Regan, 461 U.S. 540 (tax-exemption condition on organization \ndid not violate its First Amendment rights); Mem’l Hosp. v. Maricopa Cty., 415 U.S. 250 (1974) \n(benefits condition on nonresident indigent burdened his Fourteenth Amendment rights).  \nThe only other circuit in the country to squarely address this issue reached the same \nconclusion.  “The first step in any unconstitutional-conditions claim is to identify the nature and \nscope of the constitutional right arguably imperiled,” it reasoned, and abortion clinics lack a \nfreestanding constitutional right to practice their trade.  Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. \nComm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 986–88 (7th Cir. 2012).  Accordingly, “[a]s \nlong as the difference in treatment does not unduly burden a woman’s right to obtain an abortion, \nthe government is free to treat abortion providers differently” than other entities.  Id. at 988.  In \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 72 Filed: 03/ 1  3  /19 Page: 10 of 39      P AGEID #: 2266 (10 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 7 \n \nthat case, the Seventh Circuit rejected an unconstitutional-conditions challenge to an Indiana law \nwith a conduct component identical in every material way to this Ohio law.  In dicta, the Ninth \nCircuit reached a similar conclusion.  “Never has it been suggested,” the court explained, “that if \nthere  were  no  burden  on  a  woman’s  right  to  obtain  an  abortion,  medical  providers  could \nnonetheless assert an independent right to provide the service for pay.”  Teixeira v. Cty. of \nAlameda, 873 F.3d 670, 689 (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc).  \nPlanned Parenthood nonetheless maintains that a bevy of cases establishes that clinics do \nhave a due process right to perform abortions.  But a review of the cases leaves the reader empty \nhanded.  Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989), held that physicians \nhave no right to use public facilities to provide abortions, all consistent with the no-required-\nfunding-of-abortions principle on which Ohio’s policy decision rests.  After explaining that \nholding, Webster speculated that it might “be different if the State barred doctors who performed \nabortions in private facilities from the use of public facilities for any purpose.”  Id. at 510 n.8.  \nThree years after Webster, however, Casey ended any speculation over whether providers have a \nconstitutional right to offer abortion services.  It indicated they do not.   \nPlanned Parenthood of Central & Northern Arizona v. Arizona, 718 F.2d 938, 946 (9th \nCir.  1983),  another  pre-Casey  case,  fares  no  better.    It  never  held  that  providers  have  a \nconstitutional right to perform abortions and indeed had no occasion to do so because it analyzed \na broad, speech-centric claim about restrictions on a combination of abortion-related activities.  \nPlanned Parenthood of Mid-Missouri & East Kansas, Inc. v. Dempsey, 167 F.3d 458, 461–64 \n(8th Cir. 1999), is to like effect.   \nThe Tenth Circuit, it is true, accepted the existence of a Fourteenth Amendment right to \nprovide abortions.  Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Herbert, 828 F.3d 1245, 1260 (10th \nCir. 2016).  But it did so without meaningful analysis or authority, and most importantly it did so \nin a case in which the State did not challenge the existence of the right.   \nThird-party-standing cases do not fill this gap.  In those cases, the Supreme Court held \nthat abortion providers have standing to bring due process challenges on behalf of their patients.  \nSee, e.g., Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 118 (1976) (plurality); see also Diamond v. Charles, \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 72 Filed: 03/ 1  3  /19 Page: 11 of 39      P AGEID #: 2267 (11 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 8 \n \n476 U.S. 54, 65–66 (1986).  But these decisions do not establish that the providers themselves \nhave due process rights.  Much to the contrary.  The premise of these challenges is that the \nproviders have no constitutional rights of their own in this setting.  Why else go through the \nrigmarole of granting the provider third-party standing to file the claim?  The first party (the \nwoman) has the claim, and the third party (the provider) sometimes may bring that claim on her \nbehalf.  Any other interpretation of the third-party doctrine, as the plaintiffs use it here, would \nhave this disfiguring effect:  It would create a constitutional right for providers to offer abortion \nservices  and,  in  doing  so,  move  the  law  perilously  close  to  requiring  States  to  subsidize \nabortions.  Case law rejects both possibilities. \nEven if the Fourteenth Amendment does not grant Planned Parenthood a constitutional \nright to perform abortions and even if the third-party-standing doctrine does not fill this gap, the \norganization maintains that the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine defeats the law all the same.  \nOhio may not directly ban access to abortion services in the State, Planned Parenthood points \nout, and the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine bars a State from achieving that same goal \nindirectly, here by financially incentivizing abortion providers to cease offering this service.  \nYes, the doctrine would prohibit the State from requiring women to forfeit benefits if they chose \nto obtain an abortion and if that limitation unduly burdened their access to abortion services.  \nThat’s because such a state law would try to achieve indirectly what the State cannot achieve \ndirectly with respect to the underlying constitutional right.  But, no, the principle does not apply \nwhen the State regulates entities with no such constitutional right:  abortion providers.  In that \nsetting, the clinic is like anyone else in the State, subject to all manner of regulatory incentives \nand disincentives, whether in the tax code, economic development plans, or any other part of \nstate or local law.   \nConsistent with  this  explanation, all of the cases cited by Planned Parenthood  with \nrespect to this direct-indirect point involved individuals or entities who held the constitutional \nright and were discouraged from exercising it.  See, e.g., Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 360–61 \n(1976) (employees claimed that county fired them due to their political affiliation); Perry v. \nSindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597–98 (1972) (professor claimed that state college refused to renew \nhis contract due to his protected speech); Lane v. City of LaFollette, 490 F.3d 410, 419 (6th Cir. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 72 Filed: 03/ 1  3  /19 Page: 12 of 39      P AGEID #: 2268 (12 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 9 \n \n2007) (employee claimed that city fired him for his political beliefs); Toledo Area AFL-CIO \nCouncil v. Pizza, 154 F.3d 307, 321 (6th Cir. 1998) (public-employee unions claimed that \nprohibition on payroll deductions for political causes discouraged their political expression). \nThe direct-indirect dynamic, put another way, is not by itself what triggers the doctrine.  \nThe doctrine applies when the government attempts to ban or undermine a benefit recipient’s \nexercise of a right that the Constitution guarantees.  That’s why an unconstitutional-conditions \nclaim won’t get far if the government could have directly ordered the outcome it wishes to \nincentivize.  In that case, there is no right at issue.   See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & \nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 58–60 (2006) (upholding funding condition that required \nuniversities to give military recruiters equal access to students, because the First Amendment \nwould allow Congress to directly impose such a requirement).  Because Planned Parenthood has \nno constitutional right to perform abortions, the doctrine does not apply to Ohio’s incentives to \nrefrain from performing them.   \nTruth be told, general concerns about indirect efforts to accomplish what cannot be \naccomplished directly illustrate what is wrong with this claim.  Medical centers do not have a \nconstitutional right to offer abortions.  Yet, if we granted Planned Parenthood relief today, we \nwould be effectively saying that they do.  That is not the role of the unconstitutional-conditions \ndoctrine. \nThat this traditional application of the unconditional-conditions doctrine might apply in \nother settings, as the dissent points out, infra, at 26, counts as a plus, not a minus, in the \nconstitutional equation.  It shows that the principle is a neutral one.  And it shows that our \nassessment of the case turns on the nature of the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, not on \nindividual preferences with respect to this constitutional right or that one.  Any risk of unequal \napplication would arise in this case only if we extend the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine for \nthe first time to an entity (here an abortion provider) that does not have a constitutional right. \nIn  the  absence  of  such  an  extension,  Planned  Parenthood  worries  that  the \nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine will lead to several problematic outcomes.  “Imagine,” the \ndissent suggests, “that the government barred lawyers who represent indigent defendants from \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 13 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2269 (13 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 10 \n \neligibility for loan forgiveness programs.”  Id.  Or imagine, we could add, that the government \ndenied government construction contracts to companies that build for customers of a particular \nfaith or race or burdened gun shops with punitive or irrational licensing requirements.  Straw \nmen, to be sure, but revealing all the same.  None of these hypotheticals reveals a doctrinal (or \npolicy) gap that an extension of the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine needs to fill. \nThe initial question in each instance is whether such a law would implicate the regulated \nentity’s constitutional rights or some other prohibition.  That seems likely in each setting.  The \nfirst  application would implicate a lawyer’s free speech rights.    See Legal  Servs. Corp. v. \nVelazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 544 (2001).  The second application would implicate the prohibition on \ndrawing racial and faith-based classifications in any law.  Just as a State could not condition an \nabortion provider’s subsidy on providing services only to individuals of a certain race or religion, \nso it could not condition a construction company’s contracts on serving only non-Muslim clients \nor only white clients.  See Emp’t Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990); Brown v. Bd. of Educ., \n347 U.S. 483, 488, 495 (1954).  Even aside from the question whether gun stores have Second \nAmendment  rights,  compare  Teixeira,  873  F.3d  at  681–90,  with  id.  at  698–99  (Bea,  J., \ndissenting), the third application confirms that all punitive or irrational licensing requirements \nrun the risk of violating a store’s constitutional rights, whether the store sells guns or not.  But it \nis hardly punitive or irrational for a State to subsidize some activities and not others.  The \nunconstitutional-conditions  doctrine  no  more  elevates  non-constitutional  claims  into \nconstitutional ones than it insulates protected rights from protection. \nThis last point answers the dissent’s next hypotheticals about polling-place funding and \ngun-shop tax breaks, infra, at 26, as well as any others that a fertile imagination could identify, \nso long as the law does not violate the regulated entity’s rights or another prohibition.  Take the \ngun shop.  Surely a State could deny subsidies for entities dealing with the needs of victims of \ngun violence to entities or stores that sold guns.  In the end, so long as the subsidy program does \nnot otherwise violate a constitutional right of the regulated entity, the State may choose to \nsubsidize what it wishes—whether abortion services or adoption services, whether stores that sell \nguns or stores that don’t. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 14 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2270 (14 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 11 \n \nThat leads to Planned Parenthood’s next argument.  Left untouched, the Ohio law will \ndeprive Ohio women of their constitutional right of access to abortion services without undue \nburden, because it will lead Planned Parenthood and perhaps other abortion providers to stop \nproviding them.  Maybe; maybe not.   More to the point, the conclusion is premature and \nunsupported by the record.  It is true that, if these two Planned Parenthood affiliates opted not to \nprovide abortions, women seeking an abortion in Ohio would have to travel farther than they \ncurrently do to obtain an abortion.  It is also true that this kind of evidence may support an \nundue-burden challenge by establishing a “substantial obstacle” in the way of those seeking \nabortions.  See Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. at 2309–18; Women’s Med. Prof’l Corp. v. \nBaird, 438 F.3d 595, 604–05 (6th Cir. 2006). \nBut it is premature to assess any such claim now.  For one, it is not clear that the \nplaintiffs filed an undue-burden challenge on behalf of individual women, as opposed to an \nunconstitutional-conditions challenge on their own behalf.  For another, the record contains more \nspeculation than evidence about what would happen if these two Planned Parenthood affiliates \nstopped providing abortions.  For still another, the only hard evidence on point is that Planned \nParenthood does not plan to stop providing abortions, as representatives from each affiliate \ntestified that they would sacrifice government funding to continue providing abortions.  On this \nrecord, it would be unduly conjectural, and unripe to boot, to imagine what would happen if the \nplaintiffs  changed  their  mind.    Under  our  Article  III  authority  to  resolve  “Cases”  and \n“Controversies,” we must limit ourselves to the seen rather than the unseen.  And all that the \nseen shows is that the law will not create an undue burden on a woman’s right to an abortion.   \nPlanned Parenthood insists that it has no obligation to establish an undue burden because \nthe funding condition itself is unconstitutional, making it irrelevant whether the subject of the \ncondition gives in.  See Koontz, 570 U.S. at 607.  That may be true if the subject of the funding \nincentive possesses the right.  But that is not true in this instance because the subject—here \nproviders, not women—does not possess the right.  All of which takes us back to where we \nstarted.  To have an unconstitutional condition, the State must impose the condition on the \nindividual (or entity) with the constitutional right.  If there’s no right, there’s no unconstitutional \ncondition.  And the providers have no such constitutional right.  The point of the doctrine is to \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 15 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2271 (15 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 12 \n \nprotect the underlying right:  a woman’s right of access to abortion services without an undue \nburden.  It is not to leverage a constitutional condition into an unconstitutional one while freeing \nthe provider from either asserting a valid right of its own or showing any undue burden on \nanyone.   \nThat this is a pre-enforcement action, last of all, changes nothing.  Even in that setting, \nPlanned Parenthood must show that the Ohio law, if implemented, would impose an undue \nburden on a woman’s right to an abortion.  Its vow to keep performing abortions sinks any pre-\nenforcement action, and any speculation about what would happen if it changed its mind is just \nthat.   \nFor  these  reasons,  we  reverse  the  district  court’s  contrary  decision  and  remand  for \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n   \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 16 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2272 (16 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 13 \n \n_________________ \nDISSENT \n_________________ \nHELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  The majority makes short work of \nPlaintiffs’ arguments with three simple assertions.  Because Plaintiff clinics have no independent \nconstitutional right to perform abortions, it is impossible for Ohio to violate their due process \nrights by withholding benefits or imposing burdens based on their abortion activities; a woman \nhas a due process right to obtain certain nontherapeutic abortions, but no condition violates that \nright unless it imposes an undue burden on that right; because Plaintiff providers have made \nclear that they will not accede to Ohio’s funding conditions, there is no undue burden on a \nwoman’s abortion right.   \nThe majority does not mention, much less apply, the test the Supreme Court has recently \narticulated  governing  the  unconstitutional-conditions  doctrine.    That  doctrine  prohibits  the \ngovernment  from  conditioning  the  grant  of  funds  under  a  government  program  if:  (1)  the \nchallenged conditions would violate the Constitution if they were instead enacted as a direct \nregulation; and (2) the conditions affect protected conduct outside the scope of the government \nprogram.  See Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance for Open Soc’y Int’l, 570 U.S. 205, 213-15 \n(2013) (hereafter AOSI).  Because (1) the funding conditions in this case would result in an \nundue burden on a woman’s right to obtain nontherapeutic abortions if imposed directly, and \n(2) the six federal programs have nothing to do with Plaintiffs’ performing abortions, advocating \nfor abortion rights, or affiliating with organizations that engage in such activity, all on their own \n“time and dime,” I respectfully dissent.  \nEnacted  in  2016,  Ohio  Revised  Code  §  3701.034  (the  Statute)  requires  the  Ohio \nDepartment of Health (ODH) to ensure that all funds it receives through six non-abortion-related \nfederal health programs are not used to contract with any entity that performs or promotes \nnontherapeutic abortions, or becomes or continues to be an affiliate of any entity that performs or \npromotes  nontherapeutic  abortions.    A  direct  regulation  barring  healthcare  providers  from \nperforming or promoting nontherapeutic abortions or affiliating with any entity that performs or \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 17 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2273 (17 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 14 \n \npromotes nontherapeutic abortions would violate the Constitution by imposing an undue burden \non women seeking abortions and violating the healthcare providers’ rights to free speech and \nassociation.  The Statute thus satisfies the first element of an unconstitutional condition.  The \nStatute also plainly conditions government funding for programs unrelated to abortion on an \nentity’s refraining from performing or promoting abortions, or affiliating with any entity that \ndoes either.  Because § 3701.034 fails both parts of the test applied in AOSI, the district court \nproperly enjoined the law from going into effect.   \nThe majority avoids this straightforward application of the unconstitutional-conditions \ndoctrine primarily by adopting an unprecedented rule that abortion providers—entities that are \nnecessary to ensure a woman’s right to safe abortions—cannot prevail in challenging the Statute \nbecause there is no independent constitutional right to provide abortions.  For the proposition \nthat there is “no such thing” as a right to perform abortions, the majority cites the statement in \nthe plurality  opinion in  Planned Parenthood  of  Southeastern Pennsylvania  v. Casey  that  a \nprovider’s constitutional right “is derivative of the woman’s position.”  505 U.S. 833, 884 \n(1992).  (Maj. Op. at 5.)  The majority then assumes that a “derivative” right is no right at all.  \nBut of course, “derivative” simply means “developed from . . . something else.”  Black’s Law \nDictionary (10th ed. 2014).  An abortion provider’s constitutional right may be derivative of the \npatient’s right—but it is a right nonetheless. \nAnd, even if the abortion right belongs only to women, it has long been understood that \n“the right is inextricably bound up with” a provider’s ability to offer these services.  Singleton v. \nWulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114 (1976) (plurality opinion).  Further, the Supreme Court has never \nsuggested  that  a  party  that  could  prevail  in  challenging  a  direct  regulation  is  nevertheless \npowerless to challenge a law that attempts to achieve the same result by imposing a condition on \nunrelated funding.  The majority’s novel rule gives the government the authority to impose \nalmost any condition it wants on abortion providers so long as the providers continue to perform \nabortions.  The government acknowledged as much at oral argument.  This type of assault on a \nconstitutional right is precisely the type of harm the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is meant \nto protect against. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 18 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2274 (18 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v.

Code § 9.04(A)(1). \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 19 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2275 (19 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 16 \n \n(8) “Promote” means to advocate for, assist with, encourage, or popularize \nthrough advertising or publicity. \n(B) – (G)[2] The department of health shall ensure that all funds it receives \n[through the Violence Against Women Act, Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality \nPrevention  Act,  Infertility  prevention  project,  Minority  HIV/AIDS  initiative, \ninfant mortality reduction or infant vitality initiatives] are not used to do any of \nthe following: \n(1) Perform nontherapeutic abortions; \n(2) Promote nontherapeutic abortions; \n(3) Contract with any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic \nabortions; \n(4) Become or continue to be an affiliate of any entity that performs or \npromotes nontherapeutic abortions. \nPlaintiffs \nPlaintiffs  Planned  Parenthood  of  Greater  Ohio  (PPGOH)  and  Planned  Parenthood \nSouthwest Ohio Region (PPSWO) are not-for-profit corporations organized under Ohio law.  \nPPGOH and PPSWO are also affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. \n(PPFA),  which  advocates  for  women’s  access  to  comprehensive  reproductive  healthcare, \nincluding abortion.  Plaintiffs operate twenty-seven3 health centers throughout Ohio, which are \nstaffed with physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, who provide well-woman \nexams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, screenings for breast and cervical \ncancer and HIV, and contraception and contraceptive counseling.  Three of the twenty-seven \nhealth centers also provide abortion services.  Separate from their government-funded health \nservices and education programs, PPGOH and PPSWO advocate for a woman’s right to safe and \nlawful abortion through public awareness campaigns and public education activities.   \nConsistent with federal and Ohio law, no government funds are used to  pay for or \nsubsidize Plaintiffs’ abortion services or advocacy. It is undisputed that Plaintiffs “maintain \n                                                 \n2Sections (B) through (G), which address each of the programs separately, share identical language in \nsubsections (1) through (4), and are condensed for brevity. \n3During the pendency of this appeal, Plaintiffs’ counsel advised that one of the twenty-eight health centers \nhas closed for reasons unrelated to this case.  The district court’s opinion states that Plaintiffs operate twenty-eight \nhealth centers, which was accurate at the time. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 20 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2276 (20 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 17 \n \nmeasures to ensure that none of the funds received from the state or federal government are used, \ndirectly  or  indirectly,  to  subsidize  the  promotion  of  abortion  or  performance  of  abortion \nservices.”  (R. 60, PID 2136.) \nLargely through competitive grant processes, Plaintiffs have for years received funds and \nmaterial assistance distributed by ODH and county health departments under the six federal \nprograms impacted by § 3701.034:  the Infertility Prevention Project, Breast and Cervical Cancer \nMortality Prevention Act, Violence Against Women Act, Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, Infant \nMortality  Reduction  Initiative,  and  Personal  Responsibility  Education  Program  (PREP).4  \nThroughout those years, Plaintiffs passed all state and local audits and program reviews. \nAfter § 3701.034 was enacted, ODH and local health departments notified Plaintiffs that \ntheir contracts under the six federal programs would be terminated and they would not be \neligible for funding.  Plaintiffs’ termination of services they currently provide under these six \nprograms could have dramatic public-health consequences.  For example, as amicus American \nPublic Health Association details, Plaintiffs currently provide over 70,000 free STD tests to low-\nincome Ohioans annually under the STD Prevention Program.  With STDs among Ohioans \ncontinuing to rise, Plaintiffs’ non-eligibility in that program could lead to three counties being \nwithout any qualified provider because other existing program providers do not have the capacity \nto fill the gap.  Section 3701.034’s bar on funds being distributed to Plaintiffs under the other \nfive  programs  would  require  Plaintiffs  to  cease  providing  other  fundamental  public-health \nservices to primarily low-income or at-risk populations, including HIV testing and education, \ncancer screenings, and sexual-violence-prevention education.5  \n                                                 \n4Plaintiffs’ counsel advised the court by letter dated July 27, 2017, that PPGOH did not reapply for grant \nfunding under the PREP program when its contract expired on July 31, 2017, and that it appears that ODH will no \nlonger be responsible for allocating PREP funds as of August 1, 2017; thus “there is a question as to whether [this \ncourt] need consider PREP in its analysis of Section 3701.034.”  (ECF No. 57.) \n5PPGOH is the largest provider of HIV testing and treatment in Cleveland, Akron, and Canton, and \nPPSWO provides approximately 1,600 anonymous and confidential HIV tests annually.  PPGOH also provided \n4,400 pap smears and 3,700 breast exams in the fiscal year ending in June 2015.  Approximately 75% of PPSWO’s \npatients and 40% of PPGOH’s patients fall within the low-income classification.  Many of these patients live in \nmedically underserved areas––communities classified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as \nhaving too few primary-care providers, high infant mortality and poverty rates, or large elderly populations.  ODH \nfailed to identify alternative providers to fill most of the gaps in service that would result from excluding Plaintiffs \nfrom funding under the six federal programs. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 21 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2277 (21 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 18 \n \nProcedural History \nPlaintiffs filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nalleging that § 3701.034 violates 1) their First Amendment rights “by denying state and federal \nfunds”  to  Plaintiffs  “because  of––and  in  retaliation  for––their  constitutionally-protected \nadvocacy for  abortion rights  and affiliation  with  other organizations that also  advocate for \nabortion rights and/or provide abortion services”; 2) the Due Process Clause “by denying state \nand federal funds” to Plaintiffs “because of––and in retaliation for––the exercise of their own \nconstitutionally  protected  right  to  provide  abortions  and  their  patients’  exercise  of  the \nconstitutional right to choose to have an abortion”; and 3) the Equal Protection Clause “by \nsingling out abortion providers and those who ‘promote’ abortions, including [Plaintiffs], for \nunfavorable treatment without a constitutionally sufficient justification.”  (R. 1, PID 1, 27-28.)  \nPlaintiffs sought to enjoin ODH from enforcing § 3701.034 or terminating Plaintiffs’ funding \nunder the six federal programs pursuant to the Statute.   \nThe district court entered a temporary restraining order on the day § 3701.034 was to take \neffect.  Following discovery, the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motions for judgment on the \nmerits and permanently enjoined ODH from enforcing § 3701.034, reasoning that § 3701.034 \nviolates the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine by impermissibly conditioning funding from \nprograms  unrelated  to  abortion  based  on  a  recipient’s  refraining  from  exercising  its  First \nAmendment rights to free speech or association outside the contours of the six programs, and \nrefraining from providing abortion services protected by the Due Process Clause.6  Planned \nParenthood of Greater Ohio v. Hodges, 201 F. Supp. 3d 898 (S.D. Ohio 2016).  A unanimous \npanel affirmed the district court.  888 F.3d 224 (6th Cir. 2018).  The full court then voted for \nrehearing en banc.  829 F.3d 1283 (6th Cir. 2018). \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis court reviews a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute de novo.  Entm’t \nProds., Inc. v. Shelby County, 721 F.3d 729, 733 (6th Cir. 2013).  In reviewing the district \n                                                 \n6The district court did not reach Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim, nor does the majority.  Accordingly, the \ncase must be remanded for the district court to consider the Equal Protection claim. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 22 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2278 (22 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 19 \n \ncourt’s grant of injunctive relief, the district court’s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, \nits legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, and the scope of injunctive relief is reviewed for \nabuse of discretion.  Sec’y of Labor, U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. 3Re.com, Inc., 317 F.3d 534, 537 \n(6th Cir. 2003).  “A party is entitled to a permanent injunction if it can establish that it suffered a \nconstitutional  violation  and  will  suffer  continuing  irreparable  injury  for  which  there  is  no \nadequate remedy at law.”  Lee v. City of Columbus, 636 F.3d 245, 249 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting \nWedgewood L.P. I v. Twp. of Liberty, 610 F.3d 340, 349 (6th Cir. 2010)).   \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nThe majority concludes that the “conduct provision” of § 3701.034 (precluding entities \nthat perform nontherapeutic abortions from obtaining funding under the six federal programs) \ndoes not impose an unconstitutional condition because Plaintiffs have no due process right to \nperform abortions.  The majority declines to reach Plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenges to the \nspeech and affiliation provisions (prohibiting the allocation of program funds to any entity that \neither (1) promotes nontherapeutic abortions, or (2) affiliates with any entity that performs or \npromotes nontherapeutic abortions) concluding that Ohio may deny funding to Plaintiffs under \nthe six federal programs if any one of the provisions is valid.  I address all three provisions \nbecause each provision imposes an unconstitutional condition.   \nA.  Due Process Claim \n1. \nI begin with the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine.  The Supreme Court recognized this \ndoctrine many decades ago to ensure that the government cannot leverage its allocation of \nbenefits  to  “manipulate[]”  constitutional  rights  “out  of  existence.”    Frost  v.  R.R.  Comm’n, \n271 U.S. 583, 594 (1926).  Generally speaking, “the state, having power to deny a privilege \naltogether, may grant it upon such conditions as it sees fit to impose.”  Id. at 593.  The state’s \npower, however, “in that respect is not unlimited; and one of the limitations is that it may not \nimpose conditions which require the relinquishment of constitutional rights.”  Id. at 593-94.  \n“Broadly stated, the rule is that the right to continue the exercise of a privilege granted by the \nstate cannot be made to depend upon the grantee’s submission to a condition prescribed by the \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 23 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2279 (23 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 20 \n \nstate which is hostile to the provisions of the federal Constitution.”  United States v. Chi., M., St. \nP. & P.R. Co., 282 U.S. 311, 328-29 (1931).  Thus, “even though a person has no ‘right’ to a \nvaluable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for \nany number of reasons,” the government “may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that \ninfringes his constitutionally protected interests.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 \n(1972).  This doctrine has been applied in a number of contexts where constitutional rights were \nimplicated, see Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595, 604 (2013) (“We \nhave said in a variety of contexts that ‘the government may not deny a benefit to a person \nbecause he exercises a constitutional right.’” (citation omitted)), including where the government \n“condition[s] benefits on a citizen’s agreement to surrender due process rights,” R.S.W.W., Inc. v. \nCity of Keego Harbor, 397 F.3d 427, 434 (6th Cir. 2005). \n“A predicate for any unconstitutional conditions claim is that the government could not \nhave constitutionally ordered the person asserting the claim to do what it attempted to pressure \nthat person into doing.”  Koontz, 570 U.S. at 612.  And, critically for this case, even when a party \n“refuses to cede a constitutional right in the face of coercive pressure, the impermissible denial \nof a governmental benefit is a constitutionally cognizable injury.”  Id. at 607; see also AOSI, 570 \nU.S.  at  214  (explaining  that  a  condition  need  not  be  “actually  coercive”  to  violate  the \nConstitution). \nTo  be  sure,  the  unconstitutional-conditions  doctrine  does  not  render  any  funding \ncondition that may affect the exercise of constitutional rights unconstitutional.  See AOSI, 570 \nU.S. at 214 (citing United States v. Am. Library Ass’n., Inc., 539 U.S. 194 (2003) (plurality \nopinion),  and Regan  v.  Taxation  With  Representation  of  Wash., 461  U.S.  540,  546 \n(1983)).  Rather, “the relevant distinction” is whether the conditions “define the limits of the \ngovernment spending program” or are “outside the contours of the program itself.”  Id. at 214-\n15.  In determining on which side of the line a condition falls, the Supreme Court distinguishes \nbetween conditions that regulate the government-funded project and conditions that regulate the \nrecipient  of  government  funds.    See  Rust  v.  Sullivan,  500  U.S.  173,  197  (1991)  (“[O]ur \n‘unconstitutional conditions’ cases involve situations in which the Government has placed a \ncondition on the recipient of the subsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 24 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2280 (24 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 21 \n \neffectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of \nthe federally funded program.”).   \nIn AOSI, the Supreme Court invalidated a statutory provision requiring organizations \nreceiving funds under a program designed to combat AIDS and HIV to have a policy explicitly \nopposing prostitution and sex trafficking.  570 U.S. at 210, 221.  The Court first noted that \n“[w]ere [the Policy Requirement] enacted as a direct regulation of speech, [it] would plainly \nviolate the First Amendment.”  Id. at 213.  This did not end the inquiry, however.  The Court \nthen asked whether the conditions “define the federal program” or “reach outside it,” id. at 217, \nand  explained  that  “[b]y  demanding  that  funding  recipients  adopt—as  their  own—the \nGovernment’s view on an issue of public concern, the condition by its very nature affects \n‘protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program,’” id. at 218 (quoting Rust, \n500 U.S. at 197).  This was because, under the statutory condition, a funding recipient could not \n“avow the belief dictated by the Policy Requirement when spending [federal program] funds, and \nthen turn around and assert a contrary belief, or claim neutrality, when participating in activities \non its own time and dime.”  Id. at 218.  Thus, “[b]y requiring recipients to profess a specific \nbelief, the Policy Requirement goes beyond defining the limits of the federally funded program \nto defining the recipient.”  Id. (citing Rust, 500 U.S. at 197).  \nA  straightforward  application  of  these  principles  establishes  the  Statute’s \nunconstitutionality.  First, ODH could not impose the conduct provision as a direct regulation, \nbecause to do so would mean passing a law prohibiting the performance of nontherapeutic \nabortions.  There is no dispute that outlawing abortions in Ohio would be an undue burden on \nwomen’s ability to access the procedure in that state.  Even if the direct regulation were limited \nto Plaintiffs—a constitutionally dubious maneuver as well, see Planned Parenthood of Cent. \nN.C. v. Cansler, 877 F. Supp. 2d 310, 327 (M.D.N.C. 2012)—ODH never contested Plaintiffs’ \nargument that a ban on their providing nontherapeutic abortions would impose an undue burden \non women seeking abortions in Ohio.7  \n                                                 \n7Plaintiffs consistently argued that their ceasing to perform abortions would impose an undue burden on \nwomen seeking abortion due to the reduction in abortion services available to the women of Ohio.  Despite multiple \nopportunities in several rounds of briefing before the district court and this court, ODH never attempted to explain \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 25 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2281 (25 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 22 \n \nSecond, the Supreme Court explained that permissible “conditions that define the limits \nof the government spending program” are “those that specify the activities Congress wants to \nsubsidize.”  AOSI, 570 U.S. at  214.  The condition contained in the conduct provision of \n§ 3701.034, however, does not “define the limits” of the six federal programs at issue because \nthose programs have nothing to do with abortion.  Indeed, federal and Ohio law already mandate \nthat funds from those six programs, or any other government funds, cannot be used to subsidize \nnontherapeutic abortion.  Thus, there is no question that this condition “reach[es] outside” the six \nfederal programs and therefore constitutes an unconstitutional condition.  See id. at 214-15. \nODH disputes this conclusion, arguing that the conduct provision of § 3701.034 comports \nwith due process under Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 \n(1980), and Rust, 500 U.S. 173.  But these cases merely establish that the government is under no \nobligation to subsidize abortion or abortion counseling by including coverage for abortion or \nabortion counseling in public-benefits programs.  Maher, 432 U.S. at 470-71, 474 (rejecting \nchallenge to regulation limiting state Medicaid benefits for first-trimester abortions to those that \nare medically necessary); McRae, 448 U.S. at 322-23 (rejecting challenge to Hyde Amendment’s \nlimitation of Medicaid funding to those abortions necessary to save life of mother or cases of \nrape or incest, while permitting funding of costs associated with childbirth); Rust, 500 U.S. at \n192-94 (rejecting challenge to regulations providing that Title X family-planning funds could not \nbe used to fund family-planning programs where abortion is a method of family planning).  That \nprinciple is not at issue here because the six federal programs are completely divorced from \nabortion or family planning.  \nRust, in fact, teaches why § 3701.034 is impermissible.  Rust involved Title X, which \n“provides federal funding for family-planning services.”  500 U.S. at 178.  The regulations at \nissue  prevented  recipients  from  using  Title  X  funds  to  engage  in  abortion  advocacy  and \n                                                                                                                                                             \nwhy Plaintiffs’ ceasing to perform abortions would not cause an undue burden, instead calling the argument \n“irrelevant.”  (R. 53, PID 2055.)  At oral argument before the en banc court, ODH acknowledged that it never \nbriefed the issue but summarily argued in rebuttal that it was “pretty sure we not only do dispute that, but we’d come \nout on the better side of it.”  (Oct. 3, 2018, Oral Arg. 58:58-59:43.)  Because a party’s claiming to be “pretty sure” \nthat it would dispute an issue despite never briefing that issue is insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal, ODH \nforfeited the argument that Plaintiffs’ ceasing to perform abortions would not result in an undue burden.  See United \nStates v. Universal Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 191 F.3d 750, 758 (6th Cir. 1999); Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, 175 F.3d 378, 403 \nn.18 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc). \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 26 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2282 (26 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 23 \n \ncounseling.  Id. at 196.  Because Title X was a program meant to encourage family-planning \nservices leading to conception and childbirth, and thus discourage abortion, the regulations were \npermissible in part because they were “designed to ensure that the limits of the federal program \nare observed.”  Id. at 193.  In contrast, the six federal programs here have nothing to do with \nfamily planning or abortion. \nFurther,  in  rejecting  the  plaintiffs’  unconstitutional-conditions  challenge  to  the \nregulations, the Rust Court explained that the Supreme Court’s “‘unconstitutional conditions’ \ncases involve situations in which the Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the \nsubsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the recipient \nfrom engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.”  Id. \nat 197.  That is precisely what § 3701.034 does; it places conditions on Plaintiffs—the recipients \nof the subsidies—that prohibit them from engaging in protected conduct outside the scope of the \nsix federal programs.   \nFinally, it was critical in Rust that the regulations did not deny “the right to engage in \nabortion-related activities” as a condition of receiving funding.  Id. at 198.  The regulations were \nconstitutional  because  they  “govern[ed]  the  scope  of  the  Title  X project’s activities,”  while \n“leav[ing] the grantee unfettered in its other activities.  The Title X grantee can continue to \nperform abortions, provide abortion-related services, and engage in abortion advocacy; it simply \nis required to conduct those activities through programs that are separate and independent from \nthe project that receives Title X funds.”  Id. at 196.  In contrast, § 3701.034’s whole purpose is to \nfetter  Plaintiffs  in  their  other  (i.e.,  abortion-related)  activities,  which  are  unrelated  to  the \ngovernment-funded programs.  Similarly, in FCC v. League of Women Voters of California, \n468 U.S.  364,  400  (1984),  the  Supreme  Court  struck  down  a  law  barring  recipients  of \ngovernment funds from engaging in editorializing because the law barred funding recipients \n“from using even wholly private funds to finance its editorial activity.”  But the Court noted that \nsuch a law would have been permissible if it allowed the recipient “to establish ‘affiliate’ \norganizations which could then use the station’s facilities to editorialize with nonfederal funds.”  \nId.  Here, § 3701.034 expressly precludes funding recipients from being an affiliate of any entity \nthat performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions.

Dempsey, 167 F.3d 458, 463 (8th Cir. 1999) (explaining that a law prohibiting \nrecipients of state family-planning funds from having independent abortion-provider affiliates \n“would cross the line established in Rust, League of Women Voters, and Regan, and hence be an \nunconstitutional condition”). \nIn sum, none of the numerous reasons that the regulations in Rust were upheld is present \nhere: § 3701.034 does not define the scope of the federal programs; and it does not distinguish \nbetween the programs and the grantee, restricting only the former, while permitting the latter to \n“continue  to  perform  abortions,  provide  abortion-related  services,  and  engage  in  abortion \nadvocacy . . . through programs that are separate and independent from the project[s] that \nreceive[] the [six program funds].”  Rust, 500 U.S. at 196.   \nFor all of these reasons, § 3701.034’s conduct provision is unconstitutional.  \n2. \nThe majority avoids more than a cursory discussion of the principles underlying the \nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine by finding that Plaintiffs’ purported lack of an independent \nconstitutional right to perform abortions is dispositive.  As discussed above, the Supreme Court \nlabel of the provider’s constitutional right as “derivative of the woman’s position,” 505 U.S. at \n884, is a statement about the source of an abortion provider’s constitutional right—not a denial \nthat the provider has a constitutionally protected interest. \nHowever, even accepting that Plaintiffs have no wholly independent constitutional right \nto perform abortions, but see, e.g., Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Herbert, 828 F.3d 1245, \n1258-60 (10th Cir. 2016) (noting that Planned Parenthood Association of Utah alleged, “without \nserious challenge from defendants, a Fourteenth Amendment right” “to provide . . . abortion \nservices”); Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 464 (addressing the effect of the challenged Missouri law on \n“Planned  Parenthood’s  constitutional  right[]”  to  “provide  abortion  services”);  Planned \nParenthood v. Doyle, 162 F.3d 463, 471 (7th Cir. 1998) (“The constitutional right to an abortion \ncarries with it the right to perform medical procedures that many people find distasteful or \nworse.”); Planned Parenthood of Cent. & N. Ariz. v. Arizona, 718 F.2d 938, 944 (9th Cir. 1983) \n(determining “whether the State unduly interfered with Planned Parenthood’s exercise of its right \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 28 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2284 (28 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 25 \n \nto perform abortion and abortion-related services”), it does not follow that the Constitution is \nindifferent to laws that condition the grant of unrelated public funds on the abandonment of all \nabortion-related activity.  Treating the lack of a personally held, independent right divorced from \na woman’s abortion right as a bar to Plaintiffs in this case has dire implications for abortion \nproviders  in  this  circuit  and  is  inconsistent  with  the  purpose  behind  the  unconstitutional-\nconditions doctrine for at least two reasons.   \nFirst,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  Supreme  Court  has  not  always  couched  the \nunconstitutional conditions doctrine in rights-based language, referring instead to “protected \nconduct,” Rust, 500 U.S. at 197, or “constitutionally protected interests,” Perry, 408 U.S. at 597.  \nEven if providers have no right of their own to provide abortions, surely providing women with \nabortions free from undue governmental interference falls into the category of constitutionally \nprotected conduct. \nSecond, as discussed above, and as the majority acknowledges (see Maj. Op. at 8), one of \nthe  purposes  of  the  unconstitutional-conditions  doctrine  is  to  prevent  the  government  from \nachieving indirectly—by conditioning unrelated funds on forgoing constitutionally protected \nactivity—what the government cannot achieve directly.  But the majority says that is not what is \nhappening here because “the government could have directly ordered the outcome it wishes to \nincentivize” in this case.  (Maj. Op. at 9.)  The majority does not explain how Ohio could directly \norder the outcome it wishes to incentivize—that Ohio’s healthcare providers cease performing \nabortions.  And even if the direct regulation could constitutionally be limited to Plaintiffs alone, \nODH never challenged either in the district court or its briefing in this court, until en banc \nargument, that barring Plaintiffs from performing abortions would place an undue burden on \nwomen seeking abortion given the existing abortion providers in the area.  There is no doubt that \nif Ohio ordered either ban directly, Plaintiffs would be able to challenge that law on due process \ngrounds.  See Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292 (2016) (granting relief to \nplaintiff abortion providers who challenged on due process grounds regulations imposed on their \nservices); see also Singleton, 428 U.S. at 117-18 (explaining that abortion providers may “assert \nthe rights of women patients as against governmental interference with the abortion decision” \nbecause “[a] woman cannot safely secure an abortion without the aid of a physician,” “the \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 29 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2285 (29 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 26 \n \nconstitutionally protected abortion decision is one in which the physician is intimately involved,” \nand “there are several obstacles” to the woman asserting her own rights);  Craig v. Boren, \n429 U.S. 190, 195 (1976) (noting that service providers “have been uniformly permitted to resist \nefforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek \naccess to their market or function”).   \nThus, there is no reason why Plaintiffs cannot prevail on an unconstitutional-conditions \nclaim in this case.  The Supreme Court has never suggested that the government can impose a \ncondition on a third party to induce a result that would be unconstitutional if the condition were \nimposed directly on a party whose rights are affected.8  Nor has the Supreme Court suggested \nthat an entity that  could challenge  a direct  regulation  could  not  prevail in  challenging  the \ngovernment’s attempt to reach the same result through a condition imposed on unrelated funding.  \nConsider the examples of the constitutional rights to counsel, to vote, and to bear arms.  These \nrights belong to the criminal defendant, the voter, and the gun owner, respectively.  Imagine that \nthe  government  barred  lawyers  who  represent  indigent  defendants  from  eligibility  for  loan \nforgiveness programs, denied all government funding to private entities that volunteer to serve as \npolling  places  in  low-income  neighborhoods,  or  ceased  providing  all  existing  tax  breaks, \nsubsidies, and government benefits to any store that sells guns.  By the majority’s logic, as long \nas the beleaguered lawyers, polling places, and gun store owners continue to perform these \nservices, no one could successfully challenge the constitutionality of these laws based on the \nprotected rights.9   \n                                                 \n8The unconstitutional-conditions cases that the Supreme Court has addressed thus far have involved \nplaintiffs’ challenges to conditions that impact their own, personal constitutional rights.  See, e.g., Koontz, 570 U.S. \n595; AOSI, 570 U.S. 205; Rust, 500 U.S. 173; Regan, 461 U.S. 540; Mem’l Hosp. v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 \n(1974).  But the fact that the Court has only had the opportunity to consider cases where a recipient’s own \nconstitutional rights were at issue does not mean that its cases “confirm” that a “benefits condition becomes \nunconstitutional only when it violates a recipient’s constitutional rights.”  (Maj. Op. at 6 (emphasis added).)  Those \ncases just confirm that the Court can only decide the cases that come before it. \n9Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001), is plainly distinguishable.  That case involved the \ngovernment providing funds to organizations representing indigent clients in a claim against the government for \nwelfare  benefits,  but  prohibiting  those  same  organizations  from  challenging  existing  welfare  laws  as \nunconstitutional or unlawful in those cases.  Id. at 545-47.  This law violated the First Amendment, the Court \nexplained,  because “it operates to insulate current welfare laws from constitutional scrutiny and certain other legal \nchallenges, a condition implicating central First Amendment concerns,” and “there is no alternative channel for \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 30 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2286 (30 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 27 \n \nThe whole point of the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is to prevent the government \nfrom achieving indirectly what it cannot constitutionally achieve directly.  And because Plaintiffs \ncould succeed on a due process challenge against the direct version of this law, they can likewise \nchallenge  the  indirect  version  as  an  unconstitutional  condition.    The  majority’s  position \ncontravenes the purpose of the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine.10 \nODH also asserts (and it appears the majority agrees) that the unconstitutional-conditions \ndoctrine, at most, bars unconstitutional conditions only when they actually operate to impose an \nundue burden, and, the argument goes, § 3701.034 imposes no such undue burden because \nPlaintiffs’ representatives testified that Plaintiffs would continue to perform abortions even if the \nlaw  goes  into  effect.    ODH  relies  on  the  Seventh  Circuit’s  divided  opinion  in  Planned \nParenthood of Indiana, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Department of Health, 699 F.3d \n962 (7th Cir. 2012) (hereafter PPI).11   \nThere, PPI, a Medicaid provider that performs abortions, one of its doctors, and two low-\nincome patients who used its services, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the \nconstitutionality of an Indiana law that prohibited state agencies from contracting with or making \ngrants to any entity that performs abortions.  In addressing PPI’s unconstitutional-conditions \nclaim, the panel majority reasoned:  \n[T]he  government  need  not  be  neutral  between  abortion  providers  and  other \nmedical providers, and this principle is particularly well-established in the context \nof governmental decisions regarding the use of public funds.  As long as the \ndifference in treatment does not unduly burden a woman’s right to obtain an \nabortion, the government is free to treat abortion providers differently. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nexpression of the advocacy Congress seeks to restrict.”  Id. at 546-47.  No such argument could be made about a law \nstripping loan forgiveness eligibility from attorneys who represent indigent defendants. \n10Nor  would  affirming  the  district  court  “effectively  [be]  saying”  that  abortion  providers  “have  a \nconstitutional right to offer abortions.”  (Maj. Op. at 9.)  It would merely be saying that states cannot strip an entity \nof funding that is unrelated to abortion solely because that entity provides abortions on its “own time and dime.”  \nSee AOSI, 570 U.S. at 218. \n11The majority’s reliance on the Seventh Circuit “reject[ing] an unconstitutional-conditions challenge to an \nIndiana law with a conduct component identical in every material way to this Ohio law” (Maj. Op. at 7) ignores that \nthe law at issue in PPI did not prohibit funding for any entity that promotes abortions or, more critically, any entity \nthat affiliates with an entity that promotes or performs abortions.  See PPI, 699 F.3d at 967. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 31 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2287 (31 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 28 \n \nApplying these principles here, the unconstitutional-conditions claim is not likely \nto succeed.  Planned Parenthood does not argue that the loss of its block-grant \nfunding imposes an undue burden—directly or indirectly—on a woman’s right to \nobtain an abortion.  If . . . the government’s refusal to subsidize abortion does not \nunduly burden a woman’s right to obtain an abortion, then Indiana’s ban on public \nfunding of abortion providers—even for unrelated services—cannot indirectly \nburden a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. \nPPI, 699 F.3d at 988. \nThe  Seventh  Circuit’s  analysis  avoids  the  unconstitutional-conditions  argument  by \nlooking at the effect on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion if the provider does not submit to \nthe condition and continues providing abortions.  That is not the appropriate analysis.  In AOSI, \nfor example, the Supreme Court did not hold that the organizations’ First Amendment rights \nwere not violated because they could simply decline the funding and continue to have whatever \npolicy they wanted about prostitution and sex trafficking.  Rather, the Court determined that the \ncondition, if imposed directly, would violate the Constitution.  Thus, forcing the organizations to \nhave a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking to obtain the relevant funding violated the \nFirst Amendment, just as forcing Plaintiffs here to refrain from performing abortions to obtain \nunrelated funding would violate the Due Process Clause.  This is because the unconstitutional-\nconditions doctrine prohibits the imposition of the condition itself and does not require the party \nto actually submit to the condition to prevail.  AOSI, 570 U.S. at 214 (explaining that government \naction need not be “actually coercive” to qualify as an unconstitutional condition); see also \nKoontz, 570 U.S. at 607 (“As in other unconstitutional conditions cases in which someone \nrefuses to cede a constitutional right in the face of coercive pressure, the impermissible denial of \na governmental benefit is a constitutionally cognizable injury.”).12  In contrast to the Seventh \nCircuit’s holding in PPI, this court has already held that whether an entity acquiesces to the \ngovernment’s proposed condition is “irrelevant” to the condition’s constitutionality.  R.S.W.W., \n397 F.3d at 436.  Yet the majority perplexingly suggests that even a condition imposed directly \non women to choose between having an abortion and receiving government benefits could be \nconstitutional if women would choose to cease receiving government benefits.  (Maj. Op. at 8 \n(“[T]he doctrine would prohibit the State from requiring women to forfeit benefits if they chose \n                                                 \n12PPI was decided before Koontz and AOSI, which may account for its flawed analysis. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 32 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2288 (32 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 29 \n \nto  obtain  an  abortion  and  if  that  limitation  unduly  burdened  their  access  to  abortion \nservices.”).)13 \nThe PPI majority also failed to recognize Rust’s distinction between conditions placed on \nthe government program and those imposed on the recipient.  And although in summarizing Rust \nthe PPI majority seems to recognize that Rust treated the unconstitutional-conditions argument \nas  separate  from  the  undue-burden  analysis,14  the  PPI  majority  engaged  in  no  substantive \ndiscussion of Rust’s treatment of the separate unconstitutional-conditions claim.  See 699 F.3d at \n987-88.  Rather, the PPI majority’s entire discussion of the unconstitutional-conditions claim \nrested on the undisputed propositions that the government can constitutionally allocate funds in a \nmanner that favors childbirth over abortion; that there is no constitutional requirement that the \ngovernment subsidize abortion; and that denying funding for abortion does not unduly burden a \nwoman’s constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.  The PPI majority concludes by \nquoting Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59-60 (2006): \n“It is clear that a funding condition cannot be unconstitutional if it could be constitutionally \nimposed directly.”  699 F.3d at 988. \nThe unstated conclusion holding the PPI majority’s opinion together is that because the \ngovernment need not subsidize abortion and need not be neutral between abortion providers and \nother medical providers, particularly with respect to government funds, the government could \ndirectly prohibit providers from performing abortions.  Of course, this is not the case.  The cited \ncases15 establish that the government can prohibit PPI or other abortion providers from using \nprogram funds to perform or advocate for abortion.  But nowhere does Rust or any other case \n                                                 \n13This suggestion would have particularly troubling implications.  It seems that the majority would never \nallow a facial challenge claiming that a statute imposed an unconstitutional condition on a woman’s abortion right, \nbecause the answer to whether a statute will create an undue burden is always “[m]aybe; maybe not.”  (Maj. Op. at \n11.)  This is antithetical to this court’s precedent, see R.S.W.W., 397 F.3d at 436, and antithetical to the purpose of \nthe doctrine, see, e.g., Oil States Energy Servs., LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC, 138 S. Ct. 1365, 1377 n.4 \n(2018) (“The doctrine prevents the Government from using conditions ‘to produce a result which it could not \ncommand directly.’” (quoting Perry, 408 U.S. at 597)). \n14The PPI majority stated: “Because the Title X regulations did not place an undue burden on a woman’s \nright to obtain an abortion or otherwise impose an unconstitutional condition on grant recipients, the Court upheld \nthe regulatory scheme.” 699 F.3d at 988 (emphasis added). \n15Maher, 432 U.S. 464; Harris, 448 U.S. 297; Rust, 500 U.S. 173; and Webster v. Reprod. Health Servs., \n492 U.S. 490 (1989). \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 33 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2289 (33 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 30 \n \nsuggest  that  the  government  can  condition  the  receipt  of  unrelated  funds  on  a  recipient’s \nabandoning all activities that facilitate a woman’s right to obtain an abortion, or that advocate for \nsuch a right, and any affiliation with any entity that does either.  Courts considering similar \nissues post-AOSI have not followed the Seventh Circuit’s (or the majority’s) analysis.  See, e.g., \nPlanned Parenthood of Sw. & Cent. Fla. v. Philip, 194 F. Supp. 3d 1213, 1218-19 (N.D. Fla. \n2016) (“If, as the Court said in Rust, Congress can prohibit the use of federal funds for abortion \nservices  but  cannot  restrict  a  recipient  of  federal  funds  from  separately  providing  abortion \nservices, then the Florida legislature likewise can prohibit the use of state funds for abortion \nservices  but  cannot  prohibit  a  recipient  of  state  funds  from  separately  providing  abortion \nservices.”); Cansler, 877 F. Supp. 2d at 320-21 (enjoining law that denied non-abortion-related \nfunding based on Planned Parenthood’s activity as an abortion-rights advocate and abortion \nprovider under the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine).16   \nI agree with the majority that “[t]he point of the [unconstitutional-conditions] doctrine is \nto protect the underlying right: a woman’s right of access to abortion services without an undue \nburden.”  (Maj. Op. at 11–12.)  But the majority creates a loophole that enables states to \ncircumvent the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine: the government cannot leverage its funding \nto carve away at constitutional rights by passing laws that target the individual who holds the \nright, but it can leverage funding to achieve that same result so long as it manages to find a proxy \nto  target  instead.    The  majority’s  reasoning  contorts  a  doctrine  that  aims  to  prevent  the \ngovernment from manipulating rights out of existence, Frost, 271 U.S. at 593-94, to permit the \nState to leverage its funding to launch a thinly veiled attack on women’s rights so long as it \n                                                 \n16The majority’s suggestion that Teixeira v. County of Alameda, 873 F.3d 670, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2017) (en \nbanc), supports its understanding of the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is unpersuasive.  Teixeira does not \nexpressly address the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, but the law at issue there placed conditions on the sale of \nfirearms in the form of zoning restrictions.  In Teixeira, the Ninth Circuit found that “the Second Amendment does \nnot independently protect a proprietor’s right to sell firearms,” id. at 690, and still it held that “Teixeira, as the \nwould-be operator of a gun store, . . . has derivative standing to assert the subsidiary right to acquire arms on behalf \nof his potential customers,” id. at 678.  That is exactly what Plaintiffs argue here.  Moreover, the only reason the \nNinth Circuit found there was no constitutional violation in Teixeira is that, even if the store was entirely prevented \nfrom selling guns, its customers’ Second Amendment rights would not be infringed.  Id. at 679-81.  In contrast, \nODH never contested below that women’s abortion rights would be violated if Plaintiffs were prevented from \nperforming abortions.  To the extent Teixeira can be read as instructive, its reasoning supports Plaintiffs’ view of the \nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine, not the majority’s. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 34 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2290 (34 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 31 \n \ncamouflages its unconstitutional condition in provider-focused verbiage.  This strikes me as \nexactly the type of maneuver the doctrine seeks to prevent. \nAt bottom, ODH’s position and the majority’s opinion open the door for the government \nto impose almost any condition17 it wants on abortion providers so long as the abortion providers \nresist the coercion and continue to perform abortions.  At oral argument, the United States, \narguing in favor of ODH’s position, acknowledged that ODH’s position would authorize the \ngovernment to pass a law prohibiting all doctors who perform abortions from providing any \nother medical services.  (Oral Arg. at 33:10-35:30.)  This is because as long as enough doctors \ncontinue to perform abortions, there would be no undue burden on a woman’s right to obtain \none.  (Id.)  And under the majority’s reasoning, the doctors could not challenge the law as an \nunconstitutional condition because they have no due process right to provide abortions.  Other \nhypotheticals  are  imaginable,  which  before  today  would  have  seemed  absurd.    Using  this \nreasoning, the government can do almost anything it wants to penalize abortion providers so long \nas they resist the coercion and continue to perform abortions. (Id.)   \nThis result is especially striking in juxtaposition with the Supreme Court’s abortion \njurisprudence over the last three decades, which reveals that virtually every attempt to ban or \nundermine a woman’s abortion right since Roe v. Wade has operated by targeting providers, not \nwomen.  See, e.g., Whole Woman’s Health, 136 S. Ct. 2292 (imposing admitting-privileges and \nsurgical-center  requirements  on  providers);  Stenberg  v.  Carhart,  530  U.S.  914  (2000) \n(criminalizing providers’ performance of particular abortion procedures); Casey, 505 U.S. 833 \n(imposing civil penalties on providers who perform abortions without receiving signed statement \nof spousal consent);  Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S.  417 (1990) (criminalizing providers’ \nperformance of abortions on minors without both parents’ consent).  Those laws, each of which \nwas struck down as unconstitutional, reflect a basic reality that legislatures seeking to undermine \nabortion  rights  have  long  understood:  when  a  constitutional  right  requires  a  third  party  to \nvindicate  it,  a  restriction  imposed  on  that  indispensable  third  party  effectively  restricts  the \nrightholder.  That is why the Constitution prohibits unduly burdening a woman’s abortion right, \neven in the form of laws that directly target only the gatekeeper to a woman’s abortion right—\n                                                 \n17Subject only to rational basis review, according to the United States. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 35 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2291 (35 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 32 \n \nher provider.  The impact of the condition is the same, because the provider is the target in name \nonly.  In practice, the provider is merely a proxy for the woman and her constitutional rights. \nBecause  the  unconstitutional-conditions  doctrine  does  not  allow  the  government  to \npenalize a party indispensable to the exercise of a constitutional right so long as the party refuses \nto cry uncle and submit to the condition, the conduct provision is unconstitutional. \nB. First Amendment Claims \nThe majority does not reach Plaintiffs’ patently meritorious First Amendment claims, \nreasoning that because the conduct provision does not impose an unconstitutional burden, ODH \nmay deny funding under the Statute without regard to whether the Statute violates Plaintiffs’ \nFirst  Amendment  rights.    But  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment  claims  are  not  mooted  by  the \npurported constitutionality of the conduct provision, and a decision on the First Amendment \nclaims is not rendered advisory by the majority’s decision on the conduct provision.  If the First \nAmendment challenge is successful, Plaintiffs could form affiliate entities to take over their \nabortion-related activities (see Pls.’ Br. on Reh’g at 18-19), and still receive funds under the six \nfederal programs.  In any event, because the conduct provision is unconstitutional, I address \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment claims as well.  \nPlaintiffs assert two claims under the First Amendment, addressing both § 3701.034’s \nspeech provision—which prohibits the allocation of program funds to any entity that promotes \nnontherapeutic  abortions—and  its  affiliation  provision—which  prohibits  the  allocation  of \nprogram  funds  to  any  entity  that  affiliates  with  any  entity  that  performs  or  promotes \nnontherapeutic  abortions.    It  is  undisputed  that  a  funding  condition  can  result  in  an \nunconstitutional burden on First Amendment rights.  See AOSI, 570 U.S. at 218 (“By requiring \nrecipients to profess a specific belief, the Policy Requirement goes beyond defining the limits of \nthe federally funded program to defining the recipient.”); Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 59 (the First \nAmendment supplies “a limit on Congress’ ability to place conditions on the receipt of funds”). \nPlaintiffs’  First  Amendment  claim  is  not  vulnerable  to  attack  under  either  of  the \nrationales the majority appears to adopt in analyzing the due process claim.  Plaintiffs are \nasserting their own First Amendment rights and need not show that a restriction amounts to an \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 36 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2292 (36 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 33 \n \nundue burden on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion to prevail on a claim under the First \nAmendment.  Nor does ODH dispute that it would be unconstitutional to legislate a direct ban on \npromoting  nontherapeutic  abortions  or  affiliating  with  entities  that  perform  or  promote \nnontherapeutic abortions.   \nInstead, relying on Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Hidalgo County Texas, Inc. v. Suehs, \n692 F.3d 343 (5th Cir. 2012), ODH argues that the Statute’s speech provision does no more than \nis  constitutionally  permissible  by  seeking  “to  ensure  that  contractors  who  convey  Ohio’s \nmessages do so efficiently and effectively.”  (Appellant’s Br. at 52-53 (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).)  This argument is unpersuasive. \nIn Suehs, the Texas legislature had created the “Women’s Health Program (WHP),” \ndesigned to “expand access to preventative health and family planning services for women.”  \n692 F.3d.  at  346  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted).    The  Texas  legislature \nprohibited the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (THHSC), which administers the \nWHP, from contracting with “entities that perform or promote elective abortions or are affiliates \nof entities that perform or promote elective abortions.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  The plaintiff health-clinic operators alleged that the regulations violated their First \nAmendment rights of free-speech and association, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of \nequal protection.  Applying the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, the district court determined \nthat  the  regulations  likely  violated  these  constitutionally  guaranteed  rights  and  issued  a \npreliminary injunction.  The Fifth Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded, \nexplaining: \nTexas’s restriction on promoting elective abortions directly regulates the content \nof the WHP as a state program.  The policy expressed in the WHP is for public \nfunds  to  subsidize  non-abortion  family  planning  speech  to  the  exclusion  of \nabortion speech.  § 1.19(b), 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws at 335.  Texas’s authority to \npromote that policy would be meaningless if it were forced to enlist organizations \nas health care providers and message-bearers that were also abortion advocates.  \nThe authority of Texas to disfavor abortion within its own subsidized program is \nnot violative of the First Amendment right, as interpreted by Rust v. Sullivan.  \nConsequently, Texas’s choice to disfavor abortion does not unconstitutionally \npenalize the appellees’ speech. \nSuehs, 692 F.3d at 350. \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 37 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2293 (37 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 34 \n \nI agree with the district court that this out-of-circuit precedent is distinguishable and \ninapposite.  Suehs is virtually indistinguishable from Rust because, as the Fifth Circuit observed, \nTexas’s restriction “directly regulates the content of the WHP as a state program.”  Id.  Here, \nhowever, § 3701.034 does not regulate, and has no relation to, the content of the six federal \nprograms.   \nFurther, although Ohio, like Texas, may, consistent with the First Amendment, ensure \nthat its message favoring childbirth over abortion is not garbled, this case plainly involves no \nstate “message” related to or regarding abortion; § 3701.034 affects programs that have nothing \nto do with abortion or family planning, and seeks to impose restrictions on recipients’ speech \noutside of those six government programs.   \nAs the Supreme Court made clear in AOSI, the government may not prevent a recipient of \ngovernment funding from expressing its own views “when participating in activities on its own \ntime and dime.”  570 U.S. at 218.  Because “the conditions imposed by Section 3701.034 seek to \nleverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the six programs impacted by Section \n3701.034,” the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine applies.  Planned Parenthood of Greater \nOhio, 201 F. Supp. 3d at 906.  Therefore, the district court correctly determined that § 3701.034 \nviolates the First Amendment by conditioning participation in funding for these programs on a \nrecipient’s forgoing the exercise of its rights of free speech outside these programs.  See AOSI, \n570 U.S. at 218; see also Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 462 (“Legislation that simply dictates the proper \nscope of government-funded programs is constitutional, while legislation that restricts protected \ngrantee activities outside government programs is unconstitutional . . . .”); Planned Parenthood \nof Cent. & N. Ariz., 718 F.2d at 944 (although the state need not fund abortions, the state “may \nnot  unreasonably  interfere  with  the  right  of  Planned  Parenthood  to  engage  in  abortion  or \nabortion-related speech activities”). \nFinally, by conditioning participation in the six federal programs on refraining from \nbeing an affiliate of any entity that promotes or performs nontherapeutic abortions, the Statute \neffects a separate First Amendment violation of Plaintiffs’ right to free association.  See Runyon \nv. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 175 (1976) (“[T]he Court has recognized a First Amendment right to \n‘engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas[.]’  That right is protected \n\nCase: 1  : 1  6 -cv-00539-MRB    D  oc #: 72 Filed: 03 / 1  3 /19 Page: 38 of 3 9      PAGEID #: 2294 (38 of 39)\nNo. 16-4027  Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al. v. Hodges  Page 35 \n \nbecause it promotes and may well be essential to the ‘[e]ffective advocacy of both public and \nprivate points of view, particularly controversial ones’ that the First Amendment is designed to \nfoster.” (third alteration in original) (internal citation omitted) (quoting NAACP v. Alabama ex \nrel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958))).  Plaintiffs are affiliates of PPFA, which advocates for \nwomen’s access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including abortion.  Thus, even if \nPlaintiffs  ceased  performing  and  promoting  nontherapeutic  abortions  or  transferred  those \nfunctions to an affiliate, the affiliation provision would still prohibit them from obtaining funds \nunder the six federal programs due to their status as affiliates of PPFA.  See AOSI, 570 U.S. at \n215 (explaining that the funding condition at issue in Regan, 461 U.S. 540, did not violate the \nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine because the organization retained the ability to “return[] to a \n‘dual structure’ it had used in the past”).  ODH offers no argument for the constitutionality of \nthis provision aside from those offered to defend the speech provision.  For the same reasons, the \naffiliation provision also imposes an unconstitutional condition.  \nIV.  ENTRY OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION \nODH conceded that it “agrees that if this Court finds the Conduct and Speech Provisions \nboth unconstitutional,” the permanent injunction factors are met.  (Reply Br. at 29.)   \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated, the district court correctly granted Plaintiffs’ motions for judgment \non the merits and for a permanent injunction.  Its decision should be affirmed. \n\nCase: 1 : 1  6  -cv-00539-MRB   D   oc #: 72 Filed: 03/ 1  3  /19 Page: 39 of 39      P AGEID #: 2295 (39 of 39)\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \n \nNo. 16-4027 \n \n \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD OF GREATER OHIO; \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHWEST \nOHIO REGION, \n  Plaintiffs - Appellees, \n \n  v. \n \nRICHARD HODGES, in his official capacity as Director \nof the Ohio Department of Health, \n  Defendant - Appellant. \n \n \n \nBefore:  COLE, Chief Judge; SILER, BATCHELDER, MOORE, CLAY, GIBBONS, \nSUTTON, COOK, GRIFFIN, KETHLEDGE, WHITE, STRANCH, DONALD, \nTHAPAR, BUSH, LARSEN, and NALBANDIAN, Circuit Judges. \n \nJUDGMENT\n \n \nOn Appeal from the United States District Court \nfor the Southern District of Ohio at Cincinnati. \n \n  UPON CONSIDERATION of the petition for rehearing en banc and the supplemental briefs and \narguments of counsel,  \n \nIT  IS  ORDERED  that  the  judgment  of  the  district  court  is  REVERSED,  and  the  case  is \nREMANDED for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of this court. \n \n            ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT \n \n \n \n \n \n            Deborah S.

This civil action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the United States \nConstitution to vindicate rights secured by the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution. \n2.  For decades, PPGOH and PPSWO have played an important role in the delivery \n1 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 2 of 31  PAGEID #: 2\nof health care to tens of thousands of Ohio residents each year, especially low-income women \nand minority Ohio residents.  Both PPGOH and PPSWO have received federal, state, and local \nfunds to provide vital health services in the communities they serve, including pap smears and \nother cancer screenings, tests for HIV/AIDS and tests and treatment for other sexually-\ntransmitted diseases (“STDs”), infant mortality prevention programs, and sexual health education \nprograms.  PPGOH and PPSWO have provided excellent service to Ohio residents under those \nprograms, and have routinely passed audits and program reviews and received praise from \nprogram administrators.  \n3.  Nevertheless, the State of Ohio has decided to bar PPGOH and PPSWO from \nreceiving government funding for non-abortion health care programs and health education \nprograms.  It has done so solely because PPGOH and PPSWO—separate and apart from the \nhealth and education services they provide with government funding—also provide abortion \nservices (along with other reproductive health services) and advocate for safe and legal \nabortions, both of which are constitutionally protected activities.  Almost all of the programs \nfrom which the State of Ohio is attempting to exclude PPGOH and PPSWO are paid for entirely \nby federal funds.  The State disburses those federal funds to local agencies and to local service \nproviders. \n4.  On February 21, 2016, Governor John Kasich signed into law Substitute House \nBill Number 294.  Ohio Rev. H.B. 294 (codified at Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.034).  On March \n24, 2016, the Ohio Department of Health (“ODH”) informed Plaintiffs that it interprets Section \n3701.034 to categorically disqualify any entity that either “perform[s]” or “promote[s]” \n“nontherapeutic” abortions (as that term is defined in Ohio Rev. Code § 9.04(A)(1)), or \naffiliates with any entity that does so, from receiving state and certain federal funds that it is \n2 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 3 of 31  PAGEID #: 3\notherwise eligible and qualified to receive—even if the entity never uses a penny of \ngovernment money to provide abortion services or advocate for safe and legal abortion.  \nAlthough there has been confusion regarding what the statute in fact prohibits, the measure as \ninterpreted by ODH effectively bars PPGOH and PPSWO from receiving state and federal \nfunds the organizations use to provide vital non-abortion services to thousands of people in \nOhio.   \n5.  PPGOH and PPSWO seek declaratory and injunctive relief because Section \n3701.034 violates the First Amendment and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Section 3701.034 impermissibly \ndisqualifies PPGOH and PPSWO from receiving certain funds because of their \nconstitutionally protected advocacy in support of safe and legal abortion.  Section 3701.034 \nalso impermissibly disqualifies PPGOH and PPSWO from receiving the funds at issue because \nof their provision of constitutionally protected abortions, even though those abortion services \nare undertaken without any government funding or involvement.  Section 3701.034 exacts an \nextreme punishment—total disqualification—even though the funds at issue have nothing to \ndo with abortion. \n6.  Section 3701.034 cannot be justified on the ground that it avoids government \nsubsidization of abortion, because (with a few narrow exceptions) federal and state law already \nprohibit government funds from being used for abortion services, see, e.g., Ohio Rev. Code \n§ 9.04(B), and PPGOH and PPSWO have rigorously adhered to those prohibitions.  Nor can \nSection 3701.034 be justified by its budgetary impact:  The government funds diverted from \nPPGOH and PPSWO are theoretically available to other organizations, which could apply to \nreceive the same grant money.   \n3 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 4 of 31  PAGEID #: 4\n7.  The principal effect of Section 3701.034 will be to deprive Ohio residents, \nincluding low-income women, men, and teens, of much needed services.  No other existing \norganization in the region comes close to matching either PPGOH’s or PPSWO’s trusted high \nquality of care, accessibility, and specialized expertise in the services it provides.  Even if other \nhealth care providers are eventually able to provide similar services, many patients’ health care \nand access to other services will be disrupted because other providers are not prepared to \nassume responsibility for those services.  Disruptions in care, including testing and treatment, \ncould have a serious impact on the health of those patients. \n8.  Section 3701.034 will take effect on May 23, 2016.  If permitted to stand, \nSection 3701.034 will cause significant and irreparable harm to PPGOH and PPSWO, as well \nas those served by PPGOH and PPSWO, who will have few or no options for vital health \nservices.  Enforcement of Section 3701.034 will force PPGOH and PPSWO to eliminate \nservices, including life-saving health care services and educational programs.  These cuts will \nfall hardest on the many low-income Ohioans served by PPGOH’s and PPSWO’s programs, \nand those PPGOH and PPSWO employees whose jobs will likely be terminated.  Termination \nof employees, among other things, will make it difficult to reconstitute these programs should \nPPGOH and PPSWO become eligible to apply for funding once again. \n9.  Plaintiffs’ compliance with Section 3701.034’s funding condition (as \nimplemented by ODH)—i.e., by ceasing to perform and “promote” abortions—would constitute \nan undue, constitutionally intolerable burden on the abortion rights of Ohio women.  PPSWO \nand PPGOH provided approximately 30 percent (approximately 6,257 of 21,186) of the \nabortions in the State of Ohio in calendar year 2014.  In the same year, PPGOH provided \napproximately 36 percent (approximately 1,500 of 4,137) of the abortions in Franklin County \n4 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 5 of 31  PAGEID #: 5\nand 23 percent (approximately 2,000 of 8,548) of the abortions in Cuyahoga County.  PPSWO \noperates the only abortion clinic in the Cincinnati area, and in 2014 performed 2,757 abortions \nthere.  Were Plaintiffs to comply with Section 3701.034’s funding condition, the consequences \nfor Ohio women would be dramatic.  Cincinnati would become the largest metropolitan area in \nthe country without an abortion clinic.  The overnight disappearance of approximately one \nquarter to one third of capacity in Franklin and Cuyahoga counties would likely overwhelm \nexisting providers, expand wait times, and leave some women in those counties with no feasible \noption for exercising their constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.  This would \nworsen an already dire situation for women seeking an abortion in Ohio, as half of Ohio’s \nabortion clinics have shut down due to restrictive legislation over the last 6 years. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n10.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343. \n11.  Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court. \n12.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because \nPPSWO is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, and experiences the denial of funding there.  \nFurthermore, the PPSWO health centers affected by Section 3701.034 are located in Hamilton \nCounty, Ohio, and but for Section 3701.034 would receive funds administered by ODH.  \nTherefore, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims alleged herein \narise in this district.   \n13.  In addition, one of the defendants, Timothy Ingram, the Commissioner of \nHamilton County Public Health, resides within this district.  Venue is therefore also proper in \n5 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 6 of 31  PAGEID #: 6\nthis district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1). \nTHE PARTIES \n \nA.  Plaintiff PPGOH \n \n14.  Plaintiff PPGOH is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of \nOhio.  PPGOH brings this action on behalf of itself, its patients, and those benefiting from \nits health education and outreach services. \n15.  PPGOH provides affordable, respectful, and high-quality health care to tens \nof thousands of patients.  PPGOH operates 21 health centers in 20 locations in northern, \neastern, and central Ohio, which provide a wide range of reproductive health services, \nincluding well-women exams, screening for breast and cervical cancer, contraception and \ncontraceptive counseling, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and \ninfections.  At two of its health centers, located in Columbus and in the Cleveland area, \nPPGOH provides abortions to women who seek to terminate their pregnancy. \n16.  Many of the patients who receive health care services at PPGOH’s health \ncenters have limited income.  Approximately 40 percent of the patients treated at PPGOH’s \nhealth centers in the fiscal year ending June 29, 2015 are low-income, many of whom live at \nor below the poverty line. \n17.  PPGOH also provides a variety of education programs through its Health \nEducation and Outreach Department.  The department’s mission is to empower Ohioans to \nmake informed, responsible sexual health decisions through comprehensive, evidence-based \nprogramming. \n18.  PPGOH also engages in advocacy and public education activities intended \nto protect and facilitate access to comprehensive reproductive health, including safe and \n6 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 7 of 31  PAGEID #: 7\nlegal abortion services for women who choose to exercise their right to choose that option.  \n19.  Although PPGOH is an independent entity, it is an affiliate of Planned \nParenthood Federation of America, Inc. (“PPFA”), which also advocates for women’s \naccess to comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion. \n20.  PPFA’s mission is to ensure that its affiliates provide comprehensive \nreproductive health care services, high quality care, and educational programs relating to \nreproductive and sexual health, and to advocate for public policies to ensure access to health \nservices.  PPGOH’s association with PPFA is critical to its core mission of ensuring access \nto reproductive health care.   \nB.  Plaintiff PPSWO \n \n21.  Plaintiff PPSWO is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of \nOhio.  PPSWO brings this action on behalf of itself, its patients, and those benefiting from \nits health education and outreach services. \n22.  PPSWO provides affordable, respectful, and high quality health care to tens \nof thousands of patients in Southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky.  PPSWO operates \nseven health centers in Southwest Ohio, which are located in Cincinnati, Dayton, Hamilton, \nSpringdale, and Springfield.  Those health centers provide a wide range of reproductive \nhealth services, including well-women exams, screening for breast and cervical cancer, \ncontraception and contraceptive counseling, and STD testing and treatment.  At one of its \nhealth centers, located in Cincinnati, PPSWO provides abortions.  Approximately 75 \npercent of the patients treated in these health centers are low-income. \n23.  PPSWO also provides a variety of education programs through its dedicated \nteam of education staff.  The team’s mission is to empower Ohioans to make informed, \n7 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 8 of 31  PAGEID #: 8\nresponsible sexual health decisions through comprehensive, evidence-based programming. \n24.  PPSWO also engages in advocacy and public education activities intended \nto protect and facilitate access to safe and legal abortion services for women who choose to \nexercise their right to choose that option.   \n25.  Like PPGOH, PPSWO is an affiliate of PPFA, and PPSWO’s association \nwith PPFA is critical to its core mission of ensuring access to reproductive health care.   \nC.  Defendants \n \n26.  Defendant Richard Hodges is the Director of ODH, which is the agency \nresponsible for administering state and federal programs that disburse funds to service \nproviders, and which would disburse the funds at issue to PPGOH and PPSWO in the absence \nof Section 3701.034.  Defendant Hodges is sued only in his official capacity.  \n27.  Timothy Ingram is the Commissioner of Hamilton County Public Health, which \nis the agency responsible for administering certain state and federal programs that disburse \nfunds to service providers in Hamilton County, and which would disburse certain funds at issue \nto PPSWO in the absence of Section 3701.034.  Defendant Ingram is sued only in his official \ncapacity. \nPPGOH’S AND PPSWO’S GRANT PROGRAMS \n28.  Until the passage of Section 3701.034, PPGOH and PPSWO participated in \nmany programs that are intended to promote public health, including and especially the health \nof lower-income women and minorities.  Almost all of those programs are funded entirely by \nthe federal government.  Under those programs, a federal agency provides funding to the State \nof Ohio, which contracts with local service providers directly, or passes those funds on to local \nagencies, which in turn contract with local service providers to provide the services.  Section \n8 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 9 of 31  PAGEID #: 9\n3701.034 will bar PPGOH and PPSWO from carrying out the services that they previously \nprovided under those programs, to the detriment of the health and health literacy of many Ohio \nresidents.   \nA.  Infertility Prevention Project/STD Prevention Program \n \n29.  The STD Prevention Program, which is part of the Infertility Prevention \nProject, is a federal program that subsidizes the provision of diagnostic tests and treatments \nfor sexually transmitted diseases (“STDs”) (today, more generally referred to as sexually \ntransmitted infections (“STIs”)).  Section 318 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) \nauthorizes the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to make project grants \nto states for STD control and prevention programs, including screening, diagnostic tests, and \ntreatment.  See 42 U.S.C. § 247c(c) (authorizing Secretary to make grants to “States and, in \nconsultation with the State health authority, to political subdivisions of States for … sexually \ntransmitted diseases surveillance activities, including the reporting, screening, and follow up \nof diagnostic tests for, and diagnosed cases of, sexually transmitted diseases”).1 \n30.  STD Prevention Program funds are granted by the United States Centers for \nDisease Control (“CDC”) to states or state agencies (“grantees”), such as ODH.  Grantees in \nturn may enter into agreements with other entities (“subgrantees”) to provide STD Prevention \nProgram services. \n31.  PPGOH has served as a subgrantee in the STD Prevention Program for more \nthan 15 years.  In fiscal year ending July 30, 2016, PPGOH received testing kits, diagnostic \ntesting, and treatment medication valued at $420,000.  Approximately 64,300 of the 90,000 \nSTD tests that PPGOH administers annually are funded through the STD Prevention Program \n                                                           \n1   The STD Prevention Program was once part of the now-defunct Infertility Prevention Project, which was \nalso authorized under section 318 of the PHSA. \n9 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 10 of 31  PAGEID #: 10\nto benefit Ohioans who could not otherwise afford the costs of those services. \n32.  PPSWO has served as a subgrantee in the STD Prevention Program for more \nthan 14 years.  For the period May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016, it received testing kits, \nprocessing, and treatment medications for its patients under this program.  PPSWO uses these \nitems to provide approximately 7,943 STD tests and 1,150 treatments annually to benefit \nOhioans who could not otherwise afford the costs of those services. \nB.  Breast and Cervical Cancer Project \n \n33.  Congress established the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \nProgram when it enacted the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990.  \nBreast and Cervical Cancer Project (“BCCP”) funds are intended to ensure access to high \nquality screening and follow-up services for low-income and minority women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 247B(k)(2). \n34.  BCCP funds are awarded by the CDC to grantees, including ODH, which in \nturn disburse funds to service providers through 11 Regional Enrollment Agencies.  Service \nproviders do not receive up-front grants but are instead reimbursed for the services they \nprovide. \n35.  PPGOH has received funding under the BCCP for more than 20 years.  In \nfiscal year ending July 30, 2015, it was reimbursed in the amount of $18,876 for services \nprovided to eligible recipients.  PPGOH uses those funds to provide life-saving pap tests, \nbreast exams, colposcopies, and cervical biopsies to low-income women over the age of 40 \nwho are at risk for cancer but are not eligible for coverage under Medicaid. \n36.  PPSWO has received funding under the BCCP for more than 12 years.  For \nthe period May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016, it was reimbursed in the amount of $3,056 for \n10 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 11 of 31  PAGEID #: 11\nBCCP services.  PPSWO uses those funds to provide life-saving pap tests, breast exams, \ncolposcopies, and cervical biopsies to low-income women over the age of 40 who are at risk \nfor cancer but are not eligible for coverage under Medicaid. \nC.  Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative & HIV Prevention Program \n \n37.  The Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative was established by Congress in 1999 in \nresponse to growing concern about the impact of HIV and AIDS on racial and ethnic \nminorities.  See Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681 (1998). \n38.  Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative funds are granted by the CDC to grantees, \nincluding ODH.  ODH operates an HIV/STD Prevention Program, in cooperation with the \nfederal Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, which provides funds to local health authorities for \npurposes of HIV prevention programs.  ODH and/or the local health authorities enter into \nagreements with subgrantees to provide HIV prevention services. \n39.  For purposes of the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, PPGOH is a subgrantee of \nthe Canton City Health Department, the Summit County Health Department, and the City of \nCleveland.  It has received funding under the program for 22 years.  For fiscal year ending \nDecember 31, 2016, PPGOH received three Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative grants totaling \n$112,845.  PPGOH uses its Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative funds to provide anonymous and \nconfidential HIV tests to low-income and minority Ohioans.  PPGOH’s program focuses on \nAfrican-American women with risk factors for HIV. \n40.  The HIV Prevention Program is a comprehensive federal prevention program \nintended to reduce new infections, increase access to care, improve health outcomes for \npeople living with HIV, and promote health equity.  HIV Prevention Program funds are \ngranted by the CDC to grantees, including ODH and local health authorities.  ODH and/or \n11 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 12 of 31  PAGEID #: 12\nlocal health authorities enter into agreements with organizations like PPSWO to provide HIV \nprevention services. \n41.  PPSWO has received HIV Prevention Program funding for four years.  For the \ngrant year ending December 31, 2016, PPSWO was awarded more than $100,000 in HIV \nPrevention Program grants by Public Health—Dayton & Montgomery County and Hamilton \nCounty Public Health.   \n42.  PPSWO uses its Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative/HIV Prevention funds to \nprovide 1,600 anonymous and confidential HIV tests annually, as well as education and \nreferrals, to low-income and minority Ohioans.  PPSWO’s program focuses on gay men with \nrisk factors for HIV. \nD.  “Healthy Moms Healthy Babies” Infant Mortality Initiative \n \n43.  The “Healthy Moms Healthy Babies” Infant Mortality Initiative is a \nneighborhood outreach program that targets pregnant, at-risk African-American women.  It is \nfunded by the Ohio Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative, which itself is funded by a block \ngrant to ODH from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) \nunder Title V of the Social Security Act.  42 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.  The purpose of the Ohio \nInfant Mortality Reduction Initiative is to provide community-based outreach and care \ncoordination services in targeted communities with at-risk, low-income, African-American, \npregnant women and their families.  Grantees may provide services themselves or, as is the \ncase in Ohio, enter into agreements with subgrantees to provide services. \n44.  PPGOH has received Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative grants for 20 years.  \nFor the period July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016, PPGOH received two grants \ntotaling approximately $350,000, including a $185,000 grant from Trumbull County Health \n12 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 13 of 31  PAGEID #: 13\nDepartment and $168,500 from the Mahoning County General Health District. \n45.  PPGOH uses the Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative funds it receives to \nprovide education, outreach, home visits, and referrals to women before pregnancy, during \npregnancy, and up to two years after birth, including providing critical education and \nassistance in the areas of health, housing, nutrition, and employment.  Many of the women in \nthe program do not have transportation for prenatal appointments, may not have health \ninsurance, and/or may engage in high-risk activities. \nE.  Personal Responsibility Education Program \n \n46.  The federal Personal Responsibility Education Program (“PREP”) was \nauthorized in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 713.  Through the \nPREP program, HHS provides grants to states and other entities to educate young people \nregarding abstinence and contraception.  ODH has a PREP grant designed to reduce teen \npregnancy and sexually transmitted infection rates for young people in Ohio, aged 14 to 19, \nwho are in the foster care and juvenile justice systems.  \n47.  Through this program, ODH works through nine regional grantees, who in \nturn receive training and then work regionally to train direct-care staff who work with foster \ncare and juvenile-justice-involved youth.  The program consists of an evidence-based \npregnancy and STD prevention curriculum, Reducing the Risk (“RTR”), as well as other \ntopics related to health and adulthood, including healthy relationships (a Planned Parenthood \ncurriculum), financial literacy, and preparing for careers. \n48.  For the fiscal year ending July 31, 2016, PPGOH received a $166,508 grant \nfrom ODH to carry out PREP programming in 14 counties in Ohio.  For fiscal year ending \nJuly 31, 2016, PPGOH also received an $18,160 grant from Summit County Public Health \n13 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 14 of 31  PAGEID #: 14\nand Cuyahoga County Board of Health and a $23,597 grant from Cuyahoga County—for a \ntotal of $208,265.87 in PREP funding—to provide PREP programming in those counties.  \nWith these funds, PPGOH has trained 209 agency staff members who have provided PREP \nservices to 706 young Ohioans. \n49.  For the fiscal year ending July 31, 2016, PPSWO received two grants from \nODH totaling $291,000 to carry out PREP programming in 18 counties.  With PREP funding, \nPPSWO has trained 270 agency staff members who have provided the evidence-based \neducation to 1,170 young Ohioans, approximately one third of the total number of young \npersons who have received PREP education in Ohio. \nF.  Violence Against Women Act \n \n50.  The federal Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”) authorizes funding for \na Sexual Violence Prevention Program, the goals of which are (1) to reduce the incidence of \nrape and other forms of sexual violence through primary prevention and education, and (2) to \nensure that survivors and their families and friends have access to quality hotline services.  \nThe VAWA Sexual Violence Prevention Program includes several grant programs, including \nEnhancement Projects for outreach to specific communities. \n51.  VAWA funds are granted by multiple federal agencies to state grantees \nincluding ODH.  ODH enters into agreements with subgrantees to provide VAWA Sexual \nViolence Prevention Program services.   \n52.  For fiscal year ending January 31, 2017, PPSWO received $65,000 in federal \nVAWA funding from ODH.  PPSWO uses its VAWA Sexual Violence Prevention Program \nfunds to provide training to students in middle and high schools in Montgomery, Clark, \nGreene, and Preble counties.  Through the program, PPSWO teaches 700 students each year \n14 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 15 of 31  PAGEID #: 15\nabout healthy relationships, sexual assault recognition, and bystander intervention skills.  \nComplementary programs are offered for parents. \nTHE PASSAGE OF SECTION 3701.034 \n \n53.  Section 3701.034 is merely the latest in a series of enactments by Ohio in \nrecent years that have targeted abortion providers. \n54.  For instance, for more than ten years, the Ohio legislature and ODH have \nattempted to shut down abortion providers through increasingly onerous requirements related \nto an Ohio rule that abortions may be provided only in ambulatory surgical facilities that \nmaintain a written transfer agreement with a local hospital.  That rule does nothing to \nincrease patient safety or health and is not medically necessary: surgical abortion is an \nextremely safe procedure that is almost always performed an outpatient setting, and in the \nexceedingly rare event that transfer of an abortion patient to an inpatient setting is required, \nhospitals will not turn patients away.  Yet because Ohio hospitals refuse to enter into written \ntransfer agreements with abortion providers (either due to hospitals’ religious affiliation or \ntheir fear of harassment and intimidation from pro-life activists), ODH and the Ohio \nlegislature have leveraged the rule to target abortion providers.  In 2013, Ohio passed a law \nthat, among other things, prevented public hospitals from entering into written transfer \nagreements with facilities where “nontherapeutic abortions” are performed.  Ohio Rev. Code \n§ 3727.60(B)(1).  And in 2015, Ohio passed a law that, among other things, made denial of a \nwaiver of the written transfer agreement requirement automatic grounds for suspension of an \nambulatory surgical center’s license to operate.  Ohio Rev. Code § 3702.309. \n55.  Ohio also has some of the most restrictive laws in the country governing \naccess to abortion, including requiring women seeking abortions to make two separate trips \n15 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 16 of 31  PAGEID #: 16\nto a health center to receive state-mandated information.   \n56.   Governor John Kasich signed Substitute House Bill 294 into law, as Section \n3701.034 of the Ohio Code, on February 21, 2016.   \n57.  The provisions in Section 3701.034 at issue in this lawsuit take effect on May \n23, 2016. \n58.  Section 3701.034 requires ODH to ensure that funds it receives through \nseveral state and federal programs are not used to “(1) Perform nontherapeutic abortions; (2) \nPromote nontherapeutic abortions; (3) Contract with any entity that performs or promotes \nnontherapeutic abortions; [or] (4) Become or continue to be an affiliate of any entity that \nperforms or promotes nontherapeutic abortions.” \n59.  Section 3701.034 defines “Promote” to mean “to advocate for, assist with, \nencourage, or popularize through advertising or publicity.” \n60.  Under Section 3701.034, a “nontherapeutic abortion” is defined as “an \nabortion that is performed or induced when the life of the mother would not be endangered if \nthe fetus were carried to term or when the pregnancy of the mother was not the result of rape \nor incest reported to a law enforcement agency.”  Ohio Rev. Code § 9.04(A)(1).  Under this \ndefinition, abortions are “nontherapeutic” even when they are required to avoid serious but \nnon-life-threatening harms to the woman or to terminate pregnancies resulting from \nunreported rapes and incest. \n61.  Section 3701.034 explicitly governs ODH’s allocation of funds provided by \nthe federal government under the Violence Against Women Act, the Breast and Cervical \nCancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990, the CDC’s Infertility Prevention Project, HHS’s \nMinority HIV/AIDS Initiative, and HHS’s Personal Responsibility Education Program.  \n16 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 17 of 31  PAGEID #: 17\nSection 3701.034 also governs ODH’s allocation of state funds, including funds for Ohio’s \nInfant Mortality Initiative (which is itself funded by the federal government pursuant to a \ngrant from HHS). \n62.  Under Section 3701.034, as interpreted by ODH, PPGOH and PPSWO are \nprohibited from receiving certain federal or state funds because they perform \n“nontherapeutic” abortions and promote “nontherapeutic” abortions, as defined under the \nlaw, with separate funds, and because each affiliates with PPFA, which also promotes \n“nontherapeutic” abortions as defined under the law. \n63.  Both of the original House co-sponsors indicated that the primary purpose of \nSection 3701.034 was to prevent government funds from being used for elective abortions, \neven though state and federal law already prevented federal funds for being used for that \npurpose.  See House Floor Debate, Statement of Rep. Margaret Conditt (Nov. 17, 2015) \n(stating that the purpose of the bill was to “require the Ohio Department of Health, or ODH, \nto ensure that funds received from the state, or a variety of federal funds, are not used to \nperform or promote nontherapeutic abortions.”); House Floor Debate, Statement of  Rep. Bill \nPatmon (Feb. 10, 2016) (rationale behind the bill is “that taxpayer dollars should not be used \nfor [non]therapeutic abortions.”).  The title of the bill also reflects this purpose.  See \nSubstitute H.B. 294 (131st Gen. Assembly) (2016) (short title of the bill is “Dept of Health-\nensure state/federal funds not used for elective abortions”). \n64.  Another supporter of the bill, Senator Peggy Lehner, candidly explained that \nthe law amounted to retribution for Planned Parenthood’s decision to be an abortion provider.  \nAccording to Senator Lehner, the bill was “necessary only because Planned Parenthood has \nchosen—you like the word choice—they have chosen to be the leading abortion provider in \n17 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 18 of 31  PAGEID #: 18\nthis nation.  You say, but oh, but that’s only three percent of what they do.  Well if it’s only \nthree percent, then perhaps they should be looking to say, let’s drop abortion, and concentrate \non all those other things. … We have an obligation … to say … to Planned Parenthood, until \nyou get out of the business of termination of pregnancy, the destruction of human life, we are \nnot going to choose to fund you.”  Senate Floor Debate, Statement of Sen. Peggy Lehner \n(Jan. 27, 2016).   \n65.  Section 3701.034 is unnecessary to prevent federal and state funds from being \nused to perform “nontherapeutic abortions,” as the State defines that term.  The federal Hyde \nAmendment, which has been attached to congressional appropriation acts every year since \n1976, has long prohibited the use of federal funds to provide abortions that would be defined \nas “nontherapeutic” under Ohio law.  Ohio law also contains a separate provision, analogous \nto the federal Hyde Amendment, banning the use of funds of the “state or any political \nsubdivision thereof” for “nontherapeutic” abortions.  Ohio Rev. Code § 9.04(B). \n66.  Prior to enacting Section 3701.034, the Ohio legislature made no finding and \nconsidered no evidence suggesting that either PPGOH or PPSWO had violated those \nprohibitions. \nTHE IMPACT OF SECTION 3701.034 ON  \nPPGOH, PPSWO, AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE \n \n67.  Section 3701.034 will have a devastating impact on PPGOH, PPSWO, and the \ncommunities they serve.   \n68.  PPGOH will lose approximately $640,000 in grant funds annually as well as \n$420,000 worth of diagnostic testing and treatment dedicated to providing health care and \n18 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 19 of 31  PAGEID #: 19\nhealth education programs to Ohioans.2 \n69.  PPSWO will lose approximately $469,000 in grant funds annually as well as \ndiagnostic testing and treatment supplies under these programs. \n70.  Without that funding, PPGOH’s and PPSWO’s ability to offer life-saving \nhealth care services and educational programs to tens of thousands of individuals in low-\nincome communities will be severely limited. \n71.  For example, PPGOH and PPSWO can offer services to patients without \nsubstantial wait times, and in many instances can see patients on the same day that they seek \nan appointment.  On information and belief, the public health clinics that operate in the same \nregions as PPGOH and PPSWO have limited hours and/or have wait times of several weeks \nto several months for appointments.   \n72.  Few, if any, other organizations possess the same level of expertise and \nexperience in administering the education programs affected by Section 3701.034 with.  \nPPFA and its affiliates have long been recognized as a leader in sex and reproductive \neducation.  PPGOH and PPSWO have won competitive grants and received praise from \nadministrators for the services they have provided under the affected programs. \n73.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm if \nSection 3701.034 is not enjoined. \nA.  Impact on PPGOH and The Communities It Serves \n74.  If implemented, Section 3701.034 will prevent PPGOH from participating in \nthe Infertility Prevention Project/STD Prevention Program, resulting in a loss of $420,000 \n                                                           \n2 For the fiscal year ending June 2015, PPGOH received an extended grant under the “Healthy Moms Healthy \nBabies” program.   Because of the additional $50,000 awarded to PPGOH through that grant, PPGOH’s total \nfunding under these programs is approximately $690,000 this year.  \n19 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 20 of 31  PAGEID #: 20\nworth of diagnostic testing and treatment for STIs.  Approximately 64,300 of the 90,000 \nSTD tests that PPGOH administers annually are funded through the STD Prevention \nProgram, and PPGOH cannot provide the same amount of free testing and treatment without \nthese funds.   \n75.  On April 13, 2016, PPGOH received a letter signed by Director Hodges, \ninforming PPGOH that ODH will terminate its contract under the STD Prevention Program \neffective May 22, 2016.  The letter states that ODH is terminating the funds as required by \nSection 3701.034.   \n76.  Although the availability of public and private health centers varies \nthroughout northern, eastern, and central Ohio, few health care providers are prepared to \nprovide STD testing and treatment in a similarly robust fashion and in a similarly discreet \nenvironment as PPGOH.  Many PPGOH health centers are open six days per week and do \nnot limit the hours during which patients can obtain STD tests, ensuring the privacy of \npatients who seek such testing.  By contrast, most other Federally Qualified Health Centers \n(“FQHCs”) and local health departments only offer free or reduced-cost STD testing on one \nor two days per week.  Because STD testing is provided at such limited times, the reason \npatients who visit the departments at those times require care is readily apparent.  Because 40 \npercent of PPGOH’s patients are low-income , many will be unable to turn to providers that \ncharge for services. \n77.  Some communities served by PPGOH do not even have local health centers \nthat provide STD testing and treatment. But even in cities such as Columbus, where local \nhealth departments offer testing multiple days per week, those departments are not prepared \nto absorb PPGOH’s patients.  At least one advises patients that they should “[p]lan to arrive \n20 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 21 of 31  PAGEID #: 21\nearly” because the clinic “may fill up quickly” and “may stop taking patients early if it \nbecomes full.”  Sexual Health Program Information and Services Types, City of Columbus \nPublic Health, https://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/programs/sexual-health/ (last visited \nMay 10, 2016).   Many communities served by PPGOH are classified by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services as Medically Underserved Areas, meaning they \nhave too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty or a high elderly \npopulation. \n78.  Absent the support that until now has been provided by the BCCP, PPGOH \nwill be unable to provide life-saving pap tests, breast exams, colposcopies, and cervical \nscreenings to low-income Ohioans under the BCCP.  Although PPGOH is dedicated to \ncontinuing to provide cancer screenings in the absence of this support, it will no longer be \nable to provide free screenings to those women served by this grant.  PPGOH will work with \npatients to provide screenings on a sliding-fee scale, but for many patients at or below the \npoverty level, any cost renders screenings unaffordable.  \n79.  On April 13, 2016, PPGOH received a letter signed by Director Hodges \ninforming PPGOH that ODH will terminate its agreement to provide services through BCCP \neffective May 22, 2016.  The letter states that ODH is terminating the contract “on the basis \nthat the enactment of R.C. 3701.034 terminates funding.”   \n80.  Very few, if any, other clinics provide similar breast and cervical cancer \nprevention services free of cost.  The existing no-cost and low-cost providers in the regions \nserved by PPGOH are unable to offer same-day and next-day appointments as PPGOH \ncurrently does.  The approximate wait time for the same screening and a local health \ndepartment or FQHC is one to two weeks.  These wait times may become even longer if the \n21 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 22 of 31  PAGEID #: 22\nother providers are forced to absorb PPGOH’s patients.   \n81.  Section 3701.034 will also end PPGOH’s involvement in the Minority \nHIV/AIDS Initiative, which enabled PPGOH to provide 3,600 free, anonymous, and \nconfidential HIV tests throughout Ohio.  Without the $112,845 in funds it annually receives \nunder this program, PPGOH will be forced to terminate its HIV outreach and prevention \nservices and ask patients to pay for HIV tests on a sliding-fee scale in all of the health centers \nin the communities covered by the grant.   \n82.  On April 4, 2016, PPGOH received a letter from Eric Seachrist, a fiscal \nofficer at Summit County Public Health, stating that Summit County will terminate its \ncontract under the HIV Prevention Program effective May 23, 2016 because Summit Country \n“must comply with [Section 3701.034].”   \n83.  On April 20, 2016, PPGOH received a letter from James M. Adams, the \nHealth Commissioner for the Canton City Health Department.  Commissioner Adams writes \nthat “it is with regret” that he has to inform PPGOH that Canton will terminate its agreement \nwith PPGOH to provide services under the HIV Prevention Program as of May 20, 2016.  \nThe letter further states that Canton has been “most appreciative” of its collaboration with \nPPGOH.   \n84.  PPGOH’s inability to provide HIV outreach and free testing services will be \nfelt heavily by the communities it serves.  PPGOH is the largest provider of HIV testing and \ntreatment in Cleveland, Akron, and Canton.  In his April 20, 2016 letter, Commissioner \nAdams expressed appreciation that PPGOH had succeeded at encouraging testing among \npopulations that “otherwise have nowhere else to go to get tested for HIV.”   \n85.  Other local health care providers likely do not have the infrastructure to \n22 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 23 of 31  PAGEID #: 23\nabsorb PPGOH’s patients, and, upon information and belief, ODH has not developed a \ncontingency plan to care for patients who cannot afford testing and treatment.  The effect on \nthe community is potentially catastrophic.  When individuals are not made aware of ways to \nprotect themselves, HIV spreads rapidly and may become a public health crisis.  This is \nespecially true in economically disadvantaged and rural areas, where drug cultures tend to \nthrive and individuals are unable or unwilling to drive significant distances to get tested. \n86.  Without funding from the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, PPGOH will have to \nlay off four full-time employees.   \n87.  Under Section 3701.034, PPGOH will lose approximately $350,000 annually \nin grant money under the Healthy Moms Healthy Babies program.  Because there is no other \ngrant money available to PPGOH to carry out services under this program, PPGOH will be \nforced to terminate the Healthy Moms Healthy Babies program entirely.   \n88.  On April 19, 2016, PPGOH received a letter signed by Patricia M. Sweeney, \nHealth Commissioner of the Mahoning County District Board of Health, informing PPGOH \nthat the board will terminate its contract with PPGOH to provide services under the Healthy \nMoms Healthy Babies program effective May 23, 2016 as “require[d]” by Section 3701.034.  \nThe letter also states that the board is “sorry that this had to happen and thank[s] you for the \nservice you have provided over the years.”   \n89.  On April 22, 2016, PPGOH received a letter signed by Frank Migliozzi, \nHealth Commissioner of the Trumbell County Combined Health District.  The letter states \nthat Trumbell County “must” terminate its contract with PPGOH as of May 20, 2016 in \naccordance with Section 3701.034.   \n90.  These cuts will deprive 245 expectant and new mothers every year from \n23 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 24 of 31  PAGEID #: 24\nPPGOH’s expertise in providing critical health and parenting education and other vital \nassistance. \n91.  PPGOH will likely also have to lay off the six staff members dedicated to the \nHealthy Moms Healthy Babies program. \n92.  Finally, Section 3701.034 will eliminate $208,265 in funding under the PREP \nprogram, depriving at-risk young Ohioans of PPGOH’s expertise in training of professionals \nin juvenile justice and foster care settings to work with youth regarding teen pregnancy, \nadulthood preparation, and healthy relationships.   \n93.  On April 4, 2016, PPGOH received a letter signed by Eric Seachrist of \nSummit County Public Health informing PPGOH that Summit County will terminate \nPPGOH’s services under the PREP program beginning May 23, 2013 “pursuant to [House \nBill 294].”   \n94.  On April 13, 2016, PPGOH received a letter signed by Director Hodges, \ninforming PPGOH that ODH will cease funding PPGOH under the PREP program as of May \n22, 2016.  The letter states that ODH is terminating the funds as required by Section \n3701.034.  \n95.  PPGOH also received notification dated April 27, 2016 from the Cuyahoga \nCounty Board of Health, terminating its PREP funding effective May 20, 2016. \n96.  There is no other provider in the areas served by PPGOH with the same \nexpertise and experience in teen-pregnancy and health-relationships curricula.   \n97.  As the funding at issue here amounts to 55 percent of PPGOH’s education \nbudget, Section 3701.034 will also threaten the employment of PPGOH’s community health \neducators. \n24 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 25 of 31  PAGEID #: 25\nB.  Impact on PPSWO and The Communities It Serves \n98.  PPSWO will likewise no longer be able to offer important health and \neducation services if Section 3701.34 is implemented.  If Section 3701.034 takes effect, \nPPSWO will no longer be able to provide approximately 3,970 STD tests (at a value of \n$31,000) and 1,150 free prescriptions to its patients (at a value of $18,500) through the STD \nPrevention Program.  Given that approximately 75 percent of PPSWO’s patients are low-\nincome—and thus cannot afford even heavily subsidized testing and prescriptions—the law \nwill force PPSWO to turn away patients who need care because it is unable to absorb the \ncosts of providing this free testing and treatment.  Although the availability of public and \nprivate health centers varies throughout southwestern Ohio, it is unlikely that other providers \nare prepared to provide health care and educational services comparable to those provided by \nPPSWO. \n99.  On April 13, 2016, PPSWO received letters signed by Director Hodges, \ninforming PPSWO that ODH will terminate funding for the STD Prevention Program \neffective May 22, 2016.  The letters explain that Section 3701.034 prohibits ODH from \nproviding funds to an entity that performs or promotes “nontherapeutic” abortions.   \n100.  Section 3701.034 will also result in the termination of PPSWO’s BCCP \nfunding.  As a result, PPSWO will be forced to reduce the number of life-saving pap tests, \nbreast exams, colposcopies, and cervical screenings it is able to provide free of charge to \nlow-income women who are ineligible for Medicaid.   \n101.  PPSWO will also lose funds for HIV testing, particularly men who have sex \nwith men and other people with risk factors for HIV.  Funds under the HIV Prevention \nProject currently allow PPSWO to carry out 1,600 HIV tests each year as well as education \n25 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 26 of 31  PAGEID #: 26\nand referrals for patients with positive results to care and case management.  Without those \nfunds, PPSWO will be unable to continue this critical program with at-risk populations with \nwhich it has built trust and rapport.  PPSWO has also had to lay off four staff members \ndedicated to the HIV Prevention Program. \n102.  On February 23, 2016, Timothy Ingram, Health Commissioner of Hamilton \nCounty Public Health, sent a letter to PPSWO stating that Hamilton County was terminating \nits contract with PPSWO for HIV testing and risk counseling services effective March 31, \n2016.  That letter stated that Hamilton County was terminating PPSWO’s contract because \nSection 3701.034 “prohibit[s] any Ohio government agency to contract with any organization \nwith similar functions like Planned Parenthood.”   \n103.  On April 18, 2016, Janine Howard, Director of Disease Prevention for Public \nHealth—Dayton & Montgomery County, sent a letter to PPSWO stating that Dayton & \nMontgomery County was terminating its contract with PPSWO to provide services \nsupporting the Ohio HIV Prevention Statewide Initiative effective May 23, 2016.  That letter \nstates that Dayton & Montgomery County are terminating PPSWO’s contract because \n“[p]ursuant to [Section 3701.034], ODH must ensure that state funds received by ODH and \ncertain federal funds are not used … to contract or affiliate with any entity that performs or \npromotes nontherapeutic abortions” and that “ODH subrecipients[] and contracts must \ncomply with this law.”    \n104.  By ending PPSWO’s eligibility for PREP funds, Section 3701.034 will also \nstrip PPSWO of $291,000 per year.  As a result, PPSWO will no longer be able to train \njuvenile-justice and foster-care staff members, and hundreds of staff members and more than \n1,000 at-risk youth will be deprived of PPSWO’s expertise in topics such as healthy \n26 \n  \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-00539-MRB Doc #: 1 Filed: 05/11/16 Page: 27 of 31  PAGEID #: 27\nrelationships, avoidance of unwanted sex, contraception, and financial and workforce \nliteracy.   \n105.  On April 13, 2016, PPSWO received a letter signed by Director Hodges \ninforming PPSWO that Section 3701.034 “effectively terminates” PPSWO’s eligibility for \nPREP funds.  The letter further explains that ODH will no longer provide PPSWO with \nPREP funding as of May 22, 2016.   \n106.  PPSWO will also lose the $65,000 it receives under the VAWA program \nannually, effectively ending its successful program designed to teach students about healthy \nrelationships and prevent violence, and thereby depriving approximately 700 students per \nyear of PPSWO’s expertise in teaching about healthy relationships and violence prevention.   \n107.  PPSWO has already been forced to lay off one staff member because of the \nuncertainty faced in connection with receipt of VAWA and PREP funds, and PPSWO will \nlikely have to lay off another staff member if it loses the VAWA grant entirely. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCLAIM I – FIRST AMENDMENT \n \n108.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 107 above. \n \n109.  Section 3701.034 violates the First Amendment by denying state and federal \nfunds to PPGOH and PPSWO because of—and in retaliation for—their constitutionally-\nprotected advocacy for abortion rights and affiliation with other organizations that also \nadvocate for abortion rights and/or provide abortion services. \nCLAIM II – DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n \n110.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 107 above. \n \n111.

Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 107 above. \n \n113.  Section 3701.034 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment by singling out abortion providers and those who “promote” abortions, including \nPPGOH and PPSWO, for unfavorable treatment without a constitutionally sufficient \njustification. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court: \n \nA.

Judge Michael R. Barrett \n \nRichard Hodges, et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n  OPINION & ORDER  \n \n  This matter is before the Court upon Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n(Doc. 7); and Motions for Judgment on the Merits and a Permanent Injunction (Docs. \n38, 47).  These motions have been fully briefed (Docs. 49, 53, 55); and on August 2, \n2016, the Court held a hearing on the motions (Doc. 57).   \n  For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. \n7); and Motions for Judgment on the Merits and a Permanent Injunction (Docs. 38, 47) \nare GRANTED.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs  Planned  Parenthood  of  Greater  Ohio  (“PPGOH”)  and  Planned \nParenthood Southwest Ohio Region (“PPSWO”) filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nclaiming that Ohio Revised Code § 3701.034 violates the First Amendment, as well as \nthe Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nOn  May  23,  2016,  this  Court  temporarily  restrained  the  enforcement  of  Section \n3701.034.  (Doc. 19).  Plaintiffs now seek judgment on the merits and to permanently \n\nenjoin Defendant Richard Hodges, in his official capacity as the Director of the Ohio \nDepartment of Health (“ODH”), from enforcing Section 3701.034. \nSection 3701.034 requires ODH to ensure that the federal funds and materials \nwhich ODH receives and distributes under six specific programs are either “not used to \ndo any of the following” or “not distributed to entities that do any of the following:” \n(1) Perform nontherapeutic abortions; \n \n(2) Promote nontherapeutic abortions; \n \n(3) Contract  with  any  entity  that  performs  or  promotes  nontherapeutic \nabortions; \n \n(4) Become or continue to be an affiliate of any entity that performs or \npromotes nontherapeutic abortions. \n \nOhio Rev. Code § 3701.034(B)-(G).  Under the statute, “promote” means “to advocate \nfor, assist with, encourage, or popularize through advertising or publicity.”  Ohio Rev. \nCode § 3701.034(A)(8). \nPlaintiffs operate twenty-eight health centers in Ohio. (Doc. 40-1, Iris E. Harvey \n1st Decl. ¶ 9; Doc. 40-2, Jerry Lawson 1st Decl. ¶ 8).  At three of the health centers, \nPlaintiffs provide abortion services.  (Harvey 1st Decl. ¶ 13; Lawson 1st Decl. ¶ 12).  \nPlaintiffs also advocate for a woman’s right to abortion.  (Harvey 1st Decl. ¶ 15; Lawson \n1st Decl. ¶ 14).  In addition, Plaintiffs are affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica, Inc., which advocates for a woman’s access to comprehensive reproductive \nhealth care, including abortion.  (Harvey 1st Decl. ¶ 16; Lawson 1st Decl. ¶ 15).   There \nis no dispute that Section 3701.034 applies to Plaintiffs.    \nFor  a  number  of  years,  Plaintiffs  have  received  federal  funds  and  materials \ndistributed  by  ODH  and  Ohio  county  health  departments  under  the  six  health  and \n2 \n \n\neducation  programs  which  are  covered  by  Section  3701.034:  (1)  STD  Prevention \nProgram (federal program which subsidizes diagnostic tests and treatments for certain \nsexually  transmitted  diseases);  (2)  Minority  HIV/AIDS  Initiative  (federal  program \ndesigned  to  provide  HIV  testing  and  education  for  communities  that  are \ndisproportionately  affected  by  HIV);  (3)  Personal  Responsibility  Education  Program \n(federal  program  designed  to  educate  young  people  about  abstinence  and \ncontraception, with the goal of reducing teen pregnancy and STD rates); (4) Breast and \nCervical  Cancer  Prevention  Program  (federal  program  which  subsidizes  cancer \nscreening and follow-up services for low-income and minority women); (5) Ohio Infant \nMortality  Reduction  Initiative  (federally-funded  neighborhood  outreach  and  care \ncoordination program which assists pregnant, at-risk African-American women and their \nfamilies);  (6)  Violence  Against  Women  Act  Sexual  Violence  Prevention  Program \n(federally-funded  program  which  aims  to  reduce  sexual  violence  through  primary \nprevention and education).  (Harvey 1st Decl. ¶¶ 12, 28, 32, 47; Lawson 1st Decl. ¶¶ \n11, 26, 35, 40).   \nIn many instances, Plaintiffs were chosen over other entities to receive these \nfunds and materials as part of a competitive grant process.  (Harvey 1st Decl. ¶ 12; \nLawson 1st Decl. ¶ 11).  Plaintiffs have also passed all state and local audits and \nprogram reviews.   (Harvey 1st Decl. ¶ 12; Lawson 1st Decl. ¶ 11).  However, after the \npassage of Section 3701.034, Plaintiffs received letters from ODH and local health \ndepartments which stated that their current contracts under the impacted programs \nwould be terminated.  (Harvey 1st Decl., Exs. A-J; Lawson 1st Decl. Exs. A-G).   \n  In  their  Complaint,  Plaintiffs  claim  that  Section  3701.034  is  unconstitutional \n3 \n \n\nbecause as a condition of receiving government funds, recipients must abandon their \nright to engage in free speech and association protected by the First Amendment and \ntheir right to provide abortion services protected by the Due Process Clause.  Plaintiffs \nalso claim that Section 3701.034 violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating \nagainst entities, such as Plaintiffs, who engage in this constitutionally protected activity.  \nII.  ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65: “Before or after beginning the hearing \non a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits \nand consolidate it with the hearing.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2).  At the hearing on August \n2, 2016, the parties agreed that Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunctive relief should \nbe consolidated with a final resolution on the merits of Plaintiffs’ request for permanent \ninjunctive relief.  The parties also agreed that the Court can determine the propriety of \nPlaintiffs' requested permanent injunction solely on the basis of the record before the \nCourt and the evidence presented in conjunction with the preliminary injunction hearing. \n“A party is entitled to a permanent injunction if it can establish that it suffered a \nconstitutional violation and will suffer continuing irreparable injury for which there is no \nadequate remedy at law.”  Lee v. City of Columbus, Ohio, 636 F.3d 245, 249 (6th Cir. \n2011) (quoting Wedgewood Ltd. P'ship I v. Twp. of Liberty, Ohio, 610 F.3d 340, 349 (6th \nCir. 2010)).  However, “[i]njunctive relief involving matters subject to state regulation \nmay be no broader than necessary to remedy the constitutional violation.”  Kallstrom v. \nCity of Columbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1069 (6th Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). \n \n4 \n \n\nB. First Amendment: Freedom of Speech and Association \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  under  the  unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine,  Section \n3701.034  violates  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment  rights  of  freedom  of  speech  and \nassociation. \nThe First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \nthe freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” U.S. \nConst. amend. I; Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138 (1925).  \n“The First Amendment extends beyond the right to speak to encompass the ‘right of \nexpressive association,’ i.e., the ‘right to associate for the purpose of speaking.’”  Miller \nv. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, 537 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Rumsfeld v. Forum for \nAcademic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 68, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 \n(2006)).1   \nHowever,  before  any  further  discussion  of  the  First  Amendment  or  the \nunconstitutional  conditions  doctrine,  the  Court  must  address  Defendant’s  two-part \nargument  that  it  is  unnecessary  for  the  Court  to  rule  on  Plaintiffs’  speech  and \nassociation claims.   \n  First, Defendant argues that in enacting Section 3701.034, Ohio’s legislature \nmade a policy choice regarding public funding of nontherapeutic abortions, and that \npolicy choice should stand.  Defendant is correct that state legislatures have “wide \nlatitude in choosing among competing demands for limited public funds.”  Maher v. Roe, \n                                                 \n1The parties have not questioned that the speech proscribed by Section 3701.034 \n(“Promot[ing] nontherapeutic abortions”) or the type of association proscribed by Section \n3701.34 (“Becom[ing] or continu[ing] to be an affiliate of any entity that perfoms or promotes \nnontherapeutic abortions”) falls within the protections of the First Amendment. \n5 \n \n\n432 U.S. 464, 479, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 2385, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977).  However, this wide \nlatitude to set spending priorities exists “[s]o long as legislation does not infringe on \nother constitutionally protected rights.”  National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 \nU.S. 569, 588, 118 S. Ct. 2168, 2179, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1998) (citing Regan v. \nTaxation With Representation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 549, 103 S. Ct. 1997, \n2002, 76 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1983)); see also Planned Parenthood of Cent. & N. Ariz. v. \nArizona,  718  F.2d  938,  942-44  (9th  Cir.  1983)  (although  the  state  need  not  fund \nabortions,  the  state  “may  not  unreasonably  interfere  with  the  right  of  Planned \nParenthood to engage in abortion or abortion-related speech activities”)). \nSecond,  Defendant  argues  that  because  Plaintiffs  cannot  show  that  the \nprovisions of Section 3701.034 which regulate conduct are unconstitutional, the doctrine \nof  constitutional  avoidance  precludes  this  Court’s  review  of  Plaintiffs’  speech  and \nassociation claims.  This is a misapplication of the constitutional avoidance doctrine.  As \nthe Supreme Court has explained, the constitutional avoidance doctrine “[i]s a tool for \nchoosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory text, resting on the \nreasonable  presumption  that  Congress  did  not  intend  the  alternative  which  raises \nserious constitutional doubts.”  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381-82, 125 S. Ct. 716, \n724-25, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005) (citing Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 191, 111 S.Ct. \n1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991) and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast \nBuilding & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 \n(1988)).    Defendant  concedes  elsewhere,  in  a  footnote,  that  the  “promoting \nnontherapeutic abortions” provision can be severed from the “providing nontherapeutic \nabortions.”  (Doc. 36, PAGEID # 550) (citing Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting \n6 \n \n\nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 508, 130 S. Ct. 3138, 3161, 177 L. Ed. 2d 706 (2010) \n(“[W]hen confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the \nproblem,  severing  any  problematic  portions  while  leaving  the  remainder  intact.” \n(quotations and citation omitted)).  Therefore, the Court concludes that it is proper to \nrule on Plaintiffs’ speech and association claims. \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  by  categorically  disqualifying  entities  that  promote \nnontherapeutic abortions or affiliate with entities that perform or promote nontherapeutic \nabortions,  Section  3701.034  imposes  unconstitutional  conditions  on  those  entities’ \nspeech and association rights. \nUnder the “modern ‘unconstitutional conditions’ doctrine  . . . the government \n‘may  not  deny  a  benefit  to  a  person  on  a  basis  that  infringes  his  constitutionally \nprotected . . . freedom of speech’ even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.”  Bd. of \nCnty. Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996).  \nThe Supreme Court has explained that: \nFor at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though \na  person  has  no  ‘right’  to  a  valuable  governmental  benefit  and  even \nthough  the  government  may  deny  him  the  benefit  for  any  number  of \nreasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not \nrely.  It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his \nconstitutionally protected interests—especially, his interest in freedom of \nspeech.  For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because \nof his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of \nthose freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would \nallow the government to ‘produce a result which (it) could not command \ndirectly.’ Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 \nL.Ed.2d  1460.    Such  interference  with  constitutional  rights  is \nimpermissible. \n \nPerry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 2697, 33 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1972); \nsee also Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 133 S. Ct. 2586, 2598, 186 L. Ed. \n7 \n \n\n2d  697  (2013)  (“A  predicate  for  any  unconstitutional  conditions  claim  is  that  the \ngovernment could not have constitutionally ordered the person asserting the claim to do \nwhat it attempted to pressure that person into doing.”) (citing Rumsfeld v. Forum for \nAcad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59-60, 126 S. Ct. 1297, 1307, 164 L. Ed. \n2d 156 (2006)).   \nThere is no dispute that, in this instance, Ohio could not have constitutionally \nlegislated a direct ban on either promoting nontherapeutic abortions or affiliating with an \nentity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions.  Such a ban on Plaintiffs’  \nspeech  or  association  would  have  been  a  violation  of  the  First  Amendment.    See \nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S. Ct. \n2510, 2516, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995) (“When the government targets not subject \nmatter, but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First \nAmendment is all the more blatant.”) (citing R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391, 112 \nS.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992)). \nHowever,  Defendant, citing  Maher  v.  Roe, 432  U.S. 464,  97 S.Ct.  237, 653 \nL.Ed.2d 484 (1977), argues that Ohio could refuse to directly fund abortion services, \nand therefore it necessarily follows that Ohio can refuse to provide funding to abortion \nproviders for separate services which are not related to abortion.   \nDefendant is correct that Maher made it clear that states are free to “make a \nvalue judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and . . . implement that judgment by \nthe allocation of public funds.”  Maher, 432 U.S. at 474.  As a result, for a long time, \nOhio has had legislation in place which bars the use of public funds to directly fund \nabortion  services.    See,  e.g.,  Ohio  Rev.  Code  §  5101.56  (providing  that  “[u]nless \n8 \n \n\nrequired by the United States Constitution or by federal statute, regulation, or decisions \nof federal courts, state or local funds may not be used for payment or reimbursement for \nabortion services” unless certain circumstances apply).  Whether Ohio can refuse to \nprovide funding for non-abortion services to abortion providers is a different question, \nand is one which requires the application of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.   \nIn Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 197, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), \nthe  Supreme  Court  explained  that  “our  ‘unconstitutional  conditions'  cases  involve \nsituations  in  which  the  Government  has  placed  a  condition  on the  recipient  of  the \nsubsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the \nrecipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally \nfunded program.”   \nApplying  the  unconstitutional  conditions doctrine  in  Rust,  the  Supreme  Court \nupheld regulations promulgated under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, which \nprovides federal funding for family-planning services and authorizes the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to “make grants to and enter into contracts with public or \nnonprofit private entities to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family \nplanning projects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family \nplanning  methods  and  services.”    Id.  at  178  (quoting  42  U.S.C.  §  300(a)).    The \nregulations prohibited these Title X funds from being used “in programs where abortion \nis a method of family planning.”  Id. at 178.   \nThe Supreme Court explained this restriction on the subsidization of abortion-\nrelated speech contained in the regulations was permissible:   \nTitle X expressly distinguishes between a Title X grantee and a Title X \nproject.  The grantee, which normally is a health care organization, may \n9 \n \n\nreceive funds from a variety of sources for a variety of purposes.  The \ngrantee  receives  Title  X  funds,  however,  for  the  specific  and  limited \npurpose of establishing and operating a Title X project.  The regulations \ngovern the scope of the Title X project's activities and leave the grantee \nunfettered  in  its  other  activities.    The  Title  X  grantee  can  continue  to \nprovide abortion related services, and engage in abortion advocacy; it \nsimply is required to conduct those activities through programs that are \nseparate and independent from the project that receives Title X funds. \n \nId. at 196 (emphasis in original).  The Supreme Court concluded: \nBy requiring that the Title X grantee engage in abortion-related activity \nseparately from activity receiving federal funding, Congress has . . . not \ndenied it the right to engage in abortion-related activities.  Congress has \nmerely  refused  to  fund  such  activities  out  of  the  public  fisc,  and  the \nSecretary has simply required a certain degree of separation from the Title \nX project in order to ensure the integrity of the federally funded program. \n \nId. at 198. \n \nIn  support  of  its  position  that  Section  3701.034  does  not  create  an \nunconstitutional  condition,  Defendant  relies  on  Planned  Parenthood  Association  of \nHidalgo County Texas, Inc. v. Suehs, 692 F.3d 343 (5th Cir. 2012).  At issue in Suehs \nwas  a  program  created  by  the  Texas  Legislature,  the  Women’s  Health  Program \n(“WHP”),  which  was  designed  to  “expand access  to  preventative  health and family \nplanning services for women.”  Id. at 346.  The WHP denied funding to entities that \nperformed or promoted elective abortions.  Id. at 347.   \nDefendant  points  out  that  even  though  Texas’s  funding  condition  applied  to \nprogram  participants, rather  than  just  program activities,  the  Fifth  Circuit  found  the \nfunding restriction was proper.  However, there are key differences between Section \n3701.034 and the WHP, as the Fifth’s Circuit explanation of its holding illustrates: \nTexas's restriction on promoting elective abortions directly regulates the \ncontent of the WHP as a state program.  The policy expressed in the WHP \nis for public funds to subsidize non-abortion family planning speech to the \nexclusion of abortion speech.  § 1.19(b), 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws at 335. \n10 \n \n\nTexas's authority to promote that policy would be meaningless if it were \nforced  to  enlist  organizations  as  health  care  providers  and  message-\nbearers that were also abortion advocates.  The authority of Texas to \ndisfavor abortion within its own subsidized program is not violative of the \nFirst Amendment right, as interpreted by Rust v. Sullivan.  Consequently, \nTexas's choice to disfavor abortion does not unconstitutionally penalize \nthe appellees' speech. \n \nId. at 350.  In contrast, Section 3701.034 is not a direct regulation of the content of a \nstate program.  Instead, Section 3701.034 places the speech-based funding condition \non the recipient of the funds for activities conducted outside the six programs impacted \nby  Section  3701.034.    As  a  result,  Section  3701.034  does  not  “leave  the  grantee \nunfettered in its other activities.”  Rust, 500 U.S. at 196.  Moreover, Section 3701.034 \nlacks  the  policy  which  was  specifically  expressed  in  the  WHP.    Stated  differently, \nSection 3701.034 is silent regarding the use of public funds to subsidize non-abortion \nfamily planning speech to the exclusion of abortion speech.  As such, there is “no \nprogrammatic message of the kind recognized in Rust and which sufficed there to allow \nthe Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its legitimate objectives.”  \nLegal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 548, 121 S. Ct. 1043, 1052, 149 L. Ed. \n2d 63 (2001). \n  Next,  Defendant  argues  that  Section  3701.034  does  not  result  in  an \nunconstitutional  burden  on  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment  rights  because  it  does  not \ncompel any speech.  However, that is not the relevant distinction.  The Supreme Court \nhas explained that an unconstitutional condition is not limited to those situations where \nthe condition is not relevant to the objectives of the program, or “when the condition is \nactually coercive, in the sense of an offer that cannot be refused.”  Agency for Int'l Dev. \nv. Alliance for Open Soc'y Int'l, 133 S.Ct. 2321, 2328, 186 L.Ed.2d 398 (2013).  Instead, \n11 \n \n\n“the  relevant  distinction  .  .  .  is  between  conditions  that  define  the  limits  of  the \ngovernment spending program—those that specify the activities [the legislature] wants \nto subsidize—and conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside \nthe contours of the program itself.”  Id.   \nHere, the conditions imposed by Section 3701.034 seek to leverage funding to \nregulate  speech  outside  the  contours  of  the  six  programs  impacted  by  Section \n3701.034.  There is no dispute that these six programs subsidize tests and treatment for \nSTDs, cancer screenings for women, HIV testing and education, measures to reduce \ninfant mortality, education for teens regarding abstinence and contraception, and the \nprevention of sexual violence.  There is nothing within the scope of these programs \nrelated to performing abortions, promoting abortions or affiliating with an entity that \nperforms  or  promotes  abortions.    Therefore,  under  the  unconstitutional  conditions \ndoctrine, Section 3701.034 cannot condition funding for these programs based on a \nrecipient’s exercise of the right to free speech or association outside of these programs.  \nAccord Planned Parenthood of Mid–Mo. & E. Kan., Inc. v. Dempsey, 167 F.3d 458, 462 \n(8th Cir. 1999) (“Legislation that simply dictates the proper scope of government-funded \nprograms is constitutional, while legislation that restricts protected grantee activities \noutside government programs is unconstitutional”); Hill v. Kemp, 645 F. Supp. 2d 992, \n1002 (N.D. Okla. 2009) (“The State is free to fund adoption services to exclusion of any \nabortion-related services, but it may not deny [the plaintiff] funding conditioned upon \n[the plaintiff’s] waiver of its right to engage in protected speech activity with its private \nfunds.”). \nFinally, taking somewhat of a different tact, Defendant calls attention to the fact \n12 \n \n\nthat some of the grants impacted by Section 3701.034 require recipients of the grant to \nuse ODH’s curriculum for their training programs.  Defendant explains that because \nOhio has developed a particular message which it has approved as a part of these \nprograms, Section 3701.034 avoids confusing this message by eliminating the potential \nthat someone offering a contrary message will be among Ohio’s messengers.  \nDefendant relies on the Supreme Court’s decision in Rosenberger v. Rector & \nVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, which held: “When the government disburses public funds to \nprivate  entities  to  convey  a  governmental  message,  it  may  take  legitimate  and \nappropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the \ngrantee.” 515 U.S. 819, 833, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 2519, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995) (citing \nRust, 500 U.S. at 196-200).  This principle has its origins in Rust v. Sullivan, which is \nconsidered to have been one of the first cases recognizing the government speech \ndoctrine.  See Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 541, 121 S.Ct. 1043, 149 \nL.Ed.2d 63 (2001) (“The Court in Rust did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that \nthe counseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech; \nwhen interpreting the holding in later cases, however, we have explained Rust on this \nunderstanding.”).  However, this principle is not applicable here because as explained \nabove, the programs impacted by Section 3701.034 do not convey any message related \nto abortion.  Therefore, there is no potential that Ohio’s message of favoring childbirth \nover  abortion  will  be  garbled  or  distorted.    Moreover,  the  record  is  devoid  of  any \nevidence  showing  that  in  implementing  these  programs  in  the  past,  Plaintiffs  have \nactually conveyed a message related to abortion.2 \n                                                 \n2\nDefendant only argues as a hypothetical that it is possible for pregnant patients who go \nto Planned Parenthood to receive services under one of the programs impacted by Section \n13 \n \n\nDefendant makes a somewhat related argument that the funding provided by the \nprograms impacted by Section 3701.034 frees up other general funds for Plaintiffs to \nuse for other purposes, such as promoting abortions.  Citing Holder v. Humanitarian \nLaw  Project,  561  U.S.  1,  31,  130  S.  Ct.  2705,  2725,  177  L.  Ed.  2d  355  (2010), \nDefendant explains “[m]oney is fungible” and therefore Plaintiffs’ education programs \nare inextricably intertwined with its abortion business.  Defendant explains further that \nthis confuses Ohio’s message of favoring childbirth over abortion. \nTo begin, the Supreme Court has rejected “the assumption as a general matter” \nthat government funding “will simply supplant private funding, rather than pay for new \nprograms or expand existing ones.”  Agency for Int'l Dev., 133 S. Ct. at 2331; see also \nPlanned Parenthood of Cent. & N. Arizona v. State of Ariz., 718 F.2d 938, 945 (9th Cir. \n1983) (holding as a matter of law, “the freeing-up theory cannot justify withdrawing all \nstate funds from otherwise eligible entities merely because they engage in abortion-\nrelated activities disfavored by the state.”). \nMoreover, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project “concerned the quite different \ncontext of a ban on providing material support to terrorist organizations, where the \nrecord  indicated  that  support  for  those  organizations’  nonviolent  operations  was \nfunneled to support their violent activities.”  Agency for Int'l Dev., 133 S. Ct. at 2331 \n(citing Holder, 561 U.S. at 29-30).  There is no support in this record that the funds \npreviously provided to Plaintiffs under the programs impacted by Section 3701.034 were \n                                                                                                                                                             \n3701.034 could receive “options counseling,” which could include discussing abortion as an \noption.  However, as Plaintiffs point out, all providers who receive Title X funding are required to \nprovide  “options  counseling.”    This  counseling  must  be  “neutral,  factual  information  and \nnondirective counseling on each of the options” available to pregnant woman.  42 U.S.C. § \n59.5(a)(5)(ii).  Plaintiffs also point out that Defendant has identified the Cuyahoga County Board \nof Health and Belmont County General Health as eligible providers under Section 3701.034, yet \nthose two entities also receive Title X funds and are required to provide “options counseling.” \n14 \n \n\nfunneled to support Plaintiffs in the promotion of abortion or performance of abortion \nservices.  To the contrary, the record shows that Plaintiffs maintain measures to ensure \nthat none of the funds received from the state or federal government are used, directly \nor indirectly, to subsidize the promotion of abortion or performance of abortion services. \nTestifying  on  behalf  of  PPGOH  as  a  witness  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure  30(b)(6),  Barbara  Singhaus,  PPGOH’s  chief  operating  officer  and  chief \nfinancial officer, was asked, “[h]ow do you know that none of the funds received from \nthe programs identified in the law that's challenged here contribute directly or indirectly \nto the performance or promotion or abortion?”  (Doc. 40-15, PAGEID #1500).  Singhaus \nresponded: \nWe have a very sophisticated cost allocation methodology that is audited \nand reviewed by our independent auditors and by the Title 10 reviewers.  \nWe allocate every single one of our costs to between our health centers \nand isolating the surgical centers, including all of our administrative costs \nand our medical director's costs, so those funds and the costs associated \nwith those are allocated very carefully. \n \n(Id., PAGEID # 1500-1501).  When asked whether it is “fair to say then that none of the \nfunds that have been provided to PPGOH through these programs are relied on by \nPPGOH  to  provide  abortion  services,”  Singhuas  responded,  “Yes.”    (Id.,  PAGEID \n#1501). \nSimilarly,  testifying  on  behalf  of  PPSWO  as  a  Rule  30(b)(6)  witness,  Jerry \nLawson, PPSWO’s president and chief executive officer, explained:  \nWe have very scrupulous financial accounting methods to make sure that \nrevenue  and  expenses  are  properly  coded  to  the  service  that's  being \nprovided, whether it's surgery or whether it's something else.  We have \ndifferent managers, so the surgery manager does not manage elsewhere. \n \n(Doc. 40-16, PAGEID # 1729). \n15 \n \n\nDefendant  points  out  that until  April  2016,  PPSWO  offered free  STD  testing \nunder  the  STD  Prevention  Program  at  the  surgical  center  for  patients  receiving \nabortions.  (See Doc. 40-16, PAGEID # 1724-1725).  However, Defendant does not \nexplain how offering this test at the surgical center garbles or distorts Ohio’s message.  \nThe  STD  testing  is  not  related  to  the  abortion  services,  nor  is  it  a  precursor  to  a \ndiscussion about abortion services.  Instead, it is a medically separate service, which \nPlaintiffs  code  and  allocate  to  ensure  the  funding  is  also  separate  from  Plaintiffs’ \nabortion services.  In addressing the same argument in support of similar legislation, \none district court explained: \nTo be sure, Rust upheld a requirement for adequate separation of abortion \nand non-abortion-related services.  But that makes no difference here. \nThe  defunding  provision  does  not  impose  a  requirement  for  adequate \nseparation.  Instead, the provision flatly defunds abortion providers, no \nmatter how thoroughly they separate abortion and non-abortion-related \nservices.  And while, without adequate separation, one might reasonably \nfear that money paid for a recipient's non-abortion-related services could \nindirectly support the provision of abortions—money, after all, is fungible—\nthe contention that this defeats the plaintiffs' claim here fails both on the \nfacts and on the law. \n \nPlanned Parenthood of Sw. & Cent. Florida v. Philip, No. 4:16CV321-RH/CAS, 2016 WL \n3556568, at *5 (N.D. Fla. June 30, 2016).  This Court’s conclusion is the same.   \nTherefore,  the  Court  concludes  that  Section  3701.034  violates  the  First \nAmendment.   \nC. Fourteenth Amendment: Due Process \nPlaintiffs argue that Section 3701.034 violates the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment because Ohio cannot require Plaintiffs to cease performing \nnontherapeutic abortions as a condition of funding. \n“The fundamental right to privacy contained in the Due Process Clause of the \n16 \n \n\nFourteenth Amendment includes the right to choose to have an abortion, subject to \ncertain limitations.”  Women's Med. Prof'l Corp. v. Baird, 438 F.3d 595, 602 (6th Cir. \n2006) (citing Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973); \nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 869, 112 S.Ct. 2791, \n120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992)).  Abortion providers have standing to enforce their patients’ \nright to choose to have an abortion under the Due Process Clause.  See Singleton v. \nWulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (concluding that “it generally is appropriate to allow a \nphysician to assert the rights of women patients as against governmental interference \nwith the abortion decision”); Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of \nCincinnati, 822 F.2d 1390, 1396 (6th Cir. 1987) (concluding that Planned Parenthood \nhas  standing  to  assert  the  due  process  rights  of  women  seeking  right  to  have  an \nabortion). \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  Ohio  could  not  pass  a  law  directing  otherwise  qualified \nabortion providers not to perform “nontherapeutic” abortions, and therefore under the \nunconstitutional conditions doctrine, Ohio cannot require abortion providers to abandon \na constitutionally protected activity as a condition of receiving public funds unrelated to \nabortion. \n“[W]hile  the  unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine  has  been  most  consistently \napplied to protect First Amendment rights, it has also been applied by the Supreme \nCourt to other constitutional provisions.”  R.S.W.W., Inc. v. City of Keego Harbor, 397 \nF.3d 427, 434 (6th Cir. 2005); see Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 133 S. \nCt. 2586, 2594, 186 L. Ed. 2d 697 (2013) (“We have said in a variety of contexts that \n‘the  government  may  not  deny  a  benefit  to  a  person  because  he  exercises  a \n17 \n \n\nconstitutional right.’”) (quoting Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 \nU.S. 540, 545, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983)).  Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit \nhas  held  that  “[t]he  doctrine  should  equally  apply  to  prohibit  the  government  from \nconditioning  benefits  on  a  citizen's  agreement  to  surrender  due  process  rights.”  \nR.S.W.W, 397 F.3d at 434 (citing Vance v. Barrett, 345 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir. \n2003)).   \nCiting Rust v. Sullivan, Defendant argues that there is no due process right to \ngovernment subsidies: “‘the Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right \nto governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or \nproperty interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.’”  Rust, \n500 U.S. at 201 (quoting Webster v. Reprod. Health Servs., 492 U.S. 490, 507 (1989)); \nsee also Rust, 500 U.S. at 193 (“A legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of \na fundamental right does not infringe the right.” (quoting Regan, 461 U.S. at 549)).  \nHowever,  this  is  not  in  dispute.    What  is  at  issue  is  whether  Section  3701.034 \nsuppresses the exercise of due process rights “outside the contours” of the six impacted \nprograms.  As one Florida district court has recently explained in addressing a provision \nsimilar to Section 3701.034: \nIf, as the Court said in Rust, Congress can prohibit the use of federal \nfunds for abortion services but cannot restrict a recipient of federal funds \nfrom separately providing abortion services, then the Florida legislature \nlikewise  can  prohibit  the  use  of  state  funds  for  abortion  services  but \ncannot  prohibit  a  recipient  of  state  funds  from  separately  providing \nabortion services.  Rust is fatal to the defunding provision, which was \nenacted  precisely  and  only  for  a  prohibited  purpose:  to  reach  other, \nunrelated activities that are separate from the recipient's abortion services. \nThat this was the only purpose of the defunding provision is clear because \nFlorida law already prohibited the use of state funds for abortions. \n \nPlanned Parenthood of Sw. & Cent. Florida v. Philip, No. 4:16CV321-RH/CAS, 2016 WL \n18 \n \n\n3556568, at *4 (N.D. Fla. June 30, 2016).3   \nSection 3701.034 fares no better under Rust because Section 3701.034 prohibits \nfunding for programs which are not related to abortion services based on a recipient’s \nexercise of due process rights to perform abortion services.  Accord Harris v. McRae, \n448  U.S.  297,  317,  100  S.  Ct.  2671,  65  L.  Ed.  2d  784  (1980)  (“A  substantial \nconstitutional question would arise if Congress had attempted to withhold all Medicaid \nbenefits  from  an  otherwise  eligible  candidate  simply  because  that  candidate  had \nexercised  her  constitutionally  protected  freedom  to  terminate  her  pregnancy  by \nabortion.”).  This Court has already concluded that Section 3701.034 conditions funding \nunder the six impacted programs based on a recipient’s exercise of the right to free \nspeech or association outside the contours of these six programs.  This conclusion is no \ndifferent  when  it  comes  to  a  recipient’s  exercise  of  due  process  rights.    The  six \nprograms impacted by Section 3701.034 subsidize tests and treatment, screenings and \neducation programs which are not related to performing abortions.  Section 3701.034 \ndoes not provide any way for an entity to limit its use of the funding distributed under \nSection 3701.034 to those six programs, while using private funds to perform abortions. \nDefendant maintains that this does not end the analysis.  Defendant relies on  \nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana v. Commissioner of Indiana State Department of Health, \n699 F.3d 962 (7th Cir. 2012), in which the Seventh Circuit upheld an Indiana law which \n                                                 \n3The provision challenged in Planned Parenthood of Sw. & Cent. Florida v. Philip \nprovides that a state agency, local government entity, or Medicaid managed-care plan “may not \nexpend funds for the benefit of, pay funds to, or initiate or renew a contract with an organization \nthat owns, operates, or is affiliated with one or more clinics that are licensed under this chapter \nand perform abortions.”  Florida Statutes § 390.0111(15).  This “defunding provision” was \nsubject to certain exceptions “for contracts entered into before the provision's effective date, \nfunds payable on a fee-for-service basis under the Medicaid statute, and funds paid to clinics \nthat perform abortions only in limited circumstances—circumstances much narrower than \nencompassed by a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.”   2016 WL 3556568, at *1. \n19 \n \n\nprohibited abortion providers from receiving any state contracts and grants, including \nthose involving state-administered federal funds.  Id. at 969.  As part of its analysis, the \nSeventh Circuit explained that under Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. \n833, 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the government may not impose an \n“undue burden” on a woman’s right to have an abortion, which exists “if the challenged \nlaw has the ‘purpose or effect’ of placing ‘a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman \nseeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.’”  Id. at 987 (quoting Casey, 505 \nU.S. at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion)).  The court then explained that under \nRust, a state funding condition can violate the constitutional right to abortion only if the \neffect of the funding condition itself is to place an undue burden on women’s ability to \nchoose to have an abortion.  Id. at 988 (explaining that if “the government's refusal to \nsubsidize abortion does not unduly burden a woman's right to obtain an abortion, then \nIndiana's ban on public funding of abortion providers—even for unrelated services—\ncannot indirectly burden a woman's right to obtain an abortion.”).   \nThis Court has serious doubts as to whether it is proper to import the undue \nburden  analysis  from  Casey,4  into  the  analysis  here,  which  Defendant  has \nacknowledged is “a case about money.”  (Doc. 53, PAGEID #2049).  Alliance for Open \nSoc'y Int'l, Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Int'l Dev., 651 F.3d 218 (2d Cir. 2011), which was \nlater affirmed by the Supreme Court, contains an explanation of the distinction: \nFor constitutional purposes, a federal subsidy program is fundamentally \ndifferent from  “direct state  interference”  with  a particular activity.    See \nMaher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 475, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977).  \n“Constitutional concerns are greatest when the State attempts to impose \n                                                 \n4The Supreme Court recently reiterated this undue burden analysis in Whole Woman's \nHealth v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292, 2309 (2016), as revised (June 27, 2016) (explaining that \nthe rule announced in Casey, “requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on \nabortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.”). \n20 \n \n\nits will by force of law; the State's power to encourage actions deemed to \nbe in the public interest is necessarily far broader.”  Id. at 476, 97 S.Ct. \n2376.  As a result, “the Government may allocate competitive funding \naccording to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation of \nspeech or a criminal penalty at stake.”  Nat'l Endowment for the Arts v. \nFinley, 524 U.S. 569, 587-88, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998).  \nSubsidy conditions, absent special circumstances, “cannot be subject to \nthe  least-  or  less-restrictive  means  mode  of  analysis—which,  like  the \nundue burden test ..., is more appropriate for assessing the government's \ndirect regulation of a fundamental right—when the government creates a \nfederal spending program.”  Brooklyn Legal Servs. v. Legal Servs. Corp., \n462 F.3d 219, 229 (2d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 810, 128 S.Ct. \n44, 169 L.Ed.2d 11 (2007). \n \nAlliance for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Int'l Dev., 651 F.3d 218, 243 (2d \nCir. 2011) (Straub, J. dissenting), aff'd sub nom. Agency for Int'l Dev. v. All. for Open \nSoc'y Int'l, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2321, 186 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2013).5  Because Section 3701.034 \ncreates  a  subsidy  condition,  the  undue  burden  test  from  Casey  is  not  applicable.  \nAccord Planned Parenthood of Sw. & Cent. Florida v. Philip, No. 4:16CV321-RH/CAS, \n2016 WL 3556568, at *6 (N.D. Fla. June 30, 2016) (“Nothing in Whole Woman's Health \nor Casey suggests in any way that those decisions were intended to supplant the wholly \nseparate unconstitutional-conditions doctrine.”). \nTherefore, the Court concludes that Section 3701.034 violates the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   \nD. Equal protection \nPlaintiffs argue that Section 3701.034 violates the Equal Protection Clause by \nsingling out entities that perform or promote abortions and those who affiliate with those \nentities.    However,  because  the  Court  has  concluded  that  the  “performing \n                                                 \n5The Seventh Circuit, at the time it issued its opinion in Planned Parenthood of Indiana v. \nCommissioner of Indiana State Department of Health, did not have the benefit of the Supreme \nCourt’s opinion in Agency for Int'l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc. because it was decided \nalmost a year later. \n21 \n \n\nnontherapeutic”  and  “promoting  nontherapeutic  abortions”  provisions  of  Section \n3701.034 are unconstitutional under the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court need not address Plaintiffs’ claim under the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nE.  Irreparable injury and lack of adequate remedy at law \n“Where the plaintiff establishes a constitutional violation after a trial on the merits, \nthe plaintiff will be entitled to permanent injunctive relief upon showing 1) a continuing \nirreparable injury if the court fails to issue the injunction, and 2) the lack of an adequate \nremedy at law.”  Kallstrom v. City of Columbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1067 (6th Cir. 1998) \n(citing cases). \n“The  loss  of  First  Amendment  freedoms,  even  for  minimal  periods  of  time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 \nS.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); see also Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 809 (6th \nCir. 2001) (citing Deerfield Med. Ctr. v. City of Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th \nCir. 1981) (holding that if the constitutional right of privacy is either threatened or in fact \nbeing impaired, this mandates a finding of irreparable injury). \nPlaintiffs maintain that if Section 3701.034 were to go into effect, they would no \nlonger be unable to offer free of charge some of the services under the programs \nimpacted by Section 3701.034.  (Doc. 40-5, Iris Harvey 3d Decl., ¶ 6, PAGEID # 952) \n(“Without funding from those programs, PPGOH will be constrained in its ability to offer \nfree services, such as screening for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, and breast and \ncervical cancer”).  Plaintiffs maintain that the requirement to pay even a reduced fee will \ndeter patients from seeking these potentially life-saving services.  (Harvey 3d Decl., ¶ 8, \n22 \n \n\nPAGEID # 953).  Plaintiffs would also no longer have access to the juvenile justice and \nfoster care systems to teach teenagers about healthy relationships as part of the PREP \nprogram.  (Harvey 3d Decl., ¶ 7, PAGEID # 953; Doc. 40-6, Jerry Lawson 3d Decl., ¶ 9, \nPAGEID # 959).  Based on this evidence in the record, the Court finds the irreparable \ninjury is continuing and there is a lack of an adequate remedy at law because monetary \ndamages could not compensate Plaintiffs for this injury. \nAccordingly,  the  Court  concludes  that  Plaintiffs  have  established  that  if  the \nenforcement of Section 3701.034 is not permanently enjoined, Plaintiffs will suffer a \ncontinuing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nBased on the on the foregoing, Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment on the merits of \ntheir  First  Amendment  claim  and  Fourteenth  Amendment  Due  Process  claim.  \nAccordingly,  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  (Doc.  7);  and  Motions  for \nJudgment on the Merits and a Permanent Injunction (Docs. 38, 47) are GRANTED.  It is \nhereby ORDERED that: \n1.

This Order is effective upon its entry; and  \n3.  The Clerk is DIRECTED to enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.                              \n                 /s/ Michael R.
