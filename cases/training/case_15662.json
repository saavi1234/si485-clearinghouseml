    "summary": "<p>On May 4, 2016, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri (PPGP), Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region (PPSLR), current and former employees of Planned Parenthood, and Kansas Medicaid patients filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiffs sued the Kansas Department of Health and Environment under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Medicaid Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the defendant from terminating provider-plaintiffs from Kansas Medicaid. </p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that on May 3, 2016, the defendant issued a decision to terminate Planned Parenthood and current and former Planned Parenthood employees from their Kansas Medicaid Provider agreements. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the state made the decision to terminate in response to unfounded and irrelevant allegations made about Planned Parenthood's activities. In particular, the state noted a highly misleading YouTube video created by antichoice activists alleging that Planned Parenthood had sold fetal body parts. </p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that a termination of their Kansas Medicaid provider agreements would irreparably harm Kansas Medicaid patients by denying them access to their health care providers of choice. </p><p>On July 5, 2016, Judge Julie Robinson denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification but granted their motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. The order enjoined the defendant from terminating their Kansas Medicaid Provider agreements. 2016 WL 3597457. </p><p>On August 3, 2016, the defendant appealed the decision to the Tenth Circuit.  On February 21, 2018, a panel of the Tenth Circuit (Circuit Judges Robert E. Bacharach, Gregory A. Phillips, and Carolyn B. McHugh) affirmed the district court’s order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction as to PPGP, thus restraining Kansas from terminating PPGP’s Medicaid provider agreement. The appeals court, however, vacated the district court’s order as to PPSLR, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to meet standing requirements. Since there were no affidavits from any persons receiving or expecting to receive medical care at PPSLR, the plaintiffs had failed to establish any injury they would suffer from the termination of PPSLR. The court remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether PPSLR itself had sufficiently alleged standing to proceed and whether it was entitled to a preliminary injunction. 882 F.3d 1205.</p><p> </p><p>On March 21, 2018, the defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States. On December 10, 2018, the Supreme Court denied the petition; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented from the denial of certiorari. Shortly after cert was denied, the defendants rescinded the terminations of both PPGP and PPSLR from the Kansas Medicaid program. </p><p>The case was remanded to district court. The parties jointly stipulated to dismissal on April 12, 2019, and the civil case was terminated on April 16. The parties continued to litigate attorneys fees. The parties reached an agreement on August 12, 2019 that the defendants would pay $464,366.28 in fees and costs to the plaintiffs. There has been no further action in the docket as of April 2021, and the case is closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On May 4, 2016, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, current and former employees of Planned Parenthood, and Kansas Medicaid patients filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Health and Environment under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Medicaid Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the defendant from terminating provider plaintiffs from Kansas Medicaid. On July 5, 2016, Judge Julie Robinson denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification but granted their motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendant from terminating their Kansas Medicaid Provider agreements. On August 3, 2016, the defendant appealed the decision to the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed the district court's order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction as to Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri. However, the court vacated the district court’s order as to Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to meet standing requirements. On March 21, 2018, the defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States. On December 10, 2018, the Supreme Court denied the petition.

On May 3, 2016, Kansas sent notices of decisions to terminate \n(effective May 10) its Medicaid contracts with two Planned Parenthood affiliates, \nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri (“PPGP”), and Planned Parenthood \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 5 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 3     \nof the St. Louis Region (“PPSLR”).1 The notices cited concerns about the level of \nPPGP’s cooperation in solid-waste inspections, both Providers’ billing practices, and \nan anti-abortion group’s allegations that Planned Parenthood of America (“PPFA”) \nexecutives had been video-recorded negotiating the sale of fetal tissue and body \nparts. Together, the Providers and three individual Jane Does (“the Patients”) \nimmediately sued Susan Mosier, Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and \nEnvironment (“KDHE”), under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(23) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The \nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction enjoining Kansas from terminating the \nProviders from the state’s Medicaid program. \nStates have broad authority to ensure that Medicaid healthcare providers are \nqualified to provide medical services—meaning that they are competent to provide \nmedical services and do so ethically. But this power has limits. States may not \nterminate providers from their Medicaid program for any reason they see fit, \nespecially when that reason is unrelated to the provider’s competence and the quality \nof the healthcare it provides. We join four of five of our sister circuits that have \naddressed this same provision and affirm the district court’s injunction prohibiting \nKansas from terminating its Medicaid contract with PPGP. But we vacate the district \n                                              \n1 Planned Parenthood of Central Oklahoma merged into Planned Parenthood of \nKansas and Mid-Missouri (“PPKM”), effective July 1, 2016. As a result, PPKM \nchanged its name to Planned Parenthood Great Plains. In this opinion, we refer to that \nentity by its new name, PPGP. When we refer to both of these providers collectively, \nwe refer to them as “the Providers.” \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 6 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 4     \ncourt’s injunction as it pertains to PPSLR and remand for further proceedings on that \nissue. Though the Plaintiffs have provided affidavits from three Jane Does \nconcerning their past and expected medical care from PPGP, the Plaintiffs have not \nprovided affidavits from any persons receiving or expecting to receive medical care \nat PPSLR. Hence the Plaintiffs have failed to establish any injury they will suffer \nfrom the termination of PPSLR, meaning they have failed to establish standing to \nchallenge that termination. But on this record, we cannot determine whether PPSLR \nitself can establish standing, an issue the district court declined to decide but now \nmust decide on remand.2 Though Kansas has not raised this standing issue, we have \nan independent duty to assure ourselves of the district court’s subject-matter \njurisdiction. See City of Colo. Springs v. Climax Molybdenum Co., 587 F.3d 1071, \n1078–79 (10th Cir. 2009).  \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Medicaid Act and Kansas Regulations  \n  The Medicaid Act’s free-choice-of-provider provision states that “any \nindividual eligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from any \ninstitution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service \nor services required . . . who undertakes to provide him such services.” 42 U.S.C. \n                                              \n2 Though PPSLR’s standing might not turn on whether it has a private right of \naction under the free-choice-of-provider provision, its likelihood of success on the \nmerits may. See Lexmark Intern., Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S Ct. \n1377, 1386–88 & n.4 (2014); Safe Streets All. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 887 \n(10th Cir. 2017) (discussing footnote 4 of Lexmark and whether “statutory standing” \nafter Lexmark must be understood as a failure to state a claim). \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 7 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 5     \n§ 1396a(a)(23). This provision “guarantees that Medicaid beneficiaries will be able to \nobtain medical care from the qualified and willing medical provider of their choice.” \nPlanned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 862 F.3d 445, 450 (5th Cir. 2017). \nBecause the Medicaid Act is mostly administered by the states, the Act empowers \nstates to determine whether entities are medical providers “qualified to perform the \nservice or services required.” States may exclude Medicaid providers—that is, \nwithhold reimbursements for medical services provided to patients—“for any reason \nfor which the [federal] Secretary [of Health and Human Services] could exclude the \nindividual or entity from participation in a program under” specified statutes. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1); 42 C.F.R. § 1002.3(a)–(b). As grounds for excluding the \nProviders from its Medicaid plan, Kansas has raised 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(5)(B), \n(b)(12)(B).  \nKansas, like all states, issues regulations to administer its Medicaid program. \nThese regulations govern when, why, and how Kansas may terminate contracts \nbetween its Medicaid program and healthcare providers. Kan. Admin. Regs. \n§ 30-5-60(a). If Kansas decides that a provider is no longer competent to provide \nmedical services, it must send written notification to the provider of its intent to \nterminate the provider and its reasons for doing so. Kan. Admin. Regs. § 30-5-60(c). \nThis notification must also inform the provider that it has a right to appear before the \nKDHE between five and fifteen days from the date the notice is mailed or served on \nthe provider. Id.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 8 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 6     \nIf the state decides to terminate the provider, the provider may request a \nhearing from Kansas’s Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) within thirty-\nthree days after receiving notice of termination. Kan. Admin. Regs. §§ 30-7-67–68. \nAccording to Kansas, this decision to terminate “becomes final only after the time for \na formal administrative hearing has passed.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 6 (citing \nKan. Admin. Regs. § 30-7-64–104). If the provider is dissatisfied with the results of \nthis hearing, it may request a rehearing. Id. If, after that, it is still dissatisfied, the \nprovider may appeal to state court. See Kan. Stat. Ann. § 77-601–31. \nII.  Planned Parenthood’s Alleged Wrongdoing \n  Planned Parenthood affiliates, many of which are located in areas with \nshortages of primary-care providers, deliver essential services to Medicaid recipients. \nPPGP has two health centers in Kansas and three in Missouri, and PPSLR has one \nhealth center in Missouri that also serves Kansas Medicaid patients. The Providers’ \nservices include annual health exams; different types of contraception along with \ncontraceptive counseling; breast- and cervical-cancer screening; cervical-cancer \ntreatment; screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; human \npapillomavirus vaccinations; pregnancy testing and counseling; and other health \nservices.3 Though some Planned Parenthood clinics also perform abortions, Medicaid \nseldom pays for abortions. See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 302–03 (1980) \n                                              \n3 Though we only decide that the district court did not abuse its discretion in \nenjoining the termination of PPGP, we state the facts pertaining to both Providers to \nplace our analysis in context. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 9 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 7     \n(explaining that the Hyde Amendment prohibits using federal Medicaid funds to \nreimburse the cost of abortions except in limited circumstances such as rape or \nincest). The Patients chose Planned Parenthood for reproductive-healthcare services \nfor many reasons, including the quality and availability of the services and expertise \nin reproductive healthcare.  \nIn July 2015, the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress (“CMP”) \nreleased on YouTube a series of edited videos purportedly depicting PPFA \nexecutives negotiating with undercover journalists for the sale of fetal tissue and \nbody parts. Kansas alleges that the videos demonstrate that “Planned Parenthood \nmanipulates abortions to harvest organs with the highest market demand” and that \nPPFA executives are willing to negotiate fetal-tissue prices to obtain profits. \nAppellant’s Opening Br. at 7. According to Kansas, this evidence matters because \n“PPFA controls its ‘affiliate’ organizations, including [PPGP] and PPSLR.” Id. \nNeither PPGP nor PPSLR is the subject of the videos and it is undisputed that neither \nparticipates in fetal-tissue donation or sale.  \nTo prove PPFA’s control over and affiliation with the Providers, Kansas \nclaims that (1) “PPFA and its affiliates make no apparent effort to keep their finances \nseparate”; (2) PPFA compiles a yearly “‘combined balance sheet,’” which \n“aggregate[s] ‘revenue and expenses’” for the entire Planned Parenthood \norganization; (3) according to its 2014 tax return, PPFA transferred over $50 million \nto its affiliates; (4) PPFA drafts rules of procedure and operation for its affiliates and \ntrains its affiliates’ officers and employees in “management and medical practices”; \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 10 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 8     \nand (5) PPFA’s legal counsel represented PPGP and PPSLR in their meeting with the \nKDHE. Id. at 7–8 (quoting Appellant’s App. at 479–82).  \nBased on CMP’s videos of the PPFA executives, Kansas began investigating \nthe Providers. In August 2015, Kansas’s Board of Healing Arts (“BOHA”), the \nagency primarily responsible for medical licensure and regulation, requested from \nPPGP copies of “treatment records related to abortion procedures or stillbirths . . . in \nwhich fetal organs or tissues were transferred for any purpose other than those” \npermitted by law. Appellant’s App. at 208–11. On January 7, 2016, the BOHA \ndetermined that, “[a]fter careful review of the investigative materials, . . . no further \naction will be taken at this time.” Id. at 215. \nOn December 16, 2015, Kansas’s Bureau of Waste Management (“BWM”) \nalso initiated a solid-waste investigation under Kan. Admin. Regs. § 28-29-16 of a \nPPGP-operated clinic in Overland Park, Kansas. “[O]ut of concern for clinic and \npatient privacy and safety,” PPGP employees stopped the inspectors from taking \nphotographs but invited the inspectors to finish their inspection visually. Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v. Mosier, No. 16-2284-JAR-GLR, 2016 WL \n3597457, at *5 (D. Kan. July 5, 2016). PPGP employees also refused to turn over \nwaste-disposal-vendor lists—which would have become public information subject to \nthe Kansas Open Records Act had PPGP turned over the lists to the investigators—\nbecause the PPGP employees were concerned about “the history of harassment \ntoward companies that work with Planned Parenthood.” Appellee’s Response Br. at \n6. Kansas claims that the inspectors were thus “[u]nable to complete their \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 11 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 9     \ninspection,” so they left the clinic. Appellant’s Opening Br. at 10–11. Kansas alleges \nthat PPGP’s conduct hindered the investigation, though BWM never cited PPGP for \nany violation related to the investigation.  \nOn January 5, 2016, after counsel for BWM guaranteed the privacy of PPGP’s \npatients, PPGP permitted the inspectors to take photographs on their return visit. The \nBWM inspectors left a report with PPGP’s clinic employees, stating that BWM had \nfound no violations. Later, on January 15, 2016, after PPGP had taken the necessary \nsteps to make its vendor information confidential, PPGP provided BWM the \nrequested waste-vendor information as well. Though Kansas points out that this was \n“an entire month after the first inspection,” id. at 11, in reality, BWM had granted \nPPGP extra time so that PPGP could document its request to keep the information \nconfidential.  \nThough Kansas never investigated PPSLR, the Missouri Attorney General did. \nIn September 2015, after looking into PPSLR’s fetal-tissue practices, the Missouri \nAttorney General’s office announced that it had found no evidence of wrongdoing.  \nRelevant to this appeal, Kansas also notes that “[a]llegations . . . emerged that \nPlanned Parenthood offices around the country have engaged in questionable billing \npractices, including in the nearby states of Oklahoma and Texas.” Id. at 8–9. And it \nclaims that “Planned Parenthood’s practices have prompted numerous lawsuits under \nthe False Claims Act (‘FCA’).” Id. at 9. \nIII.  Termination Proceedings & District Court Case \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 12 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 10     \n  On March 10, 2016, about two months after Kansas’s inspection of one of \nPPGP’s clinics and two months after Kansas Governor Sam Brownback announced \nthat he had “signed legislation stopping most taxpayer funding from going to Planned \nParenthood,” and that “[t]he time had[d] come to finish the job,” Kansas issued \nnotices of intent to terminate PPGP and PPSLR as state Medicaid providers.4 \nGovernor Sam Brownback, 2016 State of the State (Jan. 12, 2016) (transcript \navailable at https://governor.kansas.gov/2016-state-of-the-state-january-12-2016/). \nThose notices informed the Providers that, under Kan. Admin. Regs. § 30-5-60(a), \nKansas “intend[ed] to terminate [their] participation in” Kansas’s state Medicaid \nprogram. Appellant’s App. at 78. Kansas cited the following paragraphs from \n§ 30-5-60(a): “(2) noncompliance with applicable state laws, administrative \nregulations, or program issuances concerning medical providers; (3) noncompliance \nwith the terms of a provider agreement; (9) unethical or unprofessional conduct; and \n(17) other good cause.” Id.  \nThe notices also informed the Providers that they could each challenge their \nproposed terminations in administrative reviews, where they would “have the \nopportunity to present any relevant evidence” regarding their terminations. Id. \nPPGP’s administrative review was scheduled for March 23, 2016, and PPSLR’s was \nscheduled for March 22, 2016. The notices included attachments listing the state’s \nreasons for terminating the Providers—including the CMP videos, PPGP’s supposed \n                                              \n4 Kansas also terminated eleven individual PPGP and PPSLR employees as \nMedicaid providers, but rescinded those terminations on June 13, 2016.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 13 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 11     \nlack of cooperation during the waste disposal inspections, and the FCA allegations in \nneighboring states.  \nTogether, the Providers participated in an administrative review on April 29, \n2016. At this review, the Providers’ counsel presented evidence and argued against \ntermination. But on May 3, 2016, Kansas sent each Provider a “Notice of Decision to \nTerminate,” which provided that “[a]fter thorough review of all information \npresented, . . . your participation in [Kansas’s state Medicaid program] will be \nterminated effective May 10, 2016.” Id. at 51, 53. The notices also informed the \nProviders that, under Kan. Admin. Regs. § 30-7-64, they had the right to “request a \nfair hearing” with the OAH within thirty-three days of the termination notice. Id. \nInstead of requesting a hearing to review the terminations, the Providers, the \nPatients, and eleven individual PPGP and PPSLR employees (whose charges were \nlater dropped after Kansas reconsidered and reversed its decision to terminate them \nfrom its state Medicaid program) sued Kansas under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging \nviolations of the Medicaid Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. The Patients each had their own reasons for choosing PPGP for \nreproductive-health services. Jane Doe #1 chose PPGP as a provider because it was \nthe only provider that would accept her as a patient (because she was not pregnant) \nand schedule an annual appointment for her within a reasonable time. Jane Doe #2 is \na long-time PPGP patient who trusts the provider’s expertise in reproductive health \ncare and relies on the PPGP for regularly administered birth-control shots. Jane Doe \n#3, who was pregnant when the lawsuit was filed, chose PPGP because she \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 14 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 12     \nappreciated the continuity of having one reproductive-health-care provider and \nwanted to obtain birth control after giving birth.  \nThe day after filing their lawsuit, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for  \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. On June 7, 2016, after \nKansas twice continued the hearing date and agreed to extend the effective \ntermination date to July 7, the parties argued the case before the district court. Kansas \nnow argues that extending the termination date from May 10 to July 7 meant that the \nProviders had until August 10 to seek a hearing before the OAH. Kansas also notes \nthat PPGP’s Medicaid contract with the state dictated that the contract would \nterminate thirty days after “notification from the State that the provider’s state fair \nhearing rights have expired or the state fair hearing has been completed related to the \nMedicaid termination.” Id. at 586. To Kansas, this means that “the [termination] \nnotice would have had no effect on [PPGP] until September 10, 2016.” Appellant’s \nOpening Br. at 13. On July 5, the district court granted the Plaintiffs’ request and \nissued a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Mosier, 2016 WL \n3597457, at *26. \nIn granting the Plaintiffs’ request for relief, the district court held that the case \nwas ripe, that the Plaintiffs5 had standing, and that abstention wasn’t necessary under \nYounger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). Id. at *8. On the merits, the district court \n                                              \n5 The district court concluded that the Patients had standing to pursue their \nclaim, so it declined to resolve whether the Providers also independently had \nstanding. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *17. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 15 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 13     \nfound that the Patients had a private right of action and were likely to succeed on \ntheir free-choice-of-provider claim under the Medicaid Act. Id. at *14–*22. \nSpecifically, the court concluded that states could not interfere with patients’ choice \nof providers for reasons other than the providers’ professional competence or fitness \nto provide medical services. Id. at *18. It also found that the Plaintiffs had met the \nother requirements for injunctive relief: that the Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable \nharm absent the requested relief, that the balance of harms favored the Plaintiffs, and \nthat the injunction served the public interest. Id. at *22–*25. The district court \ndeclined to rule on the Equal Protection claim. Id. at *14. Kansas appealed. \nANALYSIS \n  First, we address Kansas’s arguments regarding standing, ripeness, and \nYounger abstention. Then, we move on to address the claim’s merits. Specifically, we \ndecide whether the Patients have a private right of action under the Medicaid Act, \nand whether they have met the requirements necessary to show that they are entitled \nto injunctive relief. \nI.  Justiciability  \n  The United States Constitution empowers federal courts to address “Cases” \nand “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III § 2, cl. 1. The cases-and-controversies \nrequirement manifests in the dual justiciability doctrines of standing and ripeness. \nKansas maintains that the district court erred in concluding that the Plaintiffs had \nstanding and that the case was ripe.  \n  A.  Standing \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 16 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 14     \n  We review de novo a district court’s finding of standing. New Mexico v. Dep’t \nof Interior, 854 F.3d 1207, 1215 (10th Cir. 2017). “The constitutional requirements \nfor standing are (1) an injury in fact, (2) a causal connection between the injury and \nthe challenged act, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.” Id. at 1214–15 (quoting Roe No. 2 v. Ogden, 253 F.3d 1225, \n1228–29 (10th Cir. 2001)). Kansas contends that the Plaintiffs failed to show that \ntheir injury was imminent and fairly traceable to Kansas’s actions. \n1.  Injury in Fact  \nFor standing, a plaintiff’s injury must be “actual or imminent, not conjectural \nor hypothetical.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (quoting \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)). “An allegation of future injury \nmay suffice if the threatened injury is ‘certainly impending,’ or there is a \n‘“substantial risk” that the harm will occur.’” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 \nS. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409, \n414 n.5 (2013)). Kansas argues that the Plaintiffs failed to show injury in fact \nbecause (1) it had issued only a preliminary, not final, decision and (2) the Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries are too speculative.  \nFirst, Kansas claims that only after the Plaintiffs had an administrative hearing \n(which took place on April 29), “may [it] then issue a written preliminary decision, \nsetting forth the effective date of the termination and the basic underlying facts \nsupporting the order.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 6. And Kansas goes on to argue \nthat the “preliminary decision . . . becomes final only after the time for a formal \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 17 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 15     \nadministrative hearing has passed.” Id. (citing Kan. Admin. Regs. §§ 30-7-64–104). \nBut Kansas’s use of the term “preliminary” is without support in the statute. The \nregulations provide that “[i]f the decision is to terminate, a written order of \ntermination shall be issued, setting forth the effective date of the termination and the \nbasic underlying facts supporting the order.” Kan. Admin. Regs. § 30-5-60(c). Thus, \nwe reject Kansas’s argument that its decision was preliminary rather than final. \nSecond, Kansas claims that the Plaintiffs’ injuries are speculative because the \nProviders “refused to complete the administrative process,” so no one can say \nwhether they would have been terminated at all. Appellant’s Opening Br. at 20. This \nargument hinges on Kansas’s characterization of the termination letters and their \neffect. According to Kansas, the notices it sent to the Providers were “far from . . . \nfinal termination[s],” but rather were “effectively . . . complaint[s] that the Providers \ncould formally contest . . . or admit.” Id. at 21. The providers had until August 10 to \nadministratively appeal Kansas’s decision to terminate them from the Medicaid \nprogram—thirty-three days from the termination’s extended effective date of July 7. \nAnd Kansas says that under its contracts with PPGP, it couldn’t cut the Provider’s \nfunding until September 10—thirty days after the expiration of the Providers’ right of \nappeal.6 See Kan. Admin. Regs. § 30-7-68.  \n                                              \n6 PPSLR has no such contracts with Kansas, so this thirty-day delay doesn’t \nprotect PPSLR’s patients. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *24. And the district court \nfound that this additional thirty-day extension for PPGP was questionable. Id. PPGP \nhas contracts with three Managed Care Organizations (“MCO”) in Kansas. Id. at *2. \nKansas submitted a sample MCO contract that included the thirty-day extension, but \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 18 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 16     \n  This argument fails. As did the district court, we read the notices of \ntermination literally. See Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *9. The letters’ plain \nlanguage precludes us from treating them as mere warnings of possible future events. \nThe March 10 letters that Kansas sent to the Providers were titled, “Notice of Intent \nto Terminate,” and the May 3 letters were titled, “Notice of Decision to Terminate.” \nAppellant’s App. at 51, 53, 78, 83 (emphasis added). Also, the second letters were \nfinal because they stated that “it is the decision of [Kansas] that your participation in \n[Kansas’s Medicaid Program] will be terminated,” and that the Providers’ \nterminations would be “effective May 10, 2016.” Id. at 51, 53. This date was \nextended to July 7 only because Kansas requested more time to respond to the \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. Though the Providers’ statutory right to \nappeal the termination may have delayed the date that Kansas cut off the Providers’ \nfunding, Kansas doesn’t explain how that delay would change the legally effective \ndate of the termination.7  \n                                                                                                                                                  \nthe contract in place between Kansas and PPGP when the Plaintiffs sued did not \ncontain the extension, and instead provided for immediate termination.  \n \n7 After the parties had their evidentiary hearing on April 29, Kansas notified \nthe Providers that they would be terminated effective May 10. It told the Providers \nthat if they disagreed with this decision, they had the right to—but did not have to—\nrequest a fair hearing before the OAH within thirty-three days of the date on the \nnotice. That date would have been June 6. So, if the Providers hadn’t filed their \nlawsuit in federal court before May 10, they would have been terminated on May 10, \nsubject to possibly obtaining a reversal of the termination in later proceedings. \nNothing in the termination notice states that the termination would toll if the \nProviders requested a fair hearing before the OAH. Instead, Kansas states without \nsupport that the Providers’ funding would not have terminated on the effective \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 19 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 17     \nIn fact, as the district court noted, Kansas’s “position on the effective date of \ntermination has been a moving target.” Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *8. After the \nProviders’ April administrative hearing, Kansas specifically declined the Plaintiffs’ \nrequest to delay any termination decisions for thirty days from the date of the final \nterminations. Instead, Kansas made the effective termination date May 10, just a \nweek from the date of the final termination letters. Kansas also rejected the district \ncourt’s proposal of a mutually-agreed injunction that would “freeze the status quo” \nuntil September. Id. The first time Kansas argued that the terminations wouldn’t take \neffect until September 10 was on May 31, in its response to the Plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary injunction. And Kansas provided no concrete assurances to support this \nclaim, refusing to draft even a simple statement attesting to the fact that it wouldn’t \ncut off funding until September 10.  \nIn light of such conduct, Kansas’s claim that it wouldn’t cut off funding to the \nProviders until September 10 is unpersuasive. We agree with the district court that \nKansas cannot “have its cake and eat it too” by insisting that the terminations \nwouldn’t be effective until September, yet refusing to agree to delay enforcement by \nguaranteeing that September effective date. Id. at *9. We also agree with the district \n                                                                                                                                                  \ntermination date (May 10). But the Providers’ termination from Kansas’s Medicaid \nProgram would have triggered the loss of Medicaid funding within a few weeks. See \nMosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *8. In fact, Kansas’s regulations state that even if the \nProviders had requested a hearing before the OAH, their Medicaid funding would be \nterminated pending the appeal’s resolution because the request would concern “the \ntermination of a provider from program participation.” Kan. Admin. Regs. \n§ 30-7-66(a)(1). \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 20 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 18     \ncourt’s position that “[t]he fact that [Kansas] is unwilling to put its counsel’s \nrepresentations into a stipulated order that would apply to both providers is entirely \ninconsistent with its position that this dispute is premature.” Id.  \nIn any case, we conclude that the Plaintiffs faced a substantial risk of injury \nfrom the moment Kansas sent its final notices of termination. Although the \ntermination decisions would not have gone into effect until July 7, 2016 (accounting \nfor Kansas’s litigation-related extensions), the state “ha[d] already acted to terminate \n[the Providers’] Medicaid provider agreements; only the effect of [those] \ntermination[s] ha[d] yet to be implemented.” Gee, 862 F.3d at 455. Because the \nPlaintiffs chose not to pursue an administrative appeal, only Kansas’s “unilateral \nreversal” of its terminations could have saved the Plaintiffs from injury, even \naccounting for all of the delays built into the termination process. Mosier, 2016 WL \n3597457, at *11. As Kansas itself states, we must determine standing “as of the time \nthe action is brought.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 22 (quoting Utah Ass’n of Ctys. v. \nBush, 455 F.3d 1094, 1099 (10th Cir. 2006)). And the Patients, in particular, “need \nnot wait to file suit until [the Providers are] forced to close [their] doors to them and \nall other Medicaid beneficiaries.” Gee, 862 F.3d at 455. We do not think a two-month \ndelay—from July 7 to September 10—renders the injuries too distant or speculative \nto confer standing on the Plaintiffs. \n    2.  Causal Connection  \n  Kansas alternatively argues that the Plaintiffs lack standing because their \ninjuries resulted from their own failure to “use available procedures to remedy an \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 21 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 19     \nalleged injury,” rather than Kansas’s actions, and thus are not traceable to Kansas. \nAppellant’s Opening Br. at 23.  \n  Kansas correctly states that a plaintiff cannot show that a defendant caused its \ninjuries if the plaintiff’s injuries resulted from its own acts or failures to act. See \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 415 (concluding that plaintiffs challenging a surveillance statute \ncouldn’t show standing based on actions they took to protect themselves against \nhypothetical governmental surveillance). To support its argument that the Plaintiffs \ncaused their own injuries, Kansas relies on National Family Planning & \nReproductive Health, Inc. v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 826, 828 (D.C. Cir. 2006). There, \nthe D.C. Circuit held that a plaintiff-association lacked standing to challenge an anti-\ndiscrimination law for vagueness—the association argued that it couldn’t comply \nwith both the new law and existing regulations because they conflicted—in part \nbecause the association could have cured its uncertainty by asking the federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) for clarification. Id. at 831. \nKansas claims that, like the association in Gonzales, the Plaintiffs here could have \navoided injury by pursuing and completing the administrative-appeal process.  \n  But the Plaintiffs’ dilemma is dissimilar from that in Gonzales. In Gonzales, \nHHS could have prevented the plaintiff-association from suffering any injury by \nexplaining how it would implement the new law harmoniously with the existing \nregulations. Id. Here, Kansas had set a termination date for the Providers’ Medicaid \ncontracts, even if they could have opted to pursue an administrative appeal. But \nnothing in the record suggests that the appeal itself would have tolled the \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 22 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 20     \nterminations, and the regulations contradict that position.8 See Kan. Admin. Regs. \n§ 30-7-66(a)(1). This means that, absent injunctive relief, Kansas would have stopped \nfunding the Providers within two months. The Plaintiffs could have avoided injury \nonly by pursuing their administrative appeal and winning, and nothing required them \nto exercise that right to appeal. But even if the Plaintiffs had appealed the \ntermination, Kansas had refused to stipulate that it would continue funding the \nProviders until September. And, unlike the Providers, the Patients had no \nadministrative remedies available, and therefore no exhaustion requirements to \nsatisfy. See Gee, 862 F.3d at 455. Therefore, Gonzales is inapposite.  \nWe agree with the district court’s decision not to “impose an indirect \nexhaustion requirement by finding that Plaintiffs caused their own injury by failing to \npursue administrative remedies.” Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *12. The Plaintiffs \nmet their burden of showing that Kansas’s actions created a substantial risk of injury, \nso they had standing to sue the state. \n                                              \n8 The termination letters provided an effective date of May 10 (later extended \nto July 7), and advised the Providers that to contest the termination, they could \nrequest a fair hearing before the OAH within thirty-three days of the notice. Thus, the \nletters say that absent appeal, the terminations would be effective even before the \nProviders’ time in which to appeal had expired. So, under the state administrative-\nappeals system, the Providers couldn’t avoid being terminated for at least some \nperiod of time, even if they succeeded in their appeal and the state ultimately \nreversed the terminations.  \nAnd again, though Kansas insisted the termination wouldn’t take effect until \nSeptember 10, meaning the Providers wouldn’t lose funding until that date, it refused \nto extend the effective termination date itself to September. In doing so, the state \ncreated confusion around what effect the termination, slated to occur on July 7, \nwould have had on the Providers and the Patients. \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 23 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 21     \n   B.  Ripeness \n  Kansas next argues that this case is not ripe for adjudication because the \nPlaintiffs didn’t complete the administrative-appeal process. Ripeness is a \nprerequisite to justiciability with both constitutional and jurisdictional components. \nSee United States v. Bennett, 823 F.3d 1316, 1325 (10th Cir. 2016). We review de \nnovo the district court’s ripeness finding. Roe No. 2, 253 F.3d at 1231. Ripeness \ndoctrine ensures that courts don’t interfere with agency action until it has progressed \nfrom abstract disagreement to a formal decision with concrete effects. Farrell-\nCooper Min. Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 728 F.3d 1229, 1234 (10th Cir. 2013). To \ndetermine a claim’s ripeness, we evaluate (1) its fitness for judicial resolution and (2) \nthe hardship the parties would suffer if the court declined to hear the case. Id.  \n    1.  Fitness for Judicial Resolution \n  “[T]o determine the fitness of issues for review, we may consider ‘whether \njudicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative \naction’ and ‘whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the \nissues presented.’” Id. at 1234–35 (quoting Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Energy, 287 F.3d \n1256, 1262–63 (10th Cir. 2002)). Other relevant factors include: “(1) whether the \nissues involved are purely legal, (2) whether the agency’s action is final, (3) whether \nthe action has or will have an immediate impact on the petitioner, and (4) whether \nresolution of the issue will assist the agency in effective enforcement and \nadministration.” Id. at 1235 n.3 (quoting Los Alamos Study Grp. v. Dep’t of Energy, \n692 F.3d 1057, 1065 (10th Cir. 2012)). In sum, “[a]n agency’s action will be ripe for \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 24 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 22     \nreview where ‘the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable \nproportions, and its factual components fleshed out, by some concrete action \napplying the regulation to the claimant’s situation in a fashion that harms or threatens \nto harm him.’” Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *9 (quoting Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807–08 (2003)). \n  Kansas’s arguments on this point are related to its arguments on standing. The \nstate claims that the administrative actions it took in this case were not final. Rather, \nit argues, the Plaintiffs could have requested a formal hearing and then a rehearing \nbefore the OAH. See Kan. Admin. Regs. §§ 30-7-68, 30-7-77. If they were \ndissatisfied with the outcome of those proceedings, they could then have challenged \nthose decisions before a state appeals committee, and then, finally, in Kansas state \ncourt. See Kan. Admin. Regs. § 30-7-78; Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 77-601, 77-607.  \nThe district court disagreed, concluding that the “termination notices represent \nconcrete actions by the KDHE that threatened to harm Plaintiffs by excluding [PPGP] \nand PPSLR as Medicaid providers, notwithstanding the option of an administrative \nappeal.” Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *9. The district court pointed out that if the \nProviders didn’t appeal, their final termination would stand (which, we note, would \nhave deprived the Patients of their provider of choice). Id. at *10. Further, the district \ncourt noted that “where threatened action by government is concerned, we do not \nrequire a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the \nbasis for the threat.” Id. (quoting Medimmune, Inc. v. Genetech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, \n128 & n.8 (2007)). Finally, the district court found that the case involved primarily \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 25 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 23     \nlegal questions that did not require agency expertise or significant factual \ndevelopment. Id. Therefore, it concluded that the Plaintiffs’ claims were ripe for \njudicial review. Id. at 11. \nAgain, we agree with the district court’s thoughtful analysis, this time on this \ncase’s fitness for judicial resolution. “[B]oth parties have submitted evidence on \nthese issues, and . . . neither party requested an evidentiary hearing on the motion for \npreliminary injunction.” Id. at 10. This implies that no substantial factual disputes \nremained, and that the questions we must now answer are primarily legal questions. \nKansas has presented its grounds for terminating the Providers, and it agrees that the \npropriety of the preliminary injunction rests on “whether the Providers’ conduct and \ncorporate affiliations justify the decision to terminate.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at \n29. Though Kansas characterizes these issues9 as factual rather than legal, the district \ncourt found it telling that after the parties had one evidentiary hearing, even if it was \ninformal, neither party later requested an evidentiary hearing on the motion for \npreliminary injunction. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *10. Kansas presented three \ngrounds for terminating the Providers and supported its reasons with evidence. \nFurther agency action was therefore unnecessary for the district court to determine \n“whether, as a matter of law, any of those grounds permit [Kansas] to terminate \n                                              \n9 The issues it names are “whether the Providers are ‘qualified’ under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23), whether the State properly terminated the Providers under \nSection 1396a(p)(1), and whether the nature of the relationship between the Providers \nand the National Office is legally significant.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 29. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 26 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 24     \n[PPGP’s and PPSLR’s] Medicaid provider agreement without violating Medicaid’s \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.” Gee, 862 F.3d at 456.  \nAnd, because the Providers had clearly stated that they did “not intend to \npursue” further administrative appeal, Appellee’s Response Br. at 58, the Patients’ \ninjuries are “sufficiently likely to happen to justify judicial intervention,” Gee, 862 \nF.3d at 456 (quoting Pearson v. Holder, 624 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 2010)). Again, \nsignificantly, the Patients did not participate in the April 29 informal hearing and \nthey had no administrative remedies available to them, so only “through a § 1983 \naction” in federal court could they “vindicate their federal right” to select the \nqualified provider of their choice. Appellee’s Response Br. at 20; see Gee, 862 F.3d \nat 455. Absent further administrative action by the Providers, the terminations were \nfinal for justiciability purposes because they would have become effective as of the \ndates stated in the termination letters. In other words, because the future held no \nuncertain events, the termination letters were not “of a merely tentative or \ninterlocutory nature.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 25–26 (quoting Friends of Marolt \nPark v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 382 F.3d 1088, 1093–94 (10th Cir. 2004)); see also \nGonzales, 64 F.3d at 1499. \n  2.  Hardship \nKansas also contends that the Plaintiffs failed to show that they would face \nhardship absent an injunction because possible future injury does not amount to \nhardship and the Providers’ terminations were not final. We reject this argument for \nthe same reason already given. Because the Providers chose not to appeal their \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 27 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 25     \nterminations, the terminations were final and would have become effective no later \nthan September 10. If this had happened, the Patients would have likely “suffer[ed] \nhardship by being denied access to the provider of their choice under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(23) and to medical services at [the Providers’] facilities.” Gee, 862 F.3d \nat 457. Therefore, the Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe. \nII.  Younger Abstention \nKansas next claims that the district court erred by declining to abstain under \nYounger. We review de novo the district court’s decision on whether to abstain under \nYounger. Amanatullah v. Colo. Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 187 F.3d 1160, 1163 (10th Cir. \n1999). We first note that “abstention ‘is the exception, not the rule,’ and hence should \nbe ‘rarely . . . invoked.’” Brown ex rel. Brown v. Day, 555 F.3d 882, 888 (10th Cir. \n2009) (omission in original) (quoting Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 705 \n(1992)).  \nYounger abstention stems from the federal government’s deference to and \nrespect for the state government and its function. Younger, 401 U.S. at 44. “[F]or \nYounger abstention to apply, there must be ‘an ongoing state judicial . . . proceeding, \nthe presence of an important state interest, and an adequate opportunity to raise \nfederal claims in the state proceedings.’” Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray \nReservation v. Utah, 790 F.3d 1000, 1008 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Seneca-Cayuga \nTribe of Okla. v. Oklahoma ex rel. Thompson, 874 F.2d 709, 711 (10th Cir. 1989)). \nWe conclude that no ongoing state proceedings precluded the district court from \nexercising jurisdiction. \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 28 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 26     \nHere, the issue is whether the Providers’ right to appeal after their April 29 \nevidentiary hearing and after the resulting termination decisions would amount to an \nadministrative proceeding entitled to Younger abstention. To decide this question, we \nask “whether there is an ongoing proceeding,” and then we “decide whether that \nproceeding is the type of state proceeding that is due the deference accorded by \nYounger abstention.” Brown, 555 F.3d at 888 (first emphasis added). \nA.  Administrative Proceeding Not Ongoing \nKansas argues that state administrative proceedings were “well underway” and \nremained ongoing because the Providers still had the right to seek a formal hearing \nuntil August 10. Appellant’s Opening Br. at 31–32. The district court disagreed, \nconcluding that state administrative proceedings had not yet begun.10 Mosier, 2016 \nWL 3597457, at *12.  \nBefore the Plaintiffs filed their § 1983 lawsuit and motion for preliminary \ninjunction, the following events had taken place: (1) two different Kansas agencies \nhad investigated the Providers to determine whether they had improperly sold or \ndisposed of fetal tissue, and both agencies cleared the Providers of wrongdoing; (2) \n                                              \n10 Kansas also argues that the district court conflictingly characterized the state \nadministrative proceedings as both final and as having not yet begun. But these two \ncharacterizations do not conflict. The termination letters were final for justiciability \npurposes, and the Providers therefore had the option of appealing these final \nterminations via state administrative proceedings, though they chose not to. In fact, \nthe Providers had the choice to pursue an administrative appeal only because the \nterminations were final. These circumstances are comparable to the rule that, absent \ncertain, statutory exceptions, federal courts of appeals may hear appeals from only \ndistrict courts’ final decisions. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292. \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 29 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 27     \nKansas had sent the Providers notices of intent to terminate; (3) Kansas and the \nProviders had participated in one evidentiary hearing; and (4) Kansas had sent the \nProviders notices of decision to terminate with a termination date of May 10. Kansas \nargues that these decisions weren’t final. But again, had the Providers taken no \nfurther action—and nothing required the Providers to take further action—those \nterminations would have become effective. In other words, neither party would have \nhad anything left to do to execute the terminations; the clock was running on certain \ntermination.   \nAfter the Providers received Kansas’s notices of termination, they had an \noptional right to challenge these decisions at an administrative hearing. But “no \nadministrative proceeding commences until or unless [the Providers] appeal[], . . . \nand [the Providers] ha[ve] foresworn that option.” Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, \nInc. v. Kliebert, 141 F. Supp. 3d 604, 633 (M.D. La. 2015). Kansas tries to turn the \nProviders’ right to initiate future state administrative proceedings into present, \nongoing proceedings, claiming that “[b]ut for the district court’s injunction, the state \nproceeding would have gone forward.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 35. Kansas is \nmistaken: absent the district court’s injunction, the termination would have gone into \neffect. That is so because the Providers had decided not to proceed with an \nadministrative appeal. So nothing would have stood in the way of the termination \nbeing imposed on May 10 as promised absent a unilateral reversal. Because the \nProviders chose not to appeal this decision to the OAH, Kansas can point to no \nongoing state proceedings. \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 30 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 28     \nB.  Not the Type of Proceeding Entitled to Younger Abstention \nFor similar reasons, even if proceedings were ongoing, they aren’t the type \nrequiring Younger abstention. Relevant to this appeal, civil enforcement proceedings \nmerit abstention under Younger. Sprint Commc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S. Ct. 584, 588 \n(2013). Civil enforcement proceedings are generally “‘akin to a criminal prosecution’ \nin ‘important respects,’” and “are characteristically initiated to sanction the federal \nplaintiff,” meaning, in this case, the Providers. Id. at 592 (quoting Huffman v. \nPursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 604 (1975)). Abstention in such cases reflects “a proper \nrespect for state functions” when the party seeking relief from the federal court “has \nan adequate remedy at law and will not suffer irreparably [sic] injury if denied \nequitable relief.” Id. at 591 (quoting Younger, 401 U.S. at 43–44). We have also \ndefined civil enforcement proceedings as coercive rather than remedial. Brown, 555 \nF.3d at 890. Though the Supreme Court has disclaimed this distinction “given the \nsusceptibility of the designations to manipulation,” Sprint Commc’ns, 134 S. Ct. at \n593 n.6, Brown still provides valuable guidance for our analysis. \nUnder this framework, plaintiffs suing under § 1983 must “exhaust[] state \nadministrative remedies only where the state administrative proceedings are \ncoercive.” Brown, 555 F.3d at 890. Civil enforcement proceedings are coercive when \nthe state initiates the proceedings and the target of those proceedings challenges them \nas unlawful in federal court. Id. at 889; Sprint Commc’ns, 134 S. Ct. at 592. On the \nother hand, proceedings are remedial when the federal plaintiff initiates them seeking \na remedy for a state-inflicted wrong. Brown, 555 F.3d at 890–91.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 31 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 29     \nWe agree with the district court that the administrative proceedings in this case \nwere not civil enforcement actions subject to Younger abstention. Mosier, 2016 WL \n3597457, at *13. As the district court pointed out, the Providers chose to participate \nin an evidentiary hearing on April 29—this hearing was not mandatory. Id. The \nproceedings that Kansas “initiated to sanction [the Providers]” were completed with \nthe final termination notices—those notices were Kansas’s sanctions. Id. (quoting \nSprint Commc’ns, 134 S. Ct. at 592). After receiving the notices of termination, the \nProviders took no further action. Nor were they required to do so, because any further \nappeals would be optional avenues to seek redress for their injuries. In other words, \neven if Kansas’s “administrative termination of the Providers [was] coercive, \nintended to sanction the Providers for misconduct,” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 36, \nthat action was final when the Plaintiffs sued under § 1983. Therefore, any additional \nadministrative proceedings could not be characterized as civil enforcement \nproceedings, meaning that contrary to Kansas’s claims, the Providers faced no \nexhaustion requirement under these circumstances.11  \nFinally, but importantly, we also note that though the Providers had the right \nof appeal, the Patients did not. See Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *13; see Kliebert, \n141 F. Supp. 3d at 633. And the Patients are not subject to an exhaustion requirement \n                                              \n11 Kansas claims that “[t]he district court concluded that there was no \nexhaustion requirement in this case because Section 1983 has no exhaustion \nrequirement.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 33 n.8. This is incorrect. The district court \nconcluded that there was no exhaustion requirement in this case because it was not a \ncivil enforcement proceeding under Sprint Communications and Brown. Mosier, 2016 \nWL 3597457, at *12–*13.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 32 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 30     \nunder § 1983. See Gee, 862 F.3d at 455 (“[T]he Individual Plaintiffs have no \nadministrative appeal rights, and they are not subject to (nor could they be) any \nadministrative exhaustion requirement under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.”); Planned \nParenthood Se., Inc. v. Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 3d 1207, 1215 (M.D. Ala. 2015) \n(“[T]he Eleventh Circuit, like every other circuit to consider the issue, has concluded \nthat exhaustion is not required for claims under the Medicaid Act.”). In sum, the \ndistrict court did not err in declining to abstain under Younger because the \nadministrative proceedings were not ongoing, and were not the type of proceedings \nmeriting Younger abstention. \nIII.  Preliminary Injunction \n  We review a district court’s preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. \nN.M. Dep’t of Game & Fish v.

Wilderness Workshop v. U.S. Bureau of Land \nMgmt., 531 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 2008). To obtain a preliminary injunction, a \nplaintiff must show “[(1)] that he is likely to succeed on the merits, [(2)] that he is \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [(3)] that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and [(4)] that an injunction is in the public \ninterest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).   \n  Before we address the Patients’ likelihood of success on the merits, we first \ndecide the threshold issue of whether the Medicaid Act’s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, § 1396a(a)(23), creates a private right of action for the Patients.12 We then \ndetermine whether the Patients are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim.  \n  A.

Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 541–42 (2012); see also Atkins v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 154, 157 (1986) (explaining \nthe federal-state partnership for implementing Medicaid).  \n  As discussed, the statute at issue in this case is the Medicaid Act’s free-choice-\nof-provider provision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). That provision states: \nA  state  plan  for  medical  assistance  must . . .  provide  that  (A)  any \nindividual eligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified \nto  perform  the  service  or  services  required . . .  who  undertakes  to \nprovide him such services . . . . \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A). This section goes on to state that “an enrollment of an \nindividual eligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management \nsystem . . . , a medicaid managed care organization, or a similar entity shall not \nrestrict the choice of the qualified person from whom the individual may receive \nservices under section 1396d(a)(4)(C) of this title.”14 Id. at § 1396a(a)(23)(B). \nSection 1396d(a)(4)(C) specifically grants Medicaid patients the right to choose their \nprovider for family-planning services. See Betlach, 727 F.3d at 964. So, under the \n                                              \n14 In addition, this section contains several carefully defined exceptions, \nincluding some contained in other sections of the Medicaid Act. Specifically, \n§ 1396a(a)(23)(B) includes exceptions for providers convicted of a felony “for an \noffense which the State agency determines is inconsistent with the best interests of \nbeneficiaries under the State plan,” and for providers under a new-provider \ntemporary moratorium. This section also states that it does not apply in Puerto Rico, \nthe Virgin Islands, and Guam. Id. \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 36 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 34     \nfree-choice-of-provider provision, “any individual Medicaid recipient is free to \nchoose any provider so long as two criteria are met: (1) the provider is ‘qualified to \nperform the service or services required,’ and (2) the provider ‘undertakes to provide \n[the recipient] such services.’” Id. at 967 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A)). \n     1.  Blessing/Gonzaga Requirements \n  The question here is whether the free-choice-of-provider agreement creates a \nprivate right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. To do so, (1) “Congress must have \nintended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff,” (2) the plaintiff must \nhave “demonstrate[d] that the right assertedly protected . . . is not so ‘vague and \namorphous’ that its enforcement would strain judicial competence,” and (3) the \nstatute that creates the right must be “couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms.” Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340–41 (1997) (quoting Wright v. City \nof Roanoke Redev. & Hous. Auth., 479 U.S. 418, 431 (1987)). If “the text and \nstructure of a statute provide no indication that Congress intends to create new \nindividual rights,” then the § 1983 plaintiff cannot proceed further. Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 286 (2002). But if the plaintiff satisfies the three Blessing \nrequirements, “the right is presumptively enforceable” under § 1983. Id. at 284. Still, \ndefendants can rebut this presumption by showing that Congress either expressly \nforeclosed private enforcement, or impliedly did so “by creating a comprehensive \nenforcement scheme that is incompatible with” private enforcement. Id. at 284 & n.4 \n(quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341). \n      a.  Congress Intended to Benefit Medicaid Patients  \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 37 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 35     \n  As have the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, we conclude that the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision confers on Medicaid patients a private right of \naction. See Gee, 862 F.3d at 457; Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d at 974–75; Betlach, 727 \nF.3d at 966–68; Olszewski, 442 F.3d at 461–62. But see Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1046. \nFirst, we have no trouble concluding that Congress unambiguously intended to confer \nan individual right on Medicaid-eligible patients. See Betlach, 727 F.3d at 966. “The \nstatutory language unambiguously confers such a right,” because it mandates that “all \nstate Medicaid plans provide that ‘any individual eligible for medical assistance . . . \nmay obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or \nperson, qualified to perform the service or services required.’” Id. (omission in \noriginal) (emphasis omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)). Further, “Section \n1396a(a)(23)(B) . . . carves out and insulates family planning services from limits \nthat may otherwise apply under approved state Medicaid plans, assuring covered \npatients an unfettered choice of provider for family planning services.” Id. at 964 \n(citing §§ 1396a(a)(23)(B), 1396d(a)(4)(C)). Congress has therefore clearly intended \nto grant a specific class of beneficiaries—Medicaid-eligible patients—an enforceable \nright to obtain medical services from the qualified provider of their choice. \n  Kansas also claims that Armstrong supports its claim that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer on the Patients an enforceable right because in it, \nJustice Scalia opined that Spending Clause legislation does not provide a private right \nof action. 135 S. Ct. at 1387. But in Armstrong, the Supreme Court analyzed an \nentirely different section of the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 38 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 36     \nconcluding that this specific section did not create a private right of action. Id. \nSection 1396a(a)(30)(A) provides that “[a] State plan for medical assistance must . . . \nprovide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment \nfor” Medicaid services to ensure that Medicaid pays for only necessary, efficient, \neconomic, and high-quality care while still setting reimbursement rates high enough \nto encourage providers to continue serving Medicaid patients. In his opinion, the last \nportion of which Justice Breyer declined to join, thus making that portion a plurality, \nJustice Scalia stated that “Section 30(A) lacks the sort of rights-creating language \nneeded to imply a private right of action.” Id. But the plaintiffs there did not sue \nunder § 1983 to enforce a right established by the Medicaid Act. Id. (“The last \npossible source of a cause of action for respondents is the Medicaid Act itself. They \ndo not claim that, and rightly so.”).  \nUnlike § 1396a(a)(23), which provides that “any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from any [provider] . . . qualified \nto perform the service or services required,” the Medicaid Act section at issue in \nArmstrong directed states to adopt rate-setting plans in accordance with certain \ngeneral standards. The free-choice-of-provider provision, “[i]n contrast [to \nArmstrong’s Medicaid Act section,] § 1396a(a)(23) . . . is phrased in individual terms \nthat are specific and judicially administrable, as recognized by the Sixth, Seventh, \nand Ninth Circuits.” Gee, 862 F.3d at 462. Justice Scalia also noted in Armstrong that \nthe plaintiffs were providers, as opposed to the providers’ patients, who are the \nMedicaid Act’s intended beneficiaries. 135 S. Ct. at 1387. As such, he doubted “that \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 39 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 37     \nproviders are intended beneficiaries (as opposed to mere incidental beneficiaries) of \nthe Medicaid agreement.” Id. Indeed, the majority speculated that the provider-\nplaintiffs in Armstrong likely chose not to sue under § 1983 because they had no \nunambiguously conferred right under Gonzaga. Id. at 1386 n.*. So Armstrong does \nnothing to undermine the Patients’ claim that Congress intended to confer on them an \nenforceable right of action with the free-choice-of-provider provision. \n      b.  Right Not Vague or Amorphous  \n  Second, the free-choice-of-provider agreement is not so “‘vague and \namorphous’ that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.” Blessing, 520 \nU.S. at 340–41 (1997) (quoting Wright, 479 U.S. at 431). Kansas contends that the \nterm “qualified” makes the free-choice-of-provider provision judicially \nunadministrable because it is neither defined in the Medicaid Act, nor self-defining. \nAppellant’s Opening Br. at 41. This position is at odds with four of the five circuits \nthat have decided the issue. See Gee, 862 F.3d at 457–58; Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967–\n68; Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d at 974; Olszewski, 442 F.3d at 462; see also Gillespie, \n867 F.3d at 1050 (Melloy, J., dissenting) (agreeing that the right conferred by the \nfreedom-of-choice provision is not so vague and amorphous that it would strain \njudicial competence). We agree with the reasoning expressed by these four circuits.  \nUnder the Medicaid Act, plaintiffs need show only that their provider of \nchoice was (1) qualified to perform the medical services, and (2) undertaking to do \nso. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). These requirements are “‘concrete and objective \nstandards for enforcement,’ which are ‘well within judicial competence to apply.’” \n37 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 40 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 38     \nGee, 862 F.3d at 459 (quoting Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967). As the Ninth Circuit held \nand the Fifth Circuit has reiterated, “courts addressing this provision confront ‘a \nsimple factual question no different from those courts decide every day,’” which \nrequires no “balancing of competing concerns or subjective policy judgments.” Id. \n(quoting Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967). \n  “[W]hile there may be legitimate debates about the medical care covered by or \nexempted from the [free-choice-of-provider] provision,” the definition of the word \n“qualified” cannot be legitimately debated. Olszewski, 442 F.3d at 462. Though \ndetermining whether a provider is qualified “may require more factual development \nor expert input, [it] still falls well within the range of judicial competence.” Betlach, \n727 F.3d at 967. Whether a provider was qualified to perform medical services and \nundertaking to do so “is ‘likely to be readily apparent.’” Id. (quoting Olszewski, 442 \nF.3d at 462).  \n  Kansas again relies heavily on Armstrong to support its claim that \n§ 1396a(a)(23) is judicially unadministrable. It claims that “determining whether a \nprovider is ‘qualified’ is a [sic] dependent upon judgment, industry experience, and \ntechnical expertise,” and that such a determination implicates “expert judgments and \nquestions of state law.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 41. But in making this claim, \nKansas compares the free-choice-of-provider provision’s willing-and-qualified \nrequirements to the requirements contained in § 1396a(a)(30)(A) of the Medicaid \nAct, which was at issue in Armstrong. That section requires state plans to “provide \nfor payments that are ‘consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care,’ all \n38 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 41 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 39     \nthe while ‘safeguard[ing] against unnecessary utilization of . . . care and services.’” \nArmstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1385 (alterations in original) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A)).  \nCompared to that “judgment-laden standard,” id., the decision of whether a \nprovider is qualified is much simpler. Indeed, “the statutory term here, ‘qualified,’ is \ntethered to an objective benchmark: ‘qualified to perform the service or services \nrequired.’” Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967–68 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A)). Courts \ncan determine whether providers are qualified by “drawing on evidence such as \ndescriptions of the service required; state licensing requirements; the provider’s \ncredentials, licenses, and experience; and expert testimony regarding the appropriate \ncredentials for providing the service.” Id. at 968. This analysis is “no different from the \nsorts of qualification or expertise assessments that courts routinely make.” Id. \nc.  Right Stated in Mandatory Terms \n  On the third element, we conclude that the statute is “couched in mandatory, \nrather than precatory, terms.” Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341. Kansas doesn’t contest this \nprong of the Blessing/Gonzaga analysis, nor could it. The statute provides that “[a] \nState plan for medical assistance must” allow Medicaid-eligible individuals to obtain \nmedical services from the qualified provider of their choice. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(23)(A) (emphasis added). The statute confers a private right on Medicaid-\neligible individuals; it is not merely “a directive to the federal agency.” Armstrong, \n135 S. Ct. at 1387; see Gee, 862 F.3d at 461; Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967; Comm’r of \nInd., 699 F.3d at 974; Olszewski, 442 F.3d at 462. But see Gillespie, 867 F.3d at \n39 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 42 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 40     \n1041. Rather, it affirmatively requires state plans to allow Medicaid-eligible people \nto obtain medical services from their willing and qualified provider of choice. \n    2.  Congressional Intent to Foreclose Private Enforcement \n  Still, even if a plaintiff meets these three threshold requirements, the plaintiff \nhas established “only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under \n§ 1983.” City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005) (quoting \nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 341). “The defendant may defeat this presumption by \ndemonstrating that Congress did not intend that remedy for a newly created right.” \nId. The statute creating the right may contain evidence of such congressional intent; \notherwise, we may infer it if the statute contains a “comprehensive enforcement \nscheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under § 1983.” Id. (quoting \nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 341).15 \n                                              \n15 We don’t read City of Rancho Palos Verdes as requiring us to presume that \nCongress foreclosed a private right of action under the Medicaid Act simply because \nit was enacted under the Spending Clause. The Court discussed the Gonzaga/Blessing \nframework for determining whether a statute creates a privately enforceable right \nunder § 1983, and nowhere suggested that it intended to change or abandon this \nframework. City of Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 119–20. Assuming that the \nplaintiff had met the Gonzaga-Blessing requirements and established a rebuttable \npresumption of individual enforcement under § 1983, the Court limited its analysis to \nthe question of “whether Congress meant the judicial remedy expressly authorized by \n[the statute at issue] to coexist with an alternative remedy available in a § 1983 \naction.” Id. at 120–21. But, even if City of Rancho Palos Verdes “upended the \nBlessing ‘presumption,’” A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791, 801 (3d Cir. \n2007), and somehow required a presumption against private enforcement of \nMedicaid Act provisions, it wouldn’t change our conclusion. Congress’s \nindividually-oriented, mandatory, and rights-creating language in the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is strong enough to overcome a presumption against individual \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 43 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 41     \n  Here, again, Kansas relies on Armstrong to support its claim. There, the \nproviders sued Idaho, claiming that it had violated § 1396a(a)(30)(A) by reimbursing \nthem at rates lower than the Medicaid Act permitted. Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1382. \nThe providers asserted “an implied right of action under the Supremacy Clause to \nseek injunctive relief against the enforcement or implementation of state legislation.” \nId. at 1383 (quoting Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc. v. Armstrong, 567 F. App’x 496, \n497 (9th Cir. 2014) (unpublished), rev’d, Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. 1378). Justice Scalia \nstated that “Spending Clause legislation like Medicaid” doesn’t confer a private right \nof action because the “sole remedy Congress provided for a State’s failure to comply \nwith Medicaid’s requirements . . . is the withholding of Medicaid funds by the \n[federal] Secretary of Health and Human Services.” Id. at 1385, 1387. \nBut Armstrong isn’t a § 1983 case. Plus, an earlier Supreme Court case, Wilder \nv. Virginia Hospital Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 522 (1990), had previously rejected \nKansas’s argument. Wilder held that “[the Medicaid Act’s] administrative scheme \ncannot be considered sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate a congressional \nintent to withdraw the private remedy of § 1983. . . . ‘[G]eneralized powers’ . . . to \naudit and cut off federal funds [are] insufficient to foreclose reliance on § 1983 to \nvindicate federal rights.”16 496 U.S. at 522 (quoting Wright, 479 U.S. at 428). And \n                                                                                                                                                  \nenforcement actions, especially considering the weight of precedent favoring such \nindividual enforcement.  \n16 The Eighth Circuit contends that Armstrong effectively overruled Wilder. \nSee Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1044–1046. Even if the Supreme Court had done so—and \nwe do not think it did—it would not impact our analysis. We rely on Wilder not for \n \n41 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 44 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 42     \nbecause Justice Kennedy didn’t join Justice Scalia’s Spending Clause reasoning, it is \nnot binding on us; Wilder still is. Moreover, Armstrong’s analysis of a state’s \nviolation of the Medicaid Act is inapplicable to the Patients’ claim that Kansas is \nattempting to deprive them of their right to receive medical services from their \nchosen, qualified providers, because the federal Secretary’s withholding Medicaid \nfunds would not redress their injuries at all. Unlike the plaintiffs in Armstrong, who \nwere providers, the Patients here are individual beneficiaries of the Medicaid Act; \nand unlike in Armstrong, they are not merely contesting reimbursement rates, they \nare asserting that the state has violated their substantive right to receive medical care \nfrom their chosen medical providers. Also importantly, the providers in Armstrong \nasserted a right of action under a Medicaid Act rate-setting provision and the \n                                                                                                                                                  \nits holding that the Medicaid Act confers on providers a right enforceable under \n§ 1983 but for its conclusion that the Medicaid Act’s administrative scheme isn’t \nsufficiently comprehensive that it demonstrates Congress’s intent to preclude \nenforcement under § 1983. Wilder, 496 U.S. at 522. Armstrong neither discussed nor \n“plainly repudiate[d]” this portion of Wilder. Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1386 n.*. \nAlso, Wilder concerned an amendment to the Medicaid Act that has since been \nrepealed. See Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, § 4711, 111 Stat. \n251, 507–08. And Wilder decided whether that amendment conferred private-\nenforcement rights on Medicaid providers, 496 U.S. at 510, as opposed to our \nquestion here, which is whether a different section of the Medicaid Act confers \nprivate-enforcement rights on Medicaid patients. And importantly, Armstrong took \nissue only with Wilder’s implication that any time a statute imposes a binding \nobligation, it creates a private right of enforcement under § 1983. Armstrong, 135 S. \nCt. at 1386 n.* (noting that Gonzaga rejected Wilder’s implication “that our cases \npermit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of \naction brought under § 1983” (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283)). Armstrong did no \nmore than reaffirm Gonzaga’s requirement that rights must be unambiguously \nconferred. Id.; Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. \n42 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 45 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 43     \nSupremacy Clause, unlike the Patients here, who assert their right under § 1983 and \nthe Medicaid Act’s free-choice-of-provider provision.  \nEven if § 1396a(a)(30)(A) could fairly be read to display congressional intent \nto foreclose the availability of equitable relief, id. at 1386, § 1396a(a)(23)—the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision—can’t be read that way. \nB.  Preliminary Injunction Factors \n  1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nHaving concluded that the free-choice-of-provider provision confers on the \nPatients a private right of action, we now turn to the first and most important \npreliminary-injunction factor: whether the Patients are likely to succeed on the \nmerits. \nAgain, § 1396(a)(23) requires a state plan to provide that “any individual \neligible for medical assistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any \ninstitution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service \nor services required . . . who undertakes to provide him such services[.]” In \nevaluating what it means for a provider to be “qualified to provide services,” we \nagree with the district court and “the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, [that] ‘[t]o be \n‘qualified’ in the relevant sense is to be capable of performing the needed medical \nservices in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner.” Gee, 862 \nF.3d at 462 (quoting Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978); see also Betlach, 727 F.3d at \n969 (concluding that qualified means “having an officially recognized qualification \nto practice as a member of a particular profession; fit, competent” (quoting Oxford \n43 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 46 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 44     \nEnglish Dictionary (3d ed. 2007)). In the district court, Kansas did not contest this \nmeaning of the term “qualified.” Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *17.  \nAll agree that states have considerable discretion in establishing provider \nqualifications. See 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2) (stating that a recipient’s right to the \nservices of any provider qualified and willing to perform the services does not \nprohibit states from “[s]etting reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of \nproviders”). But that authority entitles Kansas to set qualifications only for \nprofessional competency and patient care. See Betlach, 727 F.3d at 970 (declaring \nthat states are not free to define “qualified” however they wish for their own \npurposes). We agree with the district court that the Plaintiffs may assert that they \nwere denied their right to receive Medicaid services from the willing and qualified \nprovider of their choice because their provider was wrongfully removed from the \npool of providers.17 Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *18. \nThe Plaintiffs must be allowed to challenge PPGP’s termination. After all, if a \nstate wrongly terminates a provider—whether on grounds raised by Kansas under \n§ 1320a-f(b)(5)(B) or f(b)(12)(B) or otherwise—it will have wrongly removed a \nqualified provider from the available pool. If a state could terminate providers \nwithout any challenge by affected patients, the patients’ § 1396a(a)(23) right would \n                                              \n17 As we understand it, the dissent agrees with us that a provider can be \nterminated but remain qualified. Dissent at 2 (“But other federal Medicaid provisions \nallow states to exclude providers even when they are considered ‘qualified’ under \n§ 1396a(a)(23).”), 11 (declaring that “Medicaid allows states to exclude providers \nfrom Medicaid, sometimes even when the providers are qualified. E.g., 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(39), (p)(1).”). \n44 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 47 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 45     \nlose force and be easily eviscerated. We agree with the district court that when \nKansas shrinks the pool of qualified providers by terminating them under \n§ 1396a(p)(1), patients must have a § 1396a(a)(23) right to challenge the state’s \ntermination decision as improper or wrongful. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *17. \nKansas takes a different view. It argues that termination decisions under \n§ 1396a(p)(1) (which references § 1320a-7(b)) are separate from the right of patients \nto any qualified and willing provider under § 1396a(a)(23). In effect, Kansas argues \nthat patients have no right to services from qualified providers whom it has \nterminated. \nWe agree that states have broad powers to terminate Medicaid providers. After \nall, § 1396a(p)(1) “empowers states to exclude individual providers on such grounds \ndirectly, without waiting for the [federal] Secretary to act, while also reaffirming \nstate authority to exclude individual providers pursuant to analogous state law \nprovisions relating to fraud or misconduct.” Betlach, 727 F.3d at 972. These grounds \ninclude a wide swath of misconduct set out in federal law—including fraud, drug \ncrimes, obstructing investigations, license revocations, federal or state sanctions, and \ncertain felony convictions. They also include violations of “state laws concerning \nhealth and safety, and federal regulations expressly permit States to establish \n‘reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers.’” Appellant’s Brief \nat 48 (quoting 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2)). But these provisions do not make the state’s \ntermination decision unchallengeable. Patients must have a right to challenge \ntermination decisions to protect themselves against wrongful deprivation of access to \n45 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 48 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 46     \nqualified and willing providers, that is, to protect their guaranteed right expressly \ngiven by § 1396a(a)(23). In short, § 1396a(a)(23) confers the right and cabins the \nstate’s authority under § 1396a(p)(1), such that patients can challenge the termination \ndecisions. \nIn support of its view that termination decisions under § 1396a(p)(1) are final \nand beyond patients’ ability to challenge under § 1396a(a)(23), Kansas relies in part \non O’Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980). Kansas argues \nthat “the free-choice-of-provider provision entitles beneficiaries only to ‘the right to \nchoose among a range of qualified providers, without government interference.’” \nAppellant’s Opening Br. at 46 (quoting O’Bannon, 447 U.S. at 785). But O’Bannon \naddressed a different situation—one where no one contested that the nursing home \nwas unqualified to perform the services. We agree that § 1396a(a)(23) “clearly does \nnot confer a right on a recipient to enter an unqualified home and demand a hearing \nto certify it, nor does it confer a right on a recipient to continue to receive benefits for \ncare in a home that has been decertified.” 447 U.S. at 785. But unlike in O’Bannon, \nthe Providers in the case before us remained qualified to perform the medical \nservices.  \nIn addition, we note that the nursing home residents in O’Bannon asserted \nprocedural due-process rights, not substantive rights, as the patients do here. See Gee, \n46 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 49 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 47     \n862 F.3d at 460. But see Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1048 (Shepherd, J., concurring).18 And \nin O’Bannon, the patients didn’t contest that the nursing home’s decertification had \nresulted from the home’s failure to provide adequate medical, physical, nursing, and \npharmaceutical services, as well as its failure to maintain adequate records and an \nadequate system of governance. 447 U.S. at 776 n.3. Rather, the elderly Medicaid \npatients stressed the harm they would suffer if their nursing home closed and they \nwere forced to move. Id. at 777. So the Supreme Court’s holding concerned whether \nMedicaid recipients were entitled to a hearing to continue receiving care from an \nunqualified, decertified provider. Id. at 786 (“[W]hile a patient has a right to \ncontinued benefits to pay for care in the qualified institution of his choice, he has no \nenforceable expectation of continued benefits to pay for care in an institution that has \nbeen determined to be unqualified.”). Here, the Patients are not challenging the right \nto continue receiving care from an unqualified provider. Instead, they contend Kansas \nwrongfully terminated the Providers, thereby infringing their choice-of-provider \n                                              \n18 Judge Shepherd’s concurrence in Gillespie states that the previous four \ncircuits are wrong that O’Bannon concerns only procedural rights, stating that this \nview “ignores the very language of O’Bannon. The Supreme Court clearly stated that \nit was defining the contours of the ‘substantive right . . . conferred by the statutes and \nregulations.’” 867 F.3d at 1048 (alteration in original) (quoting O’Bannon, 447 U.S. \nat 786). But the language omitted from this quote matters. The whole sentence reads, \n“In holding that these provisions create a substantive right to remain in the home of \none’s choice absent specific cause for transfer, the Court of Appeals failed to give \nproper weight to the contours of the right conferred by the statutes and regulations.” \nO’Bannon, 447 U.S. at 786. We read this sentence to mean that § 1396a(a)(23) \nconfers a substantive “right to continued benefits to pay for care in the qualified \ninstitution of his choice” but not a right to remain in a home that the state has already \ndetermined to be unqualified. Id. So the residents were asking the state to grant them \nprocedural due process for a substantive right that they did not have.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 50 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 48     \nrights. For this reason, we disagree with Kansas that O’Bannon controls this case in \nKansas’s favor. \n    a.  Waste Inspections \nThe state first claims that PPGP’s Overland Park clinic violated Kansas law by \nhindering the state’s investigation of its waste-disposal practices. See Kan. Admin. \nRegs. § 28-29-16(a)(1) (authorizing Kansas BWM employees to enter and inspect \npremises dealing with solid waste and to gather information about conditions and \nprocedures); Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 65-3409(a)(6), 65-3401 (declaring it unlawful to \nrefuse to permit or hinder waste-disposal investigations, including examination and \ncopying records).  \nSpecifically, Kansas argues that the clinic violated the Medicaid Act by failing \n“to grant immediate access” to the Kansas BWM employees who investigated the \nclinic’s waste-disposal practices. 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(12)(B). “Failure to grant \nimmediate access means the failure to grant access at the time of a reasonable request \nor to provide a compelling reason why access may not be granted.” 42 C.F.R. \n§ 1001.1301(a)(2). But § 1320a-7(b)(12)(B) allows states to terminate providers who \nrefuse to grant immediate access to state employees conducting reviews under, in \nrelevant part, § 1396a(a)(33). And § 1396a(a)(33)(A) requires states to establish \nplans to have “appropriate professional health personnel” review “the appropriateness \nand quality of care and services furnished to” Medicaid recipients.  \nWe agree with the district court that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in \nproving “that they did grant immediate access to the inspectors,” as well as “that the \n48 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 51 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 49     \nsolid waste inspection here d[id] not constitute a review bearing on” the quality of \ncare the Providers furnished to Medicaid recipients. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at \n*20. The Providers presented sufficient evidence that PPGP employees at the \nOverland Park clinic accommodated BWM investigators’ unannounced arrival at the \nclinic by inviting them to conduct their inspection, but asking them not to take \nphotographs while patients were present. The inspectors chose to leave instead. And \nwhile initially withholding the list of the clinic’s waste-services vendors, PPGP \nprovided that information after assuring its confidentiality would be protected.  \nEven if this conduct could be labeled a “[f]ailure to grant immediate access” to \nKansas officials, which is doubtful, clinic employees “provide[d] a compelling \nreason” for their refusal to allow photographs or to turn over its vendor list: they \nwere concerned for patient safety and privacy. 42 C.F.R. § 1001.1301(a)(2). Notably, \nKansas never cited PPGP for allegedly impeding the inspection. Mosier, 2016 WL \n3597457, at *21. And despite Kansas’s claim that PPGP’s “providing some access to \nits facility nearly a month after the inspection was initiated, along with its \nopportunity to fix any problems, hardly satisfied the ‘immediate access’ requirement \nof federal law,” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 50, the record shows that when the state’s \ninvestigators first visited the clinic, PPGP employees granted them complete access \nto the clinic and invited them to complete a visual inspection. And Kansas points to \nno law that would require a medical provider to permit photographs to be taken of its \noperations while patients are present and being served. \n49 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 52 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 50     \nAs its second basis for termination, Kansas relies on § 1320a-7(b)(5)(B). That \nprovision allows the Secretary to terminate any individual or entity “for reasons \nbearing on the individual’s or entity’s professional competence, professional \nperformance, or financial integrity.” We agree with the district court “that PPKM’s \n[now PPGP’s] purported failure to cooperate with the BWM’s solid waste inspection \nin December 2015 does not bear on PPKM’s [PPGP’s] ‘professional competence, \nprofessional performance, or financial integrity.’” Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *19. \nAs the district court found, “it is undisputed that no solid waste violations were \nfound, so the only basis for termination associated with the inspection was the \nalleged failure to cooperate.” Id. We agree that Kansas has not explained how this \npurported failure to cooperate would bear on PPGP’s professional competence, \nprofessional performance, or financial integrity. Id. In its brief, Kansas references \n§ 1320a-7(b)(5)(B) just twice, first simply citing its standard, and second, saying that \nthe Providers showed a lack of “professional competence” in “refusing to allow \npublic health inspectors to do their job[.]” Appellant’s Brief at 48, 54. And Kansas’s \nreply brief does even less, failing even to cite § 1320a-7(b)(5)(B). \nThe Dissent \nThe dissent does not contend that Kansas is entitled to prevail on \n§ 1320a-7(b)(12)(B) or (b)(5)(B). As grounds authorizing termination, the dissent \ninstead relies on a neighboring section unmentioned by Kansas in its brief—42 \nU.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(12)(C). Dissent at 19. In fashioning a new argument, the dissent \nsteps beyond our usual practice. See Modoc Lassen Indian Hous. Auth. v. United \n50 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 53 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 51     \nStates Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev, No. 14-1313, 2017 WL 7369692, at *10 n.9 \n(10th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017) (declining to consider an argument unraised by the parties). \nIn response to the dissent, we discuss why the dissent’s cited statutory provision fails \nto provide Kansas a basis for termination. We will not decide an argument that \nKansas failed to raise in the district court or on appeal.  \nThat said, in responding to the dissent’s argument, we turn to \n§ 1320a-7(b)(12)(C) which reads as follows: \n(12) Failure to grant immediate access. Any individual or entity that \nfails to grant immediate access, upon reasonable request (as defined by \nthe [HHS] Secretary in regulations) to any of the following: \n \n        *          *           * \n(C) To the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, for the purpose of reviewing records, documents, and other \ndata  necessary  to  the  performance  of  the  statutory  functions  of  the \nInspector General. \n \nThe dissent argues that Kan. Reg. § 28-29-16(a)(1) is analogous to this federal \nstatute subsection, authorizing Kansas to terminate the Providers’ contracts based on \nits regulation. The dissent relies on this portion of the state regulation: \nThe  [Kansas  Secretary  of  Health  and  Environment]  or  any  duly \nauthorized representative of the secretary, at any reasonable hour of the \nday, having identified themselves and giving notice of their purpose, \nmay . . . [e]nter . . . any environment where solid wastes are generated, \nstored, handled, processed, or disposed, and inspect the premises and \ngather information of existing conditions and procedures . . . . \n \nDissent at 18–19.  \n  The dissent ignores an applicable federal regulation bearing on inspections, \nwhich allows OIG immediate access on reasonable request to review “records, \n51 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 54 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 52     \ndocuments and other materials or data . . . necessary to the [performance of the \nInspector General’s] statutory functions[.]” 42 C.F.R. § 1001.1301(a)(1)(iii). But in \ndefining “failure to grant immediate access,” the federal regulation requires that a \nprovider have 24 hours to provide compelling evidence why the records cannot be \nproduced, except on OIG’s reasonable belief of imminent alteration or destruction of \nthe records (and Kansas has not alleged that it had such a belief). 42 C.F.R. \n§ 1001.1301(a)(3)(i). And as a “reasonable request” the regulation requires a written \nrequest for documents signed by a designated representative of OIG “where there is \ninformation to suggest that the [individual or entity] has violated statutory or \nregulatory requirements under Titles V, XI, XVIII, XIX or XX of the Act.” 42 C.F.R. \n§ 1301(a)(3)(ii). Further, the regulation requires that the agency request include these \ndefinitions and advise the individual or entity of the length of exclusion for failure to \ncomply with the request. 42 C.F.R. § 1001.1301(a)(3), (b). In short, the federal \nregulation provides considerably more protections to a provider. In this circumstance, \nthe state regulation is not analogous to federal law.  \nSo we reject the view that Kansas was entitled to terminate PPGP on the \ndissent’s independently raised ground. In doing so, we also rely on the district court’s \nreasoning when it rejected Kansas’s reliance on § 1320a-7(b)(12)(B)—namely, that \nPPGP was willing to let the inspection continue absent photographs (having \nconfidentiality concerns), that the Kansas regulation did not provide for photography, \nand that PPGP willingly released the vendor lists after negotiating a confidentiality \nagreement with the inspecting agency. See Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *19. \n52 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 55 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 53     \n    b.  CMP Videos of Fetal Tissue Negotiation \nKansas next argues that it was entitled to terminate PPGP’s and PPSLR’s \nprovider agreements because “PPFA’s affiliates” violated federal and state law \nprohibiting the for-profit sale of human body parts and fetal tissue. Id. at 51 (citing \n42 U.S.C. §§ 274e, 289g-2; Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-6704). Importantly, Kansas doesn’t \nclaim that PPGP or PPSLR engaged in such illegal conduct; rather, it claims that \n“[e]ven if these activities were conducted by PPFA, . . . the Medicaid Act permits the \nState to terminate its provider agreement based on those activities or the entity’s \nunlawful or unethical activities in other States.” Id. at 51–52 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1320a-7(a)(3), (a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(ii)). According to Kansas, “providers must be \nterminated from participation in ‘any Federal health care program’—no matter where \nthat program is administered—if they commit certain felony offenses in connection \nwith a health care program administered by ‘any Federal, State, or local government \nagency.’” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(a)(3)).  \nBut, first, all of the termination provisions Kansas relies on require a criminal \nconviction or related sanction; and no PPFA affiliate, including PPGP and PPSLR, \nhas been convicted or sanctioned for any wrongdoing. And the district court rightly \nexplained that even if PPFA had negotiated the illegal sale of fetal body parts (and \nthis allegation has never been proved), “under [§ 1396a(p)(1)], the ‘entity’ that a \n‘State may exclude’ must be the same entity that committed the infraction defined in \n§ 1320a-7(b).” Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *18. Indeed, the sole provision \nallowing termination on the basis of affiliation applies exclusively to entities \n53 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 56 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 54     \ncontrolled by a sanctioned individual and mandates that the sanctioned individual \nmust have ownership interest or control over the affiliated entity. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1320a-7(b)(8). Thus, if the statute allows a state to exclude a provider based on its \naffiliation with a different provider, the affiliation must involve ownership or control. \nSee Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 3d at 1223–24 & n.9.  \nKansas never addresses the district court’s conclusion, instead arguing that \nPPGP and PPSLR never established that they were separate and independent from \nPPFA. We agree with the district court that the Providers are not sufficiently \naffiliated with PPFA so that Kansas can attribute this alleged conduct to them under \nthe law. See Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *21. Kansas states that PPFA’s affiliates \naggregate their finances, share executives, and share legal counsel. Kansas also states \nthat PPFA establishes and imposes medical and ethical policies on its affiliates.  \nBut these factors do nothing to show that PPFA exercises control over its \naffiliates’ daily operations. In fact, because many PPFA affiliates don’t offer \nabortions—and Kansas provides nothing to show that PPFA could or would require \nthem to do so—we cannot attribute PPFA’s alleged abortion-related conduct to PPFA \naffiliates absent evidence that specifically implicates the affiliates.19 See Gee, 862 \n                                              \n19 Nor do we find it significant that PPFA does not offer abortions. Kansas \nrelies on this irrelevant allegation to suggest that any sales of fetal tissue “could have \nbeen coordinated only through the abortion-providing ‘affiliates’ that [PPFA’s \nnational medical director] supervises.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 53. The state \nseems to imply that this must mean that PPSLR and PPGP are doing the PFFA \ndirector’s dirty work. This conclusion is both speculative and conclusory. Kansas \npresented no evidence showing that PPGP and PPSLR sold fetal tissue for profit, and \n \n54 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 57 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 55     \nF.3d at 450. Kansas discusses when courts treat two corporate entities as one, but it \npresents no authority to support its argument that “one corporation can be held \nresponsible for the policies of an umbrella organization regarding a practice that \nother affiliated corporations engage in.” Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 3d at 1224 n.10.  \nIn sum, the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving that Kansas cannot \nterminate PPGP from the state’s Medicaid program for PPFA’s alleged unlawful \nconduct. \n    c.  Medicaid Fraud by PPFA Affiliates  \nLast, Kansas claims it was justified in terminating PPGP and PPSLR in light of \nallegations that other PPFA affiliates had committed Medicaid fraud. Kansas claims \nthat the numerous allegations of Medicaid fraud by Planned Parenthood affiliates \naround the country provide relevant evidence of PPGP’s and PPSLR’s “questionable \nbilling practices.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 8–9. This argument fails for the same \nreason the previous argument fails. Kansas never alleged that PPGP or PPSLR \nengaged in fraud, but it claims that because PPGP merged with Planned Parenthood \nof Central Oklahoma (“PPCO”), “the new combined entity has necessarily inherited \nPPCO’s record of fraud.” Id. at 54. But this “merger” doesn’t have the effect that \nKansas desires it to.  \nFirst, the only thing this “merger” changed was PPGP’s name: the former \nPPKM now operates under the name “Planned Parenthood Great Plains.” Appellant’s \n                                                                                                                                                  \nneither of the two Kansas agencies that investigated PPGP and PPSLR found any \nwrongdoing.  \n55 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 58 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 56     \nApp. at 828. The merger resulted in “no change of ownership or management \nstructure” for PPGP. Id. Second, though Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin cited two \n“integrity reviews” finding error rates in billing of 20.3% and 14.1% in calling for \nPPCO’s termination from Oklahoma’s Medicaid plan, id. at 417–19, Kansas \npresented no evidence that Oklahoma had sanctioned or terminated PPCO, and PPCO \nis still an Oklahoma Medicaid provider. Third, Kansas cites nothing to support its \nclaim that one corporate entity can inherit another’s “record of fraud,” even when the \ntwo entities merge into a single entity (which does not appear to have happened \nhere).  \nAfter considering all of Kansas’s bases for terminating PPGP from its state \nMedicaid plan as unqualified, we conclude that, as in Gee, Commissioner of Indiana, \nand Betlach, Kansas “is seeking to do exactly what [other circuits] warned against: \n‘simply labeling any exclusionary rule as a “qualification”’ to evade the mandate of \nthe free-choice-of-provider requirement.” Gee, 862 F.3d at 469 (quoting Comm’r of \nInd., 699 F.3d at 978). “[T]he free-choice-of-provider provision unambiguously \nrequires that states participating in the Medicaid program allow covered patients to \nchoose among the family planning medical practitioners they could use were they \npaying out of their own pockets.” Betlach, 727 F.3d at 971. Because Kansas has not \notherwise sanctioned or charged PPGP for any wrongdoing, allowing the state to \nterminate PPGP from its Medicaid program would cause exactly this result.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 59 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 57     \nWe therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding \nthat Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim, and we move on to \nthe remaining preliminary-injunction factors. \n    2.  Irreparable Harm \n  We next consider whether the Patients have shown that they would suffer \nirreparable harm absent injunctive relief.20 Irreparable harm is “certain, great, actual \n‘and not theoretical.’” Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1189 (10th Cir. \n2003) (quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). The \ndistrict court found that the Patients had met their burden because they would lose \nmedical treatment from the qualified providers of their choice if Kansas’s \nterminations of the Providers were allowed to stand. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at \n*23. “A disruption or denial of these patients’ health care cannot be undone after a \ntrial on the merits.” Id. \n  Kansas argues that the Patients’ injuries are speculative for the same reason it \ncontested the Plaintiffs’ standing and the case’s ripeness: that the administrative \nappeal is still pending, meaning the state can’t terminate the providers until that \nprocess is complete or the time period for appeal has expired.21 See Greater \n                                              \n20 Again, we follow the district court’s lead in limiting our review on this issue \nto whether the Patients, as opposed to the Providers, met their burden of showing \nirreparable harm. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *23. \n \n21 Kansas also disputes the district court’s reliance on the possibility that if \nPPGP and PPSLR are terminated in Kansas, other states will terminate their \nMedicaid contracts as well. See Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at 24. We need not \n \n57 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 60 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 58     \nYellowstone Coal. v. Flowers, 321 F.3d 1250, 1260 (10th Cir. 2003). It also reiterates \nits argument that “[PPGP’s] [state Medicaid] contracts are not subject to immediate \ntermination.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 56.  \nWe reject that argument here for the same reason we did above. Only the \nProviders have a right—not an obligation—to appeal Kansas’s decision; the Patients \ndo not. And the Providers have declared that they will not pursue administrative \nappeal. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *24. Absent injunctive relief, the state would \nhave stopped reimbursing the PPGP for the Patients’ care sometime between July 7, \n2016 (Kansas’s self-proclaimed termination date) and September 10, 2016 (the date \nthat accounts for the allegedly required exhaustion period and the alleged contractual \ndelays that apply only to PPGP). Even if the effective date had been two months \naway, it would not change our conclusion that the Patients were “likely to suffer \nirreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.” Greater \nYellowstone Coal., 321 F.3d at 1260. \nLast, Kansas argues that the Patients would not be injured because the \nProviders “were conspicuously non-committal about whether termination would even \nforce them to stop seeing the [Patients],” and that the Patients “alleged only that they \nwill not have access to their preferred provider and (at worst) are unsure where else \nthey might receive care.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 58–59 & n.13. First, because \nthe Patients all qualify for Medicaid, we cannot disagree with the district court, \n                                                                                                                                                  \naddress this concern because we conclude that the Patients have established the risk \nof irreparable harm based on other grounds. \n58 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 61 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 59     \nwhich “easily [found] that these patients will be unable to afford to pay out of pocket \nto see the health care provider of their choice without Medicaid assistance.” Mosier, \n2016 WL 3597457, at *23. Second, “[t]his argument misses the mark. That a range of \nqualified providers remains available is beside the point.” Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d \nat 981. Section 1396a(a)(23) gives the Patients the exact right they seek to enforce: to \nobtain medical care from their preferred qualified provider, not to obtain family-\nplanning services from any qualified provider. The Patients have given \nuncontroverted evidence explaining why they prefer PPGP, including quality of care, \nlack of bias, and scheduling convenience. Mosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *23. At least \nfour of the Providers’ clinics are located in areas with shortages of primary-care \nproviders. And the district court also rightly rejected Kansas’s claims that Patients \nhad plenty of other family-planning-services providers to choose from, finding that \nthe state’s evidence on this point was exaggerated. See id. \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Patients \nwould suffer irreparable harm absent entry of a preliminary injunction enjoining \nKansas from terminating PPGP as a provider. \n    3.  Balance of Harms & Public Interest \n  We address the last two preliminary-injunction factors together. The final steps \nin assessing a preliminary injunction’s propriety require us to ask whether the \nbalance of equities tips in the Plaintiffs’ favor, and whether an injunction is in the \npublic interest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. Based on its findings that the three allegations \nagainst the Providers were either unfounded or unrelated to the Providers’ \n59 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 62 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 60     \nqualifications, the district court found that “the risk of taxpayer harm is quite low as \ncompared to the certain injury to Medicaid patients if the injunction does not issue.” \nMosier, 2016 WL 3597457, at *24. Similarly, because the district court found that \nthere was no ongoing administrative proceeding, it concluded that issuing a \npreliminary injunction and allowing the Plaintiffs to vindicate their Medicaid-Act \nrights by pursuing their § 1983 claim in federal court would serve the public interest, \ndespite the availability of state administrative remedies. Id. at *25. \nOn appeal, neither Kansas nor the Plaintiffs addressed this step in the analysis. \nEither way, we agree with the district court’s thorough, reasoned analysis concerning \nPPGP. The court did not err in concluding that the Plaintiffs have met their burden on \nthis point as well. \nThus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Plaintiffs \nhave satisfied all of the elements required for entry of a preliminary injunction on the \nPatients’ free-choice-of-provider claim concerning PPGP. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated above, as relates to PPGP, we AFFIRM the district \ncourt’s order granting the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction, thus restraining Kansas from terminating PPGP’s Medicaid-\nprovider agreement. And as relates to PPSLR, we VACATE the district court’s order, \nbecause we conclude that the Patients have not met standing requirements—they \nhave not alleged that they receive medical care at PPSLR. We remand for the district \n60 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 63 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 61     \ncourt to determine whether PPSLR itself has sufficiently alleged standing to proceed \nand whether it is entitled to a preliminary injunction. \n61 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 64 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 62     \nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas, et al. v. Andersen, No. 16-3249 \nBACHARACH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. \n \nA preliminary injunction would be appropriate only if the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs had standing and were likely to succeed on the merits. I agree \nwith the majority that the Jane Doe plaintiffs lacked standing as to Planned \nParenthood of the Saint Louis Region and Southwest Missouri (referred to \nbelow as “PPSLR”) because they had not alleged any desire to obtain \nmedical care from this affiliate. But I also believe the Jane Doe plaintiffs \nlacked an enforceable right to challenge Kansas’s action as to Planned \nParenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri (referred to below as “PPKM”). \nThus, I would reverse the grant of a preliminary injunction to the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs as to both affiliates. \nFor PPKM, the Jane Doe plaintiffs could prevail on the merits only \nby showing that they had an enforceable right to challenge what Kansas \ndid. The burden on the Jane Doe plaintiffs was stiff, for the Supreme Court \nhas held that a right is individually enforceable only if it was \nunambiguously conferred. If an individually enforceable right existed here, \nits scope would have been ambiguous because of the combination of two \nprovisions in Medicaid: § 1396a(a)(23) and § 1396a(p)(1). \nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23), the free-choice-of-provider clause, \nstate Medicaid programs must provide that Medicaid patients can obtain \nmedical care from any willing, qualified provider. Kansas’s program \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 65 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 63     \nsatisfied this requirement by providing that Medicaid patients could obtain \nmedical care from qualified providers. But other federal Medicaid \nprovisions allow states to exclude providers even when they are considered \n“qualified” under the free-choice-of-provider clause. These provisions \ninclude 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1), which allows states to exclude medical \nproviders for violating state laws that serve a Medicaid-related goal.  \nBased on § 1396a(p)(1), Kansas terminated PPKM, contending that it \nhad violated such state laws; the Jane Doe plaintiffs disagreed and sought \nto litigate whether the Kansas laws had been properly applied. The Jane \nDoe plaintiffs thus brought a § 1983 lawsuit for violation of their rights \nunder the free-choice-of-provider clause. \nThe resulting issue is whether this clause unambiguously provided \nthe Jane Doe plaintiffs with an enforceable right to have states properly \napply their state laws (authorized by § 1396a(p)(1)) to Medicaid providers. \nIn this context, the applicability of the free-choice-of-provider clause was \nambiguous, which is not enough for an individually enforceable right. \nThus, the Jane Doe plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits and \nthe district court should have denied the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction with regard to PPKM. \nI.  The district court granted a preliminary injunction. \n  Acting through the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, \nthe State of Kansas terminated participation in Medicaid by two Planned \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 66 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 64     \nParenthood affiliates—PPKM and PPLSR.1 In terminating the two \naffiliates, Kansas relied on its findings involving violations of state law.2 \nFollowing the terminations, PPKM, PPSLR, and three “Jane Doe” \npatients of PPKM brought a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim in federal district \ncourt, alleging that Kansas’s decision violated the Medicaid Act’s free-\nchoice-of-provider clause.3  \nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Following a \nhearing, the district court granted the motion by the Jane Doe plaintiffs, \npreliminarily barring termination of PPKM and PPSLR. Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v. Mosier, No. 16-2284-JAR-GLR, 2016 \nWL 3597457, at *25 (D. Kan. July 5, 2016).4  \n                                              \n1   These affiliates are medical providers offering family planning health \nservices to Kansas Medicaid patients. After this suit began, PPKM merged \nwith another Planned Parenthood affiliate (Planned Parenthood of Central \nOklahoma) and changed the name to “Planned Parenthood Great Plains.”  \n \n2   I focus on PPKM’s alleged refusal to allow the inspectors to \nphotograph waste-disposal areas. But Kansas also alleged that PPKM and \nPPSLR had withheld vendor lists, allowed the illegal sale of fetal organs, \nand engaged in fraudulent billing practices. Consideration of these \nallegations is unnecessary for us to reverse. \n \n3   The plaintiffs also based their motion for a preliminary injunction on \na claim involving denial of equal protection. But the district court did not \nrely on this claim. Nor does the majority. \n \n4   Reasoning that the Jane Doe plaintiffs had a cause of action, the \ndistrict court declined to decide whether PPKM and PPSLR could bring the \nsuit on their own. 2016 WL 3597457, at *17. The majority takes the same \napproach, as do I.  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 67 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 65     \nIn granting the preliminary injunction, the district court concluded \nthat the case was justiciable and that abstention was unnecessary. The \ncourt then considered the factors for a preliminary injunction, including \nwhether the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits. See Diné \nCitizens Against Ruining Our Env’t v. Jewell, 839 F.3d 1276, 1281 (10th \nCir. 2016).5 In applying this factor, the court first addressed whether the \nplaintiffs had a cause of action under § 1983 to enforce the free-choice-of-\nprovider clause. The court held that the Jane Doe plaintiffs had a cause of \naction and that it was broad enough to encompass the claims brought by the \nJane Doe plaintiffs.  \n                                                                                                                                                  \n \n5   The other factors are  \n \n  whether the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without a \npreliminary injunction, \n \n  whether the threatened harm outweighs the harm to the \nadversary from a preliminary injunction, and \n \n  whether the preliminary injunction would harm the public \ninterest. \n \nDiné Citizens Against Ruining Our Env’t, 839 F.3d at 1281. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 68 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 66     \nII.  For PPKM, any individual right would not have been broad \nenough for the Jane Doe plaintiffs to challenge Kansas’s \ntermination under § 1396a(p)(1).  \n \nFor PPKM, the critical question is the scope of the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs’ alleged right under the free-choice-of-provider clause. In \ndistrict court, Kansas argued that \n  it had excluded PPKM based on § 1396a(p)(1) and  \n \n  the Jane Doe plaintiffs lacked an unambiguous right allowing \nthem to challenge Kansas’s application of § 1396a(p)(1).  \n \nThe district court rejected these arguments, holding that the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs could challenge Kansas’s determination that PPKM had violated \nstate law. The court reasoned that if the result were otherwise, a state \ncould simply evade judicial review by improperly terminating a provider \nunder state law:  \nIf  a  State  could  defeat  a  Medicaid  recipient’s  right  to \nselect  a  particular  qualified  healthcare  provider  merely  by \nterminating  its  agreement  with  that  provider  on  an  unlawful \nbasis, the right would be totally eviscerated. \n \nPlanned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v. Mosier, No. 16-2284-JAR-GLR, \n2016 WL 3597457, at *17 (D. Kan. July 5, 2016) (quoting Planned \nParenthood Se., Inc. v. Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 3d 1207, 1218 (M.D. Ala. \n2015)).  \nThis reasoning led the court to consider whether PPKM had violated \nKansas law. The court answered “no” and concluded, as a result, that \nKansas had likely violated the free-choice-of-provider clause. Because the \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 69 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 67     \nother preliminary-injunction factors supported the Jane Doe plaintiffs, the \ndistrict court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction. \n  Kansas appeals, presenting four pertinent arguments as to PPKM6: \n \n1.  This case is not justiciable. \n \n2.  The district court should have abstained. \n \n3.  The plaintiffs lack an individually enforceable right under the \nfree-choice-of-provider clause. \n \n4.  Even if an individually enforceable right existed, it would not \nallow the plaintiffs to challenge Kansas’s actions, which were \nbased on Kansas law as authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1). \n \nI agree with the majority that the case is justiciable and that the district \ncourt had no need to abstain. I will also assume, for the sake of argument, \nthat the Jane Doe plaintiffs have an individual right under the free-choice-\nof-provider clause. The resulting question entails the extent of that right. \nUnder the free-choice-of-provider clause, the state’s Medicaid \nprogram must provide that Medicaid patients can obtain medical care from \nqualified providers. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). Kansas’s Medicaid program \ncomplied with this requirement, for the program’s only exclusions were \nbased on provisions authorized by Medicaid itself.7  \n                                              \n6   Kansas also defends its findings that PPKM had violated state law \nand argues that the Jane Doe plaintiffs had not faced irreparable harm. \n \n7   In some of the cases invoked by PPKM, the state Medicaid programs \ncontained exclusions unauthorized by Medicaid or any other federal law. \nSee, e.g., Planned Parenthood Ariz. Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, 962-63 \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 70 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 68     \nKansas terminated PPKM for purportedly violating Kansas laws \nauthorized by a separate Medicaid provision: 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1). In \nlight of this termination, the Jane Doe plaintiffs seek to litigate whether \nPPKM actually violated Kansas law. But the Jane Doe plaintiffs can \nlitigate this issue only if their underlying right unambiguously extends to \nKansas’s application of its own state law. See Harris v. James, 127 F.3d \n993, 1011-12 (11th Cir. 1997).8  \n                                                                                                                                                  \n(9th Cir. 2013) (state law that excluded all abortion providers from \nMedicaid was not authorized by § 1396a(p)(1) or other federal law); \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind. v. Comm’r of the Ind. State Dep’t of Health, \n699 F.3d 962, 979-80 (7th Cir. 2012) (same). \n \n8   In Harris v. James, Medicaid recipients sued under § 1983, alleging \nthat the state’s Medicaid program failed to provide transportation to and \nfrom providers. 127 F.3d 993, 995 (11th Cir. 1997). The Medicaid \nrecipients relied in part on the free-choice-of-provider clause. Id. at 1011. \nThe Eleventh Circuit assumed, for the sake of argument, that the free-\nchoice-of-provider clause provided an individually enforceable right. Id. at \n1011 & n.27. But the court concluded that this potential right would not \nhave unambiguously included transportation to and from providers: \n \nIn other words, we do not think that transportation to and from \nproviders is reasonably understood to be part of the content of \na right to . . . choice among providers. Instead, if the regulation \n[invoked by the Medicaid recipients] is a valid interpretation of \n[Medicaid  provisions  including  the  free-choice-of-provider \nclause], it would be because transportation may be a reasonable \nmeans  of  ensuring  the  prompt  provision  of  . . . choice  among \nproviders. Such links to Congressional intent may be sufficient \nto support the validity of a regulation; however, we think they \nare  too  tenuous  to  support  a  conclusion  that  Congress  has \nunambiguously  conferred  upon  Medicaid  recipients  a  federal \nright to transportation enforceable under § 1983. \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 71 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 69     \nAs a result, we must ask: Has Congress unambiguously conferred the \nJane Doe plaintiffs with a right to have states properly apply their laws \n(authorized by § 1396a(p)(1)) to Medicaid providers? Or, as the text of the \nfree-choice-of-provider clause suggests, has Congress conferred the Jane \nDoe plaintiffs with only a right to be covered under a program (like \nKansas’s program) that does not contain unauthorized exclusionary \nprovisions? In my view, the answer is—at best—ambiguous. Thus, if an \nindividually enforceable right existed here, it would not encompass a \nchallenge to Kansas’s termination of PPKM.  \nA.  Standard of Review \n \nWe review the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction for \nan abuse of discretion. Verlo v. Martinez, 820 F.3d 1113, 1124 (10th Cir. \n2016). The court abuses its discretion when committing an error of law or \nmaking factual findings that are clearly erroneous. Id. In my view, the \ndistrict court committed a legal error by ruling that the Jane Doe plaintiffs \ncould litigate Kansas’s application of its laws authorized by § 1396a(p)(1).  \nB.  Section 1983 \n \nThis suit is brought under § 1983, not the Medicaid Act. Thus, we \nmust start with the scope of § 1983. This statute creates a private right of \naction for U.S. citizens denied rights created by federal laws. 42 U.S.C. \n                                                                                                                                                  \nId. at 1011-12 (emphasis in original). \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 72 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 70     \n§ 1983. But § 1983 does not authorize relief for every violation of federal \nlaw. City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 119 (2005).  \nTo determine whether § 1983 provides a mechanism for relief, the \nJane Doe plaintiffs must demonstrate that Congress intended to create an \nenforceable right. Id. at 120. The Supreme Court said in Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe that a right is individually enforceable only if Congress \nhad unambiguously created that right. 536 U.S. 273, 283-84 (2002). “After \nGonzaga, an enforceable private right exists only if the statute contains \nnothing ‘short of an unambiguously conferred right’ and not merely a \nvague benefit or interest.” Mandy R. ex rel. Mr. & Mrs. R. v. Owens, 464 \nF.3d 1139, 1147 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283). It is \nnot enough simply to show that a plaintiff “falls within the general zone of \ninterest that the statute is intended to protect.” Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283.  \n  C.  Medicaid \nWe must apply this § 1983 requirement against the backdrop of \nMedicaid.  \nMedicaid is a cooperative federal-state program in which states \nobtain federal funds to provide medical care to needy individuals. Wilder \nv. Va. Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 502 (1990). State participation is \nvoluntary; but once states opt into the program, they must adhere to \nstatutory requirements and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services (“HHS”). Id. Congress has directed the HHS \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 73 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 71     \nSecretary to withhold federal funds from states violating these \nrequirements. 42 U.S.C. § 1396c. \n  To participate in Medicaid, states must obtain approval of their plans \nfrom the HHS Secretary. Wilder, 496 U.S. at 502. These plans must \ndescribe the nature and scope of the state’s proposed health-care program. \nId. The statutory requirements for the plans are set forth in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a). One such requirement appears in the free-choice-of-provider \nclause underlying this suit. \n  Under this clause, a state plan must provide for eligible individuals \nto obtain medical care from any willing provider “qualified to perform the \nservice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A). Based on this provision, the Jane \nDoe plaintiffs claim that Kansas improperly terminated PPKM even though \nit was “qualified” to provide medical care. \n  But a federal court would ordinarily lack jurisdiction to consider a \nMedicaid recipient’s claim involving the state’s violation of its own \nMedicaid program. Concourse Rehab. & Nursing Ctr. Inc. v. DeBueno, 179 \nF.3d 38, 43-44 (2d Cir. 1999). To create federal jurisdiction, the Medicaid \nrecipient must allege a conflict between the state Medicaid program and a \nfederal law. Id. Thus, we must consider whether the Jane Doe plaintiffs \nhave alleged a conflict between the Kansas Medicaid program and a federal \nlaw. See id. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 74 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 72     \nThe Jane Doe plaintiffs point to the free-choice-of-provider clause. \nThus, we must first consider whether this clause provides Medicaid \npatients with a federal right enforceable under § 1983. Four circuits have \nsaid “yes”;9 one has said “no.”10 Today, the majority joins the four circuits \nthat have answered “yes.” Majority Op. at 32. We can assume, for the sake \nof argument, that the majority is right. \nWith this assumption, we must consider whether the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs have alleged a conflict between Kansas’s Medicaid program and \nthe free-choice-of-provider clause. To answer that question, we must \ndetermine the scope of this clause. At first glance, the free-choice-of-\nprovider clause might appear to force a state to allow any qualified \nprovider into the state’s Medicaid program. But “Medicaid’s freedom of \nchoice provision is not absolute.” Kelly Kare, Ltd. v. O’Rourke, 930 F.2d \n170, 177 (2d Cir. 1991). Rather, Medicaid allows states to exclude \nproviders from Medicaid, sometimes even when the providers are qualified. \nE.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(39), (p)(1).  \n                                              \n9   Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 862 F.3d 445, 460-61 \n(5th Cir. 2017); Planned Parenthood Ariz. Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, \n966-67 (9th Cir. 2013); Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. \nState Dep’t of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 974-75 (7th Cir. 2012); Harris v. \nOlszewski, 442 F.3d 456, 461-62 (6th Cir. 2006). \n \n10   Does v. Gillespie, 867 F.3d 1034, 1042-43 (8th Cir. 2017). \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 75 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 73     \nFor example, states can exclude providers from Medicaid for \nviolating certain types of state laws. A state’s authority to take such action \nstems partly from 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1), which is entitled “Exclusion \npower of State.” Section 1396a(p)(1) identifies grounds for a state to \nexclude a provider: \nIn  addition  to  any  other  authority,  a  State  may  exclude  any \nindividual  or  entity  for  purposes  of  participating  under  the \nState plan under this subchapter for any reason for which the \nSecretary  could  exclude  the  individual  or  entity  from \nparticipation  in  a  program  under  subchapter  XVIII  of  this \nchapter  under  section  1320a-7,  1320a-7a,  or  1395cc(b)(2)  of \nthis title. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1).  \nThe HHS implements § 1396a(p)(1) through a regulation, which \nstates that the listed exclusion provisions are “[i]n addition to any other \nauthority [a state] may have.” 42 C.F.R. § 1002.3(a). This language is to be \nread broadly: “Nothing contained in this part should be construed to limit a \nState’s own authority to exclude an individual or entity from Medicaid for \nany reason or period authorized by State law.” Id. § 1002.3(b).  \nKansas maintains that the legality of its actions is determined by \n§ 1396a(p)(1), not the free-choice-of-provider clause, and argues that the \nJane Doe plaintiffs therefore lacked an applicable right to challenge \nKansas’s application of its laws.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 76 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 74     \nD.  Section 1983 does not provide a mechanism for the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs to challenge Kansas’s application of its laws \nauthorized by § 1396a(p)(1). \n \nTo determine whether the free-choice-of-provider clause supports \nrelief under § 1983, we must resolve two questions: \n1.  Do the pertinent Kansas laws fall within the scope of \n§ 1396a(p)(1)? I would answer “yes.” \n \n2.  Does the free-choice-of-provider clause entitle the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs to challenge Kansas’s application of these laws? If \nsuch an entitlement exists, it is at least ambiguous, which is \nfatal to the Jane Doe plaintiffs’ claim. \n \n  1.   Kansas’s laws fall within § 1396a(p)(1). \nKansas terminated PPKM under Kansas Administrative Regulation \n§ 30-5-60(a). This provision authorizes Kansas to terminate a provider that \nhas violated applicable state regulations. Kan. Admin. Regs. § 30-5-\n60(a)(2). Invoking this authority, Kansas found that PPKM had violated a \nKansas solid-waste regulation—§ 28-29-16(a)(1)—by obstructing a solid-\nwaste inspection of PPKM’s facility. The resulting issue is whether \nCongress has authorized Kansas under § 1396a(p)(1) to exclude providers \nfrom Medicaid for violating Kansas’s solid-waste regulation. \nWe begin with the statutory text. Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, \n471 U.S. 681, 685 (1985). The critical part of the statute is the word “any” \nin the phrase “any other authority.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1). When \nconstruing the word “any,” we consider its “‘ordinary meaning.’” Moskal \nv. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 108 (1990) (quoting Richards v. United \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 77 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 75     \nStates, 369 U.S. 1, 9 (1962)). The word “any” ordinarily means “[o]ne, \nsome, every, or all without specification.” The American Heritage College \nDictionary 61 (3d ed. 1997). Thus, at first glance, § 1396a(p)(1) would \nappear to provide states with unchecked authority to exclude providers \nfrom Medicaid for any reason permitted by state law. \nBut we have always construed statutory language in context. United \nStates v. Collins, 859 F.3d 1207, 1213 (10th Cir. 2017); see Christopher v. \nSmithKline Beecham Corp, 567 U.S. 142, 162 (2012) (“[T]he modifier \n‘any’ can mean ‘different things depending upon the setting . . . .’” \n(quoting Nixon v. Mo. Mun. League, 541 U.S. 125, 132 (2004))). The \ncontext here comprises Congress’s list of permissible reasons for a state to \nterminate providers. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1). If Congress had intended \nto allow unlimited authority, the listed provisions in § 1396a(p)(1) would \nhave been superfluous. See McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, \n2369 (2016) (recognizing a presumption that statutory language is not \nsuperfluous). Thus, the phrase “any other authority” in § 1396a(p)(1) must \nbear some limitation. \nWhat is that limitation? To answer, we consider the canon of noscitur \na sociis. Under this canon, an ambiguous term may be “given more precise \ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is associated.” United \nStates v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 294 (2008). Thus, we consider the \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 78 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 76     \nlimitation of “any other authority” based on the surrounding words in the \nstatute. United States v. Phillips, 543 F.3d 1197, 1206 (10th Cir. 2008). \nIn this case, the neighboring words in § 1396a(p)(1) are three \nspecific statutory provisions that a state may invoke to justify a provider’s \ntermination: 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, and 1395cc(b)(2). See 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1) (“[A] State may exclude . . . for any reason for which \nthe Secretary could exclude . . . under [§§] 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, or \n1395cc(b)(2) of this title.”). Having identified these three provisions, we \nshould consider whether they help define the phrase “any other authority” \nin § 1396a(p)(1). See Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 226 \n(2008).11 \nThe three cited statutes include grounds to exclude or terminate \nproviders. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, 1395cc(b)(2). The Fifth, \nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits have observed that the grounds for termination \ninvolved “various forms of malfeasance,” such as “fraud, drug crimes, and \nfailure to disclose necessary information to regulators.” Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 699 F.3d \n                                              \n11   Of the situations listed in those three statutes, we are concerned only \nwith exclusionary powers that are optional for the HHS Secretary. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1) (stating “reason[s] for which the Secretary could \nexclude” a provider from participation). The three statutes also include \nexclusionary provisions that are mandatory. A separate section requires \nthat states exclude providers under these mandatory provisions. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(39). \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 79 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 77     \n962, 979 (7th Cir. 2012); Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, \n862 F.3d 445, 469 (5th Cir. 2017); Planned Parenthood Ariz. Inc. v. \nBetlach, 727 F.3d 960, 972 (9th Cir. 2013). I agree with these courts. Thus, \nI too conclude that the phrase “any other authority” likely refers to state \nlaws that prohibit acts of “malfeasance.”  \nBut what do we mean by “malfeasance”? The Fifth and Ninth Circuits \nanswer that the state laws must address conduct “analogous” to what is \ncovered in the three cited statutes. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, 862 \nF.3d at 465; Planned Parenthood Ariz., 727 F.3d at 972. The majority takes \na similar approach. Majority Op. at 45-46. \nIn my view, this approach rests on an unduly restrictive definition of \n“malfeasance.” Certainly Congress intended to impose some limits on the \nstates’ adoption of Medicaid-related laws. But Congress intended to give \nstates broad authority in light of the HHS regulations and the legislative \nhistory.  \nThe regulations interpret the phrase “any other authority” in \n§ 1396a(p)(1) to mean “any other authority [that a State] may have.” 42 \nC.F.R. § 1002.3(a) (emphasis added). And the regulations allow a state to \nexclude a provider “for any reason or period authorized by state law.” Id. \n§ 1002.3(b) (emphasis added). In fact, when promulgating § 1002.3, the \nHHS Secretary expressly rejected a suggestion to add the words “for \ncause” into § 1002.3(b). See Amendments to OIG Exclusion and CMP \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 80 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 78     \nAuthorities Resulting from Public Law 100-93, 57 Fed. Reg. 3298, 3322-23 \n(Jan. 29, 1992). The HHS Secretary explained that Congress had spoken \nbroadly, so it was “up to the various courts and legislative bodies” to \nconsider whether § 1396a(p)(1) had a limitation. Id. at 3323. \nA Senate Report also indicates that Congress intended for \n§ 1396a(p)(1) to provide the states with broad authority: “This provision is \nnot intended to preclude a State from establishing, under State law, any \nother bases for excluding individuals or entities from its Medicaid \nprogram.” S. Rep. No. 100-109, at 20 (1987) (emphasis added), as \nreprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 682, 700; see also First Med. Health Plan, \nInc. v. Vega-Ramos, 479 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2007) (“The legislative \nhistory clarifies that this ‘any other authority’ language was intended to \npermit a state to exclude an entity from its Medicaid program for any \nreason established by state law.” (emphasis in original)). \nIn light of the HHS regulations and the legislative history, the need \nto provide some limitation does not require us to narrowly read the phrase \n“any other authority.” Doing so “would defeat Congress’ intent to define \n[this phrase] in a broad manner.” Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham \nCorp., 567 U.S. 142, 163 (2012). Thus, the term “malfeasance” should be \nread broadly.  \nUnder a broad reading of “malfeasance,” a state would not be able to \npass any law and claim that violating the law constitutes an act of \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 81 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 79     \nmalfeasance. Rather, the state law must “serve[] some Medicaid-related \ngoals.” Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644, 663 \n(2003) (plurality op.). For this reason, § 1396a(p)(1) authorizes states to \nenact laws against wrongful conduct affecting Medicaid-related goals. And \nstates may then enact a law, as Kansas did, which excludes a provider for \nviolating these laws.  \nUnder this definition, a state would enjoy broad authority, but this \nauthority would not go unchecked. For example, a state could not \ncircumvent Medicaid’s purpose by enacting laws to undermine or bypass \nthe Medicaid provisions. Here the Jane Doe plaintiffs have not alleged that \nKansas’s laws were designed to undermine or bypass Medicaid.  \nBut let’s assume for the sake of argument that the majority’s narrow \ndefinition of “malfeasance” is right. Under this approach, § 1396a(p)(1) \nallows states to exclude providers for violating state laws that prohibit \nconduct “analogous” to conduct excludable under the three statutes listed \nin § 1396a(p)(1). Majority Op. at 45-46. Even under the majority’s \napproach, Kansas’s termination of PPKM would constitute action \nauthorized by § 1396a(p)(1). \n  Kansas’s termination of PPKM was based on Kansas Administrative \nRegulation § 28-29-16(a)(1). That provision states: \nThe [Kansas Secretary of Health and Environment] or any duly \nauthorized  representative  of  the  secretary,  at  any  reasonable \nhour of the day, having identified themselves and giving notice \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 82 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 80     \nof  their  purpose,  may  . . .  [e]nter  . . .  any  environment  where \nsolid  wastes  are  generated,  stored,  handled,  processed,  or \ndisposed,  and  inspect  the  premises  and  gather  information  of \nexisting conditions and procedures . . . . \n \nKan. Admin. Regs. § 28-29-16(a)(1). This provision is analogous to the \nfederal statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(12)(C),12 which is identified in \n§ 1396a(p)(1) as a basis to terminate a provider. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(p)(1). The federal statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(12)(C), allows \nfor the termination of \n[a]ny individual or entity that fails to grant immediate access, \nupon reasonable request (as defined by the [HHS] Secretary in \nregulations) to any of the following: . . . . \n                                              \n12   Kansas has argued that it could exclude PPKM under Kansas \nAdministrative Regulation § 28-29-16(a)(1) because it had been enacted \nunder § 1396a(p)(1). Appellant’s Opening Br. at 48 (quoting Planned \nParenthood Ariz. Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, 972 (9th Cir. 2013)). In \nmaking this argument, Kansas did not specifically point to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1320a-7(b)(12)(C). Instead, Kansas relied on 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-\n7(b)(12)(B). But to address Kansas’s interpretation of § 1396a(p)(1), we \nmust address the Medicaid statute as a whole. See Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 \nU.S. 305, 319 (2010) (“In sum, ‘[w]e do not . . . construe statutory phrases \nin isolation; we read statutes as a whole.’” (quoting United States v. \nMorton, 467 U.S. 822, 828 (1984)) (alteration and omission in original)); \nGraham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. U.S. ex rel. Wilson, 559 \nU.S. 280, 290 (2010) (“Courts have a ‘duty to construe statues, not isolated \nprovisions.’” (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 568 (1995))). \nIn construing the statute as a whole, we are not restricted to the sections \ncited by the parties. See United States v. Vallery, 437 F.3d 626, 632-33 \n(7th Cir. 2006) (considering parts of a statute not relied upon by either side \nbecause of the court’s obligation to take into account the meaning of the \nstatute as a whole); see also WWC Holding Co. v. Sopkin, 488 F.3d 1262, \n1276 n.10 (10th Cir. 2007) (stating that the court can interpret a statute \ndifferently than both parties because we engage in de novo review when \ninterpreting statutes).  \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 83 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 81     \n \nTo  the  Inspector  General  of  [HHS],  for  the  purpose  of \nreviewing records, documents, and other data necessary to the \nperformance of the statutory functions of the Inspector General. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(12)(C). The question here is whether § 1320a-\n7(b)(12)(C) and Kansas Administrative Regulation § 28-29-16(a)(1) are \nanalogous. The two can be analogous if they bear similarities even though \nsome differences exist. See American Heritage College Dictionary 48 (3d \ned. 1997) (defining an “analogy” as “[s]imilarity in some respects between \nthings that are otherwise dissimilar”). In addressing whether the provisions \nare analogous, we are trying to determine whether the state law prohibits \nthe same type of “malfeasance” covered in the statutes listed in \n§ 1396a(p)(1). See Planned Parenthood Ariz. Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, \n972 (9th Cir. 2013). Thus, we must focus on the conduct covered by \nKansas Administrative Regulation § 28-29-16(a)(1) and determine whether \nthis conduct bears similarities to the conduct addressed in § 1320a-\n7(b)(12)(C). \n  The conduct being prohibited is similar in the two provisions. For \nexample, both provisions require certain entities to provide access to \ngovernment officials so that they can inspect the premises. A provider \nviolates both provisions by refusing to allow access to government \ninspectors, rendering the prohibited conduct analogous. In light of these \nsimilarities, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1) authorized Kansas to terminate \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 84 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 82     \nproviders from Medicaid based on a violation of the state law requiring \naccess for a governmental inspection. \n  2.   The Jane Doe Plaintiffs’ Cause of Action \n  The resulting issue is whether the free-choice-of-provider clause \nallowed the Jane Doe plaintiffs to challenge Kansas’s application of \n§ 1396a(p)(1). The answer is (at best) ambiguous, which is fatal to the Jane \nDoe plaintiffs’ claim. \nThe district court allowed the Jane Doe plaintiffs to invoke § 1983 to \nchallenge Kansas’s action as a violation of the free-choice-of-provider \nclause. The problem is that Kansas’s action was of a type authorized by a \nseparate Medicaid provision: § 1396a(p)(1). The district court \nacknowledged this authorization, but feared that the inability to use § 1983 \nin these circumstances could allow states to evade judicial review of \nMedicaid-related decisions, rendering the free-choice-of-provider clause a \nhollow right. See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v. Mosier, No. \n16-2284-JAR-GLR, 2016 WL 3597457, at *17 (D. Kan. July 5, 2016). \nThis fear does not permit us to broaden § 1983 to allow a private \nright of action to challenge administrative action taken under \n§ 1396a(p)(1), for it is not our function as judges to create a cause of \naction to enforce a statute that does not confer an unambiguous federal \nright. Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002). \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 85 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 83     \nUntil today, no majority opinion of another circuit court has \naddressed this issue in a holding: The issue did not arise in Planned \nParenthood of Indiana or in Planned Parenthood Arizona, as the states’ \nactions there were not of a type authorized by a Medicaid provision. \nRather, the states in Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Planned \nParenthood Arizona had tried to preemptively exclude—as a class—any \nprovider that performed abortion services. Planned Parenthood Ariz. Inc. \nv. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, 962 (9th Cir. 2013); Planned Parenthood of Ind., \nInc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dept. of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir. \n2012). Section 1396a(p)(1) was relevant only because the states had argued \nthat § 1396a(p)(1) provided unchecked authority to terminate providers. \nThat argument has been soundly rejected. See Planned Parenthood Ariz., \n727 F.3d at 971-72; Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 979-80.  \nUnlike in those cases, Kansas argues that its actions under Kansas \nAdministrative Regulation § 28-29-16(a)(1) were justified under the \nprovisions listed in § 1396a(p)(1). That difference matters, as the Ninth \nCircuit explained in Planned Parenthood Arizona: \n[Section  1396a(p)(1)]  do[es]  not  apply  here.  [Arizona’s \nabortion law] does not set out grounds for excluding individual \nproviders  from  Arizona’s  Medicaid  program  demonstrated  to \nhave engaged in some type of criminal, fraudulent, abusive, or \notherwise  improper  behavior.  Rather,  it  preemptively  bars  a \nclass  of  providers  on  the  ground  that  their  scope  of  practice \nincludes certain perfectly legal medical procedures. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 86 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 84     \nPlanned Parenthood Ariz., 727 F.3d at 973 (emphases in original).13 \nKansas is doing here what the state had declined to do in Planned \nParenthood Arizona. \nThe Fifth Circuit in Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast did address \nthe issue. But the court there did so only in dicta, as the state had not \nargued that its actions were analogous to any of the provisions listed in \n§ 1396a(p)(1). See Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 862 \nF.3d 445, 466 (5th Cir. 2017) (“[The State agency does not] even assert \nthat its grounds for termination are consistent or analogous with 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(p)(1)’s enumerated grounds for exclusion.”). But see id. at 478-79 \n(Owen, J., dissenting) (concluding that the state had justified its actions \nunder § 1396a(p)(1), which should have prevented the majority from \nreaching the merits). In dicta, the court discussed the bounds of the right \nunder the free-choice-of-provider clause: \n[T]he  free-choice-of-provider  [clause]  gives  individuals  the \nright to demand care from a qualified provider when access to \nthat  provider  is  foreclosed  by  reasons  unrelated  to  that \nprovider’s  qualifications.  Otherwise,  any  right  to  which  the \n[plaintiffs]  are  entitled  to  under  [the  free-choice-of-provider \nclause] would be hollow. \n \n                                              \n13   Similarly, in Harris v. Olszewski, the Sixth Circuit did not consider \nour issue involving the interplay between the free-choice-of-provider \nclause and § 1396a(p)(1). See generally Harris v. Olszewski, 442 F.3d 456 \n(6th Cir. 2006). \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 87 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 85     \nId. at 462 (majority op.) (emphasis in original) (citing Planned Parenthood \nSe., Inc. v. Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 3d 1207, 1218 (M.D. Ala. 2015)). \n  The Fifth Circuit feared that limiting the plaintiffs’ cause of action \nwould render the free-choice-of-provider clause “hollow,” relying on \nPlanned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. v. Bentley, a district court case. 141 F. \nSupp. 3d at 1217-18. In Planned Parenthood Southeast, the district court \nsquarely considered the present issue. Id. The court acknowledged that \nthere “plainly are some reasons that a State may terminate a provider . . . \nother than the provider being unqualified.” Id. at 1218. But the district \ncourt concluded—without any pertinent citation—that the free-choice-of-\nprovider clause must allow plaintiffs to challenge those reasons or result in \n“evisceration” of the clause. Id. This reasoning is unconvincing for two \nreasons.  \nFirst, even with the absence of a private right of action to litigate the \napplication of state laws authorized by § 1396a(p)(1), plaintiffs could still \nchallenge a state Medicaid program that expressly limited the choice of \nqualified providers without any separate statutory authority. E.g., Planned \nParenthood Ariz., 727 F.3d at 964 (state program excluded all abortion \nproviders from Medicaid); Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 967 \n(same); Harris, 442 F.3d at 460 (state program limited the sale of \nincontinence products to a single provider). Thus, even if the Jane Doe \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 88 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 86     \nplaintiffs were forbidden from bringing the present suit, their right under \nthe free-choice-of-provider clause would not be a hollow one.  \n  Second, even if the inability to invoke § 1983 would render the free-\nchoice-of-provider clause “a hollow right,” this problem would be for \nCongress to fix. See Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 579 \n(1979) (“[Plaintiffs] contend that the result we reach sanctions injustice. \nBut even if that were the case, the argument is made in the wrong forum, \nfor we are not at liberty to legislate.”). Our job is only to determine \nwhether Congress has “manifest[ed] an ‘unambiguous[]’ intent to confer \nindividual rights.” Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002) (first \nalteration in original) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). “[W]hat matters is the law the \nLegislature did enact,” not what we think the law should have said. Shady \nGrove Orthopedic Assocs. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 403 (2010) \n(emphasis in original).  \nThe resulting issue is whether the free-choice-of-provider clause \nunambiguously provided the Jane Doe plaintiffs with a right to have states \nproperly apply their laws (authorized by § 1396a(p)(1)) to Medicaid \nproviders. Or, instead, has Congress simply conferred the Jane Doe \nplaintiffs with a right to be covered under a program (like Kansas’s) that \ndoes not contain unauthorized exclusionary provisions? Though Congress \nhas arguably created an individual right under the free-choice-of-provider \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 89 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 87     \nclause, the scope of that right remains ambiguous when the state terminates \na provider under § 1396a(p)(1).  \n* * * \nIn district court, the plaintiffs did not demonstrate the presence of a \nfederal right that is actionable under § 1983. The text of the free-choice-\nof-provider clause directs states to create Medicaid programs that do not \nlimit access to qualified providers without separate statutory authorization.  \nTo claim an enforceable right to obtain medical care from any \nprovider, it is not enough to show that Congress generally intended for the \nfree-choice-of-provider clause to protect the Jane Doe plaintiffs’ choice of \nproviders. See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283; see also Planned Parenthood of \nGulf Coast, 862 F.3d at 474 (Owen, J., dissenting) (“[The free-choice-of-\nprovider clause] does not give a patient the right to contest a State’s \ndetermination that a provider . . . has not otherwise met state or federal \nstatutory requirements.”). Instead, the Jane Doe plaintiffs could succeed on \nthe merits only if Congress had unambiguously extended the right under \nthe free-choice-of-provider clause to allow challenges to a state’s \napplication of its laws adopted under § 1396a(p)(1). See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 283. In my view, the applicability of this right is, at best, ambiguous.  \nThe ambiguity prevents an applicable right, which in turn prevents \nthe Jane Doe plaintiffs from establishing likelihood of success in their \nchallenge to PPKM’s termination. And the inability to establish likelihood \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-KGG   Document 84   Filed 01/23/19   Page 90 of 90\nAppellate Case: 16-3249     Document: 01019948066     Date Filed: 02/21/2018     Page: 88     \nof success prevents a preliminary injunction. Diné Citizens Against \nRuining our Env’t v. Jewell, 839 F.3d 1276, 1281 (10th Cir. 2016). \nIII.  Conclusion \n \nIn my view, the free-choice-of-provider clause does not \nunambiguously provide the Jane Doe plaintiffs with a right to challenge \nKansas’s application of § 1396a(p)(1). Therefore, the Jane Doe plaintiffs \nlacked an enforceable right to challenge Kansas’s action. The lack of an \nenforceable right should have precluded the award of a preliminary \ninjunction to the Jane Doe plaintiffs.  \nFor these reasons, I would reverse the grant of a preliminary \ninjunction to the Jane Doe plaintiffs as to both PPSLR and PPKM. The \nmajority reverses the grant of a preliminary injunction as to PPSLR but \naffirms the grant of a preliminary injunction as to PPKM. Therefore, I join \nthe majority as to PPSLR and respectfully dissent as to PPKM. \n27 \n ",

The KDHE \nprovided three grounds for the termination decisions: (1) video evidence about practices by other \nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America (“PPFA”) affiliates that include unlawful agreements \nto procure fetal tissue after abortions; (2) PPKM’s failure to cooperate with KDHE solid waste \ndisposal inspections; and (3) claims submission concerns about other PPFA affiliates identified \nby neighboring states.  Plaintiffs PPKM, PPSLR, the individual providers, and three Jane Doe \npatient Plaintiffs filed this action challenging the KDHE’s decision under the Medicaid Act and \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, and sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief from the termination decisions.

On June 29, 2016, the individual providers voluntarily dismissed their claims in this \nmatter.1 \n  Before the Court are Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary \nInjunction (Doc. 12); Motion to Certify Class (Doc. 14), and Motion to Strike Exhibits (Doc. 51).  \nThese motions are fully briefed, and the Court heard argument on the preliminary injunction \nmotion on June 7, 2016.  The Court considers the motion for preliminary injunction as it pertains \nto PPKM and PPSLR only.  \n  On June 24, 2016, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 59), re-arguing some of the \njusticiability arguments raised in response to the motion for preliminary injunction, adding \nothers, and challenging both of Plaintiffs’ claims under Fed.

This motion is not fully briefed, but the Court at this time considers Defendant’s \njusticiability challenges, to the extent necessary to rule on the motion for preliminary injunction.  \n  Having fully considered the parties’ arguments and evidence on these issues, the Court is \nprepared to rule.  As described more fully below, Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction is \ngranted and the class certification motion is denied without prejudice.  The motion to strike is \ndenied.

The Court finds that the information provided in these \ndeclarations is within the scope of each declarant’s personal knowledge, given their roles in these \norganizations. \n  For forty years, PPKM (and its predecessor organizations) has been a Medicaid provider \nfor thousands of Kansans.  PPKM provides Medicaid services to Kansas residents at two health \ncenters in Kansas and three health centers in nearby cities in Missouri.  In 2014, PPKM and \naffiliated providers provided family planning services at approximately 750 visits to nearly 500 \nMedicaid patients.  In 2015, PPKM and affiliated providers provided services at over 650 visits \nto nearly 450 Medicaid patients.  PPKM offers a range of family planning and other health \nservices, including annual exams, contraception (including long-acting reversible contraception \nor “LARC”) and contraceptive counseling, hormonal counseling, screening for breast cancer, \nscreening and treatment for cervical cancer, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted \ninfections (“STIs”), including human papilloma virus (“HPV”) vaccines, pregnancy testing and \ncounseling, and other limited general health services, such as hemoglobin testing for anemia.  \nThe Wichita, Kansas City, and Independence health centers are in areas that have primary care \nprovider shortages. \n  PPSLR operates several health centers in Missouri, including a health center in Joplin, \nMissouri, which is located approximately seven miles from the Kansas border and provides \nfamily planning health services to a small number of Kansas Medicaid patients each year, \nincluding well-woman exams, contraception (including LARC) and contraceptive counseling, \n                                                 \n2Doc. 13-2, Ex. 1,  McQuade Decl.; Doc. 13-3, Ex. 2, Kogut Decl.; see also Doc. 49-2, Ex. 1, McQuade \nSupp. Decl.; Doc. 49-3, Ex. 2, Kogut Supp. Decl.  \n3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 4 of 54\nhormonal counseling, screening for breast cancer, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, \nscreening and treatment for STIs, including HPV vaccines, and pregnancy testing and \ncounseling.  PPSLR’s Joplin, Missouri health center is located in a Primary Care Health \nProfessional Shortage Area (“HPSA”), and Cherokee County, Kansas, the county directly across \nthe border from Joplin, Missouri is also in a Primary Care HPSA and is designated as a \nMedically Underserved Population Area. \n  In 2013, the Kansas Medicaid program implemented KanCare and moved from a  \nfee-for-service program model to a managed care program model.  PPKM enrolled as a KanCare \nprovider at that time with three managed care organizations (“MCOs”) that the State of Kansas \ncontracted with to coordinate care for nearly all of its Medicaid beneficiaries.  Defendant has \nsubmitted a 2016 contractual amendment to its contracts with the MCOs, which provides that a \ncontract termination with a Medicaid provider “shall be effective 30 calendar days after \nnotification from the State that the provider’s state fair hearing rights have expired or the state \nfair hearing has been completed related to the Medicaid termination.”3  But PPKM has attested \nthat its contracts with the various MCOs do not contain this provision, and instead allow for a \nquicker contract termination.4  PPSLR does not have contracts with the MCOs that coordinate \ncare for most Medicaid patients in Kansas.  \n  In order to qualify for Kansas Medicaid/KanCare, among other requirements, an adult \nmust be low-income and either pregnant, disabled or a parent.  For example, the monthly income \nfor a family of four cannot exceed $768.  Medicaid does not pay for abortions for Kansas women \n                                                 \n3Doc. 37-11, Ex. 1-J at 10.  \n4Doc. 49-2, Ex. A ¶ 17, Ex.

That document provides details about the organizational \nstructure of PPFA: \nPPFA, which is the nation’s oldest and largest voluntary family planning \norganization, maintains primary domestic offices in New York City and \nWashington, DC . . . .  The Organization is also affiliated with 61 independent \nmedical and related entities, and 104 ancillary entities (including 55 Political \nAction Committees and 55-501(c)(4) organizations), all of which are separately \nincorporated in their respective states and which collectively constitute PPFA’s \nmembership.  Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements \ndo not include the financial position or the changes in net assets and cash flows of \nthese independent affiliated organizations.7 \n \nWith respect to financial support from PPFA, the document explains: \nThe National Program Support Plan (NPS) is a membership program between \nPPFA and Planned Parenthood Affiliates.  NPS requires affiliates to pay quarterly \nmembership dues to PPFA for the support and national visibility PPFA provides \nas well as the right to use the PPFA brand.  The revenue is recognized as an \nincrease to unrestricted net assets as the membership fees become due.8 \n \n                                                 \n5This funding restriction is commonly referred to as the “Hyde Amendment.”  See, e.g., Harris v.

The Fund receives board-designated resources as \nwell as affiliate and general-public contributions.  The Fund’s investment returns are used for \ndevelopment grants to affiliates.”9  As stated repeatedly throughout the record, PPKM and \nPPSLR are not subsidiaries of PPFA; they are separate corporations. PPKM and PPSLR are \nmembers of PPFA, which promulgates medical and other standards to which  affiliates must \nadhere in order to operate under the name “Planned Parenthood” and otherwise use the Planned \nParenthood mark.10  PPFA does not provide medical services or operate health centers.  PPFA \nexerted no control or ownership interest in PPKM or PPSLR in providing them with grants or \nother funding.   \n  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 is a PPKM patient who lives in Overland Park, Kansas and has \nreceived her annual well-woman gynecological exam at the Overland Park health center.  She \nqualifies for Medicaid until the spring of 2017.  Jane Doe #1 characterizes her care as excellent \nbased on the friendliness of the staff, and the fact that she does not feel judged because she is a \nsingle mother.  She states that the providers she saw at PPKM spent as much time as necessary \nexplaining to her the care she was getting and talked with her about her concerns.  PPKM was \nthe only provider that would schedule an appointment for her annual exam, getting her in for an \nappointment very quickly.  She wants to continue to receive her reproductive health care from \nPPKM and is not sure where she would get her care if it is not an option. \n  Plaintiff Jane Doe #2 is a long-time Planned Parenthood patient who has most recently \nreceived care at PPKM’s Overland Park health center.  She has received a range of health care \nservices including annual examinations, birth control (Depo-Provera shots), screening for STIs, \n                                                 \n9Id. at 23.  \n10Doc. 13-2, Ex. 1, McQuade Decl. ¶ 27; Doc. 13-2, Ex. 2, Kogut Decl. ¶ 10. \n6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 7 of 54\ntreatment for pre-cancerous cells, sexual health education, and breast cancer screenings.  Jane \nDoe #2 is currently disabled and relies on Medicaid for her health insurance.  She prefers going \nto Planned Parenthood because she believes they have an expertise in reproductive health care \nthat is unmatched by other providers, and she feels comfortable asking Planned Parenthood about \nanything related to her reproductive health care.  She wishes to continue to obtain her \nreproductive health care from Planned Parenthood and does not wish to find another provider.   \n  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3 is a PPKM patient who lives in Wichita, Kansas.  She is a KanCare \nrecipient and has no other health insurance.  At the PPKM health center in Wichita, she receives \nher annual examinations, follow up care after some abnormal pap smears, birth control, and STI \nscreening and treatment.  At a Planned Parenthood clinic in another state, she also received an \nabortion.  Most recently, the PPKM health center in Wichita provided her with a pregnancy \nconfirmation test.  She is currently 33 weeks pregnant.  After she has the baby, Jane Doe #3 \nplans to return to the Wichita health center for birth control.  Given her status as an established \npatient at PPKM, it is important to her to be able to return there for her reproductive health care.  \nShe believes that Planned Parenthood “saved my life in many ways by providing me the health \ncare that I needed at critical points in my life.”11 \n  In July 2015, a group called the Center for Medical Progress (“CMP”) released a series of \nYouTube videos purporting to depict representatives  from PPFA and from Planned Parenthood \naffiliates in other states discussing the illegal sale of fetal tissue and altering abortion procedures \nto preserve fetal tissue.  The videos themselves are not part of this record.  Instead, Defendant \nsubmits unauthenticated transcripts from two videos dated July 25, 2014,12 and February 6, \n                                                 \n11Doc. 7-2, Ex.

The 2015 transcript identifies the speakers as Mary Gatter, MD, President, Medical \nDirectors’ Council, PPFA and Medical Director, Planned Parenthood Pasadena & San Gabriel \nValley, Laurel Felczer, WHCNP, Senior Director of Medical Services, Planned Parenthood \nPasadena & Sun Gabriel Valley, and “Two actors posing as Fetal Tissue Procurement \nCompany.”  The parties vehemently dispute whether the transcripts are complete and reliable.14  \nBut it is undisputed that neither video transcript mentions PPKM, PPSLR, or any of their current \nor former employees.  It is also undisputed that PPKM and PPSLR do not participate in fetal \ntissue donation or sale.  \n  Kansas investigated PPKM about whether it failed to comply with Kansas law regarding \nfetal organs and tissue. “After careful review of the investigative materials,” the Disciplinary \nPanel of the Kansas Board of Healing Arts (“KBHA”) concluded on January 7, 2016, that no \nfurther action should be taken against PPKM.15  Also, the Missouri Attorney General \ninvestigated PPSLR and determined that there was no evidence of wrongdoing.  \n  A few weeks before the KBHA concluded its investigation, KDHE’s Bureau of Waste \nManagement (“BWM”) inspectors appeared unannounced at the PPKM Overland Park health \n                                                 \n13Doc. 37-3, Ex. 1-B.  \n14Plaintiffs move to strike the transcripts of these videos, attached to Defendant’s response as Exhibits 1-A \nand 1-B.

Moreover, the Court \nfinds that the authenticity and reliability of this evidence is not at issue at this time, given the Court’s finding infra \nthat because there is no dispute that the videos do not depict PPKM or PPSLR or their employees, and because \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that these affiliates are separate and distinct from PPFA and its other \naffiliates, attributing the conduct portrayed in these videos to these Plaintiffs was not a proper basis to exclude them \nas Medicaid providers under the Medicaid Act.  \n15Doc. 13-2, Ex. 1-A at 27.  \n8 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 9 of 54\ncare center on December 16, 2015, for a solid waste inspection pursuant to K.A.R. § 28-29-16.  \nThat regulation provides that a duly authorized representative of Secretary Mosier  \nat any reasonable hour of the day, having identified themselves and giving notice \nof their purpose, may: \n  (1) Enter a factory, plant, construction site, solid waste disposal area, solid \n  waste processing facility, or any environment where solid wastes are \n  generated, stored, handled, processed, or disposed, and inspect the \n  premises and gather information of existing  conditions and procedures; \n  (2) Obtain samples of solid waste from any person or from the property of \n  any person, including samples from any vehicle in which solid wastes \n  are being transported; \n  (3) Drill test wells on the affected property of any person holding a permit \n  or liable for a  permit under K.S.A. 65-3407 or amendments of that statute \n  and obtain samples from the wells; \n  (4) Conduct tests, analyses, and evaluations of solid waste to determine \n  whether the requirements of these regulations are otherwise applicable \n  to, or violated by, the situation observed during the inspection; \n  (5) Obtain samples of any containers or labels; and \n  (6) Inspect and copy any records, reports, information, or test results \n  relating to wastes generated, stored, transported, processed, or disposed. \n \n  BWM had never previously inspected the PPKM Overland Park health care facility.  The \nBWM inspectors were escorted to two exam rooms, but when they reached the laboratory about \none hour into the inspection, PPKM staff informed them that they had spoken to PPKM’s \nattorney and that although the inspectors could continue, they could not take further photographs \nout of concern for clinic and patient privacy and safety.  At this point during the inspection, \npatients were present at the facility.  The BWM inspectors also asked PPKM staff for a list of its \nvendors, including linen service and regular trash hauler vendors.  PPKM was concerned about \nwhether this information would become unprotected public information, exposing the vendors to \nanti-abortion harassment that has occurred in other states were such information was made \npublic.  PPKM staff asked the inspectors about whether the requested vendor information would \nremain confidential and the inspectors responded that it would be available through the Kansas \nOpen Records Act and PPKM would have to go through the official process of claiming the \n9 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 10 of 54\ninformation as confidential.  PPKM would not provide the inspectors the names of the facility’s \nsolid waste vendors, and asked the inspectors to return with a signed warrant.  They returned \nlater that day with a signed warrant.  PPKM’s legal counsel told the inspectors that they could \ninspect, but could not take photographs due to concern for patient and staff safety.  Again, \ncounsel declined to provide the list of solid waste vendors, and the BWM inspectors left.   \n  On January 5, 2016, BWM inspectors returned again with a warrant, and stated that they \nwould only photograph relevant areas and take measures to protect patient privacy.  PPKM \neventually provided vendor information to the BWM on January 15, 2016, after agreeing to \nallow PPKM additional time to provide the vendor information and to document PPKM’s \nrequest to keep any photographs confidential.  After the inspection, the facility was provided \nwith a report that stated no violations had been identified.16 \n  One week later, Governor Sam Brownback announced during his State of the State \naddress on January 12, 2016:  \n  In 2011, I signed legislation stopping most taxpayer funding from going to \nPlanned Parenthood.  The time has come to finish the job.    \n  Planned Parenthood’s trafficking of baby body parts is antithetical to our \nbelief in human dignity. \n  Today, I am directing Secretary Susan Mosier to ensure that not a single \ndollar of taxpayer money goes to Planned Parenthood through our Medicaid \nprogram.  I welcome legislation that would enshrine this directive in state law.17  \n \n  Almost two months later, on March 10, 2016, the KDHE sent the Plaintiff providers a \nNotice of Intent to Terminate Provider, “[a]t the direction of Governor Sam Brownback as set \nforth in his letter to Secretary Susan Mosier, M.D.,” attached to each notice.  The notices state \nthat KDHE intends to terminate the provider’s participation in the Kansas Medical Assistance \n                                                 \n16Doc. 13-4, Ex. 3 ¶ 20; Ex. 3-E.  \n17Governor Sam Brownback, 2016 State of the State (Jan. 12, 2016) (transcript available at  \nhttp://governor.ks.gov/media-room/speeches/2016/01/13/2016-state-of-the-state---january-12-2016).   \n10 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 11 of 54\nProgram (“KMAP”) under K.A.R. 30-5-60(a), subsections (2) noncompliance with applicable \nstate laws, administrative regulations, or program issuances concerning medical providers; (3) \nnoncompliance with the terms of a provider agreement; (9) unethical or unprofessional conduct; \nand (17) other good cause.  In an attachment to the letters of intent to terminate, KDHE provided \nthree grounds for termination: (1) video evidence about practices by Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America affiliates that include unlawful agreements to procure fetal tissue after \nabortions; (2) failure to cooperate with solid waste disposal inspections; and (3) claims \nsubmission concerns identified by neighboring states about other PPFA affiliates.   \n  The notice of intent to terminate letters provided for an administrative review on March \n23, 2016.  But an informal administrative review with legal counsel for PPKM and PPSLR was \nheld on April 29, 2016.  PPKM and PPSLR counsel presented evidence to rebut the allegations \nin the notice of termination letters and requested that if the KDHE decided to follow through \nwith the termination, that it be made effective thirty days from the issuance of the decision.   \n  On May 3, 2016, the provider Plaintiffs received final notices of termination, with an \neffective date of May 10, 2016.  The notices state that “[a]fter thorough review of all information \npresented, it is the decision of DHCF that your participation in KMAP will be terminated \neffective May 10, 2016.”18  The final notices provided no further information about the grounds \nfor termination. The final notices advised the providers of their right to request a hearing under \nK.A.R. § 30-7-64, et seq. within 33 days of the notice. \n  The day after receiving the final termination notices, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit and \nsought a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) before the May 10 termination date, and a \npreliminary injunction pending a final decision on the merits. The Complaint alleges the \n                                                 \n18See, e.g., Doc. 1, Ex.

But soon after setting the hearing, the parties \njointly agreed to proceed on the request for preliminary injunction only and requested a \ncontinuance of the hearing until May 17.  On May 10, the parties again jointly requested a \ncontinuance of the hearing until May 25.  On May 17, outside counsel for the KDHE withdrew \nfrom the case and the Court conducted a status conference by telephone.  Upon assurance from \nthe KDHE that its termination decision would not become effective until July 7, 2016, the Court \nagain reset the briefing deadlines on the motion for preliminary injunction and continued the \nhearing until June 7.  On June 13, 2016, the KDHE reversed its termination decisions as to the \nindividual provider Plaintiffs; these Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims.  The Court \ntherefore considers the motion for preliminary injunction motion as it applies to the PPKM and \nPPSLR termination decisions only.19 \nII.  Administrative Review and Justiciability \n  Under the KDHE regulations promulgated in furtherance of the Kansas Administrative \nProcedure Act (“KAPA”), the providers have the right to request a fair hearing administered by a \nhearing officer from the KDHE’s administrative hearings section to review an unfavorable \ndecision.20  The hearing may be by telephone unless a party shows good cause why a fair and \n                                                 \n19On July 5, 2016, Defendant submitted a letter to the Court notifying it that it received a notice of name \nchange from PPKM and Comprehensive Health of PPKM to Planned Parenthood Great Plains, effective July 1, \n2016.  Doc. 62.  The letter states that this may render PPKM’s claims moot, and argues that the fraudulent billing \npractices basis for the termination decision “is now directly at issue.”  The letter further states that the “merger may \nhave significant regulatory implications, such as requiring PPGP to obtain a new Medicaid provider identification \nnumber and provider agreement.”  Id. at 1.   \n20K.A.R. § 30-7-67.  \n12 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 13 of 54\nimpartial hearing could not be conducted by telephone.21  Either party can then request a \nrehearing before a state appeals committee.22  Once the administrative process concludes, a party \nmay further appeal through the state courts under the Kansas Judicial Review Act.23  Defendant \nargues that because Plaintiffs have the right to request this fair hearing within 33 days of the \neffective date of the KDHE’s termination decisions, or by August 10, 2016,24 the administrative \nprocess has not yet been exhausted, and therefore Plaintiffs lack standing and the case is not ripe \nfor review.  Alternatively, Defendant argues that this Court should abstain in deference to the \nKDHE’s administrative proceeding.  Plaintiffs attest through declarations that they do not intend \nto file an administrative appeal.  They further argue that the Court must rule before the effective \ndate of the decisions in order to provide them with meaningful relief, and that abstention is not \nwarranted. \n  Article III of the Constitution gives federal courts the power to exercise jurisdiction only \nover “Cases” and “Controversies.”  As the Supreme Court has explained, “[i]n limiting the \njudicial power to ‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies,’ Article III of the Constitution restricts it to the \ntraditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to redress or prevent actual or imminently \nthreatened injury to persons caused by private or official violation of law.”25  A court lacking \njurisdiction must dismiss the case, regardless of the stage of the proceeding, when it becomes \napparent that jurisdiction is lacking.26  The party who seeks to invoke federal jurisdiction bears \n                                                 \n21K.A.R. § 30-7-72.  \n22K.A.R. §§ 30-7-77, -78.  \n23K.S.A. §§ 77-604 through -631.  \n24K.A.R. § 30-7-68(a).  \n25Summers v.

First, the KDHE declined Plaintiffs’ request after an April administrative \nhearing to delay any termination decision for thirty days from the date that the final termination \nletters were issued, and instead set an original termination date of May 10 (one week from the \ndate of the final termination letters).  This prompted Plaintiffs to immediately file suit and \nrequest a temporary restraining order, which the Court set for hearing on May 6  in order to \nrender a decision before the May 10 effective date.  The parties then jointly requested two \ncontinuances of the hearing until May 17 and then May 25, which were both tied to the KDHE’s \nagreement to extend the effective date of the termination decisions.  Then, during a May 17 \nstatus conference, outside defense counsel advised that they would be withdrawing, and agency \ncounsel Mr. Dernovish advised that he would be entering an appearance.  Mr. Dernovish sought \na thirty-day extension of all deadlines, including the effective date of the termination, which he \npledged to extend to July 7. At this status conference, the Court proposed that the parties enter \n                                                 \n27Montoya v. Chao, 296 F.3d 952, 955 (10th Cir. 2002). \n28Harms v.

Spectrum Emergency Care, Inc., 190 F.3d 1156, 1160 (10th Cir. \n1999). \n30Defendant has suggested a potential mootness challenge in a footnote to its response brief, at oral \nargument, and in a July 5, 2016 letter to the Court, based on the merger between PPKM and Planned Parenthood of \nCentral Oklahoma.   The Court does not consider this issue to be in a posture for disposition at this time.  As \nDefendant admits in its July 5 letter, it is unclear whether the merger means merely a name change to PPKM, or \nwhether it would require an entirely new Medicaid provider contract.  Until this development is resolved, the Court \nwill not find that this case is moot based on this development.  Instead, the Court evaluates the record as it exists \ntoday by evaluating whether the KDHE’s termination decision as to the named Plaintiffs must be enjoined. \n14 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 15 of 54\ninto an agreed injunction until September that would freeze the status quo, conduct expedited \ndiscovery over the summer, and set this case for a trial on the merits in late-September.  \nPlaintiffs were amenable to this schedule but the KDHE was not, stating that while it did not \noppose a fall trial date, it objected to any injunction being entered in the interim.  This Court \ntherefore set deadlines tied to a July 7 termination date; the preliminary injunction hearing was \ncontinued to June 7 to allow the Court time to render a decision before the terminations were set \nto go into effect.   \n  When it filed its response to the motion for preliminary injunction on May 31, Defendant \nargued for the first time that the preliminary injunction motion is premature because the provider \nterminations could not possibly take effect until September 10, 2016, at the earliest.31  Defendant \ntakes the position that this case is not ripe, that the Court should abstain under Younger, that \nPlaintiffs lack standing, and that there is no irreparable harm based on the repeated contention \nthat no provider termination will actually occur until the provider Plaintiffs’ administrative \nappeal time runs on August 10, 2016, and then thirty more days pass—a period provided under \nthe State’s contracts with the various MCOs that administer the Kansas Medicaid program. \nDefendant attached no statement from the agency attesting to the fact that it would stay its \ndecision until that time period passed.   \n  The Court expressed frustration at the June 7 hearing about the procedural posture of this \ncase.  Newly-retained defense counsel, who entered their appearances after the response brief \n                                                 \n31See, e.g., Doc. 37 at 15 (“The termination of Medicaid funding thus will not occur before September 10, \n2016, perhaps months later if Plaintiffs simply file an appeal.”), 20 (“Planned Parenthood will not lose a dime of \nMedicaid funding until after their appeals are exhausted.”), 37 (“Planned Parenthood and the Individual Provider \nPlaintiffs will not lose any Kansas Medicaid funding while state administrative appeals are pending.  The Individual \nPlaintiffs will have their services at Planned Parenthood reimbursed under the same standards, through the same \nmechanism (the MCOs), as before KDHE initiated this administrative process, while any appeals are pending.  No \nharm of any kind will befall any Plaintiffs until at least September 10, 2016 . . . .”), 38 (“Any modification of \nfunding is at least three and one-half months away, perhaps more.”). \n15 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 16 of 54\nwas filed and four days before the hearing, took the odd position that entering into a stipulated \ninjunction would somehow require a concession on the merits of the case.  The Court understood \nat the conclusion of oral argument that these issues were ripe for adjudication, and made clear \nthat it intended to rule on Plaintiffs’ request for relief before the July 7 effective date.  The Court \nwas therefore surprised to learn of Defendant’s lengthy motion to dismiss filed on Friday, June \n24, 2016, reasserting several justiciability arguments, adding others, and seeking to dismiss the \nsubstantive claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  Once again, many \nof the KDHE’s arguments are tied to its contention that no enforcement action can take place \nbefore September 10, 2016.32 \n  Defendant’s motion to dismiss does nothing to allay the Court’s concern that Defendant \nwishes to have its cake and eat it too.  The Court cannot fathom why Defendant objects to some \nform of agreed injunctive relief during the period between the KDHE’s July 7 termination date, \nand the date upon which Defendant claims reimbursements would be declined under the MCO \ncontracts unless it intends to enforce the terminations.  Defendant repeatedly asserts in its briefs \nthat no action may be taken before this September date, but never addresses Plaintiffs’ argument \nthat there is nothing in the law or record that would guarantee a stay of the termination decisions \nwhile the appeal time runs, and pending any appeal that may be taken.  Plaintiffs further point \nout that the contractual extension does not apply to PPSLR, and that their contracts with the \nMCOs do not reflect that January amendment in the contracts between the State and the MCOs.  \nIn the Court’s view, absent some sort of stipulation or other assurance, Plaintiffs reasonably do \nnot take counsel’s briefing statements at their word that the termination decisions will not \nbecome effective until September.  This refusal to commit to the KDHE’s intended course of \n                                                 \n32Doc. 60 at 1, 2, 22, 23.  \n16 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 17 of 54\naction has created a procedural headache for the parties and for the Court, especially given the \nnewly-filed motion to dismiss that deserves responsive briefing before decision.  As Defendant is \nno doubt fully aware, it is impossible at this juncture for the Court to allow full briefing, and \ndecide the motion to dismiss in its entirety before July 7.  The fact that Defendant is unwilling to \nput its counsel’s representations into a stipulated order that would apply to both providers is \nentirely inconsistent with its position that this dispute is premature. \n  A.  Ripeness \n  Defendant urges this Court to deny the motion for preliminary injunction without \nprejudice based on “prudential considerations” associated with the timing of the motion.  \nAlthough buried in the response brief and not articulated as such at oral argument, Defendant \nclarifies in the motion to dismiss that this is a ripeness challenge based on the fact that the \neffective date of the Medicaid terminations is potentially two months away.   \n  Ripeness is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit that has both constitutional and prudential \ncomponents.33  “Ripeness doctrine prevents courts from ‘entangling themselves in abstract \ndisagreements’ and interfering in agency policy until ‘an administrative decision has been \nformalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.’”34  When \nconsidering whether a claim is ripe for adjudication, the Court must consider a two-part test \nevaluating the “fitness of the issue for judicial resolution and . . . the hardship to the parties of \nwithholding judicial consideration.”35   \n  1.  Fitness for Judicial Resolution \n                                                 \n33See, e.g., United States v. Bennett, –F.3d–, 2016 WL 3034664, at *7 (10th Cir.

Tristani, 182 F.3d 1202, 1208 (10th Cir. 1999) (citing New Mexicans for Bill Richardson \nv. Gonzales, 64 F.3d a1495, 1499 (10th Cir. 1995)). \n17 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 18 of 54\n  To determine the fitness for judicial resolution prong, the Court asks “whether judicial \nintervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action and whether the \ncourts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.”36  Plaintiffs took \nadvantage of their optional right to an administrative hearing, where Plaintiffs’ counsel was \ninformally allowed to present evidence to rebut the allegations in the notices of intent to \nterminate.  After hearing this evidence, Defendant proceeded to issue final termination decisions.  \nAn agency’s action will be ripe for review where “the scope of the controversy has been reduced \nto more manageable proportions, and its factual components fleshed out, by some concrete \naction applying the regulation to the claimant’s situation in a fashion that harms or threatens to \nharm him.”37  Here, the “final” termination notices represent concrete actions by the KDHE that \nthreatened to harm Plaintiffs by excluding PPKM and PPSLR as Medicaid providers, \nnotwithstanding the option of an administrative appeal.38  Unlike the cases cited by Defendant, \nthis case does not call upon the Court to consider contingent future events.39   \n  Defendant argues that judicial intervention would interfere with an ongoing \nadministrative proceeding, and that the KDHE’s decision “is without imminent practical effect” \nbecause it cannot take effect until the time to administratively appeal passes, plus an additional \nthirty days provided under the State’s contracts with the MCOs.  Although the termination letters \nadvise the providers of their right to a fair hearing, they do not state that the decisions will be \n                                                 \n36Farrell-Cooper, 728 F.3d at 1235 (quoting Sierra Club v.

U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 382 F.3d 1088, 1094 (10th \nCir. 2004) (finding decision not concrete where outcome was dependent upon voter approval of part of the project, a \npurely hypothetical outcome). \n18 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 19 of 54\nstayed pending review, nor that these are tentative or advisory decisions.  If Plaintiffs do not \nappeal, they can be assured that on August 10, 2016, the KDHE’s decision will stand.  And even \nif they do request a fair hearing, under K.A.R. § 30-4-66, assistance is not terminated unless it \nconcerns “the termination of a provider from program participation.”  While it is true that the \nMCO contract submitted by Defendant states that a provider termination is effective thirty \ncalendar days “after notification from the State that the provider’s state fair hearing rights have \nexpired or the state fair hearing has been completed related to Medicaid termination,”40 this \nprovision changes nothing about the termination decision itself.  Further, it is not clear that the \ncontractual provision relied upon by Defendant applies to PPSLR, nor that it applies to the \ncontracts between the MCOs and PPKM.41  There are no contracts in the record between those \nparties except for the contract between PPKM and one KanCare MCO, Amerigroup Kansas, \nInc.42  That contract provides for immediate termination. There is no foundational evidence in \nthe record providing this Court with a basis to conclude that the amendment submitted by \nDefendant caused the MCO’s to supersede their agreements with PPKM.  And PPSLR does not \ncontract with the KanCare MCOs,43 so the KDHE decision will certainly be effective for PPSLR \non August 10, 2016.   \n  When considering threatened action by the government for purposes of standing and \nripeness, the Supreme Court has explained that “where threatened action by government is \nconcerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to \nchallenge the basis for the threat—for example, the constitutionality of a law threatened to be \n                                                 \n40Doc. 37-11, Ex. 1-J at 10–11.  \n41Doc. 37-11, Ex. 1-J.  \n42Doc. 49-2, Ex. A-1.    \n43PPSLR maintains that it does not bill the MCOs or Kansas directly because it is billed as an “out of \nnetwork” provider, which still requires a Medicaid provider agreement.  \n19 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 20 of 54\nenforced.”44  The Court finds that the KDHE’s final termination decisions are sufficiently \nconcrete and imminent to make the claims in this case ripe.   \n  Defendant argues that the Court should allow the KDHE to exercise its agency expertise \nbecause the issues in this case are fact driven and deserve a more fully developed administrative \nrecord.  To be sure, the parties dispute the degree to which PPFA and the Planned Parenthood \naffiliates in this case are connected.  And there is some dispute about the details involving the \nsolid waste inspection.  But both parties have submitted evidence on these issues and, tellingly, \nneither party requested an evidentiary hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction.  They \ntreated the hearing as oral argument, resting on the evidence submitted with the briefs.  \nDefendant provides the Court with no explanation about how these non-legal issues demand \n“agency expertise” in order to resolve the claims in this case.  Certainly it does not take agency \nexpertise to determine the relationship between affiliated organizations.  Instead, the Court finds \nthat this case predominately involves purely legal questions: the meaning of 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 1396a(a)(23), and the applicability of the Equal Protection clause to the facts of this case.45  \nWhile additional factual development is expected, given its procedural posture, “in the vast \nmajority of cases in which ripeness is not found, ‘additional factual development’ is absolutely \n‘necessary,’ a feature wholly absent from a proceeding focused on the outer parameters of a \nstatute’s meaning.”46    \n  2.  Hardship \n                                                 \n44Medimmune, Inc. v. Genetech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 128 & n.8 (2007); see also Consumer Data Ind. Ass’n \nv. King, 678 F.3d 898, 907 (10th Cir. 2012) (ripeness is seldom an obstacle to a pre-enforcement challenge in this \nposture, where the plaintiff faces a “credible threat” of enforcement”). \n45Accord Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Kliebert, 141 F. Supp. 3d 604, 627 (M.D. La. 2015). \n46Id. at 629.  \n20 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 21 of 54\n  The Court also finds Plaintiffs have demonstrated hardship if this Court declines to \nreview the decision—the KDHE’s termination decisions result in a legal and practical harm by \nterminating the providers’ status as Medicaid providers.47  Plaintiffs need not await the effective \ndate of the decisions in order to suffer a legal hardship—there is no chance that the decisions will \nchange before the effective date absent Plaintiffs’ deciding to file an optional appeal.  And, as \ndescribed, it is not clear under the regulations that the termination decision would be stayed even \nif the providers requested a fair hearing.   \n  As discussed above, while September 10, 2016 may be the effective date for the MCOs to \nterminate the provider agreements based on the KDHE’s summary decision, the KDHE’s \ndecision itself becomes final on August 10, 2016.  The Court finds that the claims in this case are \nfit for judicial resolution, and that Plaintiffs will suffer a hardship if this Court declines to review \ntheir § 1983 challenges to the KDHE’s termination decisions.   \n  B.  Standing \n  In its recently filed motion to dismiss, Defendant argues for the first time that Plaintiffs \nlack standing under Article III of the Constitution to assert their claims in this case because the \nalleged injury is neither imminent nor fairly traceable to Defendant’s actions.  One of several \ndoctrines reflecting Article III’s case-or-controversy limitation on the judicial power is the \ndoctrine of standing.  That doctrine requires federal courts, before considering the merits of an \naction, to “‘satisfy themselves that the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome \nof the controversy as to warrant [the plaintiff’s] invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.’”48  \n                                                 \n47See Ohio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733–34 (1998) .  \n48Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498–99 \n(1975)). \n21 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 22 of 54\nStanding is evaluated based on the facts as they exist at the time the complaint is filed.49  At the \npleading stage, the Court “‘presume[s] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that \nare necessary to support the claim,’”50 and “general factual allegations of injury resulting from \nthe defendant’s conduct may suffice.’”51  Nonetheless, the Court is “not bound by conclusory \nallegations, unwarranted inferences, or legal conclusions.”52 \n  The Supreme Court has found the “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” to \ncontain three elements: \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact”—an invasion of a legally \nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.  Second, there must be a causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to \nbe “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . \nth[e] result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.”  \nThird, it must be “likely,” as opposed to merely “speculative,” that the injury will \nbe “redressed by a favorable decision.”53  \n \n“An allegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is ‘certainly impending,’ or \nthere is a ‘substantial risk’ that the harm will occur.”54 \n  For the same reasons explained under the Court’s ripeness analysis,55 the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have suffered an injury in fact.  Defendant argues that the injury is not imminent \nbecause the effective date of the termination decisions is four months after the Complaint was \n                                                 \n49Tandy v.

Susan B. \nAnthony List, 134 S. Ct. at 2341; see also Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Kliebert, 141 F. Supp. 3d 604, \n630 (M.D. La. 2015). \n22 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 23 of 54\nfiled.  But that is not the correct benchmark.  First, the original effective date of the termination \ndecisions (known to Plaintiffs when they filed the Complaint) was May 10, 2016, a mere six \ndays after the Complaint was filed.  The only reason the effective date was extended in the first \nplace was by agreement of the parties, to allow Defendant time to respond to the motion for \npreliminary injunction and for the dispute to be fairly heard on a less expedited timeline.  The \nCourt and the Plaintiffs were prepared to proceed with a hearing on this matter back on May 6.  \nMoreover, the availability of administrative review does not impede Plaintiffs’ injury for \nstanding purposes, particularly given Plaintiffs’ assertion that they will not pursue an \nadministrative appeal.  Given this, they have demonstrated that there is a “substantial risk” that \nthe harm alleged in this case will occur.  The KDHE’s final decision will stand absent a \nunilateral reversal by the agency of that decision, or an appeal by Plaintiffs, which they have \nforesworn.  And under the contract provision submitted by Defendant, the KanCare MCOs are \nrequired to terminate PPKM and PPSLR from the Medicaid program once this happens, even if \nthe effective date of the action is delayed for thirty days.  Plaintiffs have met their burden to \nshow that the injury is certainly impending and that there is a substantial risk that the harm will \noccur. \n  The Court also finds that the alleged injury is fairly traceable to Defendant’s action.  \nPlaintiffs need not show that Defendant’s conduct was the “proximate cause” of its injury in fact, \nbut, “[i]f ‘speculative inferences are necessary to connect [a plaintiff’s] injury to the challenged \naction,’ this burden has not been met. Moreover, where ‘the independent action of some third \nparty not before the court’—rather than that of the defendant—was the direct cause of the \nplaintiff's harm, causation may be lacking.”56  Defendant argues that the termination action \n                                                 \n56Habecker v. Town of Estes Park, Colo., 518 F.3d 1217, 1225 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Nova Health Sys. \nv. Gandy, 416 F.3d 1149, 1159 (10th Cir. 2005); Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 45 (1976)). \n23 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 24 of 54\ncannot be fairly traceable to Defendant’s action because it will be the result of Plaintiffs’ \ndecision not to pursue an administrative appeal.  There is no allegation, nor evidence that the \nalleged injury in fact—PPKM and PPSLR’s termination as Kansas Medicaid providers and the \ndenial of their Medicaid patients’ right to choose them as a family planning provider—is due to \nthe independent actions of a third party not involved in this lawsuit.  And as already discussed, \nany administrative appeal in this case is optional; administrative exhaustion is not required for \nPlaintiffs to pursue their § 1983 claims.57  Likewise, the Court will not impose an indirect \nexhaustion requirement by finding that Plaintiffs caused their own injury by failing to pursue \nadministrative remedies.   \n  C.  Younger Abstention \n  The Court next considers Defendant’s argument that it should abstain under the Younger \nabstention doctrine.  Under Younger, a federal court considers whether: \n“(1) there is an ongoing state criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, (2) the \nstate court provides an adequate forum to hear the claims raised in the federal \ncomplaint, and (3) the state proceedings involve important state interests, matters \nwhich traditionally look to state law for their resolution or implicate separately \narticulated state policies.” Once these three conditions are met, Younger \nabstention is non-discretionary and, absent extraordinary circumstances, a district \ncourt is required to abstain.58 \n \n  The issue in this case is whether the administrative appeal process available to Plaintiffs \nconstitutes an ongoing administrative proceeding, which involves two inquiries: (1) whether \nthere is an ongoing proceeding; and (2) “whether the proceeding is the type of state proceeding \n                                                 \n57Houghton ex rel.

There can be no \ndispute that the trial and appellate stages of state court litigation are considered a unitary process \nfor purposes of Younger.61  The Supreme Court has twice left open the question of whether “an \nadministrative adjudication and the subsequent state court’s review of it count as a ‘unitary \nprocess’ for Younger purposes.”62 Several other circuits have held that the administrative \nproceeding is part of that unitary process and therefore a litigant must exhaust judicial review of \nadministrative decisions before filing suit in federal court.63  However, Defendant has pointed \nthe Court to no authority that this unitary process is considered ongoing before it even begins.  \nThe cases considering this issue examine whether a pending or completed administrative \nproceeding is ongoing where the plaintiff files a federal claim instead of completing the \nadministrative process and pursuing judicial review of the administrative decision.64  Here, the \n                                                 \n59Brown ex rel.

No \nadministrative appeal has been filed and the Plaintiffs have made clear that they do not intend to \nfile an administrative appeal.  \n  Even if the administrative proceeding is ongoing, the Court finds that the administrative \ndecision here is not the type that requires Younger abstention.  In 2013, the Supreme Court made \nclear that abstention is warranted in only three types of proceedings: (1) state criminal \nprosecutions; (2) certain civil enforcement proceedings; and (3) “civil proceedings involving \ncertain orders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ ability to perform their judicial \nfunctions.”65  The administrative appeal in this case clearly does not meet the first or third \ncategory; the parties dispute whether the administrative appeal procedure available to the \nprovider Plaintiffs constitutes a “civil enforcement proceeding.”  In Sprint Communications, Inc. \nv. Jacobs, the Court explained that civil enforcement proceedings are generally “akin to a \ncriminal prosecution in important respects,” and “are characteristically initiated to sanction the \nfederal plaintiff, i.e., the party challenging the state action, for some wrongful act.”66  The Court \ncannot find that the KDHE’s termination decision constitutes a “civil enforcement proceeding” \nunder this guidance.  First, the KDHE’s termination decision is not akin to a criminal \nprosecution.  A state agency is permitted under the law to initiate an enforcement action under \nK.S.A. § 77-624, but this was a summary termination decision by the KDHE.  While there was \npresumably an investigation before the termination decision was made, there was no proceeding \nthat began with a complaint or formal charge against the providers.

In Brown  \nex rel. Brown v. Day, which was decided before the Sprint case, the Tenth Circuit considered \nwhether the district court was correct to abstain in favor of an administrative proceeding for \nwhich state court judicial review was still available.68  The court decided that this inquiry turned \non whether the administrative proceeding is remedial or coercive.69  Only coercive \nadministrative proceedings require deference.70  To determine whether an administrative \nproceeding is coercive or remedial, the court should consider: (1) “whether the federal plaintiff \ninitiated the state proceeding of her own volition to right a wrong inflicted by the state (a \nremedial proceeding) or whether the state initiated the proceeding against her, making her \nparticipation mandatory”;71 (2) whether “the federal plaintiff contends that the state proceeding is \nunlawful (coercive)” or whether “the federal plaintiff seeks a remedy for some other state-\ninflicted wrong (remedial)”;72 and (3) “if the federal plaintiff sought to thwart a state \nadministrative proceeding initiated to punish the federal plaintiff for a bad act.”73   \n  First, the “state proceeding” was initiated by the provider Plaintiffs—they opted to avail \nthemselves of an informal administrative hearing before a final termination decision was issued \n                                                 \n67Id.

If any further administrative appeal is taken before August 10, 2016, it must be \ninitiated by the provider Plaintiffs as well.  Neither the informal administrative hearing nor any \nadministrative appeal is mandatory under Kansas law and Plaintiffs declare that they will not \npursue their optional administrative remedy.  Importantly, any potential appeal would only be \navailable to PPKM and PPSLR; the patient Plaintiffs would have no recourse for pursuing their \nclaims in this case.74  Second, the provider Plaintiffs do not contend that the administrative \nproceeding itself was unlawful; they seek a remedy for violations of the federal Medicaid Act \nand the United State Constitution.  Finally, there is no bad act identified in this case that \ntriggered coercive proceedings.  While the grounds cited for the termination decision allege \nviolations of Kansas law, they were not alleged in the context of a coercive proceeding.75  Even \nif the administrative proceeding in this case is considered ongoing, the Court finds that it is \nremedial and not coercive, and thus under Tenth Circuit precedent would not constitute a civil \nenforcement proceeding. \n  The Court therefore finds that there is no ongoing state administrative proceeding that \nrequires this Court to abstain under Younger.

Preliminary Injunction Factors \n  A preliminary injunction “is an extraordinary remedy,” so “the right to relief must be \nclear and unequivocal.”77  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.”78  A relaxed standard applies if the movant can show that the harm and public \ninterest factors “tip strongly in its favor.”79   If the movant can make this showing, it can meet \nthe likelihood of success on the merits prong “by showing that questions going to the merits are \nso serious, substantial, difficult, and doubtful as to make the issue ripe for litigation and \ndeserving of more deliberate investigation.”80  However, there is a qualification to the relaxed \nstandard: ‘where a preliminary injunction seeks to stay governmental action taken in the public \ninterest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme,” the traditional standard applies.81  The \nCourt therefore applies the traditional standard in deciding Plaintiff’s motion. \n  A.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on both of their claims—that the State \nviolated the Medicaid Act free-choice-of-provider provision, and the Equal Protection Clause of \n                                                 \n76Brown, 555 F.3d at 894.

Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Medicaid Act \nclaim, it does not consider the likelihood of success on the merits of the Equal Protection claim \nat this time. \n  Plaintiffs argue that the KDHE’s decision to terminate the provider Plaintiffs from \nMedicaid violates 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23), often referred to as the “free-choice-of-provider” \nrequirement.  “Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that provides federal funding for \nstate medical services to the poor.”82  State participation in the program is voluntary, “but once a \nState elects to join the program, it must administer a state plan that meets federal \nrequirements.”83  Section 1396a provides for several requirements for State plans for medical \nassistance.  Under § 1396a(a)(23), a State plan must  \nprovide that (A) any individual eligible for medical assistance (including drugs) \nmay obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or \nperson, qualified to perform the service or services required (including an \norganization which provides such services, or arranges for their availability, on a \nprepayment basis), who undertakes to provide him such services, and (B) an \nenrollment of an individual eligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-\nmanagement system (described in section 1396n(b)(1) of this title), a Medicaid \nmanaged care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the \nqualified person from whom the individual may receive services under section \n1396d(a)(4)(C) of this title, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, in \nsection 1396n of this title, and in section 1396u-2(a) of this title, except that this \nparagraph shall not apply in the case of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and \nGuam, and except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a \nState to provide medical assistance for such services furnished by a person or \nentity convicted of a felony under Federal or State law for an offense which the \nState agency determines is inconsistent with the best interests of beneficiaries \nunder the State plan or by a provider or supplier to which a moratorium under \nsubsection (kk)(4) is applied during the period of such moratorium. \n \n  1.  Whether § 1396a(a)(23) creates an enforceable right that may be vindicated  \n    under  42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n                                                 \n82Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 433 (1986). \n83Id.  \n30 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 31 of 54\n   \n  Defendant first challenges whether the free-choice-of-provider provision creates an \nenforceable right that may be vindicated under § 1983.  All of the circuit courts to consider this \nissue have concluded after a thorough analysis that Medicaid patients may bring an enforcement \naction under § 1983 to vindicate their rights under this provision.84  To determine whether a \nfederal statute provides a private right of action under § 1983, three factors guide the Court’s \nanalysis:  \nFirst, Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the \nplaintiff.  Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly \nprotected by the statute is not so ‘vague and amorphous’ that its enforcement \nwould strain judicial competence. Third, the statute must unambiguously impose a \nbinding obligation on the States. In other words, the provision giving rise to the \nasserted right must be couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.85 \n \nThe Supreme Court has cautioned that “where the text and structure of a statute provide no \nindication that Congress intends to create new individual rights, there is no basis for a private \nsuit, whether under § 1983 or under an implied right of action.”86   \n  This Court follows the Sixth, Ninth, and Seventh Circuits in holding that the patient \nPlaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce the Medicaid free-choice-of-provider provision \nunder this three factor test.  The statute creates unambiguous rights-creating language sufficient  \nto show that Congress intended to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries.87  The statute provides courts \nwith sufficiently concrete and objective standards for enforcement by requiring states to \n                                                 \n84Harris v.

Exceptional Child Center, Inc.92 the Supreme Court considered whether a \ndifferent subsection of § 1396a(a) confers a private right of action to Medicaid providers. \nSubsection (30)(A) requires State plans to:  \nprovide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the \npayment for, care and services available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to \nsafeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure \nthat payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are \nsufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under \nthe plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the \ngeneral population in the geographic area.   \n \nThe lower court found that the plaintiff providers had an implied right of action under the \nSupremacy Clause to seek injunctive relief against enforcement of state legislation that failed to \nset rates in a manner consistent with § 30(A).93  The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that there \n                                                 \n88Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967; Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d at 974; Harris, 442 F.3d at 462.  \n89Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967; Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d at 974; Harris, 442 F.3d at 462  \n90Harris, 442 F.3d at 462.  \n91Id. at 463 (citing Wilder v.

As the \nCourt noted in Armstrong, § 30(A) “is phrased as s directive to the federal agency charged with \napproving state Medicaid plans,” whereas § 23 allows “any individual” to choose among \nqualified providers who undertake to provide medical services.98   Further, § 30(A) is a rate \nsetting statute that that contains a broad standard that would be difficult to judicially \nadminister.99  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in arguing that the Jane Doe Plaintiffs have a \nprivate right of action under § 1983 to enforce their rights under § 1396a(a)(23). \n  Defendant argues for the first time in the motion to dismiss that if there is a private right \nof action, it runs only to Medicaid patients and therefore PPKM and PPSLR lack standing to \n                                                 \n94Id. at 1383–87 & 1388 (Breyer, J., concurring). \n95Id. at 1383–87. \n96Id. at 1387–88.  \n97Id. at 1388 (Breyer, J., concurring); see Altria Grp., Inc. v.

Because the Court finds that the Jane Doe Plaintiffs have a \nprivate right of action, the Court need not resolve at this time whether PPKM and PPSLR have \nstanding in their own right, or on behalf of the patients, in order to grant injunctive relief.  The \nCourt will instead consider this issue in the context of the motion to dismiss, after allowing full \nbriefing. \n  2.  Whether there is a violation of § 1396a(a)(23) \n  The free-choice-of-provider requirement is subject to two limitations: “(1) the provider is \n‘qualified to perform the service or services required,’ and (2) the provider ‘undertakes to \nprovide [the recipient] such services.’”100  All courts to consider the question have determined \nthat the term “qualified” is unambiguous and may be defined according to its ordinary \nmeaning,101 which is “having an officially recognized qualification to practice as a member of a \nparticular profession; fit, competent.”102  In the context of the statute, a provider must be \n“qualified to perform the service or services required,” so the provider therefore must “be \ncapable of performing the needed medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and \nethical manner.”103  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have both held that under this standard, \nStates are not permitted “to establish provider-eligibility criteria based on any legitimate state \ninterest.”104 \n                                                 \n100Planned Parenthood Ariz.

The Court disagrees and \nfollows the guidance provided by another district court that considered an identical argument.  In \nPlanned Parenthood S.E., Inc. v. Bentley, 106 the United States District Court for the Middle \nDistrict of Alabama explained that the scope of the patients’ claim was that their provider of \nchoice was wrongfully excluded from the pool of providers from which they have a right to \nchoose:  \n  If a State could defeat a Medicaid recipient’s right to select a particular \nqualified healthcare provider merely by terminating its agreement with that \nprovider on an unlawful basis, the right would be totally eviscerated. If the \nGovernor and the Acting Commissioner were correct that allegedly unlawful \nterminations of provider agreements could not be challenged by recipients \npursuant to the free-choice-of-provider provision, that provision’s “individual \nentitlement,” the “personal right” it gives recipients, would be an empty one.107 \n \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs properly brought their claim under the free-choice-of-provider \nrequirement because they allege that the Jane Doe Plaintiffs were denied their right to receive \ncovered Medicaid services from any qualified provider of their choice willing to provide the \nservices.  They contend that their provider was wrongfully removed from the pool of providers. \n  The Court therefore proceeds to consider Defendant’s position that it properly terminated \nPPKM and PPSLR under the exclusion provision of the Medicaid Act, § 1396a(p)(1).  That \nprovision states: \n                                                 \n105Because the Court finds that the free-choice-of-provider statute is unambiguous, the Court does not defer \nto the CMS Administrator’s interpretation of that statute.

Alleged Medicaid Act Violations \n  Defendant first argues that it was justified in terminating the providers’ Medicaid \nprovider agreements under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b), which provides for permissive termination \nunder circumstances involving certain types of fraud and malfeasance.  Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed in showing that this statute does not justify the termination decisions. \n  a.  § 1320a-7(b)(5) \n  Under § 1320a-7(b)(5)(B), the Secretary of Health and Human Services may terminate \n“any individual or entity” “for reasons bearing on the individual’s or entity’s professional \ncompetence, professional performance, or financial integrity.”  Defendant contends that all three \ngrounds it provided for the provider Plaintiffs’ terminations constitute violations of this statute.  \nPlaintiffs are likely to demonstrate that this statute is inapplicable for several reasons.  First, \nunder § 1396a-p(1), the “entity” that a “State may exclude” must be the same entity that \ncommitted the infraction defined in § 1320a-7(b).109  Although the statute allows for exclusion of \nan entity based on affiliation with “a sanctioned individual,” that only applies when the affiliated \n                                                 \n10842 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1).  \n109Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 2d at 1223–24 & n.9. \n36 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 37 of 54\n“person” is sanctioned under the Medicaid Act and has an ownership or control interest in the \nentity, or is an officer, director, agent, or managing employee.110  Defendant points the Court to \nno authority that Congress intended to otherwise allow for exclusion based solely on affiliation \noutside of the strict confines of the statutory provision.  There is no dispute that neither PPKM, \nPPSLR, nor their current or former employees were portrayed on the CMP videos.  There is no \ndispute that the provider Plaintiffs have no direct or indirect ownership or control interest of five \npercent or more in PPFA or the affiliate identified in the videos.  There is no dispute that PPKM \nand PPSLR do not participate in fetal tissue donation or sale.  There is no dispute that PPKM and \nPPSLR are not the subjects of any Medicaid billing fraud claim relied upon by the KDHE in \ntheir notices of intent to terminate.   \n  Defendant points the Court to evidence that Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma has \ncalled for termination of her State’s Medicaid provider contracts with the two Planned \nParenthood affiliates located there.  She cites two October 2015 Integrity Reviews, finding a \n20.3% and 14.1% billing error rate.111  The Governor’s comments come from a letter she sent to \nthe Director of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority Board, encouraging him to consider \nterminating these two affiliates’ Medicaid provider contracts.  Outside of these integrity reviews, \nwhich are not part of this record, Governor Fallin points to False Claims Act cases in other \nstates.  There is no evidence about the action taken, if any, by the Oklahoma Health Care \nAuthority Board based on this letter.  Defendant argues that this evidence directly relates to \nPPKM given its intended merger with Planned Parenthood of Central Oklahoma, one of the \naffiliates referenced in Governor Fallin’s letter.  But on this record, the Court finds that Plaintiffs \nwould succeed in arguing that the Oklahoma affiliate was not sanctioned under either the \n                                                 \n11042 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(8).  \n111Doc. 37-5, Ex. 1-D.  \n37 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 38 of 54\nMedicaid Act, or Oklahoma law, and that it does not have an ownership or controlling interest in \nPPKM.   \n   Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in arguing that § 1320a-7(b) does not apply by virtue of \naffiliation, and therefore could not be applied to the provider Plaintiffs in this case as to two of \nthe grounds for termination: the videos and the alleged Medicaid fraud.  It also renders the \ngrounds for termination against PPSLR entirely baseless since the KDHE inspection involved \nonly one PPKM clinic.   \n  The Court further finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that PPKM’s \npurported failure to cooperate with the BWM’s solid waste inspection in December 2015 does \nnot bear on PPKM’s “professional competence, professional performance, or financial \nintegrity.”112  First, it is undisputed that no solid waste violations were found, so the only basis \nfor termination associated with the inspection was the alleged failure to cooperate.  Defendant  \ncannot explain how the failure to cooperate in the inspection, standing alone, bears on PPKM’s \ncompetence, performance, or financial integrity.  Second, although the evidence makes clear that \nPPKM prohibited the inspectors from taking photographs of the facility on the first visit, and that \nit negotiated with the KDHE to maintain the confidentiality of its solid waste vendors before \nidentifying them, there is no evidence that PPKM otherwise prevented the inspectors from \nperforming their inspections.  Although the BWM officials have submitted declarations stating \nthat photographs of certain solid waste disposal containers were warranted, there is nothing in \nthe regulatory authority that required PPKM to allow photographs to be taken.   K.A.R. § 28-29-\n                                                 \n112Although Defendant does not make this argument in responding to the preliminary injunction motion, the \nCourt further finds that the inspection basis for termination does not touch upon PPKM’s qualifications under § \n1396a(a)(23) given the undisputed fact that the inspection did not reveal any infractions that touch upon PPKM’s \ncapability of performing the needed medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner.  \nIn addition to finding no evidence of solid waste disposal infractions, the KBHA previously investigated PPKM in \nrelation to the CMP videos and found  no further action should be taken.  This finding was reached in between the \nfirst and second attempts to conduct a solid waste inspection. \n38 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 39 of 54\n16 provides these inspectors with authority to “gather information of existing conditions and \nprocedures,” but it does not require photographs be taken.  There is no dispute in the record that \nPPKM would have allowed the inspection to continue but for the inspectors’ insistence on taking \nphotographs.  It was the BWM inspectors who opted to leave instead of continuing without \nphotographs.  More importantly, there was never any determination made by BWM or the \nKDHE that PPKM hindered the solid waste inspection—no enforcement action was ever brought \nagainst the facility.  Given this record, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that they were \nnot properly excluded from the Medicaid program under § 1320a-7(b)(5). \n  b.  § 1320a-7(b)(12) \n  Next, Defendant claims that the termination decisions were justified under § 1320a-\n7(b)(12)(B), which allows the Secretary to terminate a provider “that fails to grant immediate \naccess, upon reasonable request (as defined by the Secretary in regulations) . . . (B) To the \nSecretary or the State agency, to perform the reviews and surveys required under State plans \nunder paragraphs (26), (31), and (33) of section 1396a(a) of this title and under section 1396b(g) \nof this title.”  Section 1396a(a)(33), requires a State health or other appropriate medical agency \nto establish a plan for “the review by appropriate professional health personnel of the \nappropriateness and quality of care and services furnished to recipients of medical assistance \nunder the plan in order to provide guidance with respect thereto in the administration of the plan \nto the State agency.”  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating that \nthe solid waste inspection here does not constitute a review bearing on “the appropriateness and \nquality of care and services furnished to recipients of medical assistance under the plan.”  As \nalready discussed, the failure to cooperate in the inspection, standing alone, does not implicate  \nPPKM’s competence, performance, or financial integrity.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have shown a \n39 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 40 of 54\nlikelihood of success in their contention that they did grant immediate access to the inspectors.  \nAnd even after the inspectors insisted on taking photographs and obtaining confidential material, \nPPKM allowed the inspection to continue; the inspectors opted to come back in January instead.   \n  c.  § 1320a-7(a)(1), (3), or (b)(1)(A)(ii) \n  Finally, Defendant appears to argue that its decision was justified under § 1320a-7(a)(1), \n(3), or (b)(1)(A)(ii) based on evidence that other PPFA affiliates submitted false Medicaid \nclaims.113  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in arguing that these provisions are entirely \ninapplicable because they all either require or permit exclusions based on criminal convictions.  \nMoreover, as described above, they are tied to the conduct of other entities, not the Plaintiff \nproviders that have been excluded by the KDHE.  Defendant’s contention that there is an \nimpending merger between PPKM and Planned Parenthood of Central Oklahoma does not \nchange this analysis.  At the time of the termination decisions, this planned merger was not \nknown to the State, so it could not have formed the basis for its termination decision.  p \n  2.  Savings Clause  \n  Defendant makes the same argument advanced and rejected by the many courts that have \nbeen called upon to review whether termination decisions under the Medicaid Act violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision: that under the savings clause, the states have plenary power to \nexclude providers as they deem fit under § 1396a(p)(1) without running afoul of the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.114  To be sure, the Seventh Circuit in Planned Parenthood of Indiana, Inc. \nv. Commissioner of the Indiana State Department of Health, acknowledged that the states retain \nregulatory authority over provider qualifications in terms of “licensing standards and other \n                                                 \n113See Doc. 37 at 34–35.  \n114Betlach, 727 F.3d at 971–72; Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d at 979; Bentley, 2015 WL 6517875, at *9–10; \nSelig, Doc. 13-5 at 25.    \n40 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 41 of 54\nrelated practice qualifications,” but the claim in this case, like in the Seventh Circuit’s case \n“raises a question about the limits of that authority.”115  The Seventh Circuit also explained that \nthe savings clause “signals only that what follows is a non-exhaustive list of specific grounds \nupon which states may bar providers from participating in Medicaid.   It does not imply that the \nstates have an unlimited authority to exclude providers for any reason whatsoever.”116  As the \ncourt explained, if states were able to exclude a provider based on any rule that they declared \nrelated to qualifications, it “would make the free-choice-of-provider requirement a nullity.”117  \nThe nonexhaustive list of grounds for excluding a provider cross- \nreferenced in the statute refer to “various forms of malfeasance such as fraud, drug crimes, and \nfailure to disclose necessary information to regulators.”118 Therefore, the statute’s “savings \nclause empowers states to exclude individual providers on such grounds directly, without waiting \nfor the Secretary to act, while also reaffirming state authority to exclude individual providers \npursuant to analogous state law provisions relating to fraud or misconduct.”119 \n  Defendant argues that PPKM violated state law by refusing to cooperate with a solid \nwaste inspection in December 2015, which makes it unlawful for a person to interfere with a \nsolid waste inspection.  But as already discussed, the Court finds the Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed in showing that they did not run afoul of state regulations by refusing to allow the BWM \ninspectors to take photographs in the facility while patients were present.  And there is no \nevidence that PPKM was cited for  impeding an inspection.  The  KDHE argues that it was \njustified in inferring that there was a solid waste violation by PPKM’s refusal to allow inspectors \n                                                 \n115Comm’r of Ind., 699 F.3d at 979.   \n116Id.  \n117Id.  \n118Id.; Betlach, 727 F.3d at 972.  \n119Betlach, 727 F.3d at 972.  \n41 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 42 of 54\nto “do their job,” when viewed in conjunction with the YouTube videos.  But the KBHA \nconducted a “thorough investigation” into PPKM after the CMP videos were released, and issued \nits finding that no further action be taken after PPKM allegedly interfered with the first solid \nwaste inspection.  And it is undisputed that PPKM does not participate in fetal tissue donation or \nsale.  After the KBHA finding was issued, and after the parties negotiated BWM’s permission to \ntake certain photographs and receive confidential solid waste vendor information, the BWM was \nable to finish its unannounced inspection and found no infractions.   \n  Finally, Defendant argues that it was justified in terminating the providers’ Medicaid \ncontracts based on the video evidence that Planned Parenthood affiliates “have sold body parts \nand manipulated abortions.  These violations likely run afoul of State and Federal law, \ncontravene the terms of the provider agreement, and fall well below the professional standard of \ncare.”120  Assuming, without deciding that PPFA or other Planned Parenthood affiliates violated \nstate and federal laws concerning fetal tissue donation, the providers in this case are likely to \nsucceed in showing that such conduct cannot be attributed to them under the law.  Based on the \nrecord provided to the Court, which is largely comprised of publicly available documents and the \nattestation of PPKM and PPSLR executives, PPKM and PPSLR are separate and distinct entities \nfrom those described in the video transcripts.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in arguing that they \ncannot be terminated under Kansas law on the basis of this affiliation.121   \n  First, Defendant cites several state law cases that explain when piercing the corporate veil \nis warranted.122  The Court cannot discern the relevance of these cases where it is undisputed that \nthe Plaintiff affiliates are neither subsidiaries of PPFA, nor officers or shareholders in PPFA.  \n                                                 \n120Doc. 37 at 28.  \n121See K.A.R. § 30-5-60(14), (15).  \n122Milgo Elec.

The Court does not read the financial \nstatements as sweepingly as the Defendant.  The joint financial statement referenced by \nDefendant states that, “the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include the \nfinancial position or the changes in net assets and cash flows of these independent affiliated \norganizations.”124  There is no evidence that dues paid to PPFA and returned in part to the \naffiliates translates into quid pro quo action on the part of the affiliates.  Plaintiffs have submitted \nevidence that PPFA exerted no control or ownership interest in PPKM or PPSLR in providing \nthis funding.   \n  Defendant next argues that PPFA and its fifty-nine affiliates have a “unity of interest” \nthat is evidenced by certain language used by PPFA and it officers when describing the \norganization and its affiliates.  But again, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that these \nstray references to the organizational structure does not overcome the declarations and other \nlegal statements showing that PPKM and PPSLR are independent entities that are merely \nmembers of PPFA.  The record shows that PPFA does not provide medical services or operate \nhealth centers.  As described in Bentley, there is no evidence  \n                                                 \n123Planned Parenthood S.E., Inc. v. Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 2d 1207, 1224  n.10 (M.D. Ala. 2015) (citations \nomitted).  \n124Doc. 37-9, Def.

[A]t most [they] \nsuggest that PPFA has supported the decisions of some affiliates to engage in \nthese practices. . . .  What PPFA permits other affiliates to do therefore has no \nbearing on PPSE, which to reiterate, has elected not to engage in fetal-tissue \ndonation.125 \n \n  Defendant cites the transcript from one of the CMP videos, suggesting that PPFA \ncoordinates fetal tissue donation policy with its affiliates.  Assuming the authenticity of this \nvideo, which has not yet been provided to the Court, any question that the KDHE had about such \ncoordination is negated by the fact that the KBHA conducted a thorough investigation of the \nallegations in those videos and found no evidence to support such activity by PPKM.  Likewise, \nthe Missouri Attorney General investigated and cleared PPSLR of wrongdoing. \n  Finally, Defendant points to filings in another case involving affiliate Planned Parenthood \nof the Great Northwest, Inc. (“PPGNW”), as evidence that PPFA and its affiliates present \nthemselves as “a single organization.”126  But again, neither PPKM nor PPSLR were parties in \nthat case and made no representations that relate to their status.  Second, the Court does not agree \nwith Defendant’s reading of the Appellee’s brief in that case.  That case was brought as a qui tam \naction alleging certain overbilling practices by PPGNW.  PPGNW argued that there was \nadequate prior public information about the billing practices in question that had been litigated in \na prior qui tam suit with an affiliate in California, and so the relator in that case was not a \nwhistleblower, but “an opportunistic plaintiff.”127   \n                                                 \n125Id. at 1224.  \n126Doc. 37-15, Ex. 1-N, Bloedow v.

Irreparable Harm \n  To constitute irreparable harm, the injury “must be both certain and great.”128  It “is often \nsuffered when ‘the injury can[not] be adequately atoned for in money,’ or when ‘the district \ncourt cannot remedy [the injury] following a final determination on the merits.’”129 The Court \nhas withheld ruling on whether the provider Plaintiffs have representational standing to raise the \nMedicaid Act claim.  Likewise, because the Court finds that the Jane Doe Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated irreparable harm without injunctive relief, the Court need not proceed to consider \nwhether Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm to PPKM and PPSLR.  The Jane Doe Plaintiffs’ \ndeclarations establish that they choose to be treated at PPKM due to scheduling conveniences, \nand that they have had positive experiences with PPKM staff as compared to other providers for \ngynecological services.  All three Plaintiffs rely on Medicaid for their health insurance and all \nthree wish to continue to be treated at Planned Parenthood clinics.  Jane Doe #3 was 33 weeks \npregnant at the time she executed her declaration, and given her status as an established patient at \nPPKM, it is important to her to be able to return there for her reproductive health care after the \nbaby is born.   \n  Defense counsel suggested at oral argument that the Jane Doe declarations filed in this \ncase were not specific enough because they lacked information such as how far away alternative \nproviders are located.  The Court does not require such detailed information from these Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n128Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, 1250 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Wis. Gas \nCo. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).   \n129Id. (quoting Am. Hosp. Ass’n v.

As already discussed, the Court gives weight to \ntheir uncontroverted declarations that they depend on Planned Parenthood clinics for their \nreproductive health care, and that these Planned Parenthood clinics are their providers of choice \nfor a host of reasons.  They are happy with the quality of care they receive, they do not feel \njudged by the provider’s staff, and they have indicated scheduling and convenience benefits to \nbeing treated by these providers.  Defense counsel also suggested that the fact that these patients \ncould still be treated at PPKM, albeit without Medicaid reimbursement, negates any finding that \nthey could not be treated by the provider of their choice.  It is uncontroverted that to be eligible \nfor Medicaid assistance, a family of four must have a net income of $768 per month or less.  The \nCourt easily finds that these patients will be unable to afford to pay out of pocket to see the \nhealth care provider of their choice without Medicaid assistance. \n  In 2014, PPKM and affiliated providers provided family planning services at \napproximately 750 visits to nearly 500 Medicaid patients.  In 2015, PPKM and affiliated \nproviders provided services at over 650 visits to nearly 450 Medicaid patients.  PPSLR operates \na health center in Joplin, Missouri, which is located approximately seven miles from the Kansas \nborder and provides family planning health services to a small number of Kansas Medicaid \npatients each year.  These clinics offer important health services, including: annual exams, \ncontraception and contraceptive counseling, hormonal counseling, screening for breast cancer, \nscreening and treatment for cervical cancer, screening and treatment for STIs, including HPV \nvaccines, pregnancy testing and counseling, and other limited general health services.  Many of \nthese clinics are located in places with health care provider shortages.  Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that both the named Jane Doe Plaintiffs, and hundreds of other Kansas Medicaid \npatients that currently depend on PPKM and PPSLR for their family planning and reproductive \n46 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 47 of 54\nhealth services would be unable to be treated by these providers if they are terminated from the \nKanCare/Medicaid program.  A disruption or denial of these patients’ health care cannot be \nundone after a trial on the merits.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs has shown irreparable harm to \nMedicaid patients who have chosen PPKM and PPSLR as their family planning and reproductive \nhealth care providers.   \n  Defendant submits evidence that Kansas Medicaid recipients can choose from other \nqualified family planning providers in Kansas.  But as several courts have found, this argument \n“misses the mark” because “[t]hat a range of qualified providers remains available is beside the \npoint.  Section 1396a(a)(23) give Medicaid patients the right to receive medical assistance from \nthe provider of their choice without state interference save on matters of provider \nqualifications.”130  Moreover, the evidence submitted by Defendant in support of its claim that \nMedicaid patients will have access to other health care providers is exaggerated.  Defendant \nsubmits a report based on procedure codes that are “commonly used by certain obstetric and \ngynecological medical providers,” resulting in a list of 9199 Kansas Medicaid providers.131  A \ncursory review of this list shows that the same providers are listed multiple times, and many of \nthe listed providers appear to have practices wholly unrelated to family planning and \nreproductive health services, such as sleep centers, podiatrists, and dermatologists.  The Court \ncannot conclude from this evidence that the Kansas Medicaid patients who choose PPKM and \n                                                 \n130Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc.v.

First, as already discussed at length, \nthere is no requirement that the providers pursue a fair hearing in order to obtain relief in this \nCourt, and the providers have stated on the record that they do not intend to pursue that channel \nof relief.  It is certain therefore that the KDHE’s termination decisions will become final on \nAugust 10, 2016, at the latest.  There is no evidence or legal authority in this record that the \ntermination decisions would not be enforced on the July 7 effective date stated in the termination \nletter, or pending an administrative appeal if one was filed, other than defense counsel’s \nassertions in the briefs.  Second, as the Court has already discussed, PPSLR has no contracts \nwith KanCare MCOs, so the contractual extension would not apply to it.  Third, there are dueling \ncontractual provisions in the record that make it unclear how quickly the MCOs would terminate \ntheir contracts with PPKM.  Fourth, Plaintiffs have submitted authority that the termination \ndecisions themselves may create a domino effect because termination from the Kansas program \nputs PPKM and PPSLR at risk of termination in neighboring states—PPKM is also a Missouri \nand soon-to-be Oklahoma provider and PPSLR is also Missouri and Illinois Medicaid provider. \nRegulations in Oklahoma and Missouri allow for those Medicaid programs to terminate a \nprovider based on termination decisions in other states; they are not tied to the “effective date” of \nthe other state’s Medicaid provider terminations. 133  Therefore, not only is there strong evidence \n                                                 \n132See Kliebert, 141 F.

For all of these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have \nalleged a sufficiently imminent irreparable harm that justifies issuing injunctive relief. \n  C.  Balance of Harms and Public Interest \n  Defendant contends that it will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction ensues, because it \nwould allow taxpayer money to flow to the provider Plaintiffs despite evidence that they have \nviolated Federal and State law, the terms of their provider agreements, and applicable \nprofessional standards.  Defendant further argues that an injunction would disrupt ongoing \nadministrative proceedings.  Plaintiffs urge that the irreparable harm it has cited cannot be \nundone, particularly the domino effect that a for cause termination could have by allowing other \nstates to terminate based on the Kansas decision.  Plaintiffs further argue that it is in the public \ninterest to preserve patients’ freedom to choose their provider without government interference \nand that an injunction would simply freeze the status quo of reimbursing these providers until a \ndecision can be reached on the merits. \n  The Court is not persuaded that the risk of taxpayer harm if the Court issues the \ninjunction outweighs the established irreparable injury to Kansas Medicaid patients if an \ninjunction does not issue.  As the Court has explained, neither the fetal tissue donation allegation \nnor the Medicaid fraud allegation have any relation to the Planned Parenthood affiliates who \nwere terminated by the KDHE, so no taxpayer money is at risk of flowing to providers that have \nviolated State or Federal law on those grounds.  And Plaintiffs have made a strong showing that \nthe solid waste disposal ground for termination is unrelated to the provider’s qualifications as \ndefined in § 1396a(a)(23).  Given these showings, the risk of taxpayer harm is quite low as \n49 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 50 of 54\ncompared to the certain injury to Medicaid patients if the injunction does not issue—they will be \nunable to seek treatment from their providers of choice.  This is a right explicitly provided in the \nMedicaid Act, and the Court finds that protecting this right until the case can be decided on the \nmerits is in the public interest. \n  The Court further finds that the injunction will not interfere with an ongoing \nadministrative proceeding.  As the Court has explained throughout this opinion, there is no \n“ongoing” administrative proceeding to interfere with and Plaintiffs have made clear that they \nwill not be exercising their optional right to a fair hearing.  Moreover, Defendant cannot explain \nhow this implicates the balance of harms.  If, for example, Plaintiffs opted to avail themselves of \nthe administrative process and the KDHE reversed its decision, Defendant could always ask this \nCourt for relief from the preliminary injunction.134  Similarly, if the intended merger between \nPPKM and Planned Parenthood of Central Oklahoma ultimately requires not just a name change \nto the PPKM entity for which the KDHE’s termination decision would extend, but instead an \nentirely new Medicaid provider identification number and provider agreement for which the \ntermination decision potentially would not apply, the parties can apply to this Court for relief \nfrom the preliminary injunction.   \n  Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained that requiring administrative exhaustion of \nstate remedies for a § 1983 claim is inconsistent with Congressional intent that the statute \n“interpose the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people’s \nfederal rights—to protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law, \n‘whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicial.’”135  The Court thus finds it to be in the \n                                                 \n134See Comm’r of the Ind., 699 F.3d at 981 (rejecting state’s claim that preliminary injunction will \nundermine the public’s interest in the administrative process). \n135Patsy v. Bd. of Regents of Fla., 457 U.S. 496, 503–07 (1982) (quoting Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, \n242 (1972)).  \n50 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 51 of 54\npublic interest’s to allow Plaintiffs to pursue their federal claims in federal court notwithstanding \nthe availability of state administrative remedies.   \n  The Court further finds that it is in the public’s interest to ensure that the goals of \nMedicaid are served—“to afford medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are \ninsufficient to meet the financial demands of necessary care and services.”136  Medicaid patients \nhave the explicit right to seek family planning services from the qualified provider of their \nchoice.137  It is uncontroverted that PPKM and PPSLR serve hundreds of underprivileged women \nin the State of Kansas.  It is in the public interest to allow these individuals to be treated by the \nqualified provider of their choice, and to have that provider reimbursed under Medicaid pending \na trial on the merits in this case. \n  In sum, Plaintiffs have satisfied the elements required to obtain a preliminary injunction \non the Jane Doe Plaintiffs’ Medicaid Act claim.  The KDHE’s termination decisions shall \ntherefore be held in abeyance until the case can be decided on the merits. \n  D.  Security \n  Plaintiffs asks that the preliminary injunction be issued without a bond requirement.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65(c) provides that “[t]he Court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary \nrestraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to \npay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.”  The Court may exercise its discretion, and determine a bond is unnecessary “if there \n                                                 \n136Hougton ex rel.

Admin., 4 F.3d 882, 883 (10th Cir. 1993)).  \n13742 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23); see also, e.g., Planned Parenthood S.E., Inc. v. Bentley, 141 F. Supp. 2d 1207, \n1217 (M.D. Ala. 2015) (“Congress saw fit to identify family planning as the area of medical care with respect to \nwhich a recipient’s free choice of provider was most critical. It is not hard to imagine why—just as business owners \ndo, healthcare providers and Medicaid recipients have widely varying “honest conviction[s]” about the \nappropriateness of different family-planning methods.” (quoting Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. \n2751, 2779 (2014)). \n51 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 52 of 54\nis an absence of proof showing a likelihood of harm.”138  The Court finds no evidence of \nfinancial harm to the State if the Court does not require a bond; the State would simply continue \nreimbursing the Plaintiff providers as it has before and since the termination decision, until a \ndecision on the merits can be reached.  No bond is required. \nV.  Motion for Class Certification \n  Also pending is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.  In their motion, Plaintiffs seek \nto certify a class of all Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries who obtain, or who seek to obtain, covered \nhealth care services from PPKM and PPSLR and their current affiliated providers.139  The \nmotion is brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), which applies where “the party opposing \nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.”   \n  The injunctive relief requested in this case does not require individualized remedies. \nMoreover, case law supports this Court’s authority to issue classwide injunctive relief based on \nits general equity powers before deciding a class certification motion.140 Additionally, the so-\ncalled “necessity doctrine” has been invoked by most circuits in Rule 23(b)(2) cases, requiring a \nneed for class relief.141  Class relief is denied under this doctrine where the putative class \nmembers will benefit from any injunction issued on behalf of the individual plaintiffs.

See generally \nNewberg on Class Actions § 4:30 (5th ed. 2015) (“Rule 23(b)(2) authorizes certification of a class solely for the \npurpose of final injunctive or declaratory relief. Hence, a case seeking only a provisional remedy like a preliminary \ninjunction cannot be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) on that basis alone.”). \n141See Charles Wright, Arthur Miller, & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1785.2 (3d ed.); \nNewburg § 4:35 (“As of 2012, courts in six circuits have applied some version of necessity analysis,” including the \nTenth Circuit). \n52 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 63   Filed 07/05/16   Page 53 of 54\nparties in this case point the Court to Kansas Health Care Association, Inc. v. Kansas \nDepartment of Social & Rehabilitative Services,142 where the Tenth Circuit recognized the \nnecessity doctrine and upheld the district court’s decision that class certification was not \nnecessary in order to award classwide preliminary injunctive relief.143  Other cases in this circuit \nsuggest that foregoing class certification under these circumstances is appropriate: (1) where the \nnature of the rights asserted require that the injunction run to the benefit of all persons similarly \nsituated;144 and (2) where there is little risk of the named plaintiffs’ claims becoming moot \nduring a live controversy.145    \n  Under the circumstances of this case, class certification is unnecessary in order to award \nrelief to all Kansas Medicaid patients who obtain or seek to obtain covered health services from \nPPKM and PPSLR.  The Court has granted the motion for preliminary injunction, enjoining the \nKDHE from enforcing its termination decisions until this case can be decided on the merits.  \nThis directive will allow all Kansas Medicaid patients who seek to obtain covered services from \nthese providers, to have those services covered.  And there is no suggestion by either party that \nthe Jane Doe Plaintiffs’ claims will become moot during the pendency of the lawsuit.  Under \nthese circumstances, Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is denied without prejudice. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED BY THE COURT that Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 12) is granted.

This civil action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate rights \nsecured by the federal Medicaid statutes, as well as the U.S. Constitution.  \n2.  Plaintiffs Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri (“PPKM”) and \nPlanned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri (“PPSLR”) provide \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 2 of 31\ncritically needed family planning and preventive health services to hundreds of women and men \nin underserved areas of Kansas through the Kansas Medicaid program. Kansas Medicaid does \nnot pay for abortions except in extremely narrow circumstances. \n3.  As is required by federal law, Medicaid enrollees, such as Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1 \nthrough #3 (“Jane Doe Plaintiffs”), may seek family planning services from a participating \nprovider of their choice and have those services covered by Medicaid.  \n4.  This action challenges the unlawful, unwarranted and politically motivated \ndecision by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (“KDHE”), at the direction of \nGovernor Sam Brownback (collectively “the State”), to terminate PPKM and PPSLR from the \nKansas Medicaid program, including KanCare, the program from which nearly all Medicaid \nbeneficiaries receive services.  This action also challenges the State’s unprecedented action to \nterminate not only the Planned Parenthood entities, but also eleven individual health care \nprofessionals who have Kansas Medicaid provider agreements and numbers—five of whom are \ncurrent employees of PPKM (together with PPKM and PPSLR, “Current Provider Plaintiffs”), as \nwell as five who are former employees of PPKM and one who is a former employee of PPSLR \n(“Former Provider Plaintiffs”).  \n5.  The State’s final termination decisions were issued on May 3, 2016 and, absent an \ninjunction, will become effective May 10, 2016.  See Final Termination Letters from Jason \nOsterhaus, Manager, Program Integrity Unit, KDHE Div. of Health Care Finance (“Osterhaus”) \nto Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs (May 3, 2016), attached hereto as Exhibit A. The State \npurports to base its termination decisions (which are identical) on the following grounds: 1) \nallegations made by anti-abortion activists in discredited YouTube videos against other Planned \nParenthood affiliates in other states and against Planned Parenthood Federation of America \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 3 of 31\n(“PPFA”) regarding the supposed sale of fetal tissue; 2) allegations that the Planned Parenthood \nhealth center in Overland Park failed to cooperate with a solid waste inspection conducted by \nKDHE that could have led to the discovery of solid waste violations, and 3) other states’ reliance \non allegations of potentially fraudulent Medicaid claims by Planned Parenthood affiliates in \nthose states as grounds for terminating those affiliates from their respective Medicaid programs.  \nSee Notices of Intent to Terminate from Osterhaus to Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs \n(Mar. 10, 2016), attached hereto as Exhibit B. \n6.  The State’s allegations provide no possible legitimate basis to terminate any of the \nCurrent or Former Provider Plaintiffs. Not only are the allegations unfounded, but none relate in \nany way to PPSLR or the eleven individual health care professionals, and certainly not to their \nability to provide quality Medicaid services. And the only allegation related to PPKM—about \nKDHE’s inspection of the Planned Parenthood health center in Overland Park—is false and also \nprovides no basis for termination from the Medicaid program.   \n7.  Unless the State’s termination decisions are prevented from taking effect, Current \nProvider Plaintiffs will be terminated from Kansas’ Medicaid program, disqualifying them from \nproviding basic and preventive health care services to approximately 450-500 Kansas women \nand men who depend on them for that care. Defendant’s actions will cause significant and \nirreparable harm to Medicaid patients, including the Jane Doe Plaintiffs, who will lose their \nprovider of choice, will find their family planning services interrupted, and in many cases will be \nleft with reduced access to care.  \n8.  Defendant’s actions violate 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23), which is known as the \nMedicaid “free choice of provider requirement,” because, by barring the Current Provider \nPlaintiffs from the Medicaid program, Defendant prevents their patients, including the Jane Doe \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 4 of 31\nPlaintiffs, who receive family planning health services from Current Provider Plaintiffs, from \nreceiving services from their qualified, willing provider of choice.  \n9.  Defendant’s actions further impermissibly treat the Plaintiffs differently than \nother Medicaid providers and penalize them without adequate justification for the exercise of \nconstitutional rights, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n10.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to protect the Jane Doe Plaintiffs’ \nand other class members’ access to—and the Current Provider Plaintiffs’ ability to provide—\nthese critical medical services. Plaintiffs also seek further declaratory and injunctive relief to \nprevent the eleven individual health care professional Plaintiffs from becoming a “terminated” \nprovider for cause from Kansas Medicaid, which can have serious, negative professional \nconsequences, including potential adverse action taken against their professional licenses and \nemployment.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  Subject-matter jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343. \n12.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court.   \n13.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 5 of 31\nTHE PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs   \nPPKM  \n14.  For 40 years, PPKM (and its predecessor organization), has been a trusted \nMedicaid provider for thousands of Kansans.  \n15.  Since 2013, when the Kansas Medicaid program moved from a fee-for-service \nprogram model to a managed care program model under KanCare, PPKM has been a KanCare \nprovider for Kansas Medicaid enrollees, of whom nearly all are enrolled in one of three managed \ncare organizations that coordinate care for the State of Kansas.  \n16.  PPKM and affiliated providers provide family planning and other preventive \nhealth services to Kansas Medicaid/KanCare beneficiaries at health centers in Wichita and \nOverland Park, and at three health centers in Missouri—in Gladstone, Independence, and Kansas \nCity.1  \n17.  PPKM offers Medicaid patients a range of family planning and other health \nservices at these centers, including well-woman exams, contraception (including long-acting \nreversible contraception, or “LARC”) and contraceptive counseling, hormonal counseling, \nscreening for breast cancer, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, screening and treatment \nfor sexually transmitted infections (“STIs”), including human papilloma virus (“HPV”) vaccines, \nand pregnancy testing and counseling. Although PPKM and affiliated providers offer abortion \nservices at a limited number of health centers, Kansas Medicaid does not cover abortions except \n                                                 \n1 Kansas allows Medicaid beneficiaries to obtain care in border cities—cities within 50 miles of \nthe Kansas border.  See Kan. Med. Assistance Program, Provider Manual: General Benefits \n§ 2300, at 2-42 (updated Aug. 2008), https://www.kmap-state-\nks.us/Documents/Content/Provider%20Manuals/Gen%20benefits_090109_973.pdf. \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 6 of 31\nin rare circumstances where allowed by federal law.  PPKM and affiliated providers do not \nparticipate in fetal tissue donation. \n18.  In 2015, PPKM provided family planning care at approximately 650 visits to \nnearly 450 patients enrolled in Kansas Medicaid/KanCare. In 2014, family planning care was \nprovided at approximately 750 visits to nearly 500 patients enrolled in Kansas \nMedicaid/KanCare. \n19.  PPKM brings this action on behalf of itself, its affiliated providers, and its \npatients. \nPPSLR \n20.  PPSLR is a Missouri not-for-profit corporation, headquartered in St. Louis, \nMissouri.  PPSLR operates several health centers in Missouri, including a health center in Joplin, \nwhich is located approximately 7 miles from the Kansas border and provides family planning \nhealth services to a small number of Kansas Medicaid patients.  \n21.   PPSLR’s Joplin health center offers Kansas Medicaid patients a range of family \nplanning and other health services, including well-woman exams, contraception (including \nLARC) and contraceptive counseling, hormonal counseling, screening for breast cancer, \nscreening and treatment for cervical cancer, screening and treatment for STIs, including HPV \nvaccines, and pregnancy testing and counseling. The Joplin health center does not provide \nabortions, and PPSLR does not participate in fetal tissue donation. \n22.  PPSLR brings this action on behalf of itself and its patients. \nCurrent and Former Employee Plaintiffs \n23.  Plaintiffs Orrin Moore, M.D.; Kristin Metcalf-Wilson, WHNP-BC; Maria Ward, \nWHNP-BC; Viola Johnson, WHNP-BC; and Cheryl Lyon, WHNP-BC, are current employees of \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 7 of 31\nPPKM, and are enrolled Kansas Medicaid and KanCare providers.  These providers have Kansas \nMedicaid provider agreements and numbers, which are associated with PPKM, that they wish to \nkeep. These Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and their patients. \n24.  Plaintiffs Mary-Jo Drake, NP; Justine Flory, CNM; Kathleen Kafka, FNP-BC; \nSarah Kearns, WHNP-BC; Victoria Zadoyan, CNM; are former employees of PPKM and have \nnot worked there for approximately one year, at least. Despite the fact that they no longer work \nfor PPKM these providers have Kansas Medicaid provider agreements and numbers, which are \nassociated with PPKM, that remain “active” with the Kansas Medicaid program. Although these \nproviders have no interest in maintaining a Kansas Medicaid provider number that is associated \nwith their former employer, they object to being terminated for cause. These Plaintiffs bring this \naction on behalf of themselves. \n25.  Plaintiff Sharon Keogh, NP, is a former employee of PPSLR. Despite the fact that \nMs. Keogh no longer works for PPSLR she has a Kansas Medicaid provider number, which is \nassociated with PPSLR, that remains “active” with the Kansas Medicaid program.  Although she \nhas no interest in maintaining a Kansas Medicaid provider number that is associated with her \nformer employer, she objects to being terminated for cause. She brings this action on her own \nbehalf. \n26.  Each of the current and former employee Plaintiffs have professional health care \nlicenses that they wish to preserve in good standing so that they may practice their chosen \nprofession, and so that they may maintain and/or acquire future employment related to their \nprofession.  \n \n \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 8 of 31\nJane Doe Plaintiffs \n27.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, a Kansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains \nreproductive health care from PPKM and affiliated providers and desires to continue to do so. \nShe sues on behalf of herself and as a representative of a class of Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries \nwho obtain, or who seek to obtain, covered health care services from PPKM and affiliated \nproviders. \n28.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #2, a Kansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care from PPKM and affiliated providers and desires to continue to do so. \nShe sues on behalf of herself and as a representative of a class of Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries \nwho obtain, or who seek to obtain, covered health care services from PPKM and affiliated \nproviders. \n29.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3, a Kansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care from PPKM and affiliated providers and desires to continue to do so. \nShe sues on behalf of herself and as a representative of a class of Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries \nwho obtain, or who seek to obtain, covered health care services from PPKM and affiliated \nproviders. \n30.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1 through #3 appear pseudonymously because of the private \nand personal nature of the medical care that they receive from PPKM and affiliated providers, \nand their desire not to have that information become public in order for them to assert their legal \nrights.   \nB.  Defendant \n31.  Susan Mosier, M.D., is Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and \nEnvironment, and in that role, governs KDHE, which is the state agency that administers \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 9 of 31\nKansas’s Medicaid program, including KanCare, and has issued termination notices to the \nCurrent and Former Provider Plaintiffs. Defendant Mosier has sent copies of the final \ntermination notices to the three managed care organizations (“MCOs”) that coordinate care for \nKanCare recipients, which, if allowed to take effect, will result in the termination of the Current \nand Former Provider Plaintiffs as KanCare providers.  Defendant Mosier is sued in her official \ncapacity, as are her employees, agents, and successors in office. \nTHE MEDICAID PROGRAM \nA.  The Medicaid Statute \n32.  The Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of \n1935, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., pays for medical care for eligible needy people. A state may elect \nwhether or not to participate; if it chooses to do so, it must comply with the requirements \nimposed by the Medicaid statute and by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services (“HHS”) in her administration of Medicaid. See generally 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(1)–(83). \n33.  To receive federal funding, a participating state must develop a “plan for medical \nassistance” and submit it to the Secretary of HHS for approval. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). As part of \nits plan, a state may contract with health plans, or managed care organizations (“MCOs”), to \ncoordinate health care for its Medicaid beneficiaries, subject to requirements set by federal law.  \n34.  Among other requirements, the State plan must provide that: “[A]ny individual \neligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, \ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required . . . who \nundertakes to provide him such services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A). \n- 9 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 10 of 31\n35.  Congress has singled out family planning services for special additional \nprotections to ensure freedom of choice, specifically providing that, with respect to these \nservices and with certain limited exceptions not applicable here, “enrollment of an individual \neligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management system . . . , a medicaid \nmanaged care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person \nfrom whom the individual may receive services . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(B).  \n36.  Implementing regulations similarly require the State plan to provide that “[a] \nbeneficiary enrolled in a primary care case-management system, a Medicaid MCO, or other \nsimilar entity will not be restricted in freedom of choice of providers of family planning \nservices.” 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(b)(2). \n37.  The federal government reimburses the state of Kansas 90% of expenditures \nattributable to offering, arranging, and furnishing family planning services and supplies in \nMedicaid. 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(a)(5). \nB.   Implementation of the Medicaid Act \n38.  For decades, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the agency \nwithin HHS that administers Medicaid (and its predecessor organization), has repeatedly \ninterpreted the “qualified” language in Section 1396a(a)(23) to prohibit states from denying \naccess to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that provider to perform Medicaid-\ncovered services or to properly bill for those services, including reasons such as the scope of the \nmedical services that the provider chooses to offer.  \n39.  CMS has long explained that “[t]he purpose of the free choice provision is to \nallow [Medicaid] recipients the same opportunities to choose among available providers of \n- 10 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 11 of 31\ncovered health care and services as are normally offered to the general population.” Ctrs. for \nMedicare & Medicaid Servs., CMS Manuals Publication #45, State Medicaid Manual § 2100.  \n40.  Consistent with this understanding, CMS has a long history of rejecting state \nplans that seek to limit the type of provider that can provide particular services. See, e.g., 53 Fed. \nReg. 8699-03 (Mar. 16, 1988) (noting rejection of a state plan that would limit providers to \n“private nonprofit” organizations); 67 Fed. Reg. 79121 (Dec. 27, 2002) (noting disapproval of a \nstate plan amendment that would have limited “beneficiary choice . . . by imposing standards that \nare not reasonably related to the qualifications of providers”). \n41.  Moreover, even though CMS is permitted to waive § 1396a(a)(23) in \ndemonstration projects approved under Social Security Act § 1115, 42 U.S.C. § 1315, CMS \nrepeatedly rejects state requests to do so for family planning services, including in recent years. \nSee Letter from Marilyn Tavenner, Adm’r, CMS, to Beverly Mackereth, Sec’y, Pa. Dep’t of Pub. \nWelfare (Aug. 28, 2014), http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-\nTopics/Waivers/1115/downloads/pa/pa-healthy-ca.pdf (denying request from Pennsylvania: “No \nwaiver of freedom of choice is authorized for family planning providers.”); Letter from Manning \nPellanda, Dir., CMS Div. of State Demonstrations and Waivers, to Julie Lovelady, Interim \nMedicaid Dir., Iowa Dep’t of Human Servs. (Feb. 2, 2015), http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-\nCHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/ia/wellness-plan/ia-wellness-\nplan-current-appvl-02022015.pdf (denying request from Iowa: “No waiver of freedom of choice \nis authorized for family planning providers.”). \n42.  Indeed, in August 2012, when Kansas applied to CMS for a § 1115 demonstration \nwaiver to implement KanCare and move its Medicaid program to a managed-care-model, it \nrequested a waiver from the freedom of choice requirement.  State of Kan., “KanCare”: Section \n- 11 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 12 of 31\n1115 Demonstration—Application 17 (Aug. 6, 2012), \nhttp://www.kancare.ks.gov/download/KanCare_Section_1115_Demonstration_August_6_2012.p\ndf.  CMS approved the application and the requested waiver—except as to family planning \nproviders, thus allowing Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries to continue to receive their planning \nservices from their provider of choice.  CMS, Waiver Authority (Jan. 1, 2013), \nhttp://www.kancare.ks.gov/download/KanCare_Waivers_and_Expenditure_Authorities.pdf (“No \nwaiver of freedom of choice is authorized for family planning providers.”).  \n43.  Again, when CMS approved amendments to KanCare in January 2014, it kept that \nwaiver “in force” and made clear that it was “unchanged.” Letter from Cindy Mann, Director, \nCMS, to Susan Mosier, M.D., then-Medicaid Director, KDHE 2 (Jan. 29, 2014), \nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-\nTopics/Waivers/1115/downloads/ks/ks-kancare-ca.pdf.   \n44.  Following the release of the anti-abortion activists’ YouTube videos, a number of \nstates attempted to terminate Planned Parenthood affiliates from their Medicaid programs, and \nCMS has, again, explained the free choice of provider protections.  In August 2015, CMS filed a \nStatement of Interest in a case challenging one such termination attempt, in Louisiana. Statement \nof Interest of the United States, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Kliebert, No. 3:15-cv-\n00565 (M.D. La. Filed Aug. 31, 2015), ECF 24. In February, CMS filed an amicus brief in the \nappeal of the preliminary injunction granted in that case. Br. For the United States as Amicus \nCuriae, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, No. 15-30987 (5th Cir. Filed Feb. 17, \n2016). In both instances, CMS made clear that the free choice of provider requirement prevents \nstates from excluding providers for reasons unrelated to fitness to provide medical services or to \nproperly bill for those services, and that the requirement would be a nullity if states “could use \n- 12 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 13 of 31\nindividualized proceedings to exclude providers for no reason or for an invalid reason, or without \nany supporting evidence.”  In addition, CMS explained that affiliation with a sanctioned entity is \nnot, by itself, sufficient basis to exclude a provider.   \n45.  Just last month, on April 19, 2016, CMS sent a letter to all State Medicaid \nDirectors to provide guidance to state Medicaid agencies on protecting the right of Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to receive covered services from any qualified provider willing to furnish such \nservices when the state exercises its authority to take action against providers that affects \nbeneficiary access to those providers, including but not limited to the denial or termination of \nprovider enrollment, or the exclusion of providers from program participation. Letter from Vikki \nWachino, Director, CMS, to State Medicaid Directors 1 (Apr. 19, 2016), \nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/SMD16005.pdf. As the guidance \nmakes clear, the free choice of provider requirement limits a state’s authority to take action \nagainst a Medicaid provider unless the action is “related to the fitness of the provider to perform \ncovered medical services—i.e., its capability to perform the required services in a professionally \ncompetent, safe, legal and ethical matter—or the ability of the provider to appropriately bill for \nthose services.” Id. at 2. \n46.  The letter further explains that proper reasons for such actions “may not include a \ndesire to target a provider or set of providers for reasons unrelated to their fitness to perform \ncovered services or the adequacy of their billing practices. The failure of a state to apply \notherwise reasonable standards in an evenhanded manner may suggest such targeting.”  Id. In \naddition, a \nstate’s action against a provider affecting beneficiary access to the provider must be \nsupported by evidence of fraud or criminal action, material non-compliance with relevant \nrequirements, or material issues concerning the fitness of the provider to perform covered \nservices or appropriately bill for them.  Taking such action against a provider without \n- 13 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 14 of 31\nsuch evidence would not be in compliance with the free choice of provider requirement. \nId. \n \nGOVERNOR BROWNBACK’S EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE PROVIDER PLAINTIFFS \n47.  After the release of the discredited YouTube videos last summer, which falsely \npurported to show some Planned Parenthood affiliates engaging in unlawful conduct related to \nfetal tissue donation, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback requested that the Kansas Board of \nHealing Arts (“BOHA”), the licensing and regulatory Board for health care providers in Kansas, \ninspect Planned Parenthood health centers and investigate whether any sells fetal tissue. The \nrequest also called on KDHE to assist in the investigation. Press Release, Office of Kan. \nGovernor Sam Brownback, Governor Sam Brownback Calls for Inspections of Planned \nParenthood and Abortion Facilities in Kansas (July 21, 2015), http://governor.ks.gov/media-\nroom/media-releases/2015/07/21/governor-sam-brownback-calls-for-inspections-of-planned-\nparenthood-and-abortion-facilities-in-kansas. \n48.  On August 4, 2015, BOHA opened an investigation into whether Planned \nParenthood health centers comply with all Kansas laws regarding fetal tissue and requested \ndocumentation supporting compliance with these laws. Comprehensive Health of PPKM fully \ncomplied with this investigation. \n49.  On December 16, 2015, KDHE’s Bureau of Waste Management (for the first time \never) began inspecting the Overland Park health center. That inspection was completed on \nJanuary 5, 2016. Although KDHE now claims that the Overland Park health center failed to \ncooperate with the inspection, at the completion of the inspection on January 5, BWM inspectors \nprovided the health center with a report which stated that no violations were found.  \n- 14 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 15 of 31\n50.  On January 7, 2015, BOHA completed its investigation, and determined after a \n“careful review” no further action would be taken, clearing PPKM of any allegation of \nwrongdoing.  \n51.  Undeterred, and without prior warning, on January 12, 2016, Governor \nBrownback announced in his State of the State Address that the “time has come to finish the job” \nof “stopping most taxpayer funding from going to Planned Parenthood.”2 Gov. Sam Brownback, \n2016 State of the State (Jan. 12, 2016), http://www.governor.ks.gov/media-\nroom/speeches/2016/01/13/2016-state-of-the-state---january-12-2016.  After touting his record \non “pro-life legislation” and as a “champion[] for life,” and accusing Planned Parenthood of \n“trafficking [in] baby body parts,” Governor Brownback directed Defendant Mosier to “ensure \nthat not a single dollar of taxpayer money goes to Planned Parenthood through our Medicaid \nprogram.” \n52.  The same day, Governor Brownback issued a letter directing Defendant Mosier \n“to take all necessary steps to terminate [PPKM] and all associated providers from Kansas \nMedicaid, including KanCare.” Letter from Sam Brownback, Governor, State of Kan., to Susan \nMosier, M.D., Secretary, KDHE (Jan. 12, 2016), http://www.governor.ks.gov/docs/default-\nsource/documents/termination-of-planned-parenthood.pdf?sfvrsn=2. Governor Brownback based \nhis direction on PPKM’s “affiliation with the national Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica (“PPFA”) and other information provided by [KDHE].” Id.  A statement by Defendant \nMosier was also issued as part of a press release from the Governor’s Office, stating: “Based on \n                                                 \n2 Since 2011, Governor Brownback has each year approved a provision of Kansas law barring \nPPKM from contracting with KDHE to receive federal Title X funds to provide family planning \nservices to low-income and uninsured women and families. See Sen. Sub. H.B. 2014, § 107(l) \n(2011–2012 Leg. Sess.) (Kan. 2011). PPKM had received those funds from KDHE for over 25 \nyears. \n- 15 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 16 of 31\nthe Governor’s direction to terminate Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri as a \nKanCare provider, KDHE will issue an intent to terminate letter.” Press Release, Office of Kan. \nGovernor Sam Brownback, Governor Sam Brownback Orders Termination of Planned \nParenthood from Kansas Medicaid and KanCare Programs (Jan. 13, 2016), \nhttp://www.governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2016/01/13/governor-sam-brownback-\norders-termination-of-planned-parenthood-from-kansas-medicaid-and-kancare-programs \n53.  On March 9, 2016, the Associated Press ran a story, which reported that PPKM \nremained a Kansas Medicaid provider.  According to the AP, Governor Brownback’s \nspokesperson said she was looking into the situation.  John Hanna, Planned Parenthood Still \nGets Medicaid Funds Despite Threats, The Topeka Capital-Journal Online (Mar. 9, 2016), \nhttp://cjonline.com/news/2016-03-09/planned-parenthood-still-gets-medicaid-funds-kansas-\ndespite-threats. \n54.  The next day, on March 10, 2016, KDHE issued separate Notices of Intent to \nTerminate each of the Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs from the Kansas Medicaid \nprogram. All of the Notices stated: “At the direction of Governor Sam Brownback . . . the KDHE \nDivision of Health Care Finance (DHCF) intends to terminate your participation in the Kansas \nMedical Assistance Program (KMAP) . . . .” The Notices stated that termination was pursuant to \nKan. Admin. Regs. § 30-5-60(a): “noncompliance with applicable state laws, administrative \nregulations, or program issuances concerning medical providers;” “noncompliance with the \nterms of a provider agreement;” “unethical or unprofessional conduct;” and “other good cause.” \nKan. Admin. Regs. § 30-5-60(a)(2), (3), (9), (17).   \n55.  The Notices of Intent to Terminate allege that these “findings” were supported by: \n1) “[e]xtensive video evidence from across the country indicat[ing] practices by PPFA affiliates \n- 16 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 17 of 31\nthat warrant termination of PPFA’s Kansas affiliates”; 2) a “lack of cooperation” by the \nComprehensive Health with a KDHE solid waste inspection, which “cause[d] the State concern \nthat further investigation could have led to discoveries of solid waste violations, in addition to \ndiscoveries like those identified in the videos of other national PPFA affiliates”; and 3) that \n“Kansas’ neighboring states have identified potentially fraudulent Medicaid claims from the \nPPFA affiliates in those states and nationally as grounds for terminating the Medicaid \nparticipation of their respective states’ PPFA affiliates.”  \n56.  The Notices of Intent to Terminate explained that the provider was entitled to an \nadministrative review before representatives of KDHE to explain why the provider should \nremain a Kansas Medicaid provider.  On April 29, 2016, counsel for the Current and Former \nProvider Plaintiffs participated in the informal administrative review process and met with \nselected personnel from KDHE. Counsel explained and presented evidence demonstrating that \neach of the allegations discussed in the Notices of Intent to Terminate are false and wholly \nirrelevant to the providers’ qualifications as a Medicaid provider.  \n57.  On May 3, 2016, the Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs received final notices \nof termination (“Final Notices”).  The Final Notices state that the terminations will be effective \nMay 10, 2016.  The Final Notices provide no additional explanation of the grounds for the \nterminations.    \nUNLAWFUL BASES FOR TERMINATION \n58.  None of the grounds asserted by Defendant is a valid basis to terminate the \nCurrent or Former Provider Plaintiffs from the Kansas Medicaid program. \n- 17 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 18 of 31\n59.  On information and belief, Defendant’s bases for terminating the Current and \nFormer Provider Plaintiffs from Medicaid are highly irregular and have not been applied to any \nother Medicaid provider.  \n“Video Evidence Regarding PPFA Clinics” \n60.  The “[e]xtensive video evidence” referenced in the Notice of Intent to Terminate \npresumably refers to highly deceptive and discredited YouTube videos, which have been \nreleased in the past year by anti-abortion extremists, that falsely claim that some Planned \nParenthood affiliates in other states profited from fetal tissue donation.   \n61.  None of the Current or Former Provider Plaintiffs were the subject of or depticted \nin any of these videos. Moreover, neither PPKM nor PPSLR share any ownership interest or \ncontrol over the delivery of health services, personnel, or finances of any Planned Parenthood \naffiliate that was falsely represented in the videos. \n62.  Since the release of these deceptive videos, government officials in twelve states \nthat conducted investigations into claims that Planned Parenthood affiliates in those states \nprofited from fetal tissue donation have identified no wrongful conduct. Danielle \nKurtzleben, Planned Parenthood Investigations Find No Fetal Tissue Sales, NPR (Jan. 28, \n2016), http://www.npr.org/2016/01/28/464594826/in-wake-of-videos-planned-parenthood-\ninvestigations-find-no-fetal-tissue-sales. As alleged in paragraphs 48–50, Kansas is among the \nstates to investigate and find no evidence of wrongdoing. In addition, the Missouri Attorney \nGeneral, after conducting a thorough investigation into PPSLR’s handling of fetal tissue, cleared \nPPSLR of any wrongdoing.  Another eight states declined to even investigate— finding nothing \n- 18 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 19 of 31\nto substantiate claims of wrongdoing. Kurtzleben, Planned Parenthood Investigations Find No \nFetal Tissue Sales.3   \n63.  Although the Notice of Intent to Terminate references action taken by the \nInspector General of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“HHSC”) against \nPlanned Parenthood affiliates in Texas based on these videos, a Texas grand jury investigated \nthese claims and cleared a Planned Parenthood affiliate there of any wrongdoing. It instead \nindicted the leader of the antiabortion group that created the deceptive videos and an accomplice \non felony charges, see Molly Hennessy-Fiske, Texas Grand Jury Indicts Antiabortion Activists \nWho Made Undercover Videos of Planned Parenthood, L.A. Times (Jan. 25, 2016), \nhttp://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-grand-jury-planned-parenthood-20160125-story.html.  \n64.  Several Planned Parenthood affiliates whose staff were deceptively recorded and \nfalsely represented in the videos (none of which include current or former staff of PPKM or \nPPSLR) have filed a federal lawsuit against the antiabortion group behind the videos and its co-\nconspirators for engaging in a complex criminal enterprise to defraud PPFA and its affiliates and \ninterfere with their delivery of critical health care services. Among the co-conspirators is Troy \nNewman, founder of the dangerous and extremist anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, which \nis headquartered in Wichita. The lawsuit explains how the antiabortion group, its leaders, and \nmultiple co-conspirators engaged in illegal conduct that includes violating the Racketeer \nInfluence and Corrupt Organization Act (“RICO”), wire fraud, mail fraud, invasion of privacy, \nillegal secret recording, and trespassing. \n                                                 \n3 One federal judge in California reviewed the videos and found no evidence of criminal \nwrongdoing. See Nat’l Abortion Fed’n v. Ctr. for Med. Progress, No. 15-cv-03522-WHO, 2016 \nWL 454082, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 5, 2016) (“I have reviewed the recordings relied on by \ndefendants and find no evidence of criminal activity.”). \n- 19 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 20 of 31\n65.  Neither PPKM nor PPSLR are subsidiaries of PPFA. Rather, PPFA is a \nmembership organization that promulgates medical and other standards to which members \n(known as “affiliates”), such as PPKM and PPSLR, must adhere to operate under the name \n“Planned Parenthood” and otherwise use the Planned Parenthood service mark.  There are fifty-\nnine Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country. PPFA does not provide medical services \nor operate health centers. \n“Failure to Cooperate with Solid Waste Disposal Inspection” \n66.  KDHE’s allegation that the Overland Park health center failed to cooperate with a \nsolid waste disposal inspection on December 16, 2015 is false, and does not relate whatsoever to \nany of the Current or Former Provider Plaintiffs other than PPKM.  \n67.  The Overland Park health center is licensed as an ambulatory surgical center and \nthus is customarily subject to unannounced inspections by inspectors from the Public Health \nDivision of KDHE. KDHE’s most recent inspection of the health center, prior to December 16, \n2015, was on May 7, 2015, was unannounced, and no violations were identified. \n68.  On December 16, 2015, two inspectors, Rebecca Wenner and Dan Tuggle, from \nKDHE’s Bureau of Waste Management (“BWM”) appeared unannounced at the Overland Park \nhealth center at a time when patients were in the health center, requesting access to inspect the \nfacility. Prior to December 16, 2015, the health center had never been inspected by BWM.  \n69.  Inspector Wenner presented an unsigned administrative search warrant, as support \nfor BWM’s authority to conduct inspections.  \n70.  In an effort to cooperate with inspectors, administrative staff at the Overland Park \nhealth center nonetheless allowed inspectors Wenner and Tuggle to enter and inspect the health \ncenter.  However, inspectors Wenner and Tuggle began taking photographs—something that \n- 20 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 21 of 31\nKDHE inspectors had never done—not only of solid waste-related items, but also of items \nhaving nothing to do with solid waste.  Inspectors Wenner and Tuggle also requested the names \nof solid waste and other vendors, but could not confirm that this information would be kept \nconfidential by BWM. \n71.  Out of concern for the privacy and safety of patients and staff in the health center, \ninspectors Wenner and Tuggle were advised that they could not take photographs. In addition, on \nthe advice of legal counsel, inspectors Wenner and Tuggle were advised that they would need to \nreturn with a valid administrative warrant in order to complete their inspection.  \n72.  Inspectors Wenner and Tuggle returned later that day with a new, signed \nadministrative warrant. Attached to the warrant was an affidavit from inspector Wenner, which \nwrongly claimed that she was denied entry to conduct the inspection in violation of Kan. Stat. \nAnn. § 65-3409(a)(6).   \n73.  Shortly after, PPKM’s legal counsel met with inspectors Wenner and Tuggle and \nreiterated that they could not take photographs due to privacy and safety concerns for patients \nand staff, but invited the inspectors to otherwise complete their inspection. Instead, inspectors \nWenner and Tuggle chose to leave the premises of the Overland Park health center.    \n74.  On December 17, 2015, legal counsel followed up with KDHE counsel Jennifer \nHackman and provided her a detailed letter, setting forth a factual account of the events that had \noccurred on December 16, 2015. The letter explained that there were serious concerns for patient \nprivacy and safety. The letter also explained the health center’s concern about releasing its \nvendor information with no confidentiality protections in place, citing that vendors have \nroutinely been harassed and the subject of death threats. This letter made it clear that Inspectors \n- 21 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 22 of 31\nWenner and Tuggle and any other KDHE staff were welcome to inspect the Overland Park \nhealth center.  \n75.  On January 5, 2016, inspectors Wenner and her supervisor, Ken Powell, appeared \nunannounced at the Overland Park health center to complete their inspection.  Inspector Wenner \npresented a signed administrative search warrant. Inspector Wenner explained that she intended \nonly to inspect and photograph waste receptacles and other containers where waste is maintained \nand disposed, and would not enter any room while patients were in the room.  \n76.  After Inspectors Wenner and Powell completed their inspection, Inspector \nWenner completed her report, which stated that no violations were identified.  The report also \nstated that vendor information would be provided to BWM by January 11, 2016, and \ndocumented the health center’s request that any photographs taken be treated as confidential.   \n77.  On January 15, 2016, following an agreed-upon extension of time, PPKM’s \ncounsel provided a letter to KDHE counsel with the requested vendor information.  The January \n15 letter reiterated the health center’s request that this highly sensitive information, along with \nthe photographs that were taken during the January 5 inspection, be kept confidential by KDHE, \nand provided ample legal support for its request.  \n78.  No further communication from KDHE was provided to the health center or its \nlegal counsel regarding the BWM inspection prior to receiving KDHE’s March 10, 2016, \nNotices of Intent to Terminate. \n79.  None of the events relating to BWM’s inspection of the Overland Park facility in \nany way concerns PPSLR or the individual Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs.   \n- 22 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 23 of 31\n80.  PPSLR does not share any ownership interest of PPKM, nor does PPSLR share \nany control over the delivery of health services at PPKM health centers, or personnel or finances \nof PPKM. \n“Claim Submission Concerns” \n81.  KDHE’s third ground to support its termination is based on a claim that other \nstates, namely Oklahoma and Texas, have identified potentially fraudulent Medicaid claims from \nPlanned Parenthood affiliates in those states as grounds for terminating those affiliates from \nMedicaid. \n82.  The Notices of Intent to Terminate reference a November 18, 2015 letter from \nOklahoma Governor Mary Fallin to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, urging it toconsider \nterminating the Planned Parenthood affiliates in Oklahoma from the Medicaid program. \nGovernor Fallin cited to a pending case in Oklahoma where it is alleged that a Planned \nParenthood affiliate in Tulsa submitted false claims, but as Governor Fallin’s letter recognized, \nthat case has not reached a final result, and there has been no admission or finding of \nwrongdoing.  \n83.  Moreover, neither PPKM nor PPSLR share any ownership interest in the Planned \nParenthood affiliate in Tulsa, or control over the delivery of health services, personnel or \nfinances of that affiliate. \n84.  KDHE’s reliance on a Texas case regarding a Planned Parenthood affiliate in that \nstate is similarly misguided. On October 19, 2015, the Office of Inspector General of the Texas \nHHSC issued notices of intent to terminate Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas from their \nMedicaid program based, in part, on information pertaining to a case involving Medicaid fraud \nallegations that was settled by a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Texas. However, on November \n- 23 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 24 of 31\n23, 2015, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas, as well as their \npatients, challenging HHSC’s termination notices. As their lawsuit explains, the settled case was \na meritless lawsuit that both Texas and the federal government declined to join, settled with no \nadmission of wrongdoing for practical reasons including concern about patient confidentiality \nbeing compromised if the case proceeded. And, as part of the settlement, Texas expressly \n“agree[d] to release and refrain from instituting, directing or maintaining any action seeking \npermissive exclusion from the Texas Medicaid Program against [the affiliate] for the Covered \nConduct.”   \n85.  Neither PPKM nor PPSLR share any ownership interest in any of the Planned \nParenthood affiliates in Texas, or control over the delivery of health services, personnel or \nfinances of any Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas. \n86.  None of the individual Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs have anything to do \nwith the actions or non-actions of the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Tulsa or the Planned \nParenthood affiliates in Texas. \nTHE IMPACT OF DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS ON PROVIDER PLAINTIFFS AND \nTHEIR PATIENTS \n87.  Only the most needy individuals in Kansas are eligible to receive Medicaid \ncoverage. In order to qualify for Kansas Medicaid/KanCare, among other requirements, an adult \nmust be low-income and pregnant, disabled or a parent. KDHE, Medicaid and KanCare \nEligibility Guidelines (2015), http://www.kdheks.gov/hcf/Medicaid/eligibility_guidelines.html. \nFor example, the monthly income for a family of four cannot exceed $768. KDHE, Medical \nCoverage for Parents or Caregivers of Children 2 (May 1, 2015), \nhttp://www.kdheks.gov/hcf/Medicaid/download/Medical_Coverage_for_Parents_Caregivers.pdf. \n- 24 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 25 of 31\n88.  The need for publicly supported family planning services is great in Kansas. In \n2010, 45% of pregnancies in Kansas were unintended. Guttmacher Inst., State Facts About \nUnintended Pregnancy: Kansas (2014), https://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/unintended-\npregnancy/KS.html (hereafter “State Facts: Kansas”).  And since 2010, the need for publicly \nfunded contraceptive services has increased. Of the estimated 324,550 Kansas women who need \nfamily planning services, approximately 55% require publicly funded contraceptive services and \nsupplies. Publicly supported family planning centers in Kansas met only 21% of the need, a 7% \ndecrease since 2010. Jennifer L. Frost et al., Guttmacher Inst., Contraceptive Needs and Services, \n2013 Update, at 18, 20, 28 (July 2015), \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/win/contraceptive-needs-2013.pdf. \n89.  Since the 2011 legislation preventing PPKM from receiving Title X funds, \npatients “are finding it harder to access birth control, cancer screenings and other reproductive \nhealth care services.” Associated Press, Kansas Loses Thousands in Federal Funding After \nVoting to Defund Planned Parenthood, KSHB.com (Aug. 22, 2015), \nhttp://www.kshb.com/news/state/kansas/kansas-loses-thousands-in-federal-funding-after-voting-\nto-defund-planned-parenthood. Indeed, some counties (including a county where PPKM \npreviously operated a health center) still have no Title X family planning providers. Id.  \n90.  Recent public health data also show that Sedgwick County, where PPKM’s \nWichita health center is located, has the highest sexually transmitted infection rate in the state of \nKansas. Madeline Anderson, Sedgwick Co. Health Officials Call High STI Rate ‘Alarming’, \nKAKE.com (Mar. 27, 2015), http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/STDs-hurt-Sedgwick-\nCounty-health-score-297770421.html. Reported cases of syphilis have also more than \nquadrupled in the Kansas City area from 2010 to 2014. Lisa Gutierrez, Syphilis Cases Rise \n- 25 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 26 of 31\nSharply in KC Area Amid Nationwide Increase in STDs, The Kansas City Star (Nov. 30, 215), \nhttp://www.kansascity.com/living/health-fitness/article47176765.html#storylink=cpy. \n91.  The Current Provider Plaintiffs help meet the need for publicly supported family \nplanning services. PPKM’s Wichita health center, for example, provides care in an HHS-\ndesigned Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area—a geographic area in which primary \ncare professionals are practically inaccessible.  PPSLR’s Joplin, Missouri health center is just \nacross the border from Cherokee County, Kansas, which is also in a Primary Care Health \nProfessional Shortage Area and is designated as a Medically Underserved Population Area. \n92.  Even if other Medicaid providers were available, patients insured through \nMedicaid choose to receive their reproductive health care from Planned Parenthood based on a \nnumber of factors that are generally not available at other providers. With their evidence-based \npractices and up-to-date technology, Planned Parenthood health centers are known as providers \nof high-quality medical care.  Many patients also turn to these providers for their reproductive \nhealth care because they are concerned about their privacy and fear being judged by other \nproviders.    \n93.  In addition, many low-income patients have unique scheduling constraints \nbecause they are juggling inflexible work schedules, childcare obligations, transportation \nchallenges, and lack of childcare resources. To ensure that these patients have access to family \nplanning services, PPKM and PPSLR offer extended hours and walk-in appointments, and offer \nsame day birth control shots, birth control implants, and intrauterine devices, so that patients \nonly need to make one trip to a health center to obtain their contraceptive method of choice. \nPPKM and PPSLR also have either Spanish speaking staff or translator services available to non-\nEnglish speaking patients at all times. \n- 26 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 27 of 31\n94.  Defendant’s actions will deprive the Current Provider Plaintiffs’ Medicaid \npatients, including the Jane Doe Plaintiffs, of access to the high-quality, specialized care \nprovided by these providers.   \n95.  The Jane Doe Plaintiffs rely on the Current Provider Plaintiffs as the provider \nthey can turn to for critical medical care and for prompt, efficient, and compassionate services. If \nthe Current Provider Plaintiffs are eliminated from Medicaid, Jane Doe Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers will be prevented from receiving services from their provider of choice, will have their \nhealth care interrupted, and may encounter difficulties finding alternative care. \n96.  Without revenue from Kansas Medicaid, PPKM may be unable to continue to \nprovide family planning services in the same manner at its health centers, and may be forced to \nlay off staff members (including its current employees that are also Plaintiffs), reduce hours, or \nclose a health center. If a health center closes, this will affect not only the Medicaid patients at \nthat health center, but all of the patients who seek reproductive health care at that health center.   \n97.  Defendant’s action to terminate the individual Current and Former Provider \nPlaintiffs will harshly penalize current and former employees of PPKM and PPSLR by \nterminating them for cause. A termination for cause from a government health care program will \nput their ability to practice their profession, and retain or acquire future employment, severely at \nrisk. \n98.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n99.  This lawsuit is properly maintained as a class action under Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2). \n- 27 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 28 of 31\n100.  The class consists of all Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries who obtain, or who seek \nto obtain, covered health care services from the Current Provider Plaintiffs. \n101.  Although the precise size of the class is unknowable, as alleged in Paragraphs 7 \nand 18 above, PPKM and PPSLR provide health care services to approximately 450-500 Kansas \nMedicaid patients annually (a very small number of which are PPSLR’s patients).  Therefore, the \napproximate size of the class is 450-500 individuals. \n102.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1 through #3 are adequate class representatives because they, \nlike other members of the class, are Kansas residents and Medicaid patients who obtain their \nreproductive health care from a Current Provider Plaintiff and desire to continue to do so. Unless \nDefendant is enjoined, class representatives and class members will suffer the same injury and \nresulting harm: they will be unable to obtain health care services at the provider of their choice. \nAs a result, many of the Current Provider Plaintiffs’ Medicaid patients, including Plaintiffs Jane \nDoe #1 through # 3 and other class members, who already have few or no alternative options, \nwill find it difficult or impossible to access the reproductive and other health care services they \nneed. \n103.  Defendant’s actions—terminating the Current Provider Plaintiffs from the Kansas \nMedicaid program—applies generally to the class, such that both declaratory and injunctive \nrelief is appropriate for all members of the class. \n104.  Class members raise the same questions of law, including whether Defendant’s \ntermination of the Current Provider Plaintiffs from Kansas Medicaid violates the Medicaid free \nchoice of provider requirement, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23), such that, as a practical matter, \nadjudication of their claims would be dispositive of the interests of the other class members. \n- 28 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 29 of 31\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM I—MEDICAID ACT (TITLE XIX OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT) \n105.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 104 above. \n106.  Defendant’s actions violate Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States \nCode by denying the Current Provider Patients’ patients, including the Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1 \nthrough # 2, the right to choose any willing, qualified health care provider in the Medicaid \nprogram. \nCLAIM II—FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION \n107.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 104 above. \n108.  Defendant’s actions violate the Plaintiffs’ rights by singling them out for \nunfavorable treatment without adequate justification. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n109.  Order that this action be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B) and/or 23(b)(2); \n110.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendant’s actions violate the Medicaid Act; \n111.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendant’s actions violate the Fourteenth \nAmendment; \n112.  Issue temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, without bond, \nenjoining Defendant and her agents, employees, appointees, delegates, or successors from \nterminating, or threatening to terminate the Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs from Kansas \nMedicaid, or from directing the three managed care organizations that coordinate care for \nKanCare to terminate the Current and Former Provider Plaintiffs as KanCare providers;  \n- 29 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-02284-JAR-GLR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 30 of 31\n113.
