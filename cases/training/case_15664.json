    "summary": "<p>On September 28, 2015, Planned Parenthood Association of Utah (PPAU), represented by private counsel, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Utah. The plaintiff sued the Utah Department of Health under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 for violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to enjoin the defendants from preventing PPAU's access to federal funds it is otherwise qualified to receive.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that on August 14, 2015, the Governor of Utah directed state agencies to \"cease acting as an intermediary for federal grant money going to PPAU for non-abortion related services.\" The Governors directive was a response to a misleading video created by antichoice activists misrepresenting Planned Parenthood and falsely accusing the organization of \"selling fetal body parts.\" The Utah Department of Health followed the Governor's directive, and planned to interfere with Planned Parenthood's access to federal funding for non-abortion services. The plaintiffs argued that the state's actions would cause irreparable harm to Planned Parenthood and its patients.</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2015, Judge Clark Waddoups issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the defendants from denying funding to PPAU until October 15, 2016. On October 15, 2015, Judge Waddoups held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. On December 22, 2015 he issued an order denying the preliminary injunction and vacating the temporary restraining order. On December 27, 2015, PPAU filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on the preliminary injunction decision. The case was stayed at the district court level while the Tenth Circuit decided on the appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12 2016, the Tenth Circuit reversed the lower courts decision and imposed a preliminary injunction enjoining the state from defunding PPAU. On September 7, 2016, Judge Dee Benson&nbsp;for the district court issued a preliminary injunction order in line with the Court of Appeals ruling.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequent to Tenth Circuit's July 12, 2016 order, a poll was called, sua sponte, to consider en banc rehearing. Upon that consideration, a majority of the active available judges of the court voted to deny. Judge Briscoe and Bacharach wrote separate concurring opinions as to the denial of en banc rehearing. Judge Gorsuch wrote a separate dissent, that Judges Tymkovich, Hartz and Holmes joined.</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, 2017, the parties submitted a stipulation proposing a permanent injunction. The proposed permanent injunction provided that Utah would not deny funding to the Plaintiff on impermissible constitutional grounds, including the</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff&rsquo;s provision of or advocacy for legal abortion; or the Plaintiff&rsquo;s association or</p>\r\n<p>affiliation with the national Planned Parenthood organization or its affiliates, or other</p>\r\n<p>organizations with which provide for the advocacy of legal abortion.</p>\r\n<p>The proposed injunction would not require the defendants to continue contracts, renew contracts, or issue new contracts to the Plaintiff. However, if the defendants</p>\r\n<p>defunded, declined to renew, or did not issue a contract to the Plaintiff, they were required to state in writing a legitimate basis for doing so and provide that writing to the Plaintiff within thirty (30) days of the time their decision takes effect. Legitimate bases could not include unproven allegations against the national Planned Parenthood organization or its affiliates or the Plaintiff&rsquo;s provision of or advocacy for legal abortion.</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 2017, the Court adopted the parties' stipulated permanent injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On May 9, the parties stipulated to dismiss the case, with prejudice, in light of the permanent injunction. The Court did so on May 10.</p>\r\n<p>The permanent injunction is still in place.</p>",

      "text": " \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH, CENTRAL DIVISION \n \n   \n   \n   \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD ASSOCIATION  MEMORANDUM DECISION \nOF UTAH,  AND ORDER DENYING  \n  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nPlaintiff,   \n   \n   \nvs.  Case No. 2:15-cv-693 \n   \n  Judge Clark Waddoups \n \nGARY R. HERBERT, in his official capacity \nas Governor of the State of Utah, and JOSEPH \nK. MINER, M.D., in his official capacity as \nExecutive Director of the Utah Department of \nHealth, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n  This matter is before the court on a motion for preliminary injunction filed by Planned \nParenthood Association of Utah (“Plaintiff”).  Under the direction of Governor Gary R. Herbert, \nthe Utah Department of Health notified Plaintiff that it was terminating or not renewing four \ncontracts due to allegations of misconduct by other Planned Parenthood entities.  On September \n29, 2015, the court entered a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) that precluded the defendants \nfrom  defunding  or  denying  funding  to  Plaintiff  based  on  the  allegations  of  misconduct.  \n1 \n \n\nFollowing the court’s issuance of the TRO, the State announced publically that it would continue \nto fund the contracts through December 31, 2015, to allow time for this motion to be addressed. \n  On October 15, 2015, the court held an evidentiary hearing to determine if a preliminary \ninjunction should issue.  In light of the State’s plan to continue with the contracts through year-\nend, the defendants did not object to the TRO remaining in place pending the court issuing this \ndecision.  Hearing Tr., at 75-76 (Oct. 15, 2015) (Dkt. No. 27).  After due consideration of the \nparties’ briefing, oral arguments, and evidence, the court concludes Plaintiff has failed to meet its \nburden for a preliminary injunction.  Accordingly, the court denies the motion and vacates the \nTRO. \nBACKGROUND \nPlanned  Parenthood  Federation  of  America,  Inc.  is  a  national  corporation  that  has \nindependent local affiliates (“Planned Parenthood”).  Plaintiff is one of those affiliates.  In July \n2015, The Center for Medical Progress began releasing secretly recorded videos of Planned \nParenthood officials discussing abortions and fetal tissue.  According to public reports, the \nvideos portray Planned Parenthood altering how abortions are performed to obtain more intact \nfetal tissue and organs.  They also portray Planned Parenthood selling fetal tissue.1  Such conduct \nis illegal under federal law.  Planned Parenthood asserts the videos have been highly edited to \nconvey false information and that it has abided by all state and federal laws.  Nevertheless, the \nvideos have sparked nationwide media coverage and protests.   \n                                                            \n1   The videos were not offered into evidence and the court makes no finding about whether the \npublic reports are accurate or whether the videos accurately portray the conduct as alleged.  The \nparties submitted affidavits in support of their respective positions and the defendants agreed to \naccept the allegations in paragraphs 12 through 22 of the Complaint as true for purposes of this \nmotion.  Mem. in Opp’n, at ix (Dkt. No. 19).  The parties did not offer any additional evidence at \nthe preliminary hearing. \n2 \n \n\nUnlike other Planned Parenthood organizations, Plaintiff has never “participate[d] in any \nprograms that allow its patients to donate fetal tissue after an abortion.”  Declaration of Karrie \nGalloway,  ¶  13  (Dkt.  No.  3-1)  (hereafter  “Galloway  Decl.”).    Thus,  there  is  not  even  an \nallegation that Plaintiff has engaged in any wrong doing.  Instead, Plaintiff has had a long-term \nrelationship with the Utah Department of Health (the “Department”) as a provider of health care, \nSTD testing, and education.  Throughout that relationship, Plaintiff has enjoyed an excellent \nreputation with the Department.  \nPlaintiff’s services are available to all who seek them, including the underinsured and \nuninsured.  It has worked to develop a relationship with “groups that are at higher risk for \ncontracting and spreading disease, and having unplanned pregnancies.”  Id. ¶ 6.  Plaintiff seeks \nto provide education and testing to such groups to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies \nand stop the spread of communicable diseases.  The contracts at issue in this suit reflect the \nunique position that Planned Parenthood holds in the community.  Two of the contracts are “for \nafter-school abstinence education programs.”  Mem. in Opp’n, at x (Dkt. No. 19).  Another \ncontract is for an STD surveillance network that “track[s] the reporting of sexually transmitted \ndiseases.”  Id.  The final one is a “letter of understanding in which Utah agreed to subsidize a \ncertain number of STD tests [Plaintiff] submitted to the Utah Public Health Laboratory.”  Id.  All \nof the contracts are federally funded, where Utah acts as the intermediary to pass the funds \nthrough to Plaintiff.     \nUnder the express terms of the contracts, the Department may terminate them at will \nupon thirty-days notice.  Moreover, the Department has no obligation to renew a contract that is \nset to expire.  Following the release of the videos, Governor Herbert directed the Department to \nexercise those options.  Consequently, on September 8, 2015, the Department notified Plaintiff \n3 \n \n\nthat  it  was  terminating  the  Utah  Abstinence Education  Program  and  the  STD  Surveillance \nNetwork contract effective October 8, 2015.  It further informed Plaintiff it would not renew the \nPersonal  Responsibility  Education  Program  that  was  set  to  expire  on  September  30,  2015.  \nFinally, it informed Plaintiff the letter of understanding regarding  STD testing would only \ncontinue through December 31, 2015. \nThe  notices  of  termination  had  been  anticipated  since  Governor  Herbert  issued  the \nfollowing press statement on August 14, 2015: \nThe allegations against Planned Parenthood are deeply troubling.  Current Utah \nstate  law  prohibits  the  use  of  state  funds  to  provide  abortions  by  Planned \nParenthood or any other organization.  The federal government has provided \ngrants to Planned Parenthood, distributed through the Utah Department of Health.  \nThese funds are also prohibited from being used to perform abortions.  In light of \nongoing concerns about the organization, I have instructed state agencies to cease \nacting as an intermediary for pass-through federal funds to Planned Parenthood \nOther  state  and  local  agencies  and  nonprofits  will  continue  to  provide  STD \neducation and prevention programs.  \nPress Release (Aug. 14, 2015) (Dkt. No. 3-1 at p. 28).   \n  In addition to the press release, on August 17, 2015, the Salt Lake Tribune reported \nthe Governor as stating, “[w]e now have a video where they’re selling fetus body parts for \nmoney and it’s an outrage and the people of Utah are outraged.  I’m outraged.  So for \ncoloring outside the lines, Planned Parenthood forfeits some of their benefits.”  Robert \nGehrke, Utah Guv Says Cutting Fund to Planned Parenthood Won’t Hurt Pregnancy, STD \nservices, The Salt Lake Tribune (Aug. 17, 2015) (Dkt. No. 3-1 at p. 33).  It is further \nreported that Governor Herbert said, “[e]ven though it may not have happened in Utah, it \nhappened in their organization. . . . If the federal government wants to fund Planned \nParenthood, fund them directly.  We don’t have to be in the middle of that issue.”  Id. \n4 \n \n\n(alteration omitted).  Finally, he reportedly said, “I’m just saying we’re not going to be a \nparty  to  this  behavior.    You  colored  outside  the  lines.    You’re  going  to  be  held \naccountable.  Work that situation out and maybe we’ll talk again in the future.”  Id. at 34.  \n  Two days later, Governor Herbert “joined Planned Parenthood protestors who \ngathered at the state Capitol.”  Daphne Chen, Gov. Gary Herbert, Rep. Mia Love Join \nPlanned Parenthood Protest at Capitol, Deseret News (Aug. 19, 2015) (Dkt. No. 3-1 at p. \n36).  At the protest, Deseret News reported the Governor as saying, “I’m here today to add \nmy voice to yours and speak out on the sanctity of life.”  Id.   \nPlaintiff  asserts  Governor  Herbert’s  statements  and  participation  in  the  anti-\nabortion protest show he terminated the contracts at issue because he opposes abortion and \nfor no other reason.  Because abortion and the right of association are both constitutionally \nprotected, Plaintiff asserts the Governor violated Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he \nordered the contracts to be terminated. \nANALYSIS \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  \nWinter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008) (citation omitted).  The \ncourt “must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each \nparty of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.”  Id. (quotations and citation \nomitted).  To  obtain  a  preliminary  injunction,  Plaintiff  “must  establish  the  following \nelements:  (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will \nresult if the injunction does not issue; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs \n5 \n \n\nany  damage  the  injunction  may  cause  the  opposing  party;  and  (4)  issuance  of  the \ninjunction would not be adverse to the public interest.”  N. Natural Gas Co. v. L.D. \nDrilling, Inc., 697 F.3d 1259, 1266 (10th Cir. 2012) (quotations and citation omitted).  \nThe Tenth Circuit has stated “where the three latter harm factors weigh in favor of the \nmovant,” the first factor is “relaxed.”  Flood v. ClearOne Commc’ns, Inc., 618 F.3d 1110, \n1117 n.1 (10th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).2    \nII.  EQUAL PROTECTION—CLASS OF ONE \nPlaintiff  asserts  the  defendants  violated  the  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  Equal \nProtection clause because they singled out Plaintiff for unfavorable treatment without \ncause.  The court addresses this claim under a “class of one” analysis.   \nA.  Scope of Class-of-One Claims \nIn Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562 (2000), the Supreme Court \nrecognized a class-of-one theory under the Equal Protection Clause.  In that case, a \nmunicipality demanded that a property owner grant it a 33-foot easement before providing \nwater service even though it only demanded a 15-foot easement from other property \nowners.  Id. at 563.  Although the property owner was not a member of any protected \nclass,  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  the  demand  was  irrational  and  arbitrary  and \nimproperly singled out the property owner.  Id. at 565.  Thus, it allowed the property \nowner’s equal protection claim to proceed. \n                                                            \n2   The defendants acknowledge this is the standard in the Tenth Circuit, but they have preserved \nan objection on the ground that the relaxed standard is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.  \nMem. in Opp’n, at 1 n.4 (Dkt. No. 19) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 20-22).  \n6 \n \n\nFollowing Olech, courts grappled with how to apply the class-of-one theory.  The \nTenth Circuit stated the class-of-one theory applies when “a public official inflicts a cost \nor burden on one person without imposing it on those who are similarly situated in \nmaterial  respects,  and  does  so  without  any  conceivable  basis  other  than  a  wholly \nillegitimate motive.”  Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba County, 440 F.3d 1202, 1209 \n(10th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).  It cautioned, however, the theory should not be \napplied too broadly or it could transform federal courts into “second-guessers of the \nreasonableness of broad areas of state and local decisionmaking.”  Id. (quotations and \ncitation omitted).   \nApproximately  two  years  after  Jicarilla  Apache  Nation,  the  Supreme  Court \nnarrowed the theory by concluding it did not apply in the public employee context even if \nthe employer singled out the employee for “good reason, bad reason, or no reason at all.”  \nEngquist v. Or. Dep’t of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 606 (2008) (quotations and citations \nomitted).  The Court distinguished Olech on the basis that it involved “a clear standard \nagainst which departures, even for a single plaintiff, could be readily assessed.”  Id. at \n602.  In contrast, employment decisions “involve discretionary decisionmaking based on a \nvast array of subjective, individualized assessments.”  Id. at 603.  It is common to find \ndifferent treatment when the government is acting in its role as an employer rather than as \nsovereign over “citizens at large.”  Id. at 599, 605.  And it is not the court’s role to \ninterfere  in  such  discretionary  functions  unless  the  action  taken  by  the  government \n“independently violate[d] the Constitution.”  Id. at 606 (citations omitted).         \nIn this case, the defendants contend Engquist’s holding should be extended to \ngovernment  contractors  and  not  just  public  employees.    As  in  Engquist,  when  the \n7 \n \n\ndefendants sought to terminate the contracts, it was not acting in its role as a sovereign, \nnor  as  a  regulator.    Instead,  it  was  acting  as  a  decisionmaker,  making  subjective, \nindividualized assessments about whether to continue the contracts.  Moreover, the terms \nof the contracts gave the defendants full discretion and authority to continue them or \nterminate them at will.  In that arena, the defendants have broad discretion in how they \nmanage their affairs and with whom they choose to contract. \nThe defendants’ position has support in case law.  Both the First Circuit and the \nEleventh Circuit have extended the holding in Engquist to government contractors.  See \nCaesars Mass. Mgmt. Co. v. Crosby, 778 F.3d 327, 336 (1st Cir. 2015); Douglas Asphalt \nCo. v. Qore, Inc., 541 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2008).  In contrast, the Second and \nSeventh Circuits have refused to hold Engquist bars all class-of-one claims by government \ncontractors, but even those circuits acknowledge Engquist may reach to some government \ncontractors.  See Analytical Diagnostic Labs, Inc. v. Kusel, 626 F.3d 135, 142 (2d Cir. \n2010); Hanes v. Zurick, 578 F.3d 491, 495-46 (7th Cir. 2009).   \nIn the Tenth Circuit, the issue remains open because the Court has not had to reach \nit.  Nevertheless, it has stated in dicta that “it is arguably just a small step from” Engquist \n“to  the  conclusion  the  [class-of-one]  doctrine  shouldn’t  apply  when  the  government \ninteracts with independent contractors—in both circumstances, the government acts in a \nmore proprietorial and less regulatory capacity.”  SECSYS, LLC v. Vigil, 666 F.3d 678, \n690 (10th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted).     \nPlaintiff contends the court should not extend Engquist to this case.  In support of \nits contention, Plaintiff cites to Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina v. Cansler, \n8 \n \n\n877 F. Supp. 2d 310, 325-27 (M.D.N.C. 2012) and Planned Parenthood Greater Memphis \nRegion v. Dreyzehner, 853 F. Supp. 2d 724, 736-38 (M.D. Tenn. 2012).  Both cases were \ndecided  after  Engquist  and  both  concluded  it  was  improper  to  terminate  funding  to \nPlanned Parenthood based, in part, on the class-of-one theory.  Notably, however, neither \ncase discussed Engquist.  Therefore, the court does not find their reasoning persuasive.  \nWhile  there  may  be  some  situations  where  Engquist  should  not  apply  to  a \ngovernment contractor (meaning the court is not adopting a per se rule), this is not one of \nthem.  There is no “clear standard” against which a departure could be measured.  Thus, \nthe court concludes the class-of-one theory is inapplicable in this case unless Plaintiff can \nshow violation of an independent constitutional right.    \nPlaintiff argues that the independent constitutional right violated here is the right \nof association.  Plaintiff asserts the videos portray false information and no investigation \nhas uncovered any wrongdoing.  Thus, by implication, Plaintiff contends its right to \nassociate  with  other  Planned  Parenthood  entities  must  continue  because  no  criminal \nconduct has been proven.  Termination of the contracts, however, does not interfere with \nPlaintiff’s right to associate with other Planned Parenthood entities.  It is free to continue \nits affiliation with Planned Parenthood and it has no legal right, let alone a constitutional \nright, to continue with the contracts.  Moreover, Plaintiff has provided no case law to \nsupport its position that a contract cannot be terminated when a party associates with \nentities allegedly engaged in illegal conduct.  Accordingly, the court finds no violation of \nthe right of association. \n9 \n \n\nPlaintiff further contends its right to advocate for and perform abortions has been \nviolated.  No federal or state funds may be used to perform abortions.  Consequently, none \nof the contracts at issue pertain to abortions.  The court therefore concludes termination of \nthe contracts does not violate Plaintiff’s right to advocate for or perform abortions. \nBecause Plaintiff has not shown an independent violation of a constitutional right, \nthe court concludes Plaintiff is unlikely to prevail on its class-of-one claim. \nB.  Appropriate Comparators \nEven if Engquist does not apply, it is still unlikely that Plaintiff would prevail on \nits class-of-one theory.  To establish a class of one, Plaintiff must show (1) it was treated \ndifferently than others who were “similarly situated in every material respect;” and (2) the \n“difference in treatment” was “wholly unrelated to any legitimate state activity.”  Kan. \nPenn Gaming, LLC v. Collins, 656 F.3d 1210, 1216 (10th Cir. 2011) (quotations and \ncitations omitted).  This is an objective standard of reasonableness.  Id.  The Tenth Circuit \nhas stated, however, plaintiffs have a “substantial burden” to prove another is “similarly \nsituated in all material respects.”  Id. at 1217 (quotations and citation omitted).  The Court \nstrictly reads the “element because it addresses the main concern with the class-of-one \ntheory—that it will create a flood of claims in that area of government action where \ndiscretion is high and variation is common.”  Id. at 1218.    \nPlaintiff  asserts  others  “similarly  situated”  should  be  defined  as  “other \nreproductive health care providers.”  The standard, however, requires similarity in every \nmaterial  respect  and  Plaintiff’s  suggested  comparators  do  not  adhere  strictly  to  that \nelement.  At issue here is Plaintiff’s association with entities who have allegedly engaged \n10 \n \n\nin illegal conduct.  While the allegations may prove to be unfounded, they are nevertheless \nmaterial  at  this  time.    Plaintiff  has  failed  to  show  it  was  treated  differently  from  a \nspecifically identified comparator, namely, another reproductive health care provider that \nassociates with an entity allegedly engaged in illegal conduct.  Accordingly, the court \nconcludes Plaintiff is unlikely to prevail in showing it was treated differently than others \nsimilarly situated.   \nIII.  UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITION \nPlaintiff also asserts two unconstitutional condition claims.  First, Plaintiff asserts \nthe defendants have penalized it for advocating for reproductive choice and associating \nwith others who similarly advocate for pro-choice.  Plaintiff contends this violates its First \nAmendment rights of speech and association.  Second, Plaintiff asserts that its abortion \nservices are constitutionally protected because without such services a woman could not \nexercise her right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process \nClause.  By terminating the contracts, Plaintiff contends the defendants have penalized it \nfor exercising its right to perform abortions. \n‘“Under the modern unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the government may not \ndeny a benefit to a person on the basis that infringes his constitutionally protected [rights] \neven if he has no entitlement to that benefit.’”  Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v. \nMoser, 747 F.3d 814, 838 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 \nU.S.  668,  674  (1996))  (alterations  omitted).  The  “doctrine  has  been  applied  when  a \ncondition acts retrospectively in a discretionary executive action,” such as terminating a \ngovernment contract, “in retaliation for prior protected speech or association.”  Id. at 839 \n11 \n \n\n(citing Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 671) (emphasis in original).  Stated differently, the doctrine \ndoes not preclude officials from taking discretionary actions; it precludes officials from \ntaking discretionary actions “in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right.”  Id.  \nRetaliatory conduct is impermissible because it “would allow the government to produce a \nresult which it could not command directly.”  Id. at 838 (quotations and citation omitted).   \nThese types of “cases necessarily examine the official’s motive for taking the \naction.”  Id. at 839 (citation omitted).  Plaintiff bears the burden of proving “retaliation \nagainst the protected conduct was ‘a substantial or motivating factor’ for taking the action \nand the [defendants] would not ‘have taken the same action in the absence of the protected \nconduct.’”  Id. (quoting Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 675) (alteration omitted).  The key phrase is \n“retaliation  against  the  protected  conduct”  because  retaliation  against  non-protected \nconduct falls outside the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. \n  Plaintiff contends that Governor Herbert’s opposition to abortions and Plaintiff’s \nassociation with other pro-choice entities was the substantial or motivating force behind \nhis directive to terminate the contracts.  It points to the Governor’s participation in an anti-\nabortion protest mere days after his press release, during which he said he was there to \nspeak out for the sanctity of life.  These facts fall short of proving, however, that Governor \nHerbert’s opposition to abortion was a substantial or motivating factor for terminating the \ncontracts. \nGary Herbert has been the Governor of Utah for the past six years.  Although \nPlaintiff has been associated with other pro-choice entities since Governor Herbert took \noffice and it started performing abortions in Utah in 2011, the Governor still allowed the \n12 \n \n\nDepartment to enter into and maintain contracts with Plaintiff.  It was not until the videos \nwere released that the Governor acted to terminate the contracts.  Indeed, Plaintiff alleges \nand the defendants do not dispute that the Governor said, “We now have video where \nthey’re selling fetus body parts for money and it’s an outrage and the people of Utah are \noutraged.  I’m outraged.  So for coloring outside the lines, [Plaintiff] forfeits some of [its] \nbenefits.”  Complaint, ¶ 14 (Dkt. No. 2).  Both the Governor’s words and the temporal \nproximity between the release of the videos and his directive to terminate the contracts \nsupport he did not retaliate against Plaintiff based upon its right of association nor its right \nto advocate for and perform abortions.  Therefore, the court concludes Plaintiff is unlikely \nto prevail on its unconstitutional condition claims. \nIV.  IRREPARABLE HARM \nPlaintiff asserts it will suffer irreparable harm unless an injunction issues because \nit will be deprived of its constitutional rights.  As discussed above, however, the court has \nconcluded that Plaintiff likely will not be able to show it suffered a constitutional harm.  \nAny financial harm Plaintiff has suffered from the contracts’ termination can be redressed. \nPlaintiff further asserts it will suffer irreparable reputational harm if an injunction \ndoes not issue.  The defendants have shown, however, that many people have spoken out \nin  favor  of  Planned  Parenthood  following  the  Governor’s  pronouncement.    See \nDeclaration of Austin Cox (Dkt. No. 19-2).  While protestors against Planned Parenthood \nhave rallied, so too have supporters of Planned Parenthood.  The court therefore concludes \nthat Plaintiff has failed to show it will suffer irreparable reputational harm.  This factor \ntherefore weighs in favor of the defendants.     \n13 \n \n\nV.  INJURY  TO  PLAINTIFF  COMPARED  TO  INJURY  TO  THE \nDEFENDANTS \nPlaintiff asserts that the injury it will suffer outweighs any damage the defendants \nwill suffer if an injunction issues.  In reviewing the defendants’ action, it is also important \nto note what they did not do.  The defendants did not terminate Plaintiff as a Medicaid \nprovider.  This means Plaintiff may still be compensated for providing care to Medicaid \nrecipients.    Additionally,  the  defendants  have  not  sought  to  preclude  Plaintiff  from \nreceiving funding directly from the federal government, as Plaintiff has done in the past.  \nSee Galloway Decl., ¶ 55 (Dkt. No. 3-1).  Finally, the Governor’s directive does not \npreclude Plaintiff from advocating for or performing abortions.  Plaintiff’s injury is related \nonly to the loss of four contracts. \nIn contrast, if the defendants are enjoined from terminating the contracts, their \nauthority  to  manage  their  affairs  will  be  curtailed.    Moreover,  it  will  deprive  the \ndefendants  of  their  contractual  right  to  terminate  the  contracts  at  will.    Finally, \ngovernmental entities have an interest in avoiding the appearance of corruption.  Although \nPlaintiff has engaged in no wrong-doing, it is currently affiliated with other Planned \nParenthood entities that have allegedly engaged in illegal conduct.   \nUnder such circumstances, continuing to allow Plaintiff to provide services under \nthe auspices of the contracts may reasonably be perceived by the citizenry of Utah as \napprobation of the wrongful conduct.  Plaintiff derives benefit from its affiliation with the \nnational organization.  Indeed, Plaintiff argues that termination of the contracts harms its \nability  to  raise  funding  from  donors.  The  “good  will”  that  inheres  in  the  Planned \nParenthood brand also extends to “bad will” that attaches because of the allegations of \n14 \n \n\nwrongful conduct. The defendants have discretion under the contracts to consider whether \ncontinuation  of  them  would  send  a  message  that  wrongful  conduct  is  acceptable.  \nRequiring  the  defendants  to  continue  the  contracts  will  remove  the  defendants’ \ndiscretionary decisionmaking.  There is no monetary remedy for such injuries.  The court \ntherefore concludes the injuries to the defendants outweigh the injuries to Plaintiff.   \nVI.  IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC INTEREST \nThe final factor to consider is whether an injunction is in the public interest.  After \nthe Governor issued his directive, individuals at the Department sought to dissuade him \nfrom terminating the contracts.  They asserted that other providers could not fulfill the \ncontracts as well as Plaintiff and that terminating its relationship with Plaintiff could \njeopardize  future  funding  from  the  federal  government.    The  Governor  reiterated  he \nintended to redirect the funding to other qualified providers, but it is not clear he will be \nable  to  do  so.    Thus,  some  members  of  the  public  may  be  harmed  if  the  contracts \nterminate. \nBalanced against this harm is the right of the elected Governor of this State to \nmake decisions about what is in the best interest of the State.  These contracts relate to \ndiscretionary programs.  The State has acted as an intermediary to pass through federal \nfunds to Plaintiff, and has concluded it no longer desires to do so.  It is contrary to the \npublic’s interest to remove from the Governor the very discretion his position entails.  \nIndeed, these are the types of decisions that should be left to elected officials and not \nmanaged by the courts.  The court therefore concludes it is not in the public interest to \nenjoin the defendants from terminating the contracts at issue.   \n15 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  court  DENIES  Plaintiff’s  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 3) and VACATES the court’s temporary restraining \norder (Dkt. No. 12). \nDATED this 22nd day of December, 2015. \n            BY THE COURT: \n \n            _  \n            Clark Waddoups  \n            United States District Court \n             \n             \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n16 \n ",

PPAU files this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate rights \nsecured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  For \nover forty-five years, PPAU has been an integral provider of reproductive health \nservices to women, men, and teens of Utah, including providing education and testing to \nprevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (“STDs”), and education to prevent \nunwanted pregnancy.  For decades, PPAU has been awarded grants funded by the \nfederal government, including those administered by the State, to further reproductive \nhealth education and testing, including through a long-standing relationship with UDOH.  \n2.  On August 14, 2015, without warning and having expressed no prior \nconcerns about PPAU or the services it provides, Governor Herbert directed the \nagencies of the State of Utah to cease acting as an intermediary for federal grant \nmoney going to PPAU for non-abortion related services based solely on unproven \nallegations by an anti-abortion group of misconduct in other states by affiliates of the \nnational organization of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (the “National \n  2 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 3 of 18\nOrganization”) (collectively, with its affiliates, “Planned Parenthood”).  Governor Herbert \nhas therefore singled out PPAU for this unfavorable treatment, not based on any actual, \nor even alleged, misconduct by PPAU itself, but because of its association with Planned \nParenthood.   \n3.  The claims in this case arise in a current political climate that is very \nhostile to Planned Parenthood.  At the time of the filing of this complaint, threats of a \ncomplete shut-down of the federal government loom as certain opponents of Planned \nParenthood in Congress are conditioning the approval of the government’s operating \nbudget on the complete revocation of all federal funds to Planned Parenthood, unless \nthe organization certifies that it will not provide abortions.  Accordingly, Governor \nHerbert’s decision was motivated solely by animus toward PPAU’s constitutionally \nprotected, privately funded activities --- specifically, PPAU’s association with providers \nof abortion services, including the  National Organization and its affiliates, PPAU’s \nadvocacy for access to abortion services; and/or PPAU’s provision of and/or association \nwith abortion services, even though PPAU conducts all such activities outside of any \nstate or federal program and with no funding from those programs. \n4.  PPAU therefore seeks a judgment declaring that the actions of Governor \nHerbert, as implemented through UDOH, violate PPAU’s rights under the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  As these actions, if allowed \nto stand, will imminently and irreparably harm PPAU and the thousands of women, men, \nand teens of Utah who rely on PPAU for reproductive health education and testing to \n  3 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 4 of 18\nprevent the contraction and transmission of life-threatening infections and diseases, \nPPAU also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. \nTHE PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE \n5.  Planned Parenthood of Utah is a Utah non-profit corporation that provides \ncomprehensive reproductive health care to approximately 46,000 women, men and \nteens each year at health centers located throughout Utah, including in Logan, Ogden, \nHeber, Orem, St. George, and four health centers in Salt Lake County.  The care PPAU \nprovides includes annual wellness exams, birth control counseling and the provision of \nall FDA-approved form of contraception, testing and treatment for STDs, screening for \nbreast and cervical cancer, diagnosis and treatment of abnormal pap tests, \nvasectomies, and health education.  PPAU also provides abortions at one of its health \ncenters in Salt Lake City which are funded solely by private donations.  PPAU sues on \nbehalf of itself and its patients with regard to Defendants’ termination of the pass-\nthrough of federal funding to PPAU for non-abortion reproductive health care as \ndescribed below. \n6.  Defendant Gary R. Herbert is the Governor of the State of Utah.  In his \nofficial capacity, Governor Herbert is the Chief Executive Officer of the State of Utah.  \nGovernor Herbert maintains an office in Salt Lake County, Utah.  Governor Herbert is \nsued in his official capacity.   \n7.  Defendant Joseph K. Miner, M.D., is the Executive Director of the Utah \nDepartment of Health.  UDOH is a department of the State of Utah created by Utah \n  4 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 5 of 18\nCode § 26-1-4.  UDOH is the health, health planning, and medical assistance authority \nof the State of Utah and is the sole state agency for administration of federally assisted \nstate programs or plans for public health, health planning, maternal and child health, \nservices for children with a disability, and medical assistance.  Utah Code § 26-1-18.  \nDr. Miner maintains an office in Salt Lake County, Utah.  Dr. Miner is sued in his official \ncapacity. \n8.  Defendants, and those subject to their supervision, direction, and control, \nare responsible for the administration of the federally-funded programs at issue, and \nsimilar programs, whether now-existing or in the future.  The relief requested in this \naction is sought against each Defendant, as well as against each Defendant’s officers, \nemployees, and agents, and against all persons acting in cooperation with Defendants, \nunder their supervision, at their direction, or under their control. \n9.  This action raises questions under the Constitution of the United States \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and thus this Court has jurisdiction over all claims for relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n10.  Further, PPAU’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2201, and by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, and by the general legal and equitable powers of this Court. \n11.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because all \nDefendants reside in this District and the State of Utah.  Venue is also proper because a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n  5 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 6 of 18\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nGOVERNOR HERBERT’S DIRECTIVE \n \n12.  On August 14, 2015, Governor Herbert issued a statement regarding \nPPAU (the “Directive”), wherein Governor Herbert “instructed state agencies to cease \nacting as an intermediary for pass-through federal funds to Planned Parenthood [of \nUtah].” \n13.  Governor Herbert’s Directive was issued in response to recent (false) \naccusations made in the media by an anti-abortion organization that purport to relate to \nfetal tissue donation programs conducted by other affiliates of the National Organization \nin other states --- not PPAU. \n14.  In a press conference on August 17, 2015, Governor Herbert stated, “We \nnow have video where they’re selling fetus body parts for money and it’s an outrage and \nthe people of Utah are outraged.  I’m outraged.  So for coloring outside the lines, \nPlanned Parenthood [of Utah] forfeits some of their benefits.” \n15.  On August 19, 2015, Governor Herbert joined Mia Love, one of Utah’s \ncongressional representatives, and approximately three-hundred other attendees at a \nprotest held in the rotunda of the Utah State Capitol, to ask lawmakers to defund \nPlanned Parenthood.  At the protest, Governor Herbert stated, “I’m here today to add \nmy voice to yours and speak out on the sanctity of life . . . .”  He further stated, “The \nthing I find most appalling is the casualness, the callousness . . . the lack of respect, the \nlack of sensitivity to the unborn . . . .”  \n  6 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 7 of 18\n16.  However, the accusations made in the media against the other affiliates of \nPlanned Parenthood have not been proven, nor do these accusations include any \nalleged conduct by PPAU, as Governor Herbert himself acknowledged in his August 17, \n2015, press conference when he stated that none of the alleged conduct occurred in \nUtah.   \n17.  Thus, Governor Herbert knew, and continues to know, that there is no \nevidence, or even accusation, that PPAU has “colored outside” of any lines, including \nbecause PPAU does not participate in any program that provides fetal tissue for \nscientific research.  \n18.  Moreover, there has never been any assertion by Governor Herbert, \nUDOH, or anyone else that PPAU is not qualified to provide the federally-funded \nreproductive health education and STD testing services to the Utah community that it \nprovides through its relationship with UDOH, or that PPAU has ever abused any federal \ngrant money provided for such services. \n19.  Finally, as Governor Herbert himself acknowledged in his Directive, no \nfederal funding to PPAU, whether directly from the federal government or through state \nagencies such as UDOH, is used to provide abortions. \n20.  Instead, the funds affected by Governor Herbert’s Directive, which \nprimarily include funding through contracts between PPAU and UDOH, are shown in a \nlist available through a hyperlink included in the Governor’s statement: \n  7 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 8 of 18\na.  Funding to support the “Utah Abstinence Education Program,” the \npurpose of which is to provide abstinence education as a means of promoting \nabstinence from sexual activity among Utah youth.  This program is an afterschool \nprogram requiring parental permission to enroll. \nb.  Funding to support the “Personal Responsibility Education \nProgram,” the purpose of which is to educate adolescents on both abstinence and \ncontraception to prevent pregnancy and STDs, while also providing education into \nadulthood preparation topics such as positive self-esteem and health relationship \ndynamics, educational and career success, and life skills such as goal-setting, decision \nmaking, communication skills, and stress management.  This program is also an \nafterschool program requiring parental permission to enroll. \nc.  Funding to support a program in collaboration with the \nCommunicable Disease Prevention Program for STD Testing in the State of Utah, \nwherein federal funds are used to pay the Utah Public Health Laboratory for specimens \nto be tested for STDs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea (the “Targeted STD Testing \nFunds”). \nd.  Funding to support a program to improve timeliness, accuracy, and \ncompleteness of STD reporting and surveillance data, sometimes referred to as the \n“STD Surveillance Network.” \n  8 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 9 of 18\n21.  The Directive also purports to affect reimbursements made to PPAU for \npregnancy and STD testing for victims of rape or sexual assault through the Utah Office \nfor Victims of Crime. \n22.  Thus, the funds affected by Governor Herbert’s Directive are unrelated to \nabortion and/or to the donation of fetal tissue for scientific research (except that the \nprograms funded are intended to, and have the effect of, decreasing abortions). \n23.  Instead, Governor Herbert’s Directive was issued solely in retaliation for \nPPAU’s prior protected and privately funded activities --- specifically, that PPAU \nprovides, associates with, and/or advocates for access to abortion, even though PPAU \nconducts all such activities outside of any state or federal program and does not use \nfunding from any state or federal program for these activities. \nIMPLEMENTATION OF GOVERNOR HERBERT’S DIRECTIVE BY UDOH \n24.  On September 8, 2015, and pursuant to Governor Herbert’s Directive, \nUDOH provided PPAU with a thirty-day written notice of termination of its contract for \nthe Utah Abstinence Education Program, which was not set to expire until September \n30, 2016, and would be renewable for additional years at the time of expiration.  \nAccordingly, this contract will terminate on October 8, 2015. \n25.  On September 8, 2015, the UDOH also provided PPAU with a notice that \nUDOH would cease accepting funds from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (the “CDC”) for the STD Surveillance Network contract after September 29, \n2015, when such funds would otherwise be available through September 29, 2018. \n  9 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 10 of 18\nUpon information and belief, UDOH’s statements were not true as it will continue to \nreceive this CDC funding; it will just not provide it to PPAU.  This contract will terminate \non October 8, 2015. \n26.  The contract between UDOH and PPAU for the Personal Responsibility \nEducation Program (“PREP”) is set to expire on September 30, 2015, and UDOH has \nmade public statements that it will allow this contract to expire without renewal, per the \nGovernor’s Directive.  Upon information and belief, UDOH would have renewed the \ncontract for PREP for additional years, but for Governor Herbert’s Directive. \n27.  PPAU has also been informed by UDOH that reimbursement for \nspecimens sent to the Utah Public Health Laboratory for STD testing will only continue \nto December 31, 2015, due to Governor Herbert’s Directive.  Upon information and \nbelief, UDOH would also have provided PPAU with additional years of federal funding to \npay the Utah Public Health Laboratory for specimens to be tested for the Communicable \nDisease Prevention Program for STD Testing in the State of Utah, but for Governor \nHerbert’s Directive. \n28.  All of the programs above are funded by the federal government, and \ngrant recipients are selected based upon criteria established by the federal government.  \nBy contract, the State of Utah has agreed to administer these programs on behalf of the \nfederal government.  These programs are not funded by Utah taxpayer dollars. \n \n \n  10 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 11 of 18\nTHE IMPACT OF DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS \n29.  Defendants’ actions will cause irreparable harm to PPAU and its patients. \n30.  The Utah Abstinence Education Program and the Personal Responsibility \nEducation Program are intended to reduce pregnancy and risky sexual behavior among \nteens, while increasing school performance within identified high risk communities.  \nApproximately 152 students (and their parents) are and/or are expected to be signed up \nfor these critical programs during the current school year.  PPAU cannot be replaced in \nrunning these programs, including because these programs use the highly successful \nWyman Teen Outreach Programtm (“TOPtm”) curriculum, and PPAU is the only \norganization certified to replicate or teach the Wyman TOPtm curriculum in Utah.  \nAccordingly, the Defendants’ actions threaten to irreparably harm PPAU’s ability to \nserve these high-risk teens and their parents, and to prevent these teens from acquiring \nSTDs, which could be life threatening, and from having unwanted pregnancies. \n31.  The Targeted STD Testing Funds program is intended to target groups for \nChlamydia and Gonorrhea testing and treatment that have been identified as high risk \nfor contracting these diseases:  females between the ages of 15-24 (and their partners), \nand men who have sex with other men.  In the absence of the critical funds provided by \nthis program, PPAU’s continued ability to provide STD testing and treatment statewide \nto all who request it is put at risk.  Moreover, local health departments do not have the \ncapacity nor the expertise to provide Chlamydia and Gonorrhea testing and treatment \non the scale that PPAU does (statewide to all who request it, including low income \n  11 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 12 of 18\nhouseholds and those without insurance).  Further, PPAU is much more accessible than \nany local health department, and patients feel more safe and comfortable seeking these \nservices than from PPAU than from the health department.  If these at-risk groups are \nnow forced to pay for their testing, or make inconvenient trips to the health department \nbecause of Defendants’ actions, many won’t get tested, and Chlamydia and Gonorrhea \nrates will go up.  Further, the lack of prompt care and evening and weekend hours will \ncause other PPAU patients to forego services altogether.  Women who have to wait or \ntravel for family planning services or who forego service entirely will undoubtedly \nexperience increased risk of unintended pregnancy, sexually-transmitted infection, and \nundetected cancer.  Plus, untreated Chlamydia can cause Pelvic Inflammatory \nInfections which can lead to infertility in women.   Accordingly, Defendants’ actions \nthreaten to irreparably harm PPAU’s ability to serve these high-risk groups by \npreventing the spread of STDs and preventing other related injuries such as infertility. \n32.  The STD Surveillance Network program is a pilot project between PPAU \nand UDOH intended to improve reporting of STD testing results by building \ncommunication infrastructure within the State of Utah, with the goal of decreasing the \nspread of these diseases in the community.  PPAU cannot be replaced as a partner for \nthis project because, in UDOH’s own words, “”PPAU is the ideal candidate” for this \nproject because of the quantity and quality of the services provided by PPAU.  Even if \nUDOH could find a new partner, it will essentially have to start over, or at best, UDOH \nwill have to re-do much of the work it had already accomplished with PPAU over the last \n  12 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 13 of 18\ntwo years.  Accordingly, the State’s Action threatens to irreparably harm PPAU’s ability \nto serve the community by helping UDOH build the data communication infrastructure to \nprevent the spread of STDs in Utah. \n33.  Defendants’ actions also threaten to irreparably harm PPAU’s ability to \nserve the victims of rape and sexual assault, and to prevent these patients from being \ntested and receiving care for STDs, which could be life threatening, because fewer \nvictims will report for this critical follow-up testing if they cannot get this testing done at \nPPAU, which has a reputation in the community of treating these patients with respect \nand without judgment. \n34.  Finally, PPAU’s reputation, and its ability to partner with local health \norganizations, is critical to its success, and its continued ability to fulfill its mission.  \nGovernor Herbert has made false public statements that PPAU has been engaged in \nillegal activities related to fetal tissue donation, and has instructed state agencies to \nterminate state-administered federal funds to PPAU because of this alleged \nwrongdoing.  These false statements, and UDOH actions attendant these statements, \nthreaten to destroy PPAU’s reputation in the community that it has worked so hard to \nbuild over almost 50 years in Utah.  Without its reputation intact, PPAU will no longer be \nable to function as it has in the past, and to serve the community as it has in the past. \n35.  In addition to the ability to successfully collaborate with other health care \norganizations, PPAU’s reputation is also critical to its continued ability to raise funds \nthrough private donors, which is necessary for PPAU to keep its costs low, and to meet \n  13 \n   \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-CW   Document 2   Filed 09/28/15   Page 14 of 18\nits mission of providing statewide services to all who request those services, including \nthose without insurance.  Donors will be less likely to provide money to PPAU if they \nbelieve, as the Governor has stated, that PPAU has “colored outside the lines.”   \n36.  Finally, for PPAU to successfully meet its mission, it must continue to have \nthe reputation with patients in the community that it is an organization that can be \ntrusted.  Many patients choose PPAU over other health care centers because they trust \nthat PPAU will offer nonjudgmental, compassionate, and comprehensive care, and that \nPPAU will provide them with information they need to plan their families and protect \ntheir health in a safe environment.  If patients believe that PPAU has engaged in \ncriminal behavior, or acted improperly, they are less likely to believe PPAU is a safe \nenvironment in which to receive the sensitive education and care related to their \nreproductive health. \n37.  Thus, PPAU and its patients have no adequate remedy at law. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT 1:  VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER \nTHE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \n \n38.

Purser, with him on the brief),\nOffice of the Attorney General for the State of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, for\nDefendants-Appellees.\nBefore BRISCOE, EBEL and BACHARACH, Circuit Judges.\nBRISCOE, Circuit Judge.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 2 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 2     \nPlaintiff Planned Parenthood Association of Utah (PPAU) filed this action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that defendant Gary Herbert, the Governor\nof the State of Utah, violated PPAU’s constitutional rights by directing defendant\nJoseph Miner, the Executive Director of the Utah Department of Health (UDOH),\nto stop UDOH from acting as an intermediary for so-called “pass-through” federal\nfunds that PPAU uses to carry out certain programs in the State of Utah.  Along\nwith its complaint, PPAU filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order\n(TRO) and a preliminary injunction.  Although the district court initially issued a\nTRO, it ultimately withdrew the TRO and denied PPAU’s request for a\npreliminary injunction.  PPAU filed this interlocutory appeal challenging the\ndenial of its motion for preliminary injunction.  We granted a stay in favor of\nPPAU to prevent the cessation of funding during the pendency of this appeal, and\nwe also expedited the briefing and oral argument schedule.  Now, exercising\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), we reverse the decision of the\ndistrict court and remand with instructions to grant PPAU’s motion for\npreliminary injunction.\nI\nFactual background\na)  Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and its activities\nPPAU is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of\n2\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 3 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 3     \nUtah.  PPAU is an affiliate of, but legally separate from, Planned Parenthood\nFederation of America, Inc. (Planned Parenthood). \nFor nearly fifty years, PPAU has provided reproductive health services to\nwomen, men, and teenagers in the State of Utah.  PPAU delivers these services\ndirectly through its network of nine urban and rural clinics and indirectly through\ncontracts with eleven rural and frontier providers who act on PPAU’s behalf. \nPPAU is currently the only statewide organization that provides reproductive\nhealth services to anyone who requests them.  More specifically, PPAU provides\nservices without regard to a patient’s health insurance status, socioeconomic\nstatus, race, or ethnicity.\nIn 2011, PPAU began offering abortion services.  PPAU does not receive\nany funds from either the federal government or state government for abortion\nservices.  PPAU complies with all federal and state laws regarding the disposal of\nfetal tissue, and it does not allow its patients to donate fetal tissue after an\nabortion.\nDuring its 2015 fiscal year, PPAU provided health care services to 46,082\npatients, 46% of whom reported being uninsured.  Nearly 45,000 of these total\npatients sought and received services unrelated to abortion, such as the provision\nof birth control, vasectomy, pregnancy testing, screenings for sexually-\ntransmitted diseases (STDs), cancer screenings, and cancer prevention.  Over\n17,000 of the total patients either asked to be tested for, or were identified as at\n3\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 4 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 4     \nrisk for having contracted, chlamydia and/or gonorrhea.  Of this group,\napproximately 72% reported being uninsured.\nIn addition to medical services, PPAU provides a variety of education\nservices related to reproductive health, including abstinence education,\ncontraceptive education, and STD education.\nb) PPAU’s relationship with the Utah Department of Health\nUDOH is a department of the State of Utah created pursuant to Utah Code \n§ 26-1-4.  UDOH is the health, health planning, and medical assistance authority\nof the State of Utah and, as such, is the sole agency that oversees the\nadministration of federally-assisted state programs or plans for public health,\nhealth planning, maternal and child health, services for children with a disability,\nand medical assistance.  \nPPAU has received federal funding to support its reproductive health\nservices and education since approximately 1973.  Since 1993, PPAU has\nreceived federal funds through programs administered by the State of Utah.1  At\nissue in this case are two grants, one contract, and one letter of understanding,\npursuant to which UDOH dispenses federal funds, either directly or indirectly, to\nPPAU.  PPAU in turn uses that funding for four specific types of programs.  The\ndetails of this funding are outlined in detail below.\n1 According to the limited record on appeal, approximately one-third or less\nof PPAU’s annual operating budget derives from federal, state, or local\ngovernment funding.\n4\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 5 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 5     \nc) Targeted STD testing\nSince the early 1990s, PPAU has worked in collaboration with UDOH to\ncarry out the Communicable Disease Prevention Program for STD Testing in the\nState of Utah.  Federal funds are used to pay the Utah Public Health Laboratory\nfor specimens to be tested for STDs.  As part of this program, UDOH has\nprovided PPAU, at no charge, with prescription medications needed to treat\nchlamydia and gonorrhea.  This has enabled PPAU, in turn, to provide treatment\nfree of charge to all patients who test positive, as well as to their partners.\nThe most recent manifestation of this collaboration is a letter of\nunderstanding entered into between UDOH and PPAU in early 2015.  Pursuant to\nthat letter of understanding, UDOH agreed to “pay the Utah Public Health\nLaboratory on [PPAU’s] behalf . . . for 4,400 specimens from January 1, 2015,\nthrough December 31, 2015 for STD testing for” the following classes of Utah\nresidents: (1) “[f]emales 15 to 24 years of age”; (2) “[t]he partners of females 15\nto 24 years of age, regardless of the partner’s age”; and (3) “[m]en who have sex\nwith men.”  App. at 149.  \nd) STD Surveillance Network\nIn 2013, UDOH asked PPAU to participate in a five-year project called the\nSTD Surveillance Network.  The purpose of the project was to update the\nsurveillance systems at UDOH to improve data gathering and STD prevention\noutcomes across the State of Utah.  Funding for the Network was provided by the\n5\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 6 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 6     \nCenters for Disease Control (CDC).\nThe parties’ agreement was formalized by contract on March 3, 2014.  The\ncontract period was to run from March 3, 2014, until September 30, 2018.  Under\nthe terms of the contract, UDOH agreed to pay PPAU $30,000 in federal funds in\nexchange for PPAU’s work on the project.  In early February 2015, the contract\nwas amended to increase the amount of federal funds provided by UDOH to\nPPAU from $30,000 to $109,960. \ne) Utah Abstinence Education Program\nOn or about April 1, 2011, UDOH issued a grant to PPAU so that PPAU\ncould carry out the Utah Abstinence Education Program (UAEP).  The original\namount of the grant was for $221,546.20, and was intended to cover the period\nfrom April 1, 2011, to September 30, 2014.  The grant was subsequently amended\nto provide total funding in the amount of $338,386.55, and to extend the grant\nperiod until September 30, 2016.\nIn carrying out the UAEP, PPAU provides after-school abstinence\neducation to teenagers in the State of Utah.  The program requires parental\npermission to enroll.  In PPAU’s fiscal year 2015, 98 teenagers signed up for the\nprogram and 44 teenagers graduated from the program.  \nf) The Personal Responsibility Education Program \nIn 2013, UDOH sought competitive bids from entities in the state interested\nin carrying out the State’s Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP). \n6\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 7 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 7     \nFunding for the PREP program came from the United States Department of Health\nand Human Services, Administration on Children, Youth and Families.  The\npurpose of PREP “is to educate adolescents on both abstinence and contraception\nto prevent pregnancy and [STDs], including HIV/AIDS.”  Id. at 275.  In addition,\nPREP is intended to educate adolescents on “the following three adulthood\npreparation subjects”: (1) “[h]ealthy relationships, such as positive self-esteem\nand relationship dynamics”; (2) “[e]ducational and career success, such as\ndeveloping skills for employment preparation, job seeking, independent living,\nfinancial self-sufficiency, and work-place productivity”; and (3) “[h]ealthy life\nskills, such as goal-setting, decision making, negotiation, communication and\ninterpersonal skills, and stress management.”  Id.  “The target population for\n[PREP] is Utah youth ages 14-19 with a specific focus on youth in the Utah\nJuvenile Justice System, youth of Hispanic origin and/or non-white race, current\nteen moms, and youth residing in areas with birth rates higher than Utah’s state\nrate.”  Id. \nPPAU was the winning bidder on the project.  According to PPAU, it was\nawarded a three-year grant from UDOH, good through 2016, with the possibility\nof signing new contracts for additional years.\ng) The release of the CMP videos\nIn the summer of 2015, an entity known as the Center for Medical Progress\n(CMP) released “selectively edited videos of Planned Parenthood staff members\n7\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 8 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 8     \ndiscussing the health care provider’s fetal tissue donation program.”  Id. at 398. \nThe videos resulted in “[a]nti-abortion advocates . . . accusing Planned\nParenthood of profiting off the sale of fetal tissue, which would be illegal.”  Id. \nIn turn, “[m]ultiple investigations were launched in Congress and in the states.”2 \nId.  \nh) Defendant Herbert’s response to the CMP videos - the Directive\nDefendant Gary Herbert is the Governor of the State of Utah and, in that\ncapacity, serves as the Chief Executive Officer for the State of Utah.  On August\n14, 2015, Herbert, in response to the CMP videos, issued a written statement\n(Directive) that stated:\nThe allegations against Planned Parenthood are deeply troubling. \nCurrent Utah state law prohibits the use of state funds to provide\nabortions by Planned Parenthood or any other organization.  The\nfederal government has provided grants to Planned Parenthood,\ndistributed through the Utah Department of Health.  These funds are\nalso prohibited from being used to perform abortions.  In light of\nongoing concerns about the organization, I have instructed state\nagencies to cease acting as an intermediary for pass-through federal\nfunds to Planned Parenthood.\nId. at 51.3  The Directive was specifically directed at federal funding that flowed\n2 According to the limited information available in the record, to date none\nof these investigations have “turned up . . . evidence that Planned Parenthood was\ndoing anything other than receiving legal reimbursements for the cost of\nprocessing the donations” of fetal tissue.  App. at 398.  No evidence was found to\nsupport the CMP videos’ claim that fetal tissue was being sold by Planned\nParenthood.\n3 In referring to “Planned Parenthood,” the Directive did not distinguish\n(continued...)\n8\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 9 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 9     \nthrough UDOH to PPAU for the UAEP program, the PREP program, the Targeted\nSTD Testing program, and the STD Surveillance Network.  The Directive also\n“purport[ed] to affect reimbursements made to PPAU for pregnancy and STD\ntesting for victims of rape or sexual assault through the Utah Office for Victims\nof Crime.”  Id. at 14.\nHerbert followed the Directive with a press conference on August 17, 2015,\nduring which he stated, “We now have video where they’re selling fetus body\nparts for money and it’s an outrage and the people of Utah are outraged.  I’m\noutraged.  So for coloring outside the lines, [PPAU] forfeits some of their\nbenefits.”  Id. at 11.  Herbert conceded during the press conference, however,\n“that none of the alleged conduct occurred in Utah.”  Id. at 12.\nOn August 19, 2015, Herbert participated in a group protest, held in the\nrotunda of the Utah State Capitol, to ask state lawmakers to defund PPAU. \nDuring the protest, Herbert stated: “I’m here today to add my voice to yours and\nspeak out on the sanctity of life . . . .”  Id. at 11.  Herbert further stated: “The\nthing I find most appalling is the casualness, the callousness . . . the lack of\nrespect, the lack of sensitivity to the unborn . . . .”  Id. \ni) UDOH’s response to the Directive\nDefendant Joseph Miner, M.D., the Executive Director of UDOH, acting\n3(...continued)\nbetween the national organization and PPAU.\n9\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 10 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 10     \npursuant to defendant Herbert’s Directive, instructed his subordinates at UDOH to\nimplement the Directive.  Consequently, on September 8, 2015, UDOH provided\nPPAU with a thirty-day written notice of termination of its contract for the UAEP\nprogram.  On that same date, UDOH also provided PPAU with notice that UDOH\nwould cease accepting funds from the CDC for the STD Surveillance Network\ncontract after September 29, 2015.  UDOH also informed PPAU that\nreimbursement for specimens sent by PPAU to the Utah Public Health Laboratory\nfor STD testing would cease after December 31, 2015.  Finally, UDOH publicly\nstated that it intended to allow its contract with PPAU for the PREP program to\nexpire without renewal on September 30, 2015.\nj) PPAU’s conduct\nIt is undisputed that at no time has PPAU been accused of misusing funds,\nincluding using the funds at issue to perform abortion services.  Further, it is\nundisputed that at no time has UDOH complained about the services provided by\nPPAU, or otherwise claimed that PPAU was not qualified to provide services.  It\nis also uncontroverted that PPAU has no direct connection to any of the activities\nallegedly depicted in the CMP videos.\nProcedural background\nPPAU initiated this action on September 28, 2015, by filing a complaint\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief against\ndefendants Herbert and Miner.  The complaint set forth three claims for relief. \n10\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 11 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 11     \nCount 1 alleged a violation of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nMore specifically, Count 1 alleged that “[d]efendants’ actions in singling out\nPPAU for unfavorable treatment without adequate justification violate[d] PPAU’s\nrights as guaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nto the United States Constitution.”  Id. at 19–20.  Count 2 alleged that\n“[d]efendants’ actions violate[d] the rights of PPAU as guaranteed by the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution by imposing a penalty based on its\nspeech and/or associations without adequate justification.”  Id. at 20.  Count 3\nalleged that “[d]efendants’ actions violate[d] the rights of PPAU and its patients\nas guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to\nprovide and access abortion services by imposing a penalty on PPAU for the\nprovision of and/or association with abortion services without adequate\njustification.”  Id. at 21.  The complaint sought declaratory relief, a preliminary\nand permanent injunction, and a judgment awarding PPAU its costs of suit,\nincluding reasonable attorneys’ fees.  \nAlong with its complaint, PPAU filed a motion for temporary restraining\norder (TRO) and preliminary injunction.  PPAU argued that there was a\nsubstantial likelihood that it would succeed on the merits of its claims, that it\nwould suffer irreparable injury if an injunction did not issue, that the threatened\ninjury to it outweighed any damage that an injunction might cause to the\ndefendants, and that issuance of an injunction would not be adverse to the public\n11\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 12 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 12     \ninterest.  \nThe following day, September 29, 2015, the district court held a hearing on\nPPAU’s motion for TRO.  No evidence was presented during the hearing; instead,\nthe parties agreed to have the district court decide the motion upon the facts\ndeemed by defendants to be admitted.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the\ndistrict court granted a TRO in favor of PPAU.\nOn October 15, 2015, the district court held a hearing on PPAU’s motion\nfor preliminary injunction.  Again, no testimony was presented at the hearing. \nThe parties instead relied exclusively on documentary evidence: PPAU submitted\na lengthy declaration from Karrie Galloway, the president and CEO of PPAU;\ndefendants submitted affidavits from Shari Watkins, UDOH’s finance director,\nand Austin Cox, defendant Herbert’s constituent services director, as well as\ndocuments submitted in connection with Watkins’ affidavit pertaining to each of\nthe UDOH/PPAU programs that were intended to be defunded.  Notably, no\nevidence was submitted from defendant Herbert discussing or explaining his\ndecision to issue the Directive.\n  On December 22, 2015, the district court issued a memorandum decision\nand order denying PPAU’s motion for preliminary injunction and vacating the\npreviously issued TRO.  Shortly thereafter, PPAU filed a timely notice of\ninterlocutory appeal.\n12\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 13 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 13     \nII\nIn this appeal, PPAU challenges the district court’s denial of its motion for\npreliminary injunction.  “We review the denial of a preliminary injunction for\nabuse of discretion.”  Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1128\n(10th Cir. 2013), aff’d sub nom Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct.\n2751 (2014).  “A district court abuses its discretion by denying a preliminary\ninjunction based on an error of law.”  Id.  To the extent the district court made\nfactual findings as part of its ruling, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(2), we review those\n“factual findings under the deferential ‘clear error’ standard,” Glossip v. Gross,\n135 S. Ct. 2726, 2739 (2015); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6).\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) authorizes district courts to issue\npreliminary injunctions.  A plaintiff “seeking a preliminary injunction must\nestablish that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities\ntips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Nat.\nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).\nLikelihood of success on the merits\n“The very purpose of an injunction under Rule 65(a) is to give temporary\nrelief based on a preliminary estimate of the strength of the plaintiff’s suit, prior\nto the resolution at trial of the factual disputes and difficulties presented by the\ncase.”  11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal\n13\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 14 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 14     \nPractice and Procedure, § 2948.3, at 213-14 (2013).  Although “[t]he courts use a\nbewildering variety of formulations of the need for showing some likelihood of\nsuccess,” id. at 197, “[a]ll courts agree that plaintiff must present a prima facie\ncase but need not show a certainty of winning,” id. at 201.\nIn analyzing whether PPAU has established a likelihood of success on the\nmerits, we shall address separately each of the three claims asserted in its\ncomplaint.  As discussed below, we conclude that PPAU has failed to establish a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of its equal protection claim, but has\nestablished a likelihood of success on the merits of its unconstitutional conditions\nclaims.\na) Equal protection claim\nIt is undisputed that Count 1 of PPAU’s complaint, particularly when\nconsidered together with PPAU’s motion for preliminary injunction, asserts a so-\ncalled “class-of-one” equal protection claim.  More specifically, Count 1 of\nPPAU’s complaint alleges that “[d]efendants’ actions in singling out PPAU for\nunfavorable treatment without adequate justification violate[d] PPAU’s rights as\nguaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution.”  App. at 19–20.  In its simultaneously-filed motion\nfor preliminary injunction, PPAU argued that Herbert “has singled out PPAU and\nis treating it differently than all other federal grant recipients for reproductive\nhealth services.”  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 3 at 3.  PPAU in turn argued that “[t]he\n14\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 15 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 15     \nState lacks any compelling, or even legitimate, governmental interest for\ndistinguishing between [PPAU] and other federal grant recipients providing\nreproductive health services and education who have and will be approved for\nreceiving federal funds administered by the State, and whose existing contracts\nwere not terminated or rejected for renewal.”  Id. at 4–5.  PPAU concluded by\narguing that “[t]his disparate treatment is a violation of PPAU’s constitutional\nrights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”  Id. \nIn Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000), the\nSupreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause gives rise to a cause of\naction even if a plaintiff does not belong to a particular class or group.  To prevail\non this class-of-one theory, a plaintiff must allege and prove (1) “that [it] has\nbeen intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated” and (2) “that\nthere is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.”  Id.  In other words, the\n“paradigmatic” class-of-one case arises when “a public official inflicts a cost or\nburden on one person without imposing it on those who are similarly situated in\nmaterial respects, and does so without any conceivable basis other than a wholly\nillegitimate motive.”  Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cnty., 440 F.3d 1202,\n1209 (10th Cir. 2006).  We have emphasized that a class-of-one plaintiff must\nidentify others “similarly situated in every material respect.”  Id. at 1210. \n“Depending on the case and the nature of the differential treatment, the\nallegations necessary to establish this level of similarity will vary.”  Haik v. Salt\n15\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 16 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 16     \nLake City Corp., 567 F. App’x 621, 632 (10th Cir. 2014) (citing Jennings v. City\nof Stillwater, 383 F.3d 1199, 1214 (10th Cir. 2004)).  A class-of-one claim fails if\nthere is “either a rational basis for the [challenged] treatment” or “a material\ndifference” between the plaintiff and others who were allegedly similarly situated. \nJicarilla, 440 F.3d at 1210. \nDefendants argue, as a threshold matter, that PPAU cannot establish a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of its class-of-one equal protection claim\nbecause the claim is effectively precluded by the Supreme Court’s decision in\nEngquist v. Oregon Dep’t of Agriculture, 553 U.S. 591 (2008).  At issue in\nEngquist was “whether a public employee can state a claim under the Equal\nProtection Clause by alleging that she was arbitrarily treated differently from\nother similarly situated employees, with no assertion that the different treatment\nwas based on the employee’s membership in any particular class.”  553 U.S. at\n594.  The Supreme Court concluded, based upon its “traditional view of the core\nconcern of the Equal Protection Clause as a shield against arbitrary\nclassifications, combined with unique considerations applicable when the\ngovernment acts as employer as opposed to sovereign, . . . that the class-of-one\ntheory of equal protection does not apply in the public employment context.”  Id.\nat 598.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court explained that it “ha[s] long held the\nview that there is a crucial difference, with respect to constitutional analysis,\n16\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 17 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 17     \nbetween the government exercising ‘the power to regulate or license, as\nlawmaker,’ and the government acting ‘as proprietor, to manage [its] internal\noperations.’”  Id. (quoting Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S.\n886, 896 (1961)).  As a result, the Court noted, it “ha[s] often recognized that\ngovernment has significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citizen\nemployees than it does when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at\nlarge.”  Id. at 599.  The Court emphasized that its “precedent in the public\nemployee context . . . establishes two main principles.”  Id. at 600.  “First,\nalthough government employees do not lose their constitutional rights when they\naccept their positions, those rights must be balanced against the realities of the\nemployment context.”  Id.  “Second, in striking the appropriate balance, [the\nCourt] consider[s] whether the asserted employee right implicates the basic\nconcerns of the relevant constitutional provision, or whether the claimed right can\nmore readily give way to the requirements of the government as employer.”  Id.  \nContinuing, the Court noted that its “[r]ecognition of the class-of-one\ntheory of equal protection on the facts in Olech was not so much a departure from\nthe principle that the Equal Protection Clause is concerned with arbitrary\ngovernment classification, as it was an application of that principle.”  Id. at 602. \nOlech, the Court noted, “involved the government’s regulation of property,” and\n“the cases upon which [it] . . . relied concerned property assessment and taxation\nschemes.”  Id.  “[S]uch legislative or regulatory classifications,” the Court stated,\n17\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 18 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 18     \nare “expect[ed] . . . to apply without respect to persons.”  Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).  Thus, the Court stated, “[w]hen those who appear similarly\nsituated are nevertheless treated differently, the Equal Protection Clause requires\nat least a rational reason for the difference, to ensure that all persons subject to\nlegislation or regulation are indeed being treated alike, under like circumstances\nand conditions.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  And, the Court\nemphasized, “[w]hat seems to have been significant in Olech and the cases on\nwhich it relied was the existence of a clear standard against which departures,\neven for a single plaintiff, could be readily assessed.”  Id.  For example, the Court\nnoted, “[t]here was no indication in Olech that the zoning board was exercising\ndiscretionary authority based on subjective, individualized determinations—at\nleast not with regard to easement length, however typical such determinations\nmay be as a general zoning matter.”  Id. at 602–03.  \nThe Court then concluded that “[t]here are some forms of state action . . .\nwhich by their nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based on a vast array\nof subjective, individualized assessments.”  Id. at 603.  “In such cases,” the Court\nheld, the rule that people should be ‘treated alike, under like circumstances and\nconditions’ is not violated when one person is treated differently from others,\nbecause treating like individuals differently is an accepted consequence of the\ndiscretion granted.”  Id.  “In such situations,” the Court explained, “allowing a\nchallenge based on the arbitrary singling out of a particular person would\n18\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 19 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 19     \nundermine the very discretion that such state officials are entrusted to exercise.” \nId.  \nUltimately, the Court concluded that “[t]his principle applies most clearly\nin the employment context, for employment decisions are quite often subjective\nand individualized, resting on a wide array of factors that are difficult to\narticulate and quantify.”  Id. at 604.  The Court stated that, “[u]nlike the context\nof arm’s-length regulation, such as in Olech, treating similarly situated\nindividuals differently in the employment context is par for the course.”  Id. \n“Thus,” the Court held, “the class-of-one theory of equal protection—which\npresupposes that like individuals should be treated alike, and that to treat them\ndifferently is to classify them in a way that must survive at least rationality\nreview—is simply a poor fit in the public employment context.”  Id. at 605.  “To\ntreat employees differently,” the Court stated, “is not to classify them in a way\nthat raises equal protection concerns.”  Id.  “Rather,” the Court stated, “it is\nsimply to exercise the broad discretion that typically characterizes the employer-\nemployee relationship.”  Id.  And, the Court stated, “[a] challenge that one has\nbeen treated individually in this context, instead of like everyone else, is a\nchallenge to the underlying nature of the government action.”  Id.  \nAs noted, the defendants in this case argue that Engquist should be\nextended to government contractors, such as PPAU.  They argue that the\nprinciples that motivated the Supreme Court’s decision in Engquist apply with\n19\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 20 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 20     \nequal force to government contractors.  We have not directly addressed this issue\nbefore.  But, to date, four other circuits—the First, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh\nCircuits—have extended Engquist beyond the context of government employment. \nSee Caesars Mass. Mgmt. Co. v. Crosby, 778 F.3d 327, 336–37 (1st Cir. 2015)\n(applying Engquist to preclude four corporate plaintiffs from asserting an equal\nprotection claim arising out of a decision by the Massachusetts Gaming\nCommission finding them unsuitable as proposed operators of a casino); Srail v.\nVillage of Lisle, 588 F.3d 940, 944–45 (7th Cir. 2009) (extending Engquist to\npreclude equal protection claim filed by residents of an incorporated subdivision\nclaiming that the village in which they resided violated the Equal Protection\nClause by refusing to supply water to subdivisions and schools attended by their\nchildren at adequate firefighting pressure and volume); Flowers v.

There, a\nhighway paving contractor filed suit against Georgia state officials alleging that\nthey violated his equal protection rights by wrongly singling it out and treating it\ndifferently than other, similarly-situated paving contractors.  The Eleventh Circuit\nconcluded “that Engquist [was] control[ling] . . . and ma[de] clear that [the\ncontractor] failed to assert a cognizable right to equal protection.”  541 F.3d at\n1274.  The Eleventh Circuit explained:\nIn Board of County Commissioners v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 116\nS.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996), the [Supreme] Court addressed\nwhether independent contractors may bring a § 1983 retaliation claim\nwhen a government entity has acted against the contractor’s exercise\nof free speech.  Id. at 671–73, 116 S.Ct. at 2345–46.  Having never\naddressed the issue in the independent contractor context, the Court\napplied its government employment precedents to the question.  Id. at\n673–74, 116 S.Ct. at 2346–47.  It did so because of the “obvious”\nsimilarities between government employees and government\ncontractors with respect to the issue.  Id. at 674, 116 S.Ct. at 2347. \nSpecifically, the Court explained that “[t]he government needs to be\nfree to terminate both employees and contractors for poor\nperformance, to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and responsiveness\nof service to the public, and to prevent the appearance of corruption.” \nId. at 674, 116 S.Ct. at 2347.  The Court further articulated that\n“absent contractual, statutory, or constitutional restriction, the\ngovernment is entitled to terminate [employees and contractors] for\n21\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 22 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 22     \nno reason at all.”  Id.\n     Just as in the employee context, and in the absence of a restricting\ncontract or statute, decisions involving government contractors\nrequire broad discretion that may rest “on a wide array of factors that\nare difficult to articulate and quantify.”  Engquist, 128 S.Ct. at 2154.\nId.\nIn our view, Douglas’s reliance on Umbehr is entirely reasonable.  In\nUmbehr, the Supreme Court stated that “[i]ndependent contractors appear to us to\nlie somewhere between the case of government employees, who have the closest\nrelationship with the government, and our other unconstitutional conditions\nprecedents, which involve persons with less close relationships with the\ngovernment.”  518 U.S. at 680.  Ultimately, however, the Court rejected the\nnotion that “there is a ‘difference of constitutional magnitude’ between\nindependent contractors and employees in this context.”  Id. at 684 (internal\ncitation omitted) (quoting Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 83 (1973)).  The\nCourt explained that “[i]ndependent government contractors are similar in most\nrelevant respects to government employees, although both the speaker’s and the\ngovernment’s interests are typically—though not always—somewhat less strong\nin the independent contractor case.”  Id.  \nIn light of Umbehr and Douglas, a relatively strong case can be made that\nwe should follow suit and extend Engquist to cases involving claims asserted by\ngovernment contractors, unless, of course, there is some unique aspect of the case\n22\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 23 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 23     \nthat would take it outside this general rule.  Generally speaking, when the\ngovernment deals with its contractors, it is not acting as sovereign, but rather in a\nrole that is in many ways similar to that of employer.  See SECSYS, LLC v.\nVigil, 666 F.3d 678, 690 (10th Cir. 2012) (noting that “the government acts in a\nmore proprietorial and less regulatory capacity” when it deals with independent\ncontractors).  And, in that role, “[t]he government’s interest in achieving its goals\nas effectively and efficiently as possible is elevated . . . to a significant one.” \nEngquist, 553 U.S. at 598.  Further, in dealing with its contractors, the\ngovernment is often called upon to make judgments that are “subjective and\nindividualized.”  Id. at 604.  In other words, the government is often called upon\nin this context to “exercise the broad discretion that typically characterizes the\n[contractee-contractor] relationship.”  Id. at 605.  All of which leaves no “clear\nstandard against which departures . . . c[an] be readily assessed.”  Id. at 602.\nWe need not, however, definitely resolve the Engquist issue at this very\nearly stage of the litigation.  Instead, we simply conclude that PPAU has failed to\nestablish a likelihood of success on the merits of the Engquist issue.  In reaching\nthis conclusion, we emphasize that the record on appeal contains no evidence\nregarding how the State of Utah typically deals with contractors, such as PPAU,\nwith respect to contracts involving federal funding.4  Perhaps there is little to no\n4 Contrast that, for example, with the decision in Planned Parenthood\nGreater Memphis Region v. Dreyzehner, 853 F. Supp. 2d 724 (M.D. Tenn. 2012). \n(continued...)\n23\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 24 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 24     \ndiscretion afforded the State of Utah regarding these contracts and their\ntermination.  But all that is contained in the record on appeal are the specific\ncontracts at issue between PPAU and the State of Utah.  And as to those\ncontracts, there is no evidence regarding whether PPAU competitively bid for\nthem or whether, instead, PPAU was awarded the contracts through other\nmethods.  Further, although PPAU refers to other, similarly-situated contractors\nin the State of Utah who provide reproductive-related services, there is literally\nno evidence in the record on appeal regarding these other contractors.  For this\nreason alone, we conclude that PPAU has failed to satisfy its burden of\nestablishing a likelihood of success on the Engquist issue. \nEven assuming, for purposes of argument, that we were to reject the\ndefendants’ Engquist argument, we would still conclude that PPAU has failed to\nestablish a substantial likelihood of demonstrating that it was “arbitrarily treated\ndifferently from other similarly situated” government contractors.  Engquist, 553\nU.S. at 594.  “[W]e have recognized a substantial burden that plaintiffs” asserting\na class-of-one claim “demonstrate others similarly situated in all material respects\nwere treated differently and that there is no objectively reasonable basis for the\ndefendant’s action.”  Kan. Penn Gaming, LLC v. Collins, 656 F.3d 1210, 1217\n4(...continued)\nIn that case, the district court was presented with detailed information regarding\nhow federal grants are awarded to recipients in the State of Tennessee.  Id. at\n727–28.\n24\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 25 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 25     \n(10th Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted).  “It is therefore imperative for the\nclass-of-one plaintiff to provide a specific and detailed account of the nature of\nthe preferred treatment of the favored class.”  Jennings v. City of Stillwater, 383\nF.3d 1199, 1214 (10th Cir. 2004).\nPPAU has failed to meet this substantial burden, at least at this point in the\nlitigation.  Although PPAU repeatedly refers, both in its district court pleadings\nand in its appellate brief, to other, similarly-situated “pass-through funding\nrecipient[s]” in the State of Utah, it fails to specifically identify a single one of\nthem in any of its pleadings.  Aplt. Br. at 43.  And, relatedly, there is literally no\nevidence in the record on appeal regarding the State of Utah’s contracts or\ndealings with contractors other than PPAU.5  PPAU’s failure in this regard leaves\nus with no standard against which we can compare Herbert’s actions towards\nPPAU.  The result is that PPAU has failed to establish a substantial likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of its class-of-one equal protection claim.\nb) Unconstitutional conditions claims\nPPAU asserted two unconstitutional conditions claims in its complaint.  To\nbegin with, Count 2 of PPAU’s complaint alleged that “[d]efendants’ actions\nviolate[d] the rights of PPAU as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United\n5 Again, contrast that with the record in Dreyzehner, where the Planned\nParenthood organization in that case presented the district court with information\nregarding a “dozen or so similarly-situated service providers whose contracts\nwere approved.”  853 F.

In support, PPAU alleged that it\n“advocates for access to abortion” and “associates with” others to do the same. \nId. at 14.  PPAU also alleged in its motion for preliminary injunction that its\n“association with other Planned Parenthood providers who participate in lawful\nprograms that allow abortion patients to donate fetal tissue for scientific research\n. . . is protected by the First Amendment,” and that Herbert’s Directive was\nintended to punish PPAU for this association.  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 3 at 3. \nFinally, at the hearing on its motion for preliminary injunction, PPAU again\nargued that the Directive infringed upon its First Amendment rights to advocate\nfor legal abortions and associate with other organizations for political, social, and\neducation reasons.  App. at 475–76.\nCount 3 of PPAU’s complaint also alleged an unconstitutional conditions\nclaim.  It alleged that “[d]efendants’ actions violate[d] the rights of PPAU and its\npatients as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution to provide and access abortion services by imposing a penalty on\nPPAU for the provision of and/or association with abortion services without\nadequate justification.”  App. at 21.  At the hearing on its motion for preliminary\ninjunction, PPAU explained that it has a constitutional right to provide facilities\nfor women who choose to exercise their substantive due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment to have legal abortions.  Id. at 476.\n26\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 27 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 27     \nThe Supreme Court “ha[s] said in a variety of contexts that ‘the government\nmay not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right.’” \nKoontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 133 S. Ct. 2586, 2594 (2013)\n(quoting Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 545\n(1983)).  “Those cases reflect an overarching principle, known as the\nunconstitutional conditions doctrine, that vindicates the Constitution’s\nenumerated rights by preventing the government from coercing people into giving\nthem up.”  Id.\nThe Supreme Court “has applied this doctrine in two distinct contexts.” \nPlanned Parenthood of Kan. v. Moser, 747 F.3d 814, 838 (10th Cir. 2014).  “First,\nthe doctrine has been applied when the condition acts prospectively in statutes or\nregulations that limit a government-provided benefit—typically a subsidy or tax\nbreak—to those who refrain from or engage in certain expression or association.” \nId. at 838–839.  “Second, the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine has been\napplied when the condition acts retrospectively in a discretionary executive action\nthat terminates a government-provided benefit—typically public employment, a\ngovernment contract, or eligibility for either—in retaliation for prior protected\nspeech or association.”  Id. at 839\nThis latter context is exemplified by Umbehr.  There, the Court applied the\ndoctrine in concluding that “the First Amendment protects independent\ncontractors from the termination of at-will government contracts in retaliation for\n27\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 28 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 28     \ntheir exercise of the freedom of speech.”  518 U.S. at 670.  The Court in turn held\nthat the “balancing test” outlined in Pickering v. Board of Education of Township\nHigh School District 205, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968), “adjusted to weigh the\ngovernment’s interests as contractor rather than as employer, determines the\nextent of [the independent contractor’s] protection.”  518 U.S. at 673.  To prevail\nunder this balancing test, the Court held, the independent contractor “must show\nthat the termination of his contract was motivated by his speech on a matter of\npublic concern.”  Id. at 685.  “If he can make that showing,” the Court held, the\ngovernment “will have a valid defense if it can show, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that, in light of [its] knowledge, perceptions, and policies at the time of\nthe termination, [it] would have terminated the contract regardless of the\n[contractor’s] speech.”  Id.  The government “will also prevail,” the Court stated,\n“if it can persuade the . . . [c]ourt that the [government]’s legitimate interests as\ncontractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh the free speech interests at stake.”  Id.  \nPPAU’s unconstitutional conditions claims appear to us to fit comfortably\nwithin the context exemplified by Umbehr.  As previously noted, PPAU has\nalleged in those claims that Herbert took a discretionary executive action, i.e.,\nissuing the Directive, that terminated PPAU’s contractual relationships with\nUDOH and was motivated by PPAU’s engagement in the following activities:\n“associat[ing] with other Planned Parenthood providers who participate in lawful\nprograms that allow abortion patients to donate fetal tissue for scientific\n28\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 29 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 29     \nresearch,” Dist. Ct. Docket No. 3 at 3; advocating for legal abortions, App. at\n475; associating with organizations for political, social and education reasons, id.\nat 476; and providing abortion services to its patients.\nDefendants do not dispute that Herbert issued the Directive or that its effect\nwould be to terminate PPAU’s contracts with UDOH.  Defendants do dispute,\nhowever, whether PPAU engaged in activities protected by the First Amendment\nand whether Herbert’s issuance of the Directive was motivated by either PPAU’s\nexercise of its First Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment rights.  We therefore\naddress these issues in turn.\nIn challenging whether PPAU engaged in any First Amendment-protected\nactivities, defendants argue that no court has ever held that the “fundamental right\nto abortion includes the right to sell fetal tissue.”  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at 19. \nDefendants also argue that no court has “extend[ed] th[e] First Amendment right\nof association to encompass the right to associate in furtherance of illegal acts\nsuch as selling fetal tissue.”  Id.  These arguments, however, miss the mark. \nQuite simply, PPAU has never alleged that it possessed or exercised any such\nrights. \nFocusing on the First Amendment rights that PPAU has actually identified\nin Count 2 of its complaint, we have little trouble in concluding that they are\nvalid.  “The First Amendment creates ‘an open marketplace’ in which differing\nideas about political, economic, and social issues can compete freely for public\n29\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 30 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 30     \nacceptance without improper government interference.”  Knox v. Serv. Emp. Int’l\nUnion, Local 1000, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 2288 (2012) (quoting New York State Bd. of\nElections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, 208 (2008)).  “The government may not\nprohibit the dissemination of ideas that it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement\nof ideas that it approves.”  Id.  “And the ability of like-minded individuals to\nassociate for the purpose of expressing commonly held views may not be\ncurtailed.”  Id.  PPAU has alleged consistently, without dispute from defendants,\nthat it advocates for abortion rights and associates with other entities, including\nPlanned Parenthood, to do the same.\nPPAU has also alleged in Count 3, without serious challenge from\ndefendants, a Fourteenth Amendment right.  The Supreme Court has recognized\nthat “the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions\nupon state action . . . encompass[es] a woman’s decision whether or not to\nterminate her pregnancy.”  Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153 (1973).  The Court\nhas also recognized that, “because abortion is a medical procedure, . . . the full\nvindication of the woman’s fundamental right necessarily requires that her”\nmedical provider be afforded the right to “‘make his best medical judgment,’”\nwhich includes “implementing [the woman’s decision] should she choose to have\nan abortion.”  City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416,\n427 (1983) (quoting Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 192 (1973)), overruled on other\ngrounds by Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v.

Doyle, 162 F.3d 463, 471 (7th Cir.1998) (“The\nconstitutional right to an abortion carries with it the right to perform medical\nprocedures that many people find distasteful or worse.”).\nHaving determined that PPAU has identified valid First and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights, that leaves the question of whether PPAU can establish that\nHerbert issued the Directive in retaliation for PPAU’s exercise of those rights. \nThe district court concluded that PPAU failed to establish a likelihood of success\non this point and offered the following rationale in support of its conclusion:\n     Plaintiff contends that Governor Herbert’s opposition to abortions\nand Plaintiff’s association with other pro-choice entities was the\nsubstantial or motivating force behind his directive to terminate the\ncontracts.  It points to the Governor’s participation in an anti-\nabortion protest mere days after his press release, during which he\nsaid he was there to speak out for the sanctity of life.  These facts\nfall short of proving, however, that Governor Herbert’s opposition to\nabortion was a substantial or motivating factor for terminating the\ncontracts.\n     Gary Herbert has been the Governor of Utah for the past six\nyears.  Although Plaintiff has been associated with other pro-choice\nentities since Governor Herbert took office and it started performing\nabortions in Utah in 2011, the Governor still allowed the Department\nto enter into and maintain contracts with Plaintiff.  It was not until\nthe videos were released that the Governor acted to terminate the\ncontracts.  Indeed, Plaintiff alleges and the defendants do not dispute\nthat the Governor said, “We now have video where they’re selling\nfetus body parts for money and it’s an outrage and the people of Utah\n31\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 32 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 32     \nare outraged.  I’m outraged.  So for coloring outside the lines,\n[Plaintiff] forfeits some of [its] benefits.”  Complaint, ¶ 14 (Dkt. No.\n2).  Both the Governor’s words and the temporal proximity between\nthe release of the videos and his directive to terminate the contracts\nsupport he did not retaliate against Plaintiff based upon its right of\nassociation nor its right to advocate for and perform abortions. \nTherefore, the court concludes Plaintiff is unlikely to prevail on its\nunconstitutional condition claims.\nApp. at 494–495.\nWe conclude that the district court’s analysis is unconvincing.6  Focusing\non what the district court described as “the Governor’s words,” id. at 495, the\nDirective itself repeatedly refers to PPAU as “Planned Parenthood,” states that\n“[t]he allegations against Planned Parenthood are deeply troubling,” notes that\n“[t]he federal government has provided grants to Planned Parenthood, distributed\nthrough the Utah Department of Health,” and ultimately states that Herbert\n“instructed state agencies to cease acting as an intermediary for pass-through\nfederal funds to Planned Parenthood.”  App. Vol. 1 at 51.  The Directive thus fails\nto distinguish between PPAU and Planned Parenthood (or, for that matter,\n6 As we read the above-quoted language, the district court was merely \nassessing the limited evidence presented by the parties and determining, as a\nmatter of law, whether PPAU had established a likelihood of succeeding on its\nunconstitutional conditions claim.  Indeed, it would have been unusual for the\ndistrict court to make a factual finding on this key issue, given the procedural\nposture of the case, the fact that no witnesses testified at the preliminary\ninjunction hearing, and the fact that Herbert has not been deposed yet.  See\nWright et al., supra, § 2950, at 271-72 (“it is inappropriate for the court at a Rule\n65(a) hearing to make findings of fact or conclusions of law that go beyond what\nis necessary to decide whether a preliminary injunction should be issued”).  In\nany event, even assuming that the district court intended to make a factual finding\non this issue, we conclude that such finding was clearly erroneous.\n32\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 33 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 33     \nPlanned Parenthood affiliates in other states) and treats PPAU as if it were the\nentity implicated in the CMP videos.  In other words, reading the Directive in\nisolation, it appears as though Herbert mistakenly believed that PPAU was\nimplicated in the CMP videos and deserved to be punished for its apparent\nmisconduct. \nThe same can be said for much of Herbert’s post-Directive statement to the\npress on August 17, 2015.  There, Herbert stated that “[w]e now have video where\nthey’re selling fetus body parts for money and it’s an outrage.”  Id. at 56.  Herbert\nfurther stated that “it happened in their organization” and “for coloring outside\nthe lines, Planned Parenthood forfeits some of their benefits.”  Id.  In short, these\nstatements to the press again failed to distinguish between PPAU and Planned\nParenthood (or Planned Parenthood’s affiliates in other states) and suggested\neither that Herbert believed that PPAU was involved in the wrongdoing depicted\nby the CMP videos or failed to appreciate the organizational distinctions between\nPPAU, Planned Parenthood, and Planned Parenthood’s other affiliates.\nIf that were all the evidence we had before us, we would thus be left to\nconclude that the most reasonable finding a court or jury could make is that the\nDirective was issued based upon a mistake of fact made by Herbert, rather than\nupon any motivation by Herbert to punish PPAU for its First or Fourteenth\nAmendment activities.  But PPAU has presented additional evidence which leads\nus to a different conclusion.\n33\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 34 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 34     \nDuring the press conference on August 17, 2015, Herbert acknowledged\nthat the events depicted in the video “may not have happened in Utah.”  Id.  And\nin opposing PPAU’s motion for preliminary injunction in the district court,\nHerbert made more specific admissions.7  To begin with, he admitted that the\nCMP videos involved other affiliates of Planned Parenthood and not PPAU.  Id. at\n12; Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at ix.  Herbert further admitted that “there is no\nevidence, or even accusation, that PPAU has ‘colored outside’ of any lines,\nincluding because PPAU does not participate in any program that provides fetal\ntissue for scientific research.”  App., Vol. 1 at 12; Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at ix. \nHerbert also admitted that none of the federal funds that flow through the UDOH\nto PPAU are “used to provide abortions.”  App., Vol. 1 at 12; Dist. Ct. Docket\nNo. 19 at ix.  In addition, Herbert admitted that the accusations made by CMP in\n7 The dissent attempts to downplay this evidence, stating that it derives in\npart from “excerpts from PPAU’s unsworn complaint,” which the dissent asserts\n“is not evidence,” and also from what the dissent characterizes as “an excerpt\nfrom the defendants’ brief in district court opposing PPAU’s motion for\npreliminary injunction.”  Dissent at 7.  In fact, it is the combination of the two\ndocuments that renders these so-called “excerpts” relevant.  To begin with,\nPPAU’s complaint contains numerous factual allegations regarding Herbert’s\nissuance of the Directive.  App., Vol. 1 at 11-14.  Defendants, in their\nmemorandum in opposition to PPAU’s motion for preliminary injunction, stated:\n“For only the purposes of this brief opposing [PPAU’s] motion for preliminary\ninjunction, Governor Herbert does not dispute the factual allegations in\nparagraphs 12 through 22 of [PPAU’s] Complaint describing his response to the\n[CMP] videos.”  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at ix.  In other words, Herbert admitted\nthe factual allegations contained in paragraphs 12 through 22 of PPAU’s\ncomplaint for purposes of the preliminary injunction proceedings.  Thus, contrary\nto the dissent’s assertion, it is proper for us to treat these admissions as evidence.  \n34\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 35 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 35     \nthe videos regarding Planned Parenthood and its other affiliates had not been\nproven and indeed were false.  App., Vol. 1 at 11-12; Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at\nix.  Lastly, Herbert essentially agreed that the national “political climate . . .\n[wa]s very hostile to Planned Parenthood.”  App., Vol. 1 at 3; Dist. Ct. Docket\nNo. 19 at viii-ix.  Nevertheless, Herbert has steadfastly refused to retract the\nDirective.  App., Vol. 2 at 394, 396.\nPPAU also points to Herbert’s participation in a pro-life event held in the\nrotunda of the Utah State Capitol on August 19, 2015, five days after he issued\nthe Directive.  The purpose of the event was “to ask lawmakers to defund\n[PPAU].”  App., Vol. 1 at 59.  During the event, Herbert made two statements to\nthe crowd regarding abortion.  To begin with, Herbert stated, “I’m here today to\nadd my voice to yours and speak out on the sanctity of life.”  Id.  Herbert then\nstated, “The thing I find most appalling is the casualness, the callousness . . . the\nlack of respect, the lack of sensitivity to the unborn.”  Id. at 11.\nConsidering all of this evidence together, we conclude that a reasonable\nfinder of fact is more likely than not to find that Herbert issued the Directive to\npunish PPAU for the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights it has identified in\nthis litigation.  In particular, we conclude that a reasonable finder of fact is more\nlikely than not to find that Herbert, a politician and admitted opponent of\nabortion, viewed the situation that presented itself by release of the CMP videos\nas an opportunity to take public action against PPAU, deprive it of pass-through\n35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 36 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 36     \nfederal funding, and potentially weaken the organization and hamper its ability to\nprovide and advocate for abortion services.  This seems especially true given\nHerbert’s concession that the allegations made by CMP are unproven and in fact\nfalse, and in light of the current political climate, including the efforts by abortion\nopponents both in the State of Utah and nationally to defund Planned Parenthood\nand its affiliates.\nOf course, that leaves the possibility that defendants can assert a valid\ndefense to the unconstitutional conditions claims asserted by PPAU.  As we\npreviously noted, defendants “will have a valid defense if [they] can show, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that, in light of [their] knowledge, perceptions,\nand policies at the time of the termination, [they] would have” issued the\nDirective “regardless of” PPAU’s First and Fourteenth Amendment activities. \nUmbehr, 518 U.S. at 685.  Second, defendants can “also prevail if [they] can\npersuade [us] that [their] legitimate interests as contractor, deferentially viewed,\noutweigh the free speech interests at stake.”  Id. \nNotably, defendants have never attempted, either below or on appeal, to\ninvoke either of these defenses.  Specifically, as to the first defense, defendants\nhave never asserted that Herbert would have issued the Directive absent the\nrelease of the CMP videos.  As for the second defense, defendants did argue in\ntheir response to the motion for preliminary injunction that “[a] contractor’s\nundisputed affiliation with a group alleged to be engaged in such illegal activity\n36\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 37 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 37     \nis ‘a reasonable justification’ for terminating the contract,” Dist. Ct. Docket No.\n19 at 15 (quoting Kansas Penn Gaming, 656 F.3d at 1216), “to prevent the very\n‘appearance of corruption’ Utah is entitled to avoid,” id. (quoting Umbehr, 518\nU.S. at 674).  But that argument was asserted only in the section addressing\nPPAU’s class-of-one equal protection claim and was not repeated in the section\naddressing the unconstitutional conditions claims.  Moreover, the argument is not\nrepeated in the defendants’ appellate brief.  As a result, we conclude, for purposes\nof this appeal, that defendants have not adequately raised the argument in\nopposition to the unconstitutional conditions claim.\nIn summary, we conclude that PPAU has established a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits of its unconstitutional conditions claims and\nthat the district court erred in concluding otherwise. \nLikelihood of irreparable harm to PPAU\n“‘A plaintiff suffers irreparable injury when the court would be unable to\ngrant an effective monetary remedy after a full trial because such damages would\nbe inadequate or difficult to ascertain.’”  Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1131\n(10th Cir. 2012) (quoting Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v. EchoStar Satellite\nCorp., 269 F.3d 1149, 1156 (10th Cir. 2001)).  “When an alleged constitutional\nright is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is\nnecessary.”  Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 963 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting\n11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice\n37\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 38 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 38     \nand Procedure § 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995)).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that\n“[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373\n(1975).\nThe district court in this case concluded that PPAU failed to establish the\nlikelihood of irreparable harm.  The district court based this conclusion primarily\non its determination that PPAU “likely will not be able to show it suffered a\nconstitutional harm.”  App. at 495.  The district court also stated that “[a]ny\nfinancial harm [PPAU] has suffered from the contracts’ termination can be\nredressed.”  Id.  Finally, the district court rejected PPAU’s argument that it would\n“suffer irreparable reputational harm if an injunction did not issue.”  Id.  In doing\nso, the district court noted that there was evidence in the record “that many\npeople have spoken out in favor of [PPAU] following the Governor’s\npronouncement.”  Id. \nWe reject most of the district court’s analysis on this issue.  To begin with,\nwe conclude that PPAU has, in fact, demonstrated a substantial likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of its unconstitutional conditions claims.  We in turn\nconclude that the likelihood that PPAU will suffer a violation of its First\nAmendment rights if the Directive is left in place, standing alone, gives rise to an\nirreparable injury.  See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373; Kikumura, 242 F.3d at 963\n(reaching similar conclusion).  More specifically, we conclude that “[d]amages\n38\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 39 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 39     \nwould [likely] be inadequate or difficult to ascertain” for such a constitutional\nviolation.  Awad, 670 F.3d at 1131 (quoting Dominion, 269 F.3d at 1156).\nAs for the financial harm that PPAU would incur as a result of the\nDirective, i.e., the loss of the federal funds it would have received pursuant to the\nterms of the contracts at issue, the district court was correct that these damages\ncould be redressed (although that would, as a result of the Eleventh Amendment,\nhave to be in a state court action filed by PPAU).  See Heideman v. Salt Lake\nCity, 348 F.3d 1182, 1189 (10th Cir. 2003) (“[E]conomic loss usually does not, in\nand of itself, constitute irreparable harm.”).  \nBut the district court was also wrong in concluding that there was no\nlikelihood of harm to PPAU’s reputation.  Contrary to the district court’s\nassertion, the fact that approximately 1,800 Utah residents sent correspondence to\nHerbert in favor of PPAU following his issuance of the Directive does not\neliminate the likelihood of irreparable harm to PPAU’s reputation.  As noted by\nPPAU, “there are over two million Utah citizens,” meaning that the small amount\nof correspondence that Herbert received from PPAU supporters was “a drop in the\nbucket.”  Aplt. Br. at 69.  Further, we conclude that the Directive could, due in\npart to its ambiguity, reasonably be interpreted by many Utah residents as an\nindication that PPAU was somehow involved with the CMP videos or was\notherwise engaged in the selling of fetal tissue.  And we agree with PPAU that, as\na provider of medical services, its “reputation is . . . critical to maintaining the\n39\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 40 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 40     \ntrust of its patients.”  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 3 at 16.\nFinally, the district court wholly ignored PPAU’s argument that the\nDirective “threaten[ed] to irreparably harm [PPAU]’s ability to serve the high-risk\nmen, women, and teens and their parents, all of whom are the subjects and\nrecipients of the programs that the Governor’s Directive directly affects.”  Id. \nMore specifically, PPAU argued that the Directive “threaten[ed] to increase\nunwanted pregnancies among these groups, as well as [to] increas[e] the risk that\nthese patients will contract and/or transmit potentially life-threatening STDs.”  Id. \nBecause, however, these arguments appear to be focused on the impact of the\nDirective on the public as opposed to PPAU itself, they will be considered below\nin connection with our analysis of the public interest requirement.\nIn sum, we conclude that PPAU has established a likelihood that it will\nsuffer irreparable reputational harm if a preliminary injunction is not issued.\nDoes the harm alleged by PPAU outweigh any harm to defendants?\nIn analyzing this factor, the district court began by noting that the Directive\n“did not terminate [PPAU] as a Medicaid provider” or “preclude [PPAU] from\nadvocating for or performing abortions.”  App. at 496.  The district court also\nnoted that “the defendants have not sought to preclude [PPAU] from receiving\nfunding directly from the federal government, as [it] has done in the past.”  Id. \nThe district court then turned to the defendants’ interests and concluded that if\nthey were “enjoined from terminating the contracts, their authority to manage\n40\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 41 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 41     \ntheir affairs will be curtailed.”  Id.  The district court also concluded that an\ninjunction would “deprive the defendants of their contractual right to terminate\nthe contracts at will.”  Id.  In addition, the district court concluded that\n“continuing to allow [PPAU] to provide services under the auspices of the\ncontracts may reasonably be perceived by the citizenry of Utah as approbation of\nthe wrongful conduct” allegedly engaged in by Planned Parenthood.  Id.  In other\nwords, the district court concluded, “[t]he defendants have discretion under the\ncontracts to consider whether continuation of them would send a message that\nwrongful conduct is acceptable.”  Id. at 497.  Because “[t]here is no monetary\nremedy for such injuries,” the district court concluded, “the injuries to defendants\noutweigh the injuries to [PPAU].”  Id. \nThe threshold, and ultimately critical, flaw in the district court’s analysis is\nthat it failed to take into account PPAU’s likelihood of success on the merits of\nits unconstitutional conditions claim and the resulting likelihood of irreparable\nharm to PPAU.  In our view, the possibility of PPAU’s First Amendment rights\nbeing irreparably harmed outweighs any opposing interests asserted by\ndefendants.\nTo the extent that the district court suggested PPAU could replace the\nfunding from other sources, we conclude that there is no basis in the record to\nsupport such a conclusion.  According to PPAU, the programs at issue “are\nfederally-funded, but administered by the State, and therefore, [it] cannot\n41\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 42 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 42     \nparticipate in these programs except through UDOH.”  Aplt. Br. at 71-72.  Indeed,\nPPAU alleges, the “UDOH unsuccessfully attempted to find a work-around [for\nthe Directive] by which PPAU could obtain funding for the programs at issue\ndirectly from the federal government.”  Id. at 72.\nFinally, we agree with PPAU that the issuance of a preliminary injunction\nin its favor would not infringe upon defendants’ ability and right to manage the\ncontracts at issue and, if necessary, to terminate them for a proper reason (i.e.,\nany reason that would not result in a violation of PPAU’s constitutional rights). \nAlthough defendants assert in response that an injunction would deprive them of\n“their discretion under the contracts to consider whether continuation of them\nwould send a message that wrongful conduct is acceptable,” again there is no\nevidence in the record, nor even any allegation, that PPAU has engaged in any\nwrongful conduct.  Aplee. Br. at 55 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe therefore conclude that the potential harm to defendants from the\nissuance of an injunction does not outweigh the harm to PPAU that will likely\nresult if the injunction is not issued.\nIs an injunction in the public interest?\nIn addressing this factor, the district court acknowledged that “some\nmembers of the public may be harmed if the contracts terminate,” but the court\ndid not otherwise elaborate on this point.  App. at 497.  But “[b]alanced against\nthis harm,” the district court stated, “is the right of the elected Governor of this\n42\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 43 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 43     \nState to make decisions about what is in the best interests of the State.”  Id. \nBecause “[t]hese contracts relate to discretionary programs,” the district court\nconcluded, “[i]t is contrary to the public’s interest to remove from the Governor\nthe very discretion his position entails.”  Id.  “Indeed,” the district court\nconcluded, “these are the types of decisions that should be left to elected officials\nand not managed by the courts.”  Id.  Consequently, the district court\n“conclude[d] it is not in the public interest to enjoin the defendants from\nterminating the contracts at issue.”  Id. \nWe again reject the district court’s analysis.  In assessing this factor, the\ndistrict court again failed to take into account PPAU’s likelihood of success on its\nunconstitutional conditions claims.  Assuming, for purposes of argument, that the\nDirective violates PPAU’s First Amendment rights, the citizens of Utah have a\npublic interest in ensuring that such an order is not enforced.  In other words, the\ncitizens of Utah have an interest in ensuring that their elected public officials do\nnot engage in conduct that violates the constitutional rights of another citizen.\nFurther, although the district court conceded that some members of the\npublic might be harmed by the Directive, it failed to give adequate consideration\nto this potential harm.  Throughout the district court proceedings, defendants\nconceded the importance of the programs at issue to the citizens of Utah.  But\ndefendants argued in their response to PPAU’s motion that Herbert issued the\nDirective only “after considering whether other available and adequate health\n43\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 44 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 44     \nproviders would provide these same services” to the citizens of Utah.  Dist. Ct.\nDocket No. 19 at 26.  At the hearing on the motion, however, defendants reversed\ncourse and conceded that, in fact, no other providers would be able to provide\nsome of these same services.  App. at 459-460.  Notably, the district court made\nno mention of this fact in its decision.8\nAs PPAU notes in its motion, the Directive “threatens to increase unwanted\npregnancies among the[] groups [served by the programs at issue], as well as [to]\nincreas[e] the risk that these patients will contract and/or transmit potentially life-\nthreatening STDs.”  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 3 at 16.  This serious potential harm,\nparticularly when combined with the potential violation of PPAU’s constitutional\nrights, is sufficient to outweigh Herbert’s interest in exercising his discretion to\nterminate the contracts at issue with PPAU, particularly given that the exercise of\nthat discretion may violate PPAU’s constitutional rights.\nOne final point merits discussion.  We agree with defendants that “[w]here\n. . . the exercise of authority by state officials is attacked, federal courts must be\nconstantly mindful of the ‘special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved\nbetween federal equitable power and State administration of its own law.’”  Rizzo\nv. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 378 (1976) (quoting Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117,\n8 Likewise, the dissent states that “[t]he record . . . contains evidence that\nGovernor Herbert thought that the directive would not harm Utah citizens.” \nDissent at 11 n.7 (citing a newspaper article quoting Herbert).  Herbert’s initial\nstatements on this matter, however, are belied by defendants’ subsequent\nconcessions.  \n44\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 45 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 45     \n120 (1951)).  That concern was exemplified in Rizzo, where the plaintiffs sought\nthe extreme measures of appointment of a receiver to supervise the Philadelphia\npolice department and civilian review of police activity.  The requested injunctive\nrelief in this case, in contrast, is much narrower in scope and does not, in our\nview, implicate the concerns raised in Rizzo.  Specifically, the requested\ninjunction in this case would simply preserve the status quo until the merits of\nPPAU’s claims can be litigated and would not otherwise prevent the defendants\nfrom administering the contracts at issue.\nIII\nFor the reasons outlined above, we conclude that PPAU satisfied each of\nthe four requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction and that the district\ncourt abused its discretion in concluding otherwise.  Consequently, we REVERSE\nand REMAND with directions to issue a preliminary injunction in favor of PPAU.\n45\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 46 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 46     \nPlanned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert, et al., No. 15-4189 \nBACHARACH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.  \n  The majority concludes that Planned Parenthood Association of Utah \n(“PPAU”) has satisfied its burden on each of the four elements of the test \nfor a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the majority reverses and \nremands with instructions to grant PPAU’s motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. I join the majority’s discussion of the equal protection claim. \nSee Maj. Op. at 14-25. But I respectfully dissent from the majority’s \ndisposition of the claims involving unconstitutional conditions. On these \nclaims, I believe that the district court acted within its discretion in \nconcluding that PPAU had not shown a likelihood of success.1 \n  PPAU’s claims grew out of Governor Herbert’s directive that the \nUtah Department of Health terminate its contractual relationships with \nPPAU. According to PPAU, this directive placed unconstitutional \nconditions on PPAU’s exercise of its \n1.  First Amendment right to advocate for reproductive choice and \nassociate with the national Planned Parenthood organization for \npurposes of pro-choice advocacy and \n \n2.  Fourteenth Amendment right to provide access to abortion \nservices. \n \n                                              \n1  In light of this conclusion on likelihood of success, I would decline \nto address the three other elements of the test for a preliminary injunction. \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 47 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 47     \nI believe that the district court acted within its discretion in concluding \nthat PPAU had not shown a likelihood of success on the claims involving \nunconstitutional conditions. \nI.  We review the district court’s decision for an abuse of discretion. \n  We review the district court’s ruling for an abuse of discretion. \nHeideman v. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2003). A \ndistrict court abuses its discretion if it “commits an error of law, or is \nclearly erroneous in its preliminary factual findings.” Prairie Band of \nPotawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, 1243 (10th Cir. 2001) \n(quoting Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson, 194 F.3d 1149, 1155 (10th \nCir. 1999)). \nII.  We should not relax PPAU’s burden to demonstrate likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits.  \n \n  PPAU urges us to relax the likelihood-of-success element. According \nto PPAU, it satisfied the other elements for a preliminary injunction, which \nsoftens the burden on likelihood of success to require only a showing that \nthe issue is serious, substantial, difficult, and doubtful. Appellant’s \nOpening Br. at 39-40. For this argument, PPAU relies on Nova Health \nSystems v. Edmondson, 460 F.3d 1295, 1298 n.6 (10th Cir. 2006). I \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 48 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 48     \ndisagree because Nova Health Systems has been implicitly overruled by \nWinter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008).2 \n  Before Winter was decided, we held that the likelihood-of-success \nelement is “somewhat relaxed” when the other three elements “tip \ndecidedly” in favor of the movant. Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d \n1182, 1189 (10th Cir. 2003) (emphasis in original). This approach is no \nlonger tenable in light of Winter. In Winter, the Supreme Court addressed \nthe Ninth Circuit’s relaxed standard for irreparable injury, which had \nrequired a movant to show only a “possibility” of irreparable injury if the \nmovant demonstrated a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits. \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 21. The Supreme Court rejected this relaxed standard \nas “too lenient.” Id. at 22. \n  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals extended Winter to the \nlikelihood-of-success inquiry, holding that the court could no longer apply \na relaxed standard for likelihood of success. Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d \n307, 320-21 (4th Cir. 2013). In dicta, the D.C. Circuit has likewise \nindicated that “a likelihood of success is an independent, free-standing \nrequirement for a preliminary injunction.” Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d \n                                              \n2  The majority also requires proof of likelihood of success and has not \napplied the relaxed standard urged by PPAU. But because the majority \nconcludes that PPAU is likely to succeed even under the traditional \nstandard, the majority does not decide whether to relax PPAU’s burden on \nlikelihood of success.\n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 49 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 49     \n388, 393 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., \n571 F.3d 1288, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring)). \n  The Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have upheld their relaxed \nlikelihood-of-success standards in the face of Winter. See Alliance for the \nWild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2011); \nCitigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v. VCG Special Opportunities Master Fund \nLtd., 598 F.3d 30, 35-38 (2d Cir. 2010); Hoosier Energy Rural Elec. Coop., \nInc. v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co., 582 F.3d 721, 725 (7th Cir. 2009). \n  I disagree with these courts and agree with the Fourth Circuit and the \nD.C. Circuit. In Winter, the Supreme Court reasoned that \n(cid:120)  “plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief [must] demonstrate that \nirreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction” and \n \n(cid:120)  issuing a preliminary injunction after applying a less-\ndemanding test is inconsistent with the Court’s characterization \nthat “injunctive relief [is] an extraordinary remedy that may \nonly be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is \nentitled to such relief.” \n \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis in original). In the same opinion, the \nCourt reiterated that to obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must \nprove not only a likelihood of irreparable injury but also a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits. Id. at 20. And if the Court disallowed softening of \nthe burden on irreparable injury because of the need for the movant to \nclearly show entitlement to a preliminary injunction, we should not allow \nentry of a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of success on \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 50 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 50     \nthe merits. Winter requires a movant to establish each of the four \npreliminary injunction elements and does not allow relaxation of the \nburden on one element based on the proof of another. Thus, I would \ndecline to apply the relaxed standard in district court. There, PPAU had to \nshow that it was likely to succeed on the merits. \nIII.  The district court acted within its discretion in concluding that \nPPAU was unlikely to persuade the jury that Governor Herbert \nhad acted with a purpose of interfering with constitutionally \nprotected conduct. \n \n  Applying the proper test, the district court concluded that PPAU was \nunlikely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that PPAU could not prove \nthat Governor Herbert issued the directive as punishment for the exercise \nof constitutional rights. This ruling fell within the district court’s \ndiscretion. See Verlo v. Martinez, 820 F.3d 1113, 1128 (10th Cir. 2016) \n(applying the abuse-of-discretion standard to the inquiry on likelihood of \nsuccess). \n  As noted, PPAU claims that Governor Herbert put unconstitutional \nconditions on PPAU’s exercise of \n(cid:120)  its First Amendment rights to advocate for reproductive choice \nand associate with others in furtherance of such advocacy and \n \n(cid:120)  its Fourteenth Amendment right to provide abortion-related \nservices. \n \nThe First Amendment protects PPAU’s pro-choice advocacy and \nassociation in furtherance of pro-choice advocacy. See Hill v. Colorado, \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 51 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 51     \n530 U.S. 703, 714-15 (2000); City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 24 \n(1989); Planned Parenthood of Kan. and Mid-Mo. v. Moser, 747 F.3d 814, \n838-39 (10th Cir. 2014). And I assume, for the sake of argument, that \nPPAU has a Fourteenth Amendment right to provide abortion-related \nservices. Cf. Planned Parenthood of Mid-Mo. & E. Kan., Inc. v. Dempsey, \n167 F.3d 458, 464 (8th Cir. 1999) (stating that a Planned Parenthood \naffiliate’s right to perform abortions “is derived directly from women’s \nconstitutional right to choose abortion”). \n  At trial, PPAU would need to show that its protected conduct—\nadvocacy for reproductive choice, association with pro-choice advocates, \nand provision of abortion services—was a substantial or motivating factor \nfor Governor Herbert’s directive. See Moser, 747 F.3d at 839. If PPAU had \nmade this showing, the burden would shift to the defendants to show that \nthe governor “would have taken the same action even in the absence of the \nprotected conduct.” Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 675 \n(1996).3 \n                                              \n3   The majority contends that the “defendants have never asserted that \nHerbert would have issued the Directive absent the release of the CMP \nvideos.” Maj. Op. at 36. But the release of the videos is not the \nconstitutionally protected conduct asserted by PPAU; the constitutionally \nprotected conduct is PPAU’s pro-choice advocacy, association with similar \nadvocates, and provision of abortion services. Thus, the defendants must \nshow that Governor Herbert would have issued the directive in the absence \nof PPAU’s pro-choice speech, affiliations, and abortion services. The \ndefendants argued throughout that Governor Herbert would have issued the \ndirective regardless of the allegedly protected conduct. See Appellee’s \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 52 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 52     \n  The district court concluded that PPAU had failed to show that \nGovernor Herbert’s animus toward abortion was a substantial or motivating \nfactor in issuing the directive. This conclusion fell within the district \ncourt’s discretion. In determining PPAU’s likelihood of success on the \nmerits, the district court had little evidence to go on. Though PPAU bore \nthe burden of proof on likelihood of success, PPAU presented no testimony \nat the preliminary injunction hearing. Based on the sparse record, the \ndistrict court could easily conclude that Governor Herbert believed the \nallegations of illegality from the videos, just as he said he did. \n  The majority contends that Governor Herbert “admitted that the \naccusations made by [the Center for Medical Progress] in the videos \nregarding Planned Parenthood and its other affiliates had not been proven \nand indeed were false.” Maj. Op. at 34-35. I respectfully disagree with this \ninterpretation of the record. \n  For its interpretation of the record, the majority relies on (1) excerpts \nfrom PPAU’s unsworn complaint and (2) an excerpt from the defendants’ \nbrief in district court opposing PPAU’s motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. See id. The unsworn complaint is not evidence. But even in the \n                                                                                                                                                  \nResp. Br. at 48 (arguing that the district court correctly concluded that \nPPAU’s constitutional claims are not likely to succeed on the merits \nbecause “neither abortion itself, nor speaking about it, nor associating with \nothers to advocate for it had anything to do with the Governor’s \ndecision”); Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at 28-30 (defendants making the same \nargument in response to PPAU’s motion for a preliminary injunction). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 53 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 53     \ncomplaint, PPAU does not allege that Governor Herbert conceded that the \nallegations were false. Instead, PPAU alleges only that Governor Herbert \nacknowledged that the conduct depicted in the videos had not taken place \nin Utah. Appellant’s App’x, vol. I at 12. In addition, the majority cites \npage ix of the defendants’ brief in district court, opposing PPAU’s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction. But this excerpt again does not suggest that \nGovernor Herbert conceded that he had mistakenly interpreted the video \nevidence or that this evidence was false. Nowhere has PPAU presented \nevidence of a concession by Governor Herbert that the video evidence was \nfalse or misinterpreted.  \n  Our task is not to assess the soundness of the governor’s decision. \nInstead, we must decide whether the district court had the discretion to \nconclude that the fact-finder was likely to regard Governor Herbert’s \nmotivation as something other than punishment of PPAU for exercising its \nconstitutional rights. \n  In my view, the district court did not abuse its discretion. This \nconclusion is supported by Governor Herbert’s statements that the \ndirective was based on videos depicting purportedly illegal activity by an \naffiliated entity.4 Appellant’s App’x, vol. 1 at 51 (Governor Herbert’s \n                                              \n4  The Salt Lake Tribune also reported that Governor Herbert had said: \nWe  now  have  a  video  where  [Planned  Parenthood  is]  selling \nfetus body parts for money and it’s an outrage and the people \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 54 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 54     \nofficial public statement, following the directive).5 Indeed, PPAU even \nalleged in the complaint that Governor Herbert had based his directive on \nallegations of misconduct against affiliates of Planned Parenthood. Id. at 7, \n11. \n  PPAU points to Governor Herbert’s contemporaneous \nacknowledgment that the pass-through funding was not used for abortion \nservices, contending that the acknowledgment was unnecessary and served \nonly to distance the directive from abortion. But PPAU provides no \nevidence to support this contention. In my view, the district court had the \ndiscretion to credit Governor Herbert’s stated reason for issuing the \ndirective. \n  As further evidence of pretext, PPAU points to the temporal \nproximity between the release of the videos and the directive, arguing that \n                                                                                                                                                  \nof Utah are outraged. I’m outraged. So for coloring outside the \nlines, Planned Parenthood forfeits some of their benefits. \nAppellant’s App’x, vol. 1 at 56. \n5   The majority states that Governor Herbert apparently issued the \ndirective based on a mistaken assumption that the video had involved \nPPAU’s conduct. I respectfully disagree. The record reflects Governor \nHerbert’s understanding from the outset that the video had depicted \nconduct by an affiliated Planned Parenthood chapter, not PPAU itself. See \nAppellant’s App’x, vol. I at 56. But PPAU’s claim involves reliance on \nunconstitutional conditions, not a mistake. Thus, the majority \nacknowledges that if Governor Herbert had issued the directive based on a \nmistake, the defendants would be likely to prevail on a claim of \nunconstitutional conditions. Maj. Op. at 33. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 55 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 55     \n“Governor Herbert waited until the political moment was ripe to retaliate \nagainst PPAU.” Appellant’s Opening Br. at 64. The defendants interpret \nthis temporal proximity as evidence that the governor was heavily \ninfluenced by the Center for Medical Progress videos. Rejecting this \ninterpretation, the district court credited the defendants’ explanation for \nthe directive. That decision was reasonable and within the district court’s \ndiscretion. \n  PPAU’s only direct evidence is a memorandum of talking points for a \npro-life event that Governor Herbert attended after issuing the directive. \nThe talking points, which were drafted by Governor Herbert’s staff, \nincluded statements that (1) the directive had been based on Governor \nHerbert’s commitment to the “Right to Life” and (2) Governor Herbert had \nsent “a strong message” that “Utah values the sacred nature of human life.” \nAppellant’s App’x, vol. 2 at 391-92. But there is no evidence of Governor \nHebert’s approval or use of these talking points. See Oral Arg. at 14:15-\n15:08 (PPAU counsel admitting that Governor Herbert had not used the \ntalking points and that the talking points had never been publicly released). \nBecause Governor Herbert neither prepared nor used the talking points, the \ndistrict court could reasonably decline to rely on them. \n  PPAU also points to six forms of circumstantial evidence: \n1.  Governor  Herbert’s  attendance  at  a  pro-life  event  days \nafter  the  directive  was  issued,  where  Governor  Herbert \nreportedly stated that “I’m here today to add my voice to \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 56 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 56     \nyours and speak out on the sanctity of life” (Appellant’s \nApp’x, vol. 1 at 59-60), \n \n2.  political  efforts  across  the  country  to  defund  Planned \nParenthood affiliates in reaction to the videos (Id. vol. 2 \nat 399), \n \n3.  Governor Herbert’s admission that PPAU was not directly \nimplicated in the Center for Medical Progress videos (Id. \nvol. 1 at 56), \n \n4.  investigative  reports  debunking  allegations  that  other \nPlanned  Parenthood  affiliates  had  engaged  in  illegal \nconduct (Id. vol. 2 at 398),6 \n \n5.  Governor  Herbert’s  purported  knowledge  that  the \ndirective  would  harm  Utah  citizens  (Id.  at  336-59 \n(internal  communications  between  officials  at  the  Utah \nDepartment of Health)),7 and \n \n6.  Governor Herbert’s statement that he stood by his actions \nprohibiting Utah from acting as a pass through for federal \nfunds to PPAU (Id. at 394, 396). \n \n  Based on this circumstantial evidence, PPAU urges an inference that \nthe governor retaliated against PPAU for constitutionally protected \n                                              \n6  On appeal, PPAU asserts that every governmental agency \ninvestigating the videos has exonerated Planned Parenthood. Appellant’s \nOpening Br. at 64. For this assertion, PPAU has relied solely on \n(cid:120)  an email transmitting an article from a website called “Media \nMatters for America” (Appellant’s App’x at 387-88) and \n(cid:120)  two web articles in the Huffington Post (Id. at 398-401, 403-\n04). \n7  The record also contains evidence that Governor Herbert thought that \nthe directive would not harm Utah citizens. See Appellant’s App’x, vol. 1 \nat 55 (Governor Herbert stating that the federal funds would still be used \nto benefit Utah citizens, as the funds would be “put into the marketplace \nwith other qualified providers”). \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 57 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655346     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 57     \nconduct. But again, the district court could reasonably have relied on \nGovernor Herbert’s stated reason for issuing the directive, and this reliance \ndid not constitute an abuse of discretion. Thus, I would uphold the district \ncourt’s conclusion that PPAU did not show a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of the claims involving unconstitutional conditions. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  I respectfully disagree with the majority’s conclusion that PPAU has \nshown a likelihood of success on the merits of the claims involving \nunconstitutional conditions. Accordingly, I would affirm the district \ncourt’s denial of PPAU’s motion for a preliminary injunction. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 37   Filed 08/08/16   Page 58 of 59\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019655347     Date Filed: 07/12/2016     Page: 1     \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT \nOFFICE OF THE CLERK \nByron White United States Courthouse \n1823 Stout Street \nDenver, Colorado 80257 \n(303) 844-3157 \n \nElisabeth A.

Subsequent to \nthat issuance, a poll was called, sua sponte, to consider en banc rehearing. Upon that \nconsideration, a majority of the active available judges of the court voted to deny. See \nFed. R. App. P. 35(a). Chief Judge Tymkovich, as well as Judges Hartz, Gorsuch, and \nHolmes voted to grant en banc rehearing. \n                                              \n* The Honorable Scott Matheson and the Honorable Carolyn McHugh are recused \nin this matter and did not participate in the sua sponte consideration of en banc rehearing.  \n \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 2 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 2     \n \nJudge Briscoe has written separately in concurrence to the denial of en banc \nrehearing, as has Judge Bacharach.

SHUMAKER, Clerk \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 3 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 3     \nNo. 15-4189, Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert\nBRISCOE, Circuit Judge, concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc.\nI write in support of the denial of rehearing en banc for two reasons: to\ncomment on the unusual procedural step this court has taken in this untimely sua\nsponte request for an en banc poll, and to set the record straight regarding the\nmerits of the panel decision.\nI\nFrom a procedural perspective, our consideration and denial of rehearing en\nbanc will surely come as a surprise to the parties, who have clearly moved on. \nThe parties intentionally bypassed further review by the panel or the full court,\nand instead returned to the district court.  And the parties have since stipulated to\nthe entry of a preliminary injunction in favor of plaintiff Planned Parenthood\nAssociation of Utah (PPAU). \nAs our docket reflects, both the panel opinion and the judgment in this case\nissued on July 12, 2016.  The July 26, 2016 deadline for filing a petition for\nrehearing en banc subsequently passed without the parties taking any action.  See\nFed. R. App. P. 35(c) (“A petition for rehearing en banc must be filed within the\ntime prescribed by Rule 40 for filing a petition for rehearing.”); Fed. R. App. P.\n40(a)(1) (“Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, a\npetition for panel rehearing may be filed within 14 days after entry of\njudgment.”); see also Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1) (outlining how time is computed\nunder the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure “[w]hen the period is stated in\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 4 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 4     \ndays”).  Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and our own Tenth\nCircuit Rules, that left only the mandate to issue.\nOn August 1, 2016, however, a member of this court, acting despite the\nabsence of a timely filed petition for rehearing by any party, called for a poll. \nThe poll ultimately failed by a vote of 6 to 4, with two judges recusing.  The\nmandate issued on August 8, 2016, prior to the completion of voting, but after it\nwas clear that the poll would fail.  According to the district court’s docket, the\nparties, unaware of our untimely sua sponte activities, stipulated to the entry of a\npreliminary injunction in favor of PPAU on August 31, 2016, and have moved on\nwith this litigation in district court.\nIn my view, we should be extraordinarily cautious in exercising our\ninherent authority to sua sponte rehear a case when the parties themselves have\nchosen not to seek en banc review.  And, presumably, our inherent authority in\nthat regard is, at an absolute minimum, bounded by the standards outlined in Fed.\nR. App. P. 35 and 10th Cir. R. 35.  Although the dissent cites to the standard for\nen banc review outlined in Fed. R. App. 35(a) and asserts that “the panel acted\ninconsistently with this court’s previously uniform practice when it comes to\nquestions concerning our standard of review and the burden of proof,” Dissent at\n2, there is simply no substance to that assertion, and thus no justification for the\nunusual procedure that has been invoked.\n2\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 5 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 5     \nII\nTurning to the merits, the dissent mischaracterizes this litigation and the\npanel opinion at several turns.  To begin with, the dissent incorrectly states that\n“the preliminary injunction motion turned in significant measure on the question\nwhether [PPAU] could show that it was likely to succeed at trial on its\nunconstitutional conditions claim.”  Dissent at 1.  As a matter of fact, PPAU\nasserted three claims—an equal protection claim and two unconstitutional\nconditions claims—and a substantial portion of the panel opinion was devoted to\nanalyzing whether PPAU had established a substantial likelihood of success on\nthe merits of its equal protection claim (the panel agreed with the district court\nthat PPAU failed in this regard).\nAs for the unconstitutional conditions claims, it is true that PPAU’s\nlikelihood of success ultimately turned on the assessment of evidence concerning\nGovernor Herbert’s motive for issuing the August 14, 2015 directive.  See\nPlanned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Herbert, — F.3d —, 2016 WL 3742008 at\n*12 (10th Cir. July 12, 2016) (“[T]hat leaves the question of whether PPAU can\nestablish that Herbert issued the Directive in retaliation for PPAU’s exercise of\nthose [constitutional] rights.”).  But the dissent again mischaracterizes how both\nthe district court and the panel performed this assessment.  To begin with, the\ndissent incorrectly states that “the district court found that the Governor’s stated\nintention appeared to be his true intention” in suspending PPAU’s funding. \n3\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 6 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 6     \nDissent at 2.  In other words, the dissent states that the district court made an\nexpress finding of fact “that the Governor ‘did not retaliate against Plaintiff.’” \nId. at 4 (quoting Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Herbert, No. 2:15-CV-693,\n2015 WL 9412539, at *6 (D. Utah Dec. 22, 2015)).  The dissent in turn asserts\nthat the panel proceeded to review that factual finding de novo.  Id. \nWhat in truth occurred is that the panel, after carefully considering the\ndistrict court’s opinion, concluded that the district court did not make a factual\nfinding regarding the Governor’s motive for issuing the directive, but rather made\na legal determination regarding whether the limited evidence before it would be\nsufficient to allow a factfinder to find in favor of PPAU on the motive issue. \nPlanned Parenthood, — F.3d —, 2016 WL 3742008 at *12, n.6 (“As we read the\nabove-quoted language, the district court was merely assessing the limited\nevidence presented by the parties and determining, as a matter of law, whether\nPPAU had established a likelihood of succeeding on its unconstitutional\nconditions claim.”).  Indeed, the panel remarked that “it would have been unusual\nfor the district court to make a factual finding on this key issue, given the\nprocedural posture of the case, the fact that no witnesses testified at the\npreliminary injunction hearing, and the fact that Herbert ha[d] not been deposed\nyet.”  Id.  And the panel in turn reviewed the district court’s legal determination\nde novo.  In a related footnote, the panel also stated that, “even assuming that the\ndistrict court intended to make a factual finding on this issue, we conclude that\n4\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 7 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 7     \nsuch finding was clearly erroneous.”  Id.  That is because the district court failed\nto consider at all the admissions made by Governor Herbert in responding to\nPPAU’s motion for preliminary injunction.\nDissatisfied with the panel’s analysis, the dissent asserts that Rule 52(a)(2)\nimposed an obligation on the district court “to offer a finding on the only and\nhotly disputed question in this case,” i.e., Governor Herbert’s motive for issuing\nthe directive, and that “the proper course for [the panel] would have been to\nremand the matter for the district court to discharge its fact-finding function, not\nto attempt [its] own de novo assessment of the record on appeal.”  Dissent at 5. \nThe problem with this assertion is two-fold.  First, the dissent misreads\nRule 52(a)(2).  That rule states: “In granting or refusing an interlocutory\ninjunction, the court must . . . state the findings and conclusions that support its\naction.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(2).  In other words, Rule 52(a)(2) generally\n“requires [a district] court to make findings of fact and conclusions of law if it\ngrants or refuses a preliminary injunction.”  9C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2576 at 283 (3d ed. 2008).  But the Rule\nobviously affords a district court with discretion in how it goes about resolving\nthe unique issues presented in each case.  Thus, although the district court in this\ncase could have made a preliminary factual finding regarding Governor Herbert’s\nmotive, it did not, in the panel’s view, do so, and there was no requirement under\nRule 52(a)(2) that the panel remand the case to the district court to make a factual\n5\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 8 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 8     \nfinding on this issue.  Second, the panel did not, as the dissent implies, make its\nown factual findings, but instead properly conducted a de novo review of what it\ndeemed to be the district court’s legal determination.\nThe dissent also takes issue with the panel’s alternative conclusion that,\neven assuming the district court intended to make a factual finding regarding\nGovernor Herbert’s motive, the district court clearly erred in doing so.  To begin\nwith, the dissent complains that “the panel never proceeded to explain why the\ndistrict court’s finding qualified as ‘plainly implausible,’ ‘irrational,’ or enjoyed\n‘no support’ in the record.”  Dissent at 6.  In turn, the dissent asserts that the\npanel could not “have found the district court’s finding reversible under the\ncorrect standard of review had it tried” because “PPAU offered ‘virtually no\nevidence’ to support its account of the Governor’s intentions.”  Id. (quoting Judge\nBacharach Concur. at 2).\nTo be sure, the panel opinion did not offer a detailed explanation of its\nalternative conclusion.  But that was precisely because it was an alternative\nconclusion contained in a footnote.  And, most certainly, the lack of a detailed\nexplanation for an alternative holding is certainly no basis for granting en banc\nreview.  In any event, the panel based its alternative holding on the fact that the\ndistrict court failed to consider all of the evidence that was contained in the\nrecord.  Most notably, this included, as described in detail in the panel opinion,\nthe admissions made by Governor Herbert in responding to PPAU’s motion for\n6\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 9 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 9     \npreliminary injunction.\nAs for those admissions, the dissent suggests that this is a “new” piece of\nevidence of the panel’s “own creation.”  Dissent at 9.  By no means, however,\nwas this a new piece of evidence unbeknownst to the parties or the district court. \nAs the panel opinion clearly noted, it was Herbert’s opposition brief to PPAU’s\nmotion for preliminary injunction that included the specific admissions to factual\nallegations contained in PPAU’s complaint.  Planned Parenthood, — F.3d —,\n2016 WL 3742008 at *13 (“[I]n opposing PPAU’s motion for preliminary\ninjunction in the district court, Herbert made more specific admissions.”). \nThe dissent then attempts to reframe those admissions, asserting that “[t]he\npanel apparently overlooked the qualifying phrase ‘describing his response to the\nvideos’ and assumed that the Governor admitted all of PPAU’s allegations.” \nDissent at 10 (emphasis in original).  “In fact,” the dissent asserts, “the\nGovernor’s brief merely and unsurprisingly acknowledges the complaint’s\ndescription of the Governor’s response to the videos — namely that, shortly after\nviewing them, he came to the belief that Planned Parenthood’s conduct warranted\nthe defunding of certain programs.”  Dissent at 10-11 (emphasis in original). \nAgain, however, this reframing belies the record.  As the panel opinion\nexplained,\nPPAU’s complaint contains numerous factual allegations regarding\nHerbert’s issuance of the Directive.  App., Vol. 1 at 11-14. \nDefendants, in their memorandum in opposition to PPAU’s motion\n7\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 10 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 10     \nfor preliminary injunction, stated: “For only the purposes of this\nbrief opposing [PPAU’s] motion for preliminary injunction,\nGovernor Herbert does not dispute the factual allegations in\nparagraphs 12 through 22 of [PPAU’s] Complaint describing his\nresponse to the [CMP] videos.”  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at ix.  In\nother words, Herbert admitted the factual allegations contained in\nparagraphs 12 through 22 of PPAU’s complaint for purposes of the\npreliminary injunction proceedings. \nPlanned Parenthood, — F.3d —, 2016 WL 3742008 at *13, n.7.  Notably,\nparagraphs 12 through 22 of PPAU’s complaint were contained in the\n“FACTUAL BACKGROUND” section under a heading entitled “GOVERNOR\nHERBERT’S DIRECTIVE.”  Dist. Ct. Docket No. 2 at 6.  And, as the panel\nopinion accurately described them, Herbert’s admissions to those paragraphs\ndirectly concerned the issuance of his directive:\nTo begin with, he admitted that the CMP videos involved other\naffiliates of Planned Parenthood and not PPAU. [App., Vol. 1] at 12;\nDist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at ix. Herbert further admitted that “there is\nno evidence, or even accusation, that PPAU has ‘colored outside’ of\nany lines, including because PPAU does not participate in any\nprogram that provides fetal tissue for scientific research.” App., Vol.\n1 at 12; Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at ix. Herbert also admitted that\nnone of the federal funds that flow through the UDOH to PPAU are\n“used to provide abortions.” App., Vol. 1 at 12; Dist. Ct. Docket No.\n19 at ix. In addition, Herbert admitted that the accusations made by\nCMP in the videos regarding Planned Parenthood and its other\naffiliates had not been proven and indeed were false. App., Vol. 1 at\n11-12; Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at ix. Lastly, Herbert essentially\nagreed that the national “political climate ... [wa]s very hostile to\nPlanned Parenthood.” App., Vol. 1 at 3; Dist. Ct. Docket No. 19 at\nviii-ix. \nId. at *13.  Had the panel, as the dissent suggests, attributed to the Governor a\nseries of admissions he never made, we presumably would have heard directly\n8\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 11 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 11     \nfrom the Governor, either by way of a petition for panel rehearing or a petition\nfor rehearing en banc, that we had misstated the Governor’s admissions.  The\nGovernor’s silence, however, speaks volumes.\nThe dissent also asserts, curiously, that the panel, by construing Herbert’s\nadmissions in the manner that it did, failed to afford “the sort of comity this court\nnormally seeks to show the States and their elected representatives.”  Dissent at\n10.  “[T]he notion of comity,” however, involves “a proper respect for state\nfunctions.”  Sprint Commc’ns v. Jacobs, 134 S. Ct. 584, 591 (2013); see also\nMichigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., 134 S. Ct. 2024, 2048 (2014) (noting that\n“the practical aim of comity” is to “allay[] friction between sovereigns”). \nPrecisely how the panel’s interpretation of Herbert’s admissions could have\nviolated the notion of comity—an argument, by the way, that Herbert himself has\nnever made—is unclear.\nThat leaves only one other error that the dissent contends the panel\ncommitted: “relax[ing] PPAU’s burden of proof and even seem[ing] to reverse it.” \nDissent at 7.  According to the Dissent, PPAU was obligated to “show its ‘right to\nrelief . . . clear[ly] and unequivocal[ly],’” and the panel failed to hold PPAU to\nthis obligation.  Id. (quoting Petrella v. Brownback, 787 F.3d 1242, 1256 (10th\nCir. 2015) (brackets added by Dissent)).  There is no merit to the dissent’s\ncomplaints on this point, however, because the purported error is tied directly to\nthe dissent’s mischaracterization of the record and the evidence contained in it, in\n9\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 12 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 12     \nparticular the admissions made by Governor Herbert in responding to PPAU’s\nmotion for preliminary injunction.  As explained in the panel opinion, the\nevidence, when considered in its proper context, was more than sufficient for\nPPAU to carry its burden of proof.\nIn the end, the panel opinion was faithful to circuit precedent, including the\napplicable standards of review, and the record on appeal.  As a result, there is\nsimply no basis upon which to grant rehearing en banc. \n10\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 13 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 13     \nNo. 15-4189, Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert\nBACHARACH, Circuit Judge, concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc.\nI continue to respectfully disagree with the panel majority’s disposition of\nthe claim involving unconstitutional conditions. Nonetheless, I do not believe that\nwe should take the case en banc.\nI. Merits\nOn the merits, the critical issue involves the element of likelihood of\nsuccess. On this element, I believe our precedent requires us to apply the abuse-\nof-discretion standard. See Verlo v. Martinez, 820 F.3d 1113, 1128 (10th Cir.\n2016). \nApplication of this standard makes sense here, for the likelihood-of-success\nelement requires us to predict the fact-finder’s ultimate determination after a full-\nblown trial. That prediction would involve an intrinsically factual issue: the intent\nof the Governor in issuing the Directive.\nIn my view, it is appropriate to apply the abuse-of-discretion standard when\nthe district court must predict what the trier of fact would ultimately find. See\nRoss-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996)\n(applying the abuse-of-discretion standard to the likelihood-of-success inquiry\nwhen predicting the eventual outcome on the merits). As a result, I believe that\nwe should follow our precedent in Verlo v. Martinez, which establishes the abuse-\nof-discretion standard on likelihood of success.\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 14 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 14     \nAs stated in my panel dissent, I do not believe that the district court abused\nits discretion on the likelihood-of-success inquiry. The district court had little to\ngo on because PPAU had not presented any testimony and its only documentary\nevidence about the controversial videotapes involved two web articles in the\nHuffington Post and an email transmitting an article from a website called “Media\nMatters for America.” PPAU said that each governmental agency investigating the\nvideotapes had exonerated Planned Parenthood, but PPAU did not present any\nevidence from a governmental source or the actual videotapes.\nThough PPAU presented virtually no evidence, everyone agreed that\nGovernor Herbert had attributed the Directive to his own reaction to the Planned\nParenthood videotapes. To prevail, PPAU had to prove that Governor Herbert’s\nstated reason for the Directive was pretextual—that his true motivation was to\npunish PPAU for exercising its constitutional rights.\nWill PPAU be able to prove that at trial? When given the opportunity to do\nso at the preliminary injunction hearing, PPAU presented no live testimony and\nvirtually no documentary evidence. In these circumstances, the district court had\nthe discretion to predict that PPAU would not satisfy its burden of proof at trial.\nThus, I believe that the panel should have affirmed the denial of a preliminary\ninjunction on the claim of unconstitutional conditions.\n2\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 15 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 15     \nII. En Banc Consideration\nThough I respectfully disagree with the panel’s disposition, I do not favor\nen banc consideration because I doubt that the panel opinion will significantly\naffect future appeals.\nLike Judge Gorsuch, I believe that the panel’s review of the district court’s\nruling was more searching than the abuse-of-discretion standard permits. But this\ndisagreement is unlikely to affect future cases, for the panel stated that it was\nreviewing the district court’s order for an abuse of discretion.\nThough I respectfully disagree with the panel majority on how it applied\nthis standard, my disagreement involves the application of the standard rather\nthan the standard itself, for the panel did not articulate a more searching standard\nof review (such as de novo review) on likelihood of success. Nor did the panel\nmajority disavow the need for clear, unequivocal proof to justify a preliminary\ninjunction. Thus, I do not believe that the panel opinion will significantly affect\nfuture appeals.\n3\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 16 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 16     \nNo. 15-4189, Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert\nGORSUCH, Circuit Judge, joined by TYMKOVICH, Chief Judge, and HARTZ\nand HOLMES, Circuit Judges, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.\nA great deal about this case is undisputed.  Shortly after the public release\nof videos allegedly showing Planned Parenthood officials negotiating the sale of\nfetal tissue, the Governor of Utah announced his belief that the conduct was\nillegal and warranted the suspension of public funding for four programs run by\nPlanned Parenthood Association of Utah (PPAU), the local Planned Parenthood\naffiliate.  PPAU responded by bringing a lawsuit and seeking a preliminary\ninjunction to force the State’s continued funding of the four programs in question. \nAs litigated by the parties, the preliminary injunction motion turned in significant\nmeasure on the question whether the organization could show that it was likely to\nsucceed at trial on its unconstitutional conditions claim.  And even on that claim\nthe parties’ dispute proved pretty narrow, for everyone agreed on the law.  If the\nGovernor discontinued funding because of the group’s affiliation with those\naccused of illegally selling fetal tissue — as he said he did — the parties agreed\nthat no constitutional violation had taken place.  But if the Governor discontinued\nfunding for a different and secret reason — in retaliation for the group’s advocacy\nof lawful abortions — both sides accepted that a constitutional violation had\noccurred.  \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 17 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 17     \nSo it is that the question of preliminary relief on PPAU’s unconstitutional\nconditions claim hinged on a question of fact:  what was the Governor’s intention\nin suspending funding?  See Judge Briscoe Concur. at 3 (“[I]t is true that PPAU’s\nlikelihood of success ultimately turned on the assessment of evidence concerning\nGovernor Herbert’s motives . . . .”).  On the preliminary evidentiary record before\nit, the district court found that the Governor’s stated intention appeared to be his\ntrue intention and that PPAU hadn’t shown it was likely to prove otherwise at\ntrial.  Accordingly, it denied the motion for preliminary relief.  But when the case\nreached this court, a panel disagreed and ordered the Governor to fund PPAU.  In\ndoing so, I respectfully submit, the panel acted inconsistently with this court’s\npreviously uniform practice when it comes to questions concerning our standard\nof review and the burden of proof, questions of considerable legal significance. \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 35(a) (en banc review is appropriate to “maintain uniformity\nof the court’s decisions; or . . . [if] the proceeding involves a question of\nexceptional importance”).1    \n1  Judge Briscoe contends that we should be reluctant to grant en banc\nrehearing sua sponte.  See Judge Briscoe Concur. at 2.  And it’s certainly true that\nthe threshold required to win rehearing en banc under Rule 35(a) is and should be\na very high one.  But any suggestion that en banc proceedings should only come\nby way of motion from the parties, or that sua sponte en banc polls and\nproceedings like this one are somehow irregular, would be quite mistaken.  Sua\nsponte en banc proceedings have played a long and familiar role in federal\nappellate practice.  See, e.g., United States v. Sturm, 672 F.3d 891, 895 (10th Cir.\n2012); United States v. Hardman, 297 F.3d 1116, 1118 (10th Cir. 2002); United\nStates v. Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343, 1361-62 (10th Cir. 1998); United States v.\n-2-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 18 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 18     \n*\nConsider first the standard of review.  Because a preliminary injunction is a\nform of discretionary equitable relief — and a temporary one at that — we review\nthe district court’s decision only for abuse of discretion.  Petrella v. Brownback,\n787 F.3d 1242, 1256 (10th Cir. 2015).  Where, as here, everything turns on the\nresolution of a factual dispute, that means “[w]e will not challenge [the district\ncourt’s] evaluation [of the evidence] unless it finds no support in the record . . .\nor follows from a plainly implausible, irrational, or erroneous reading of the\nrecord.”  Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2003);\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6) (factual findings may be set aside only if clearly\nerroneous).  This deferential standard applies even when the district court makes\nfactual findings concerning documentary proof rather than live testimony.  \nAnderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985).  And no doubt that kind of\ndeference is especially appropriate where, as here, the fact-finding district judge\nat the preliminary injunction stage will be the same fact-finder who will\nHill, 53 F.3d 1151, 1152 (10th Cir. 1995); see also 16AA Charles Alan Wright et\nal., Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 3981.2 (4th ed. 2008) (noting that “[a] court of appeals\nmay decide on its own motion to sit en banc” and collecting cases).  No doubt,\ntoo, the power to call for rehearing sua sponte exists for good reason, for\notherwise a panel opinion could ensconce precedentially binding error into circuit\nlaw that the full court would be powerless to correct only because of the fortuity\nthat the parties who could seek review happen to lack sufficient incentive to do so\n(say because of a settlement or extralegal considerations).  Cf. W. Pac. R. Corp. \nv. W. Pac. R. Co., 345 U.S. 247, 260 n.20 (1953) (en banc rehearing is “an\nimportant and useful device in the administration of justice”).\n-3-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 19 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 19     \nultimately decide the question of permanent injunctive relief.  After all, in cases\nlike this, the district judge is essentially predicting what he or she — not a jury or\nhypothetical reasonable person — will decide at the end of the day. \nRespectfully, the panel opinion departed from these rules of review.  Rather\nthan afford the district court’s factual finding about the Governor’s intentions the\ndeference it was due, the panel offered its own independent assessment of the\nrecord.  As Judge Bacharach’s panel dissent and his concurrence today both\nobserve, in doing so the panel employed a “more searching” standard of review\nthan our precedents “permit[].”  Judge Bacharach Concur. at 3; Planned\nParenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Herbert, 828 F.3d 1245, 1270 (Bacharach, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part).  Even Judge Briscoe, the author of the\npanel opinion, today acknowledges that the panel engaged in de novo review. \nJudge Briscoe Concur. at 4.  To be sure, the panel offered two (albeit alternative)\narguments in defense of its approach.  But, respectfully, neither supports the\npanel’s departure from our normal rules of review.\nFirst, the panel asserted that no deference was due because the district court\nfailed to supply a factual finding about the Governor’s intentions.  Planned\nParenthood Ass’n of Utah, 828 F.3d at 1261 n.6.  But the district court did\nprecisely that:  it expressly found that the Governor “did not retaliate against\n-4-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 20 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 20     \nPlaintiff” and it proceeded to supply many and extensive reasons for its finding.2 \nSee Cypert v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-050 of Osage Cty., 661 F.3d 477, 483 (10th\nCir. 2011) (noting whether the defendant retaliated against the plaintiff for\nengaging in constitutionally protected activity is “ordinarily for the trier of fact”);\nMaestas v. Segura, 416 F.3d 1182, 1187-88 (10th Cir. 2005) (same).  Besides,\neven supposing (counterfactually) that the district court had failed to offer a\nfinding on the only and hotly disputed factual question in this case, it would have\nfailed its duty under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(2) to supply a necessary finding and the\nproper course for this court would have been to remand the matter for the district\ncourt to discharge its fact-finding function, not to attempt our own de novo\nassessment of the record on appeal.  See id. (“In granting or refusing an\n2  “Gary Herbert has been the Governor of Utah for the past six years. \nAlthough Plaintiff has been associated with other pro-choice entities since\nGovernor Herbert took office and it started performing abortions in Utah in 2011,\nthe Governor still allowed the [Utah Department of Health] to enter into and\nmaintain contracts with Plaintiff.  It was not until the videos were released that\nthe Governor acted to terminate the contracts.  Indeed, Plaintiff alleges and the\ndefendants do not dispute that the Governor said, ‘We now have video where\nthey’re selling fetus body parts for money and it’s an outrage and the people of\nUtah are outraged.  I’m outraged.  So for coloring outside the lines, [Plaintiff]\nforfeits some of [its] benefits.’  Complaint, ¶ 14 (Dkt. No. 2).  Both the\nGovernor’s words and the temporal proximity between the release of the videos\nand his directive to terminate the contracts support he did not retaliate against\nPlaintiff based upon its right of association nor its right to advocate for and\nperform abortions.  Therefore, the court concludes Plaintiff is unlikely to prevail\non its unconstitutional condition claims.”  Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v.\nHerbert, No. 2:15-CV-693, 2015 WL 9412539, at *6 (D.

Dep’t of Human Servs., 69 F.3d 1081, 1087-\n89 (10th Cir. 1995) (remanding to the district court to make adequate factual\nfindings).  \nSecond, and proceeding in the opposite direction, the panel summarily\nsuggested in a footnote that any finding the district court did make had to have\nbeen clearly erroneous.  Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah, 828 F.3d at 1261 n.6.\nBut the panel never proceeded to explain why the district court’s finding qualified\nas “plainly implausible,” “irrational,” or enjoyed “no support” in the record.  And\nsurely merely being “unconvinc[ed],” as the court professed to be, will not do. \nId. at 1261.  Neither, for that matter, could the panel have found the district\ncourt’s finding reversible under the correct standard of review had it tried, for as\nJudge Bacharach explained and as we shall see in a moment, PPAU offered\n“virtually no evidence” to support its account of the Governor’s intentions and the\nrecord “easily” permitted, whether or not it compelled, the finding the district\ncourt offered.  Judge Bacharach Concur. at 2; Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah,\n828 F.3d at 1269 (Bacharach, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).3\n3  Separately, the panel also briefly suggested that it would have been\n“unusual” for the district court to issue findings of fact at the preliminary\ninjunction stage in this particular case given that discovery had just begun. \nPlanned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah, 828 F.3d at 1261 n.6.  But, as we’ve seen,\ndistrict courts must provide any factual findings necessary to support their\npreliminary injunction rulings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(2); their findings are\n-6-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 22 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 22     \n*\nNext consider the burden of proof.  Even if the panel could have properly\napplied a de novo standard of review, a preliminary injunction still remained an\n“extraordinary remedy” and it fell to PPAU as the movant to show its “right to\nrelief . . . clear[ly] and unequivocal[ly].”  Petrella, 787 F.3d at 1256.  True, this\ncourt once suggested that the plaintiff’s burden on the likelihood of success factor\nmay be relaxed when the other preliminary injunction factors are satisfied.  See\nNova Health Sys. v. Edmondson, 460 F.3d 1295, 1298 n.6 (10th Cir. 2006).  But,\nas Judge Bacharach’s panel dissent noted, the Supreme Court has since cast doubt\non that judgment.  See Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah, 828 F.3d at 1267-68\n(Bacharach, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Winter v. Nat.\nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  See also Diné Citizens Against\nRuining Our Environment v. Jewell, — F.3d —, No. 15-2130, slip op. at 9-11\n(10th Cir. Oct. 27, 2016). \nRespectfully, the panel in this case not only conducted its own de novo\nreview of the record, it relaxed PPAU’s burden of proof and even seemed to\nreverse it.  For PPAU to prevail in the case as litigated, everyone acknowledges,\nit had to show that the Governor’s real reason for his decision was something\ndue our deference even when based on purely documentary proof under Anderson,\n470 U.S. at 574; and district courts routinely decide preliminary injunction\ndisputes before the great grinding gears of our civil discovery process engage.\n-7-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 23 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 23     \nsecret and different than he now contends it to be.  Yet, it is undisputed that when\nthe Governor announced his decision to discontinue funding he\ncontemporaneously explained that his decision came in direct response to the\nvideos.  And it is undisputed, too, that the Governor was free as a matter of law to\nsuspend the funding in question for this reason.  To be sure, the panel cited the\nfact that the Governor has long opposed abortion and, from this, inferred that he\nwanted to punish the group for its lawful abortion advocacy.  But it is undisputed\nthat the Governor has held office since 2009 and had taken no action against\nPPAU until shortly after the release of the videos in 2015.  And it is undisputed\nthat the Governor has repeatedly granted or extended funding to PPAU for\nnumerous programs since taking office.  So it is that, analytically, to reach the\ndecision it did the panel had to dismiss the Governor’s evidence suggesting an\nobvious and temporally proximate potential cause of the group’s asserted injury\n— the videos — in favor of PPAU’s evidence suggesting a temporally remote\npotential cause that was itself contradicted by intervening evidence.  And\nwhatever else might be said about this proof, it’s hard to see how it could qualify\nas clear and unequivocal proof that PPAU was likely to succeed on the merits.  As\nJudge Bacharach observed, a proper application of the burden of proof “easily”\nrequired affirmance.  Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah, 828 F.3d at 1269-71\n(Bacharach, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Judge Bacharach\nConcur. at 2.\n-8-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 24 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 24     \nIndeed, the panel’s relaxation of the burden of proof in this manner sits at\nodds with a very large body of circuit precedent.  In so many fields (like\nemployment or business disputes) this court routinely holds proof exactly like\nPPAU’s — pointing to a temporally remote cause and disregarding proof of\nalternative and intervening causes — insufficient even to survive summary\njudgment.  See Trujillo v. PacifiCorp, 524 F.3d 1149, 1157 n.5 (10th Cir. 2008)\n(collecting cases dismissing similar causation claims as too speculative).  And it\nis difficult to see how this court could, consistent with so much precedent, hold\nproof along the very same lines sufficient to establish a likelihood of success.   \nFaced with the problem that PPAU itself presented “virtually no evidence”\nto discharge its burden of proof consistent with circuit precedent, Planned\nParenthood Ass’n of Utah, 828 F.3d at 1269-71 (Bacharach, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part), the panel proceeded to supplement the group’s arguments\nfor reversal with a new one of its own creation. The panel asserted that the\nGovernor, in a brief he submitted to the district court, “admi[tted]” that he knew\nthe videos to be fabrications.  And in light of this asserted admission, the panel\nreasoned, the Governor surely could not have relied on the videos as grounds for\nhis decision to discontinue funding.  Indeed, the panel placed great stress on this\nargument when explaining its grounds for reversal.  See Planned Parenthood\nAss’n of Utah, 828 F.3d at 1261-62. \n-9-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 25 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 25     \nBut, respectfully, this new argument only serves to highlight the problems\nwith the panel opinion.  For here, in its final and key movement, the panel\nadvanced and adjudicated an argument for reversal that PPAU never made — not\nin this court, not in the district court.  All in spite of and without discussing this\ncourt’s rule that it will not normally pursue arguments for reversal that an\nappellant hasn’t presented on appeal or preserved in the district court.  See Verlo\nv. Martinez, 820 F.3d 1113, 1132 (10th Cir. 2016); Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc.,\n634 F.3d 1123, 1127 (10th Cir. 2011).  \nPerhaps even more troubling still, proceeding without the benefit of\nadversarial testing the panel proceeded to make a mistake, one inconsistent with\nthe sort of comity this court normally seeks to show the States and their elected\nrepresentatives.  For a look at the Governor’s district court brief quickly reveals\nthe reason why PPAU never attempted the panel’s new argument:  the brief\ncontains nothing like the bombshell admission the panel attributed to it.  The\nGovernor’s brief says simply that, for “purposes of this brief opposing [the]\nmotion for preliminary injunction, Governor Herbert does not dispute” the factual\nallegations in paragraphs 12 through 22 of PPAU’s complaint “describing [his]\nresponse to the videos.”  Defs Mem. Opp’n. to Pls. Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at ix,\nECF No. 19 (emphasis added).  The panel apparently overlooked the qualifying\nphrase “describing his response to the videos” and assumed that the Governor\nadmitted all of PPAU’s allegations.  In fact, the Governor’s brief merely and\n-10-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 26 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 26     \nunsurprisingly acknowledges the complaint’s description of the Governor’s\nresponse to the videos — namely that, shortly after viewing them, he came to the\nbelief that Planned Parenthood’s conduct warranted the defunding of certain\nprograms.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine that the Governor’s able lawyers would\nhave conceded away their entire case while still opposing relief, all without\nPPAU’s equally able lawyers noticing at any time throughout extensive district\ncourt and appellate proceedings.  See Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah, 828\nF.3d at 1269-70 (Bacharach, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting\nthe absence of any admission).  And it seems more than a little at odds with the\ncomity federal courts normally afford the States and their elected representatives\nfor this court, on its own motion, to attribute to a sitting Governor an admission\nhe never made in order to discredit, in a published judicial opinion, the statements\nhe publicly offered for his official actions.  See Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362,\n378-79 (1976) (“Where, as here, the exercise of authority by state officials is\nattacked, federal courts must be constantly mindful of the special delicacy of the\nadjustment to be preserved between federal equitable power and State\nadministration of its own law.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n*\nRespectfully, this case warrants rehearing.  As it stands, the panel opinion\nleaves litigants in preliminary injunction disputes reason to worry that this court\nwill sometimes deny deference to district court factual findings; relax the burden\n-11-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00693-DB   Document 42   Filed 10/28/16   Page 27 of 27\nAppellate Case: 15-4189     Document: 01019712249     Date Filed: 10/28/2016     Page: 27     \nof proof by favoring attenuated causal claims our precedent disfavors; and invoke\narguments for reversal untested by the parties, unsupported by the record, and\ninconsistent with principles of comity.  Preliminary injunction disputes like this\none recur regularly and ensuring certainty in the rules governing them, and\ndemonstrating that we will apply those rules consistently to all matters that come\nbefore us, is of exceptional importance to the law, litigants, lower courts, and\nfuture panels alike.  I respectfully dissent.\n-12-",
