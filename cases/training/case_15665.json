    "summary": "<p>On August 28, 2015, Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. (PPSE) filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. PPSE sued the Governor of Alabama and the Alabama Medicaid Agency under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Medicaid Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the defendant from terminating PPSE's Medicaid provider agreement. </p><p>Specifically, PPSE claimed that on August 6, 2015, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley notified the plaintiff that the state would soon terminate PPSE's Medicaid provider agreement. While the letter did not give a reason for this termination, Governor Bentley released a press statement the same day referencing a heavily edited video produced by anti-choice advocates that misleadingly indicated other Planned Parenthood clinics had sold fetal body parts. The plaintiff claimed that such allegations were irrelevant to PPSE's ability to offer services to Medicaid patients. Further, PPSE claimed that termination of its Medicaid provider agreements violated the Medicaid Act by denying PPSE patients the right to choose the willing and qualified health care provider of their choice; the First and Fourteenth Amendment by penalizing the plaintiff for its constitutionally protected association with abortion providers; and the Equal Protection Clause by singling PPSE out for unfavorable treatment. </p><p>On September 16, 2015, PPSE submitted an amended complaint including a Jane Doe plaintiff. The Jane Doe plaintiff was an Alabama Medicaid patient who preferred to receive health services from PPSE. On October 16, 2015, the plaintiffs submitted a second amended complaint and a motion to certify class. The plaintiffs asked for class certification to cover all Alabama Medicaid beneficiaries who obtained or sought to obtain health care services from PPSE. </p><p>On October 28, 2015, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. He found that Governor Bentley's termination of PPSE's provider agreement likely violated the Medicaid Act because it failed to provide a reason for such termination. The preliminary injunction required that the State reinstate its Medicaid provider agreement with PPSE.  </p><p>The parties then began settlement discussions. On November 30, 2015, the parties jointly moved the court to enter a final order. The proposed order permanently enjoined the state from terminating PPSE's Medicaid provider agreements based on any allegations from the misleading video previously mentioned by the Governor or from terminating the agreement on an at-will basis. The order further required the State to cover the plaintiffs' attorney fees. Judge Thompson entered the final order as requested. The case is now closed.</p>",

HAC FT T CL\nINC., UI 3. U I c'r\nUIjUR\nfl C 0 fl T i\nLi U\nPlaintiff,\nCIVIL ACTION : I5'-cv-( 20\nkA\nROBERT BENTLEY, Governor of Alabama, in Case No.\nhis official capacity; STEPHANIE McGEE\nAZAR, Acting Commissioner, Alabama\nMedicaid Agency, in her official capacity,\nDefendants.\nCOMPLAINT\nPlaintiff, by and through its attorneys, brings this Complaint against the above-named\nDefendants, their employees, agents, delegatees, and successors in office, and in support thereof\nstate the following:\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n1. This civil action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate rights\nsecured by the federal Medicaid statutes and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\n2. Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. (\"PPSE\") provides critically needed\nfamily planning services and other preventive health services to women in Mobile and\nBirmingham through the Medicaid program. As is required by federal law, Medicaid enrollees\nmay seek services from a participating provider of their choice and have those services covered\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 2 of 13\nby Medicaid. Alabama Medicaid does not pay for abortions except in extremely narrow\ncircumstances.\n3. On August 6, 2015, without warning and having expressed no prior concerns\nabout the participation of PPSE in providing services to Alabama women through the Medicaid\nprogram, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley notified PPSE by letter that it was terminating\nPP SE's Medicaid provider agreement, effective 15 days after receipt of the letter. While the\nletter gave no reason for the termination, Governor Bentley that same day released a statement\nthat referred to heavily edited and misleading videos that opponents of Planned Parenthood have\nrecently released. Those tapes relate to the practice of an extremely small number of Planned\nParenthood affiliates that allow their patients to donate fetal tissue following an abortion in order\nto advance medical research. While all Planned Parenthood affiliates comply with all federal and\nstate laws on the disposal of fetal tissue, PPSE does not participate in any fetal tissue donation\nprograms and does not appear in any of the videos.\n4. Notably, nothing in Governor Bentley's statement relates to the quality of\nMedicaid services provided by PPSE.\n5. Instead, Governor Bentley stated that he terminated the agreements\nbecause: \"1 respect human life, and I do not want Alabama to be associated with an\norganization that does not.\" Defendants' actions are, unfortunately, consistent with the\nState's long history of targeting abortion providers for unfair treatment. As the Court\ndetailed in Planned Parenthood Southeast v. Strange, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1330, 1334 (M.D.\n2014) (Thompson, J.), \"abortion providers and women seeking abortions in Alabama\ntoday live and work in a climate of extreme hostility to the practice of abortion. On a day-\nto-day basis, a provider or a patient sees this hostility when she opens the newspaper,\n-2-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 3 of 13\ndrives by a group of protesters at a clinic, or learns that another piece of legislation\nconcerning abortion has been enacted.\" In each of the last four years the State has passed\na new law restricting abortion. Id. In general, there is a climate of hostility toward\nabortion from elected officials. Id. See also West Ala. Women's Or. v. Williamson, No.\n15-CV-00497-MHT-TFM (M.D. Ala. Aug. 13, 2015) (Thompson, J.), slip op.., Doc. 23-1\nat 30 (\"Abortion providers in Alabama have faced severe harassment and stigma for\nbeing associated with abortion in any way\"); Id. at 67-68 (\"The history of violence and\nthe continued extreme hostility towards abortion providers has created a shortfall of\nclinics and doctors in Alabama.\"); id. at 79 (\"These circumstances have resulted in a climate\nin which any physician associated with abortion in this State is stigmatized, harassed, and even\nthreatened with violence.\").\n6. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to protect PPSE's patients' access\nto - and PPSE's own ability to provide these critical medical services. Defendants' actions\nviolate Section 1 396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States Code (\"Medicaid freedom of choice\nprovision\") because, by barring PPSE from the Medicaid program, it prevents PPSE's patients\nfrom receiving services from the qualified, willing provider of their choice. Defendants' actions\nfurther impermissibly penalize Plaintiff without adequate justification, in violation of the First\nand Fourteenth Amendments.\n7. Unless enjoined, the termination of PPSE's Medicaid provider agreements will\ndisqualify PPSE from providing critical health care services to Alabama women who depend on\nPPSE for that care. Defendants' actions are already causing significant and irreparable hann to\nPPSE and to its Medicaid patients who will lose their provider of choice, and will find their\nfamily planning services interrupted. Plaintiff and its patients have no adequate remedy of law.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 4 of 13\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n8. Subject-matter jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. § 1331 &\n1343.\n9. Plaintiff's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the\ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Cot.\n10. Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391.\nTHE PARTIES\nA. Plaintiff\n11. Plaintiff PPSE is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of Georgia.\nPPSE brings this action on behalf of itself, its physicians who are Medicaid-enrolled providers,\nand its Medicaid patients.\n12. PPSE provides reproductive health care at two health centers in Alabama, one in\nMobile and one in Birmingham, as well as at five in Georgia, and one in Mississippi. PPSE\nparticipates in the Alabama Medicaid program, providing medical services to low-income\nenrollees. The family planning and other preventive health services provided by PPSE at these\nhealth centers include physical exams, contraception and contraceptive counseling, screening for\nbreast cancer, screening for cervical cancer, testing and treatment for certain sexually transmitted\ninfections (\"STIs\"), and pregnancy testing and counseling. Plaintiff also provides abortion at\nboth health centers.\nB. Defendants\n13. Defendant Robert Bent-ley is the Governor of Alabama. On August 6, 2015,\nGovernor Bentley notified PPSE that he was directing the termination of PPSE's Medicaid\n-4-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 5 of 13\nagreement. The Governor is sued in his official capacity for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n14. Defendant Stephanie McGee Azar is the Acting Commissioner of the Alabama\nMedicaid Agency, the agency that administers the state Medicaid program. The Acting\nCommissioner is sued in her official capacity for declaratory and injunctive relief.\nTHE MEDICAID PROGRAM\nA. The Medicaid Statute\n15. The Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of\n1935, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., pays for medical care provided to eligible people based upon\ntheir income. A State may elect whether or not to participate; if it chooses to do so, it must\ncomply with the requirements imposed by the Medicaid statute and by the Secretary of the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") in her administration of Medicaid. See\ngenerally 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1)-(83).\n16. To receive federal funding, a participating State must develop a \"plan for medical\nassistance\" and submit it to the Secretary of HHS for approval. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a).\n17. Among other requirements, the State plan must provide that: \"[A]y individual\neligible for medical assistance.. . may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency,\ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required.. . who\nundertakes to provide him such services.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A).\n18. Congress has singled out family planning services for special additional\nprotections to ensure freedom of choice of provider, specifically providing that, with respect to\nthese services and with certain limited exceptions not applicable here, \"enrollment of an\nindividual eligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management system. . . ,a\n-5-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 6 of 13\nmedicaid managed care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the\nqualified person from whom the individual may receive services.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(B).\n19. The federal government reimburses the state of Alabama 90% of expenditures\nattributable to family planning services and supplies in the Medical assistance program. 42\nU.S.C. § 1396b(a)(5).\nB. Implementation of the Medicaid Act\n19. For decades, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), the agency\nwithin HHS that administers Medicaid (and its predecessor organization), has repeatedly\ninterpreted the \"qualified\" language in Section 1 396a(a)(23) to prohibit states from denying\nenrollees access to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that provider to perform\nMedicaid-covered services or to properly bill for those services, including reasons such as the\nscope of the medical services that the provider chooses to offer.\n20. CMS has explained that \"[t]he purpose of the free choice provision is to allow\n[Medicaid] recipients the same opportunities to choose among available providers of covered\nhealth care and services as are normally offered to the general population.\" Ctrs. For Medicare &\nMedicaid Servs, CMS Manuals Publication #45, State Medicaid Manual § 2100.\n21. Consistent with this understanding, HHS has a long history of rejecting state plans\nthat seek to limit the type of provider that can provide particular services. See, e.g., 53 Fed. Reg.\n8699 (Mar. 16, 1988) (noting rejection of plan that would limit providers to \"private nonprofit\"\norganizations); 67 Fed. Reg. 79121 (Dec. 27, 2002) (noting disapproval of a state plan\namendment that would have limited \"beneficiary choice.. . by imposing standards that are not\nreasonably related to the qualifications of providers\").\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 7 of 13\n22. More recently, CMS rejected an Indiana plan that barred state agencies from\ncontracting with or making grants to any entities that perform abortion because it violated the\nMedicaid freedom of choice provision. Letter from Donald M. Berwick, Adm'r., CMS, to\nPatricia Casanova, Dir., Ind. Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (June 1, 2011),\nhttp://www.politico.com/static/PPM0601_indiana_letter.html.\n23. Moreover, even though CMS is permitted to waive § 1396a(a)(23) in\ndemonstration projects, like Alabama's Plan First program, approved under Social Security Act §\n1115, CMS has repeatedly rejected state requests to do so for family planning services, including\ntwice in the last year: first in Pennsylvania, see Letter from Marilyn Tavenner, Adm'r, CMS, to\nBeverly Mackereth, Sec'y, Pa. Dep't of Public Welfare (Aug. 28, 2014),\nhttp://www.medicaid.govlMedicaid-CHIP-Prograrn-InfonnationlBy-\nTopics/Waivers/i 11 5/downloads/palpa-healthy-ca.pdf (\"No waiver of freedom of choice is\nauthorized for family planning providers.\"); and more recently in Iowa, see Letter from Manning\nPellanda, Dir., CMS Div. of State Demonstrations and Waivers, to Julie Lovelady, Interim\nMedicaid Dir., Iowa Dep't of Human Servs. (Feb. 2, 2015), http://www.medicaid.govlMedicaid-\nCHIP-Program-InformationlBy-Topics/Waivers/ ill 5/downloads/ia'ia-marketplace-choice-plan-\nca.pdf(\"No waiver of freedom of choice is authorized for family planning providers.\"). Alabama\ndid not even request such a waiver in applying for their program. See Letter from Cindy Mann,\nDirector, Ctr. for Medicaid & CHIP Srvs., to Stephanie Azar, Commissioner, Ala. Medicaid\nAgency (Dec. 29, 2014) http://www.medicaid.govlMedicaid-CHIP-Program-InformationlBy-\nTopics!Waivers/l 11 5/downloads/al/a1-family-planning-ca.pdf. (\"All requirements of the\nMedicaid program as expressed in law, regulation, and policy statement not expressly identified\nas not applicable in this letter, shall apply to this demonstration.\").\n-7-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 8 of 13\nDEFENDANTS' EXCLUSION OF PPSE FROM THE\nALABAMA MEDICAID PROGRAM\n24. On August 6, 2015, without prior notice, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley sent\na letter to PPSE notifying PPSE that the Alabama Medicaid Agency was terminating PPSE's\nagreements, effective 15 days after receipt of the letter. A true and correct copy of this letter is\nattached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 1.\n25. Defendants' letter provided no reason for the termination of the agreement.\n26. However, Governor Bentley's tweets and statements indicate that he terminated\nPPSE's agreement because of heavily edited and misleading videos that have been recently\nreleased by opponents of Planned Parenthood with regard to other Planned Parenthood's abortion\npractice in other states. For example, on August 15, 2015, Governor Bentley said, \"I will not let\nAlabama tax payer money fund an organization that talks about on tape gently crushing the\nheads on an unborn baby and selling their body parts. In Alabama, we're not going to use\ntaxpayer dollars to support an organization like Planned Parenthood that does things like that.\nWe're just not going to do it. I just will never support an organization that talks about gently\ncrushing the heads of an unborn child. Then to do that in order to preserve the organs so that\nthey can sell the organs; I cannot think of anything more barbaric than that.\"\n27. The allegations in the misleading videos that Planned Parenthood abortion\nproviders are violating the law are false, and no governmental investigation related to the videos\nto date has identified any illegal conduct by Planned Parenthood.\n28. In fact, PPSE complies with all federal and state laws regarding the disposal of\nfetal tissue. See Alabama Administrative Code 420-5-1-.03(5)(e). PPSE does not participate in\nany programs in which patients can donate fetal tissue after abortion. None of its employees are\ndepicted in the misleadingly edited videos. And two investigations of PPSE by Georgia officials,\n-8-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 9 of 13\ncommenced at the request of Governor Deal after the videos' release, have vindicated PPSE's\npractices.\n29. Similarly, Governor Bentley's tweets and statements indicate that he terminated\nPPSE's contract because of his animus against abortion providers. On August 6, 2015, Governor\nBentley said the following: \"The deplorable practices at Planned Parenthood have been exposed\nto Americans, and I have terminated any association with the organization in Alabama. As a\ndoctor and Alabama's Governor, the issue of human life, from conception to birth and beyond, is\nextremely important to me. I respect human life, and I do not want Alabama to be associated\nwith an organization that does not.\"\n30. Defendants' actions are, unfortunately, consistent with the State's long history of\ntargeting abortion providers for unfair treatment. See Planned Parenthood Southeast v. Strange,\n33 F. Supp. 3d 1330 (M.D. 2014) (Thompson, J.), and West Ala. Women's Ctr. v. Williamson,\nNo. 15-CV-00497-MHT-TFM, slip op., Doc. 23-1 (M.D. Ala. Aug. 13, 2015) (Thompson, J.),\ndetailed in ¶ 5, supra.\n31. Defendants' actions were taken without regard to the quality of the medical care\nprovided by PPSE to Medicaid patients, and in direct retaliation for PPSE's provision of abortion\nservices and its affiliation with Planned Parenthood.\n32. CMS has advised Defendants that their actions to terminate PPSE's provider\nagreements likely violate the Medicaid freedom of choice provision.\nIMPACT OF DEFENDANTS' ACTIONS: ON PPSE AND ITS PATIENTS\n33. The need for publicly supported family planning services is great in Alabama,\nwhich regularly ranks among the worst states in the United States for reproductive care. In 2013,\n323,490 Alabama women were in need of publicly finided family planning services. Guttmacher\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 10 of 13\nInst., State Facts About Unintended Pregnancy: Alabma (2014),\nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/unintended-pregnancy/pdfYAL.pdf (hereafter \"State\nFacts: Alabama\"). In 2010, 55% of pregnancies in Alabama were unintended. Id. The state ranks\nfifteenth highest among 50 states in teen pregnancy rates. Kathryn Kost & Stanley Henshaw,\nGuttmacher Inst., U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, Births and Abortions, 2010: National and State\nTrends by Age, Race and Ethnicity, (2014), http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/U5TPtrends10.pdf.\nOver 60% of Alabama's unplanned births are publicly funded. State Facts: Alabama.\n34. In spite of the great needs, there are simply not enough providers of the critical\ncare PPSE provides. PPSE's health centers are in areas classified as a \"Primary Care Health\nProfessional Shortage Area,\" a designation for areas with a population to full-time primary care\nphysician ratio of 3500:1 - or a ratio between 3000-3500:1 in areas with unusually high demand\nfor primary care services and in which primary care professionals in contiguous areas are\npractically inaccessible.

Women, including those on Medicaid, choose Planned Parenthood over other\nhealth care centers because they trust that Planned Parenthood will offer nonjudgmental,\ncompassionate, and comprehensive care, and that Planned Parenthood will provide them with\n-10-\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 1   Filed 08/28/15   Page 11 of 13\ninformation they need to plan their families and protect their health. If PPSE is eliminated from\nMedicaid, they will be prevented from receiving services from their provider of choice.\n36. As a result of Defendants' actions, PPSE is being forced to refer Medicaid\npatients elsewhere for care or ask them to pay out of pocket for their services. Turning away\npatients or forcing them to pay for health care they cannot afford fundamentally defeats the core\nof PPSE's mission: to enable its patients to plan their families and protect their health and well-\nbeing. Delays in accessing family planning services can lead to devastating consequences,\nincluding undetected diseases and unintended pregnancies, many of which may end in abortion.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCLAIM I - MEDICAID ACT (TITLE XIX OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT)\n37.

Medicaid Act claims\nWith respect to the Medicaid Act claims, the Court’s ability to enter final\njudgment depends on two things—first, whether the Court is inclined to rule for\nPlanned Parenthood SE and Doe or for the Governor and the Commissioner; and\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52   Filed 10/15/15   Page 2 of 8\nsecond, whether the theory on which this Court is inclined to rule relates to a pure\nquestion of law.\na. Potential Medicaid Act rulings favoring the Governor and Commissioner\nIf this Court is inclined to rule for the Governor and Commissioner on the\nMedicaid Act claims based on a pure issue of law, the Court may proceed to enter\na final judgment dismissing those claims under Rule 12(b)(6). The Governor and\nCommissioner have argued that Planned Parenthood SE and Doe do not have a\nsubstantial likelihood of success because of at least three separate legal arguments.\nFirst, neither Planned Parenthood SE nor Doe has a cause of action to enforce\n§1396a(a)(23). See Doc. 29 at 22-30. Second, even if §1396a(a)(23) is enforceable\nthrough §1983, the law does not allow plaintiffs like Planned Parenthood SE and\nDoe to use §1396a(a)(23) to collaterally attack the termination of a provider\nagreement, and a provider’s exclusive means of challenging this sort of decision is\nthrough the administrative process envisioned by §1396a(p) and its implementing\nregulations. See id. at 33-34. Third, the provider agreements signed by Planned\nParenthood SE authorized both parties to terminate the agreements at will. See id.\nat 43-44. If the Court is inclined to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction on\nany of these legal grounds, then further discovery likely would be unnecessary, and\nthe Court could enter final judgment dismissing Planned Parenthood SE and Doe’s\n2\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52   Filed 10/15/15   Page 3 of 8\nMedicaid Act count for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\nWith the Court’s leave, the Governor and Commissioner have not yet filed a\nmotion to dismiss, but the Court may construe this document and the opposition to\nthe motion for preliminary injunction as a request for dismissal under Rule\n12(b)(6).\nOn the other hand, if the Court is inclined to deny Planned Parenthood SE\nand Doe’s motion for a preliminary injunction based on the other merits arguments\nthe Governor and Commissioner have raised—arguments that are not based on\npurely legal grounds—discovery will be necessary before the Court can issue final\njudgment dismissing those claims. For example, the Governor and Commissioner\nhave argued that the termination of Planned Parenthood SE’s was justified because\nof concerns that the Planned Parenthood organization has provided medical\nservices that violate American Medical Association standards. See Doc. 29 at 34-\n42. If the Court is inclined to deny the motion for preliminary injunction because it\nappears more likely than not that the Governor and Commissioner will prevail on\nthose arguments, it would appear likely that Planned Parenthood SE and Doe\nwould seek discovery on those issues before final judgment would be appropriate.\n3\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52   Filed 10/15/15   Page 4 of 8\nb. Potential Medicaid rulings favoring Planned Parenthood SE and Doe\nIf the Court is inclined to grant Planned Parenthood SE and Doe’s motion\nfor a preliminary injunction based on the Medicaid Act claims, the Governor and\nCommissioner have discerned only one scenario under which the grounds for\ndoing so would be purely legal in nature such that the Court could proceed to final\njudgment. The Court noted at the preliminary-injunction hearing that it might hold\nthat: (1) the termination letter, on its face, terminated Planned Parenthood SE’s\nprovider agreement at-will, rather than for cause; and (2) the Medicaid Act does\nnot allow for at-will terminations of provider agreements. Although the Governor\nand Commissioner disagree with those propositions and, indeed, this theory is not\nthe same as the one Plaintiffs advanced in their Complaint and motion for\npreliminary injunction, both appear to involve pure questions of law. Likewise,\nalthough the Governor and Commissioner believe that the Court should not grant a\npreliminary injunction on that theory, if the Court does so, further discovery likely\nwould not be necessary, and the Court could proceed to final judgment on that\nground.\nMeanwhile, if the Court were inclined to grant Planned Parenthood SE or\nDoe a preliminary injunction on the Medicaid claims on any other theory, then\nfurther discovery would be necessary, and this Court would not be in a position to\nproceed to final judgment. For example, Planned Parenthood SE has claimed that\n4\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52   Filed 10/15/15   Page 5 of 8\nthe evidence does not establish that its affiliates have violated medical standards or\nthat it can be held accountable for violations by other Planned Parenthood\naffiliates. See Doc. 36 at 14. If the Court determines that the current record\nsupports Planned Parenthood SE’s arguments for the purposes of the motion for a\npreliminary injunction, further discovery would be necessary on these matters. In\nrecent days, it has become all the more apparent that Planned Parenthood SE may\nhave additional relevant evidence on these fronts. Despite Planned Parenthood\nSE’s assertions that Planned Parenthood Federation of America “does not\nsupervise PPSE or otherwise have control over its daily operations or its internal\naffairs,” Doc. 36 at 14, the President of the Planned Parenthood Federation\nannounced earlier this week that the “Federation has decided” that “all of our\nhealth centers will follow the same policy” regarding fetal tissue extraction and\ndonation. See Letter from C. Richards, Pres. of Planned Parenthood Fed. of Am., to\nDr. Francis Collins, Dir. of the Nat’l Inst. of Health (Oct. 13, 2015) (attached as\nExhibit A). Other yet-to-be-produced evidence may confirm that Planned\nParenthood affiliates have violated medical standards. Accordingly, if this Court\nwere to grant the preliminary injunction on the Medicaid claim for any reason\nother than the at-will theory discussed above, it would not be appropriate to\nproceed to final judgment on the claim.\n5\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52   Filed 10/15/15   Page 6 of 8\nII. Constitutional Claims\nThe Court’s ability to enter final judgment on the constitutional claims also\ndepends on whether the Court is inclined to rule for the defendants or plaintiffs at\nthe preliminary-injunction stage. If the Court rules that Planned Parenthood SE and\nDoe have not alleged plausible constitutional claims for the reasons given in the\nGovernor and Commissioner’s opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction,\nthen the Court could enter final judgment dismissing those claims under Rule\n12(b)(6). See Doc. 29 at 44-48. Although the Governor and Commissioner do not\nbelieve that Plaintiffs have met their burden to obtain preliminary relief on the\nconstitutional claims, see Doc. 29 at 44-48, if the Court is inclined to grant the\npreliminary injunction, it would not be appropriate to proceed to final judgment\nimmediately. That is so because a determination of the merits of those claims\nwould require further discovery and litigation.\nIII. Class action issues\nPlanned Parenthood SE and Doe suggested at yesterday’s phone conference\nthat they anticipate filing a motion to certify a class in this case tomorrow. The\nGovernor and Commissioner anticipate opposing any such motion, and class\ndiscovery would be necessary on issues relating to, among other things, whether\nDoe and Planned Parenthood SE can satisfy requirements of Rule 23 relating to\n6\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52   Filed 10/15/15   Page 7 of 8\nnumerosity, adequacy of representation, ascertainability of a class, and the\nsuitability of this case for class treatment. The Governor and Commissioner thus\nwould request a reasonable opportunity to respond to any such motion and a\nreasonable opportunity to conduct discovery on those issues before the Court rules\non the motion.\nIn any event, Doe’s apparent shift to a putative class action at this point only\nhighlights the lack of fit between her Medicaid claim and the relief that Planned\nParenthood SE actually filed this complaint to obtain. As the Governor and\nCommissioner have observed, §1396a(a)(23) grants patients a right of access to\nproviders who have agreements in place with a State. A State’s decision to\nterminate provider agreements, on the other hand, can be challenged only by\nproviders, through the administrative process envisioned by §1396a(p) and its\nimplementing regulations. The inclusion of additional individual patients through a\nmotion for class certification cannot change the twin realities that (1) this case is\nreally about Planned Parenthood SE’s request for reinstatement of its provider\nagreement, and (2) Planned Parenthood SE is using the wrong procedural\nmechanism to achieve that goal, given that Planned Parenthood SE did not file an\nadministrative appeal.\n7\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52   Filed 10/15/15   Page 8 of 8\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ John C.

I also explained how that law was \nthe result of a blue ribbon panel appointed by the Reagan Administration to consider the \nunderlying medical and ethical issues.  My letter outlined the very limited role that Planned \nParenthood plays in fetal tissue research that can contribute to important medical breakthroughs.  \nCurrently, Planned Parenthood operates nearly 700 health centers that provide a wide range of \nvital health services to millions of women and men every year.  Our role in fetal tissue research \nis an extremely small part of what we do.  In fact, just 1% of our health centers currently \nfacilitate tissue donation for fetal tissue research.  !\n!\n  Over the last two months, opponents of safe and legal abortion have turned patently false \nclaims about our role in fetal tissue donation into fodder to advance their extreme political \nagenda – including votes in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate that would have \nblocked Planned Parenthood from receiving federal reimbursements for providing cancer \nscreenings and other preventive care.  I am pleased to report that those efforts, which would have \njeopardized millions of people’s access to health care, have failed thus far.  But this isn’t just \nabout Planned Parenthood, and it isn’t over.  These false claims are being used to advance \npolitically motivated legislation in Congress and in state legislatures across the country to deny \nwomen access to basic health care and to impose medically unnecessary restrictions on safe and \nlegal abortion.  The American public overwhelmingly opposes this political agenda.!\n!\nThrough it all, we’ve heard from leading research institutions and practitioners across the \ncountry, asking Planned Parenthood not to bow to political pressure and to continue our support \n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52-1   Filed 10/15/15   Page 3 of 4\n!\n!\nfor patients to contribute to this important work. As the nation’s leading women’s health care \nprovider, our promise to both our patients and the medical community is that we will never bow \nto political pressure and we will never back down from advancing women’s health every way we \ncan. !\n!\nAs I have stated repeatedly, the accusations leveled against Planned Parenthood are \ncategorically false. Planned Parenthood adheres to the highest legal, medical, and ethical \nstandards.  The outrageous claims that have been made against Planned Parenthood, which have \nbeen widely discredited and debunked, are the worst kind of political interference in women’s \nhealth.  The real goal of these extremists has nothing to do with our fetal tissue donation \ncompliance process but is instead to ban abortion in the U.S. and block women from getting any \nhealth care from Planned Parenthood.  Today, we’re taking their smokescreen away and pushing \nforward with our important work on behalf of millions of women, men, and young people. !\n \nThe participation by a handful of our affiliates in supporting women who choose to make \nfetal tissue donation has always been about nothing other than honoring the desire of those \nwomen and contributing to life-saving research and cures. In order to completely debunk the \ndisingenuous argument that our opponents have been using – and to reveal the true political \npurpose of these attacks – our Federation has decided, going forward, that any Planned \nParenthood health center that is involved in donating tissue after an abortion for medical research \nwill follow the model already in place at one of our two affiliates currently facilitating donations \nfor fetal tissue research.  That affiliate accepts no reimbursement for its reasonable expenses –  \neven though reimbursement is fully permitted under the 1993 law.  Going forward, all of our \nhealth centers will follow the same policy, even if it means they will not recover reimbursements \npermitted by the 1993 law.  \n \nI want to be completely clear about two things: First, Planned Parenthood’s policies on \nfetal tissue donation already exceed the legal requirements.  Now we’re going even further in \norder to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion \npolitical agenda.  And, second, our decision not to take any reimbursement for expenses should \nnot be interpreted as a suggestion that anyone else should not take reimbursement or that the law \nin this area isn’t strong.  Our decision is first and foremost about preserving the ability of our \npatients to donate tissue, and to expose our opponents’ false charges about this limited but \nimportant work.!\n!\n  Finally, in my previous letter to you, I suggested that the widespread confusion over fetal \ntissue research merits a review by an expert independent panel.  There is now proposed federal \nand state legislation to ban fetal tissue donation for research.  I believe these public policy \nproposals would benefit from the expertise from NIH and medical and ethical leaders, and I \nagain encourage you to develop a deliberative process to ensure that Congress and state \nlegislatures have the benefit of such guidance and recommendations.!\n!\nThank you for your interest in this issue.  \n2!\n! !\n\nCase 2:15-cv-00620-MHT-TFM   Document 52-1   Filed 10/15/15   Page 4 of 4\n!\n!\n!\nSincerely,!\n!\n!\n \nCecile Richards !\nPresident !\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America!\n!\n!\ncc:   Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell \n!\n!\n3!\n! !",

(‘PPSE’),  which  funds  services \nunrelated to abortion, including routine gynecological \nexams,  pregnancy  counseling,  and  breast-  and \ncervical-cancer  screenings.    The  plaintiffs  are  PPSE \nand  Jane  Doe,  a  PPSE  patient  and  Medicaid  recipient, \n\nsuing individually and on behalf of a putative class of \nsimilarly situated Medicaid-recipient patients of PPSE.  \nThe  defendants  are  the  Governor  of  Alabama  and  the \nActing  Commissioner  of  the  Alabama  Medicaid  Agency; \nboth are sued in their official capacities.   \nThe plaintiffs filed this lawsuit to challenge the \ntermination  of  PPSE’s  provider  agreement  as  unlawful \nunder  the  ‘free-choice-of-provider’  provision  of  the \nMedicaid Act, which states in relevant part that “any \nindividual  eligible  for  medical  assistance ... may \nobtain  such  assistance  from  any  institution,  agency, \ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the \nservice  or  services  required ... who  undertakes  to \nprovide  [her]  such  services.”    42  U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(23).  PPSE also claims that the termination \nviolates its rights under the First Amendment and the \nDue  Process  and  Equal  Protection  Clauses  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment.  PPSE and Doe bring all of their \nclaims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Jurisdiction is proper \n2 \n \n\nunder  28  U.S.C.  §§ 1331  (federal  question)  and  1343 \n(civil rights). \nThis matter is currently before the court on PPSE \nand Doe’s motion for entry of a preliminary injunction.   \nThe  motion  will  be  granted  on  the  basis  of  Doe’s \nMedicaid Act claim. \n \nI. LEGAL STANDARD \nTo  demonstrate  that  a  preliminary  injunction  is \nwarranted, a plaintiff must show that “(1) there is a \nsubstantial likelihood that he ultimately will prevail \non  the  merits  of  the  claim;  (2)  he  will  suffer \nirreparable  injury  unless  the  injunction  issues;  (3) \nthe threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever \ndamage  the  proposed  injunction  may  cause  the  opposing \nparty; and (4) the public interest will not be harmed \nif the injunction should issue.”  Cate v. Oldham, 707 \nF.2d 1176, 1185 (11th Cir. 1983).  The plaintiff bears \nthe  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  each  of  the  four \n3 \n \n\nrequired showings.  McDonald’s Corp. v. Robertson, 147 \nF.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir. 1998). \n \nII. BACKGROUND \nA.  State Medicaid Program \nThe  federal  Medicaid  program  was  established  by \nCongress  to  provide  low-income  families,  disabled \nindividuals,  pregnant  women,  and  children  with \naffordable  medical  care.    The  program  operates  as  a \npartnership  between  the  federal  government  and  the \nStates.    Subject  to  guidelines  established  by  the \nfederal  government  regarding  eligibility  for \nassistance,  the  types  of  services  covered,  and  the \ncosts of those services, States receive federal funds.  \nSee  42  U.S.C.  § 1396a.    Although  States  are  afforded \ndiscretion  in  administering  the  program,  they  are \nrequired  to  submit  their  plans  for  federal  approval.  \nSee  42  C.F.R.  § 430.10.    The  plan  operates  as  a \ncontract  between  the  participating  State  and  the \nfederal  government,  and  the  Department  of  Health  and \n4 \n \n\nHuman Services may withhold federal funds if the State \nfails  to  ”comply  substantially”  with  the  plan  as \napproved and adopted.  42 C.F.R. § 430.35. \nAs  a  state  participant,  Alabama  maintains  such  a \nplan  with  the  federal  government.    The  State  also \nmaintains  “provider  agreements”  with  health-care \nproviders, which impose on providers state and federal \nregulatory requirements governing the filing of claims.  \nWhen a provider renders covered services to a Medicaid \nrecipient,  the  State  pays  that  provider  directly.  \nFamily-planning services are covered under the Medicaid \nAct and under the Alabama plan.1 \n                   \n1.  Except  in  rare  cases,  Medicaid  monies  are  not \nused  to  provide  abortions  in  Alabama.    The  Hyde \nAmendment,  a  rider  attached  to  congressional \nappropriations  bills  since  1976,  prohibits  the  use  of \nfederal  funds  to  pay  for  abortions.    Although  it  was \ninitially an all-out ban, the Amendment has evolved to \nexempt cases in which the life of the mother would be \nendangered  by  carrying  the  fetus  to  term,  as  well  as \ncases of rape and incest.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 113-\n76, §§ 506-07, 128 Stat. 5, 409 (2014) (\"Consolidated \nAppropriations Act\"). \n \nHowever,  States  are  free  to  fund  abortions  for \nMedicaid  recipients  from  their  own  coffers.    Alabama \n(continued…) \n5 \n \n\nPPSE  is  a  regional  non-profit  corporation \naffiliated  with  Planned  Parenthood  Foundation  of \nAmerica (‘PPFA’); it operates health centers in Mobile \nand  Birmingham.    Through  these  centers,  it  provides \nfamily-planning  and  preventive-health  services, \nincluding  physical  exams,  contraceptive  counseling, \ncontraception,  breast-  and  cervical-cancer  screenings, \ntreatment  for  sexually  transmitted  infections,  and \npregnancy  counseling.    Both  offices  also  provide \nabortions.  As an affiliate of PPFA, PPSE is distinct \nfrom  the  national  organization;  PPSE  maintains  an \nindependent board and exercises exclusive control over \nits daily affairs.  Although PPSE is not supervised by \nPPFA, it must comply with certain standards adopted by \nPPFA in order to operate under the “Planned Parenthood” \nname. \n                                                         \ndoes  not  do  so.    See  Ala.  Admin.  Code  560-X-6-.09(1) \n(\"Payment is available for abortions as provided under \nfederal law.  In the event the abortion does not meet \nthe  requirements  of  federal  law,  and  the  recipient \nelects to have the abortion, the provider may bill the \nrecipient for the abortion.\"). \n6 \n \n\nUntil  the  termination  of  the  provider  agreement,2 \nboth  of  PPSE’s  offices  participated  in  the  State’s \nMedicaid  program  and,  therefore,  were  able  to  provide \nthe aforementioned services for free or at reduced cost \nto  Medicaid  recipients  in  the  State.    PPSE  provided \nservices  to  Medicaid  recipients  one  to  two  times  per \nweek.    Over  the  past  two  fiscal  years,  PPSE  received \napproximately  $ 5,600  in  state  Medicaid  funds.    All \nparties  agree  that  PPSE  receives  no  Medicaid  funding \nfor abortion services. \n \nB. Videos Regarding Fetal-Tissue Donation \nBeginning  in  mid-July  2015  and  ending  in  early \nAugust,  the  Center  for  Medical  Progress,  an \nanti-abortion group, released a series of controversial \nvideos  on  fetal-tissue  donation  programs  operated  by \n                   \n2.  The  State  of  Alabama  technically  maintained  a \nseparate,  yet  identical,  provider  agreement  for  each \nPPSE  facility;  however,  the  agreement  itself  was \nbetween  the  State  and  PPSE.    For  clarity,  the  court \nwill  refer  to  these  identical  agreements  as  one \nprovider agreement in this opinion.  \n7 \n \n\ncertain abortion clinics.  These programs permit women \nwho elect to have abortions to donate fetal tissue for \nmedical  research  purposes.    At  the  PPFA-affiliated \nclinics  that  provide  these  services,  the  fetal  tissue \nis  collected  by  providers.    In  some  instances, \nprocurement  companies  partner  with  the  providers  to \ncollect  and  transmit  tissue  to  researchers.    The \nparties  do  not  dispute  that  no  employee  or \nrepresentative of PPSE is depicted in these videos and \nthat  PPSE  does  not  participate  in  \nfetal-tissue donation, and never has. \nThe videos feature individuals affiliated with the \nCenter  for  Medical  Progress  posing  as  employees  of  a \nfake  tissue-procurement  company.    These  individuals \nparticipate  in  a  series  of  covertly  filmed \nconversations  with  employees  of  PPFA  and  various \nPPFA-affiliated  clinics.    The  videos--nine  in \nall--discuss  two  purported  practices  at  issue  here.  \nFirst,  the  videos  are  clearly  intended  to  give  the \nimpression  that  the  depicted  PPFA  affiliates  profit \n8 \n \n\nfrom  the  ‘sale’  of  fetal  tissue.    Second,  the  videos \nattempt  to  give  the  impression  that  providers  at  the \naffiliates  that  participate  in  fetal-tissue-donation \nprograms  alter  abortion  procedures  in  order  to  obtain \nintact--and therefore more ‘valuable’--specimens. \nFollowing  the  release  of  the  videos,  PPFA \nrepresentatives  criticized  the  tactics  of  the \nfilmmakers  and  argued  that  the  videos  falsely  portray \nthe  practices  of  those  affiliates  that  engage  in \nfetal-tissue donation.  PPFA contends that much of what \nwas  omitted  from  the  videos’  recorded  conversations \nwith  staff  reflects  that  PPFA  affiliates  recover  only \ntheir costs, and do not profit from their fetal-tissue-\ndonation programs.  An independent analysis of several \nof  the  videos,  submitted  by  the  plaintiffs,  concludes \nthat  the  released  videos  were  “heavily  edited”  and \ntherefore  lack  any  legal  “evidentiary  value.”    Pls.’ \nEx. G, Reply Br. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 2, doc. no. 36-1.  \nThe  release  of  the  videos  led  to  strong  and \nimmediate  backlash  against  PPFA  and  the  clinics \n9 \n \n\naffiliated  with  it.    Both  PPSE  and  other  affiliates \nreport  an  increase  in  death  threats  and  incidents  of \nharassment.    Only  two  days  after  the  release  of  the \nfirst  video,  the  Governor  of  Indiana  ordered  an \ninvestigation  into  PPFA-affiliated  clinics  in  that \nState.    Similar  investigations  were  launched  by \npoliticians  in  Massachusetts,  South  Dakota, \nPennsylvania, and Georgia.  Louisiana, Arkansas, Utah, \nTexas, and New Hampshire also responded with efforts to \nterminate  affiliated  clinics  from  their  Medicaid \nprograms.  \n \nC. Termination of PPSE’s Provider Agreement \nOn August 6, 2015, the Governor of Alabama sent a \nletter to PPSE to notify it that its provider agreement \nwas  being  terminated.    The  letter  did  not  provide  a \nreason  for  the  termination  and  advised  PPSE  that  the \ntermination  would  go  into  effect  15  days  later.    The \nGovernor states in his briefing in this court that his \ndecision to terminate was based on his viewing one of \n10 \n \n\nthe videos released by the Center for Medical Progress.  \nThe  plaintiffs  cite  a  statement  the  Governor  made  to \nthe media, in which he contends that comments made in \nthe  video  he  viewed  displayed  a  lack  of  respect  for \nhuman life.  The Governor states that he had no plan to \nterminate PPSE’s provider agreement before viewing this \nvideo.  Further,  it is undisputed that, prior to the \nreceipt of this letter, PPSE had not been made aware of \nany  investigation  into  its  medical  or  administrative \npractices by the Alabama Medicaid Agency.   \n \nIII. DISCUSSION \n  To  determine  whether  issuance  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction is warranted, the court will first evaluate \nthe plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of \ntheir  claims,  then  consider  the  threat  of  irreparable \ninjury,  and,  finally,  discuss  whether  the  balance  of \nharms  and  the  public  interest  weigh  in  favor  of  or \nagainst an injunction.  Because Doe has made a showing \non  her  Medicaid  Act  claim  adequate  to  warrant  a \n11 \n \n\npreliminary injunction, the court does not reach PPSE’s \nconstitutional claims.  \n \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1. Private Enforcement of the  \nFree-Choice-of-Provider Right \n \nIn order to prevail on the merits, the plaintiffs \nmust,  as  a  threshold  matter,  be  entitled  to  pursue \nrelief  under  their  stated  cause  of  action.    The \nGovernor  and  the  Acting  Commissioner  argue  that  the \nfree-choice-of-provider  provision  is  not  enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by either Medicaid providers or \nby  recipients.    This  court  finds  to  the  contrary,  at \nleast  with  respect  to  Doe,  who  is  a  recipient  of \nMedicaid benefits.3 \n                   \n3. Because the court finds that Doe has a private-\nenforcement  right,  the  court  need  not  decide  whether \nPPSE also has such a right, on behalf of its recipient-\npatients or on its own behalf.  See Silver v. Baggiano, \n804  F.2d  1211,  1217  (11th  Cir.  1986)  (declining  to \nresolve  whether  § 1396a(a)(23)  creates  a  right \nenforceable by a provider since “Medicaid recipients do \nhave  enforceable  rights  under  § 1396a(a)(23),  and  an \nactual recipient has made a motion to intervene in this \n(continued…) \n12 \n \n\nThe  federal  Courts  of  Appeals  to  consider  the \nissue, as well as other federal district courts, have \nreached  the  same  conclusion:  § 1396a(a)(23)  creates  a \nprivate  right  enforceable  under  § 1983.

Although  the \nEleventh  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  has  not  explicitly \nheld that the free-choice-of-provider provision creates \na private right enforceable under § 1983, it suggested \nas much in Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F.2d 1211, 1216-18 \n(11th Cir. 1986) (noting, in remanding for the district \ncourt  to  consider  in  the  first  instance  whether  a \nprovider  had  such  a  right,  that  the  district  court \nmight not need to reach each issue, because “Medicaid \nrecipients  do  have  enforceable  rights  under \n§ 1396a(a)(23),  and  an  actual  recipient  has  made  a \nmotion to intervene in this case”), abrogated on other \ngrounds by Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of \nGa., 535 U.S. 613, 618 (2002). \nThese  courts  applied  the  three-step  test \narticulated  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  Blessing  v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), for determining whether \na statutory provision can be enforced under § 1983: (1) \n“Congress  must  have  intended  that  the  provision  in \nquestion  benefit  the  plaintiff”;  (2)  “the  plaintiff \n14 \n \n\nmust demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by \nthe  statute  is  not  so  vague  and  amorphous  that  its \nenforcement would strain judicial competence”; and (3) \n“the  statute  must  unambiguously  impose  a  binding \nobligation on the States.” Id. at 340-41 (citations and \ninternal quotation marks omitted). \nWith  respect  to  the  first  factor,  they  explained \nthat,  in  guaranteeing  the  free  choice  of  provider  to \n“any  individual  eligible  for  medical  assistance,”  the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision employs “individually \nfocused terminology” that “unambiguously confer[s]” an \n“individual  entitlement.”    Harris,  442  F.3d  at  461 \n(citations omitted); see also Planned Parenthood Ariz., \n727  F.3d  at  966-67  (citing  Ball  v.

The \nSupreme Court, too, has explained as much.

(“Planned  Parenthood  argues \nthat  a  state  infringes  the  free-choice-of-provider \nright  when  it  excludes  a  provider  from  its  Medicaid \nprogram for a reason other than the provider’s fitness \nto render the medical services required.  Whether this \nis  the  proper  interpretation  of  § 1396a(a)(23)  is  a \nlegal question fully capable of judicial resolution.”); \n16 \n \n\nsee  also  Planned  Parenthood  Ariz.,  727  F.3d  at  967 \n(“[W]hether the doctor is qualified ... may require [] \nfactual  development  or  expert  input,  but  still  falls \nwell  within  the  range  of  judicial  competence.

See Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, \n536  U.S.  273,  284  (2002).    Under  Gonzaga,  this \npresumption  of  enforceability  could  be  overcome  if \nCongress had foreclosed § 1983 lawsuits by recipients, \neither  expressly  or  “impliedly,  by  creating  a \ncomprehensive  enforcement  scheme  that  is  incompatible \nwith”  private  lawsuits.    Id.  at  284  n.4  (quoting \nBlessing,  520  U.S.  at  341).    But  the  three  Courts  of \nAppeals  to  consider  the  question  all  concluded  that \nCongress  had  not  expressly  or  impliedly  foreclosed \nprivate-enforcement actions.  Planned Parenthood Ariz., \n727 F.3d at 968; Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d \nat 975-76; Harris, 442 F.3d at 462. \nThis  court  is  persuaded  that  these  remarkably \nconsistent holdings are correct.  The fact that federal \nand  state  law  provide  for  an  administrative  appeals \n18 \n \n\nprocess  does  not  prompt  a  different  conclusion.  \nExhaustion  of  administrative  remedies  available  under \nstate  law--by  either  Doe  or  PPSE--was  not  required \nbefore  Doe  could  file  suit  in  federal  court.    As  she \npoints  out,  the  Eleventh  Circuit,  like  every  other \ncircuit  to  consider  the  issue,  has  concluded  that \nexhaustion  is  not  required  for  claims  under  the \nMedicaid Act.  See Alacare, Inc. North v. Baggiano, 785 \nF.2d 963, 965-67 (11th Cir. 1986) (“The evidence of a \ncongressional  preference  for  imposing  an  exhaustion \nrequirement  in  Medicaid  cases  is  simply \ninevident ... .”  (applying  Patsy  v.  Fla.  Bd.  of \nRegents,  457  U.S.  496  (1982));  see  also  Romano  v. \nGreenstein, 721 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir. 2013); Roach v. \nMorse, 440 F.3d 53, 58 (2d Cir. 2006); Houghton ex rel. \nHoughton v. Reinertson, 382 F.3d 1162, 1167 n.3 (10th \nCir. 2004); Talbot v. Lucy Corr. Nursing Home, 118 F.3d \n215, 220 (4th Cir. 1997).   \nFurther, it is relevant that the letter sent by the \nGovernor  was--as  the  court  determines  below--based  on \n19 \n \n\nan  at-will  termination  clause  in  PPSE’s  provider \nagreement, and not any for-cause ground.  Because the \ntermination letter lacked any substantive basis for the \ntermination  of  the  provider  agreement,  it  is \nquestionable whether meaningful review could have been \nsought  through  the  administrative  process.    The \ndefendants'  argument  that  the  plaintiffs  could  have \nuncovered through the administrative appeal process the \nfor-cause  reason  the  defendants  now  retrospectively \noffer is unpersuasive.  Their argument ignores the fact \nthat the Governor did implicitly identify a basis for \nterminating  the  agreement,  which  was  his  contractual \nauthority to terminate it at will, at any time, without \ngiving any other reason.  This basis for administrative \naction  strikes  the  court  as  a  fundamentally \nunappealable  one,  impervious  to  evidentiary  rebuttal.  \nEven  if  every  factual  allegation  leveled  against  PPSE \nwere  disproven,  the  agency--believing  that  it  was \nempowered to terminate a provider agreement without any \n20 \n \n\nbasis whatsoever in the conduct of the provider--would \nhold a trump card. \nThe defendants argue that a recent decision by the \nSupreme  Court,  Armstrong  v.  Exceptional  Child  Ctr., \nInc., 135 S. Ct. 1378 (2015), warrants reconsideration \nof  the  above  precedents  establishing  that  recipients \nhave  enforceable  rights  under  the \nfree-choice-of-provider  provision.    However,  Armstrong \ndoes  not  cast  significant  doubt  on  this \nnow-well-established proposition.  \nArmstrong  involved  a  challenge  by  providers  to  a \ndifferent  provision  of  the  Medicaid  Act,  42  U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A) (the ‘equal-access’ provision), which \nrequires  state  plans  to  “provide  such  methods  and \nprocedures  relating  to  the  utilization  of,  and  the \npayment  for,  care  and  services  available  under  the \nplan ... as  may  be  necessary  to  safeguard  against \nunnecessary  utilization  of  such  care  and  services  and \nto assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, \neconomy,  and  quality  of  care  and  are  sufficient  to \n21 \n \n\nenlist enough providers so that care and services are \navailable  under  the  plan  at  least  to  the  extent  that \nsuch  care  and  services  are  available  to  the  general \npopulation in the geographic area ... .”  135 S. Ct. at \n1382.  The equal-access provision, the Court observed, \n“lacks  the  sort  of  rights-creating  language  needed  to \nimply a private right of action,” id. at 1387--that is, \njust  the  sort  of  language  that  the \nfree-choice-of-provider  provision  does  contain.    See \nalso Townsend, 2008 WL 2743284, at *8 (drawing the same \ncontrast between § 1396a(a)(23) and § 1396a(a)(30)(A)); \nPlanned Parenthood Gulf Coast, 2015 WL 6122984, at *18 \n(recognizing that the equal-access provision “lacks the \nrights-creating  and  individual-focused  language  so \nprominent in [the free-choice-of-provider provision]”). \nThe Armstrong Court concluded that two aspects of \nthe  equal-access  provision,  considered  together, \n“establish[ed] Congress’s intent to foreclose equitable \nrelief.”    135  S.  Ct.  at  1385  (citation  and  internal \nquotation  marks  omitted).    Only  one  of  these  factors \n22 \n \n\napplies  with  any  force  to  the  free-choice-of-provider \nprovision:  that  the  remedy  Congress  affirmatively \nprovided  for  a  State’s  failure  to  comply  with  the \nprovisions of the Medicaid Act was the withholding of \nfunds  by  the  Secretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  \nId.  (citing  42  U.S.C.  § 1396c).    Critically,  however, \nthe  Court  made  clear  that  “[t]he  provision  for  the \nSecretary’s enforcement by withholding funds might not, \nby  itself,  preclude  the  availability  of  equitable \nrelief.”4  Id. (citing Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy \nv. Stewart, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 1639 n.3 (2011) (“The fact \nthat the Federal Government can exercise oversight of a \nfederal spending program and even withhold or withdraw \n                   \n4. This enforcement provision applies to a number \nof  other  substantive  provisions  of  the  Medicaid  Act, \nmany of which have been repeatedly held to be privately \nenforceable under § 1983.  See, e.g., Bontrager v. Ind. \nFamily & Soc. Servs. Admin., 697 F.3d 604, 606-07 (7th \nCir. 2012) (§ 1396a(a)(10)); Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, \n355-57  (4th  Cir.  2007)  (§ 1396a(a)(8));  S.D.  ex  rel. \nDickson  v.  Hood,  391  F.3d  581,  602-07  (5th  Cir. \n2004)(§ 1396a(a)(10));  Sabree  ex  rel.  Sabree  v. \nRichman,  367  F.3d  180,  182-93  (3d  Cir.  2004) \n(§§ 1396a(a)(8),  1396a(a)(10),  1396a(a)(15));  Gean  v. \nHathaway,  330  F.3d  758,  772-73  (6th  Cir. \n2003)(§ 1396a(a)(3)). \n23 \n \n\nfunds ... does  not  demonstrate  that  Congress  has \ndisplayed  an  intent  not  to  provide  the  more  complete \nand  more  immediate  relief  that  would  otherwise  be \navailable under Ex parte Young[, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)].” \n(citation  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted))).  \nRather,  the  Court  held,  “the  express  provision  of  an \nadministrative  remedy,”  “when  combined  with  the \njudicially unadministrable nature” of the equal-access \nprovision,  demonstrated  that  private  enforcement  was \nprecluded.    Armstrong,  135  S.  Ct.  at  1385  (emphasis \nadded). \nThe  equal-access  provision  at  issue  in  Armstrong \nand the free-choice-of-provider provision at issue here \ncould hardly be more different with respect to judicial \nadministrability.    “It  is  difficult  to  imagine  a \nrequirement  broader  and  less  specific  than”  the  \nequal-access  provision’s  “judgment-laden  standard.”  \nId.  By contrast, the free-choice-of-provider provision \narticulates  “concrete  and  objective  standards  for \nenforcement.”    Planned  Parenthood  Ariz.,  727  F.3d  at \n24 \n \n\n967 (citation omitted).  For example, to adjudicate a \nclaim  under  the  equal-access  provision,  a  court  might \nbe required to determine whether a particular procedure \nwas  “necessary  to  safeguard  against  unnecessary \nutilization”  of  covered  care--a  near-impossible  task.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A).  To decide a claim under \nthe  free-choice-of-provider  provision,  however,  does \nnot  demand  that  the  court  obtain  a  crash-course  in \nhealth-systems  administration;  determining  that  a \nprovider  is  “qualified  to  perform  [a]  service ... and \nundertakes to provide [] such service[]” is well within \na  court’s  competence.    Id.    If,  as  the  defendants \ncontend, States had free rein to define ‘qualified’ in \nwhatever ways they wished, deciding a claim under the \nfree-choice-of-provider  provision  might  indeed  be  a \nmore  difficult,  and  perhaps  ‘judgment-laden’  task.  \nHowever,  the  court  rejects  this  expansive  reading; \n“qualified to perform the service or services required” \nmeans  just  what  the  plain  language  says:  having \n“competency  and  professional  standing  as  a  medical \n25 \n \n\nprovider generally.”  Planned Parenthood of Ariz., 727 \nF.3d at 967-69; Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at \n978 (“If the states are free to set any qualifications \nthey  want--no  matter  how  unrelated  to  the  provider’s \nfitness  to  treat  Medicaid  patients--then  the \nfree-choice-of-provider  requirement  could  be  easily \nundermined by simply labeling any exclusionary rule as \na  ‘qualification.’  This  would  open  a  significant \nloophole for restricting patient choice, contradicting \nthe broad access to medical care that § 1396a(a)(23) is \nmeant to preserve.”). \n  Doe,  as  a  recipient  of  Medicaid  benefits  and  a \npatient of PPSE, has pleaded a viable cause of action.  \nShe  is  entitled  to  bring  an  enforcement  action  under \n§ 1983 to vindicate her right to receive care from any \nqualified  (and  willing)  provider  under  the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision. \nThis  conclusion  is  particularly  well-supported  by \nthe  statute  in  the  context  of  the  family-planning \nservices at issue here.  Although the Medicaid Act does \n26 \n \n\npermit  States  to  limit  a  recipient’s  free  choice  of \nprovider  in  certain  ways  when  she  is  enrolled  in  a \nmanaged-care plan,5 the statute is clear that the State \nstill “shall not restrict the choice of the qualified \nperson  from  whom  the  individual  may  receive  services \nunder  section  1396d(a)(4)(C)  of  this  title,”  which \npertains  to  “family  planning  services  and  supplies.”  \n42  U.S.C.  § 1396a(a)(23)(B).    Congress  saw  fit  to \nidentify  family  planning  as  the  area  of  medical  care \nwith  respect  to  which  a  recipient’s  free  choice  of \nprovider was most critical.  It is not hard to imagine \nwhy--just  as  business  owners  do,  healthcare  providers \nand  Medicaid  recipients  have  widely  varying  “honest \nconviction[s]”  about  the  appropriateness  of  different \nfamily-planning  methods.    See  Burwell  v.  Hobby  Lobby \nStores,  Inc.,  134  S.  Ct.  2751,  2779  (2014)  (citation \nomitted).  Congress presumably intended to ensure that \nwomen  who  receive  Medicaid  benefits  would  be  able  to \n                   \n5. Neither party has suggested that Doe is enrolled \nin such a plan. \n27 \n \n\nreceive  care  from  a  provider  whose  perspectives  on \nfamily planning were aligned with her own. \n  One final point bears discussing.  The Governor and \nthe  Acting  Commissioner  argue  that  no \nfree-choice-of-provider  claim  can  be  brought,  whether \nby a provider or a recipient, when the State terminates \nan  individual  provider  agreement  pursuant  to \n§ 1396a(p)(1)  (the  ‘exclusion’  provision).    This  is, \nthey  emphasize  in  their  brief,  because  such \nterminations  are  an  exception  to  the  requirement  that \nStates must give recipients a free choice of qualified \nproviders.6    The  court  understands  this  argument  as \n                   \n6.  For  the  first  time  at  oral  argument,  the \ndefendants  hinted  at  a  different  argument--that  in \nterminating  PPSE  under  the  exclusion  provision,  they \nhave “effectively” rendered it (or recognized it to be) \nunqualified for purposes of the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Tr. Hr’g Mot. Prelim. Inj. 26, doc. no. 44. \n \nHowever, the defendants cannot have it both ways.  \nIf they rely on the exclusion provision as an exception \nto  the  free-choice-of-provider  provision,  they  are \nnecessarily  conceding  that  an  exception  is  necessary \nbecause the rule applies; that is, because PPSE cannot \nbe  terminated  as  unqualified.    Then,  the  court  must \ndetermine (as it does, below) whether Doe has a right \n(continued…) \n28 \n \n\nfollows:  The  exclusion  provision  permits  States  to \nterminate  a  provider  agreement  for  at  least  some \nreasons  other  than  that  the  provider  is  not \n‘qualified.’    When  a  State  terminates  a  qualified \nprovider for one of these reasons, the argument goes, a \nrecipient is not entitled to choose to receive covered \ncare  from  that  provider,  despite  the  fact  that  it  is \nqualified.  This  is  true,  but  of  little  help  to  the \ndefendants’ case.  There plainly are some reasons that \na  State  may  terminate  a  provider  agreement  under  the \nexclusion  provision  other  than  the  provider  being \nunqualified.    (Whether  a  State  may  do  so  based  on \nreasons  wholly  unrelated  to  the  purposes  of  the \n                                                         \nto  challenge  PPSE’s  termination  under  the  exclusion \nprovision, and whether the termination was proper under \nthe terms of that provision.   \n \nIf  instead  defendants  were  to  contend  that  they \nterminated  PPSE  because  it  was  unqualified,  the  court \nwould have to consider whether Doe could challenge the \ntermination on those grounds, and whether the State is \nfree to determine, without giving any reason related to \nthe services it provides, that PPSE is unqualified.  As \nthe 6th, 7th, and 9th Circuits have held, the answers \nto these questions are clearly “yes” and “no.”  \n29 \n \n\nMedicaid  Act  will  be  discussed  below.)    Additionally, \nproviders  who  have  been  properly  excluded  from  a \nState’s Medicaid program under the exclusion provision \ndo fall within an “exception[]” to a recipient’s right \nto  choose  any  qualified  provider.    Planned  Parenthood \nAriz.,  727  F.3d  at  973.  But  here,  Doe  does  not  argue \nthat the free-choice-of-provider provision entitles her \nto choose a provider that was rightfully excluded for, \nsay,  claim  fraud  under  42  U.S.C.  § 1320a-7a(a)  (a \nground  for  exclusion  by  a  State  under  the  exclusion \nprovision),  yet  is  nonetheless  fully  qualified  to \nprovide  her  care;  that  grievance  would  not  be \nactionable under the free-choice-of-provider provision.  \nRather,  Doe  alleges  that  her  qualified  provider  of \nchoice, PPSE, was wrongfully removed from the pool of \nproviders  among  whom  she  has  a  right  to  choose.  \nIndeed, Doe argues not only that there exists no basis \nin fact for PPSE’s termination, but also that PPSE was \nexcluded  on  a  basis  which,  as  a  matter  of  law,  falls \noutside the exclusion-provision exception. \n30 \n \n\nIf  a  State  could  defeat  a  Medicaid  recipient’s \nright  to  select  a  particular  qualified  healthcare \nprovider merely by terminating its agreement with that \nprovider  on  an  unlawful  basis,  the  right  would  be \ntotally  eviscerated.    If  the  Governor  and  the  Acting \nCommissioner  were  correct  that  allegedly  unlawful \nterminations  of  provider  agreements  could  not  be \nchallenged  by  recipients  pursuant  to  the \nfree-choice-of-provider  provision,  that  provision’s \n“individual entitlement,” the “personal right” it gives \nrecipients, would be an empty one.7  Planned Parenthood \n                   \n7. O’Bannon is not to the contrary.  In O’Bannon, \nthe  Court  held  that  the  free-choice-of-provider \nprovision  did  not  give  residents  of  a  nursing  home  a \ndue-process right to a pre-deprivation hearing when the \nState,  after  an  audit,  determined  that  their  nursing \nhome  no  longer  met  specific  federal  “statutory  and \nregulatory  standards  for  skilled  nursing  facilities” \nand  terminated  its  Medicaid  provider  agreement.    447 \nU.S. at 775-76, 785.  O’Bannon is inapposite here for \ntwo  reasons.    First,  as  the  Seventh  Circuit  put  it, \n“[t]his is not a due-process case.  Planned Parenthood \nand its patient[] are not suing for violation of their \nprocedural rights; they are making a substantive claim \nthat  [the  termination  of  the  provider  agreement] \nviolates  [the  free-choice-of-provider  provision].”  \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 977.  Even more \n(continued…) \n31 \n \n\nof  Ind.,  699  F.3d  at  974;  Harris,  442  F.3d  at  461 \n(citation  omitted).    See  also  Pls.’  Ex.  S,  United \nStates’  Statement  of  Interest  in  Planned  Parenthood \nGulf Coast, Inc. v. Kliebert 7 n.3, doc. no. 7-1 (“[The \nfree-choice-of-provider provision] is violated whenever \na  beneficiary  is  denied  her  right  to  receive  covered \nMedicaid services from ‘any’ qualified provider of her \nchoice  willing  to  provide  the  services;  it  does  not \nmatter  whether  that  provider  was  excluded  from  the \nMedicaid  program  on  an  individualized  or  class-wide \nbasis.”). \n \n2. At-Will Termination \n                                                         \nbasically, as discussed in greater detail below, PPSE’s \ntermination  letter  included  no  basis  for  the  decision \nthat could even plausibly be construed as relating to \nits “competency and professional standing as a medical \nprovider  generally.”    Planned  Parenthood  Ariz.,  727 \nF.3d at 969.  O’Bannon held that a Medicaid recipient \nhas  no  due-process  right  to  a  hearing  before  his \nunqualified nursing home’s agreement is terminated; it \ndoes  not  stand  for  the  proposition  that  any  time  a \nState terminates a Medicaid provider agreement, for any \nreason  or  for  no  reason  at  all,  that  decision  is \ninsulated  from  substantive  review  at  the  behest  of \nrecipients. \n32 \n \n\nAlthough  the  parties  in  this  case  have  presented \nsignificant  evidence  regarding  the  motivation  for  and \nvalidity of the Governor’s decision to terminate PPSE’s \nprovider agreement, the court need not delve into it.  \nThis  is  because  the  termination  letter  sent  by  the \nGovernor  was  clearly  based  on  the  at-will  termination \nprovision in PPSE’s provider agreement. \nThe  letter  sent  by  the  Governor  to  PPSE  did  not \nprovide a substantive reason or statutory basis for the \ntermination  of  its  provider  agreement.    Rather,  it \nsimply stated that “[p]ursuant to the Alabama Medicaid \nAgency  Provider  Agreement  under  section  IV.  Term, \nAmendment,  and  Termination,  the  Agency  is  exercising \nits ability to terminate the existing agreement(s) with \nPlanned  Parenthood  Southeast,  Inc.  with  fifteen  (15) \ndays written notice.  The termination of the provider \nagreement(s)  with  Planned  Parenthood  Southeast,  Inc. \nwill  be  effective  fifteen  (15)  days  after  receipt  of \nthis letter.”  Pls.’ Ex. 1, doc. no. 1-1. \n33 \n \n\nSection IV of the provider agreement sets forth two \ndifferent methods of termination.  First, it sets forth \nan  at-will  termination  provision:  “Either  party  may \nterminate  this  Agreement  by  providing  the  other  party \nwith fifteen (15) days written notice.”  Defs.’ Ex. 16, \nat 24, doc. no. 28-16.  Second, it sets forth a for-\ncause termination provision: “MEDICAID may immediately \nterminate  the  Agreement  for  cause  if  the  Provider  is \nexcluded from the Medicare or Medicaid programs for any \nreason,  loses  its  licenses  or  certificates,  becomes \nineligible  for  participation  in  the  Medicaid  program, \nfails to comply with the provisions of this Agreement, \nor if the Provider is or may be placing the health and \nsafety of recipients at risk.”  Id. at 5. \nAlong with the failure to articulate any specific \ncause  for  the  termination,  the  15-day  delay  clearly \nindicates that the Governor and the Acting Commissioner \nterminated  PPSE’s  provider  agreement  not  under  the \nfor-cause termination provision, but instead under the \nat-will  termination  provision.    This  assessment  is \n34 \n \n\ncorroborated by the fact that the letter sent to PPSE \nwould  have  been  inadequate  to  effectuate  a  for-cause \ntermination,  because  it  failed  to  provide  the  notice \nrequired  by  federal  law.8    “In  order  to  exclude  a \nprovider under [the exclusion provision], a state must \ngive the provider to be excluded notice of the state’s \nintent to exclude, 42 C.F.R. § 1002.212 ... .”  Planned \nParenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Betlach, 899 F. Supp. 2d 868, \n882  (D.  Ariz.  2012)  (Wake,  J.).    Specifically, \n§ 1002.212  requires  States  to  give  providers  whose \nagreements are terminated “notification consistent with \nsubpart E of part 1001 of this chapter,” which in turn \nrequires  that  such  notice  include  “the  basis  of  the \nexclusion.”    42  C.F.R.  § 1001.2002(c).    Although  the \nGovernor  made  public  statements  via  Twitter  regarding \n                   \n8.  This  failure  to  provide  adequate  notice  of  a \nfor-cause  ground  for  termination  illustrates  vividly \nwhy  PPSE’s  failure  to  pursue  an  administrative  appeal \nhas  no  bearing  on  the  outcome  of  this  case.    The \npurpose of giving a provider notice of the reason for \ntermination of its agreement is obvious: so that it can \nsubmit  evidence  and  argument  to  meaningfully  contest \nthe  agency’s  determination.    When  no  reason  has  been \narticulated, an appeal becomes a sham. \n35 \n \n\nhis  decision  to  terminate  PPSE’s  provider  agreement, \n‘tweets’ are plainly not an acceptable form of notice. \nHence,  the  narrow  question  before  the  court  is \nwhether the Medicaid Act allows a State to terminate a \nprovider  agreement  based  on  no  reason  other  than  the \nexistence  of  a  contractual  at-will  termination \nprovision like the one in PPSE’s.  The answer to that \nnarrow question is “no.” \nThe Governor and the Acting Commissioner argue that \nAlabama  is  empowered  to  terminate  Medicaid  provider \nagreements  on  any  basis  recognized  under  state  law \n(including,  as  relevant  in  this  case,  state  contract \nlaw).  This authorization, they suggest, comes from the \nfirst clause of the exclusion provision, which states: \n“In  addition  to  any  other  authority,  a  State  may \nexclude  any  individual  or  entity  for  purposes  of \nparticipating  under  the  State  plan  under  this \nsubchapter for any reason for which the Secretary could \nexclude the individual or entity from participation in \n[Medicare under the for-cause bases listed in] section \n36 \n \n\n1320a-7, 1320a-7a, or 1395cc(b)(2) of this title.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1) (emphasis added). \nHowever,  this  clause  of  the  exclusion  provision \ndoes  not  give  States  carte  blanche;  the  defendants \n“read[] the phrase for more than it’s worth.”  Planned \nParenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 979.  It is true that \nStates  have  the  “authority  to  suspend  or  to  exclude \nproviders  from  state  health  care  programs  for  reasons \nother  than  those  upon  which  the  Secretary  of  [Health \nand Human Services] has authority to act.”  Guzman v. \nShewry,  552  F.3d  941,  949  (9th  Cir.  2009).    But  this \nauthority is not unbounded.  As the Seventh and Ninth \nCircuits  have  concluded,  the  exclusion  provision  is  a \n“standard  savings  clause  [which]  ‘signals  only  that \nwhat  follows  is  a  non-exclusive  list’  and  ‘does  not \nimply  that  the  states  have  an  unlimited  authority  to \nexclude providers for any reason whatsoever.’”  Planned \nParenthood  Ariz.,  727  F.3d  at  972  (citing  Planned \nParenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 979).  “[T]he Medicaid \nAct itself must provide that ‘other’ authority, just as \n37 \n \n\nit supplies the ‘authority’ covered by the rest of the \nsubsection.    Were  it  otherwise--were  states  free  to \nexclude  providers  as  they  see  fit--then  the  bulk  of \n§ 1396a(p)(1)  itself  would  be  unnecessary,  as  the \n‘authority’ it supplies would be superfluous.”  Planned \nParenthood Ariz., 727 F.3d at 972. \nThe  Governor  and  the  Acting  Commissioner’s  broad \nreading  of  the  exclusion  provision  is  therefore  “not \nplausible.”  Planned Parenthood Ariz., 899 F. Supp. 2d \nat  882.  “If  a  state  could  rely  on  [the  exclusion \nprovision]  to  exclude ... providers  for  any \nnon-arbitrary  reason,  then  the  remainder  of  the \nexceptions,  which  carefully  set  forth  circumstances \nunder which the Secretary and states have authority to \nexclude  providers,  would  be  unnecessary.    Such  an \ninterpretation  undermines  the  cardinal  rule  of \nstatutory  interpretation  that  no  provision  [of  a \nstatute] should be construed to be entirely redundant.”  \nId.  at  882-83  (citation  and  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted)  (discussing,  as  an  example,  42  U.S.C. \n38 \n \n\n§ 1396n(b)(4), which allows the Secretary of Health and \nHuman  Services  to  waive  the  free-choice-of-provider \nrequirement, but only when a State limits choice based \non standards that “are consistent with access, quality, \nand  efficient  and  economic  provision  of  covered  care \nand services”). \nThe Governor and the Acting Commissioner also cite \nthe regulation implementing the exclusion provision and \nthe provision’s legislative history in support of their \nclaim.    42  C.F.R.  § 1002.2  states:  “Nothing  contained \nin this part should be construed to limit a State’s own \nauthority  to  exclude  an  individual  or  entity  from \nMedicaid for any reason or period authorized by State \nlaw.”    However,  a  close  reading  reveals  that  “[t]hat \nprovision is only a limitation on interpretation of the \nreferenced ‘part’ of the regulations--Title 42, Chapter \nV,  Subchapter  B,  Part  1002--which  does  not  encompass \nthe  free-choice-of-provider  requirement.”    Planned \nParenthood  Ariz.,  727  F.3d  at  972  n.8.    Although  the \nlegislative  history  of  the  provision  includes  a  note \n39 \n \n\nstating  that  it  “is  not  intended  to  preclude  a  State \nfrom establishing, under State law, any other bases for \nexcluding  individuals  or  entities  from  its  Medicaid \nprogram,” S. Rep. No. 100-109, at 20 (1987), reprinted \nin  1987  U.S.C.C.A.N.  682,  700,  this  note  makes  clear \nonly  that  a  State  may  establish  other  bases  for \nexclusion,  not  what  limits  exist  on  a  State’s \ndiscretion in doing so.  The legislative history itself \nsuggests  those  limits,  in  explaining  that  the \n“overarching purpose of [the exclusion provision] is to \ngrant  authority  to  exclude  a  provider  based  on  the \nprovider’s  quality  of  services ... .”    Planned \nParenthood Ariz., 899 F. Supp. 2d at 882-83 (citing S. \nRep.  No.  100-109  (1987),  at  1-2,  reprinted  in  1987 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 682, 700). \nIf  a  State  were  free  to  terminate  a  provider \nagreement  for  any  reason  with  a  basis  in  state  law, \nrecipients’  free-choice-of-provider  rights  would  be \n“greatly weakened,” and “subject to state policies and \npolitics  having  nothing  to  do  with  the  Medicaid \n40 \n \n\nprogram.”  Id.  An at-will termination clause might (or \nmight not) defeat a provider's right to challenge such \na  decision  on  appeal,  but  it  has  no  effect  on  a \nrecipient's rights; after all, \"Jane Doe[] [is] not [a] \npart[y]  to  the  agreement[]  cited.\"  Planned  Parenthood \nArk. & E. Okla., slip op. at 25. \nBecause  the  enumerated  statutory  bases  for \nexcluding  providers  cross-referenced  in  the  exclusion \nprovision involve “various forms of malfeasance such as \nfraud,  drug  crimes,  and  failure  to  disclose  necessary \ninformation to regulators,” Planned Parenthood of Ind., \n699 F.3d at 979, the provision’s ‘any other authority’ \nclause, when “[r]ead in context, ... reaffirm[s] state \nauthority  to  exclude  individual  providers  pursuant  to \nanalogous  state  law  provisions  relating  to  fraud  and \nmisconduct,”  but  does  not  give  States  license  to \nterminate provider agreements “on grounds unrelated to \nmedical  competency  or  legal  and  ethical  propriety.”  \nPlanned Parenthood Ariz., 727 F.3d at 972. \n41 \n \n\nThe  state-law  ground  on  which  the  Governor \nterminated  PPSE’s  provider  agreement--the  at-will \ntermination  clause--falls  well  outside  the  range  of \ngrounds  germane  to  the  purposes  of  the  Medicaid  Act.  \nSee  also  Pls.’  Ex.

For-Cause Termination \nHad this termination been for cause, it would have \nbeen  necessary  for  the  court  to  consider  whether  the \nreasons of which PPSE would have been given notice were \nsufficient  to  support  the  termination  of  its  provider \nagreement.    Because  the  Governor  and  the  Acting \nCommissioner  have  retrospectively  (and  belatedly) \narticulated a for-cause ground that they believe would \nsupport such an action, the court turns now, briefly, \nto whether, on the record before the court, they would \nhave  been  justified  in  terminating  the  agreement  on \nthat basis. \nIn  their  brief  opposing  the  motion  for  a \npreliminary  injunction,  the  defendants  identified  the \nfollowing  ground  for  excluding  PPSE:  that  it  is  an \n“entity  that  the  [State]  determines ... has \nfurnished ... services  to  patients ... of  a  quality \nwhich fails to meet professionally recognized standards \nof  health  care.”    42  U.S.C.  § 1320a-7(b)(6)(B).  \nSpecifically,  they  assert  that  statements  in  a  video \n43 \n \n\npurporting  to  describe  the  practices  of  some  PPFA \naffiliates  with  respect  to  fetal-tissue  donation  run \nafoul  of  “safeguards”  prescribed  by  the  American \nMedical Association.  See Am. Med. Assoc. Code on Med. \nEthics,  Op.  2.161  (last  updated  June  1996)  (doc.  no. \n28-7).    According  to  the  defendants,  this  video  gave \nthe Governor reason to be concerned that (1) “decisions \nregarding  the  technique  used  to  induce  abortion”  by \npractitioners at some PPFA affiliates were being based \nin part on a desire to obtain intact tissue samples and \ntherefore not exclusively on “concern for the safety of \nthe  pregnant  woman,”  and  (2)  that  “fetal  tissue  is \n[being] provided in exchange for financial remuneration \nabove  that  which  is  necessary  to  cover  reasonable \nexpenses.”  Id. \nIf there was any indication--allegation, even--that \nPPSE had itself provided substandard care in these or \nany  other  ways,  various  questions  would  arise  with \nrespect  to  the  applicability  of  § 1320a-7(b)(6)(B) \nregarding  the  quality  of  care.    The  court  would  be \n44 \n \n\ncompelled to examine a number of issues: the amount of \nevidence  required  to  terminate  for  failure  to  meet \nprofessionally recognized standards of healthcare, the \ntype of evidence such a showing would require, whether \nabortion procedures had actually been altered in such a \nway  as  to  pose  any  additional  risks  to  women,  and \nwhether providers had actually received remuneration in \nexcess of reasonable expenses.  \nHowever, the court has not assessed the strength of \nthe ‘evidence’ in the videos because it is beside the \npoint.    PPSE  states  that  it  does  not  engage  in \nfetal-tissue  donation  at  all.    It  offers  evidence  to \nthis  effect,  and  the  defendants  do  not  contest  the \npoint.    Rather,  they  argue  that  the  practices--\nspecifically,  (alleged)  ethical  violations--of \nseparately incorporated organizations in other regions \nwith  which  PPSE  is  affiliated  are  properly  attributed \nto PPSE.  The court disagrees. \nFirst,  when  considered  together,  the  exclusion \nprovision  (§ 1396a(p)(1))  and  § 1320a-7(b)(6)(B),  the \n45 \n \n\nfor-cause  ground  cited  by  the  defendants,  make  clear \nthat  the  “entity”  that  “a  State  may  exclude”  must  be \nthe  same  “entity  that  the  [State]  determines  ...  has \nfurnished  ...  services  to  patients  ...  of  a  quality \nwhich fails to meet professionally recognized standards \nof  health  care.”    This  is  because  the  exclusion \nprovision  authorizes  the  State  to  exclude  “any  ... \nentity” if the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n“could  exclude  the  ...  entity  under  ...  section \n1320a-7 ... .”    (emphasis  added).    It  is  a  basic \nprinciple  of  legislative  drafting  that  the  definite \narticle (“the”) is used in place of “such” to mean “the \npreviously mentioned.”  See Lawrence E. Filson & Sandra \nL.  Strokoff,  The  Legislative  Drafter’s  Desk  Reference \n228  (2d  ed.).    It  is  evident  from  the  termination \nletter that the ‘entity’ the State has “exclude[d]” is \nPPSE--the entity with which it entered into, and then \nterminated,  a  provider  agreement.    See  § 1396a(p)(3) \n(defining  the  term  “exclude”  to  mean  “the  refusal  to \nenter  into  or  renew  a  participation  agreement  or  the \n46 \n \n\ntermination  of  such  an  agreement”).    Therefore,  the \ntermination  is  authorized  by  the  provision  the  State \ncites  only  to  the  extent  that  this  entity--PPSE--has \nfurnished substandard care. \nSecond,  when  § 1320a-7(b)(6)(B)  is  read  in  the \ncontext  of  other  enumerated  for-cause  termination \ngrounds, it is apparent that it was intended to apply \nto only services furnished by the provider itself, and \nnot to any services furnished by affiliates.  Another \nprovision does permit the exclusion of an entity based \non  affiliation,  but  only  when  the  affiliated \nperson--who  must  have  been  sanctioned  under  the \nMedicaid  Act--has  an  ownership  or  control  interest  in \nthe  entity  or  is  an  officer,  director,  agent,  or \nmanaging  employee  of  the  entity.    42  U.S.C.  § 1320a-\n7(b)(8).    Congress’s  inclusion  of  that  provision \nstrongly  suggests  that  § 1320a-7(b)(6)(B)  was  not \nintended to allow for the termination of one entity’s \nagreement  on  the  basis  of  the  infractions  of  another \nparty in the absence of ownership, control, management, \n47 \n \n\nor  an  agency  relationship.9    The  defendants  do  not \nclaim, and the evidence does not suggest, that PPSE has \nsuch  a  close  connection  with  any  of  the  affiliates \ndepicted  in  the  video.    See  also  Planned  Parenthood \nArk.  &  E.  Okla.,  slip  op.  at  27-28  (rejecting  the \n\"contention  that  Planned  Parenthood  Federation  of \nAmerica and its affiliates function as a unified whole, \nand  thus,  that  the  acts  of  one  affiliate  may  be \nattributed to all other affiliates\"). \nThe Governor and the Acting Commissioner also seek \nto  place  the  policies  of  PPFA  at  issue,  arguing  that \nbecause  PPSE  has  “agree[d]  to  certain  standards  and \npolicies which are contained in the by-laws of PPFA[,]” \nPlanned  Parenthood  Fed’n  of  Am.,  Inc.  v.  Problem \nPregnancy of Worcester, Inc., 498 N.E.2d 1044, 1048-49 \n                   \n9. Section 1320a-7(b)(8), unlike most of the other \npermissive  for-cause  exclusion  grounds  enumerated  in \n§ 1320a-7(b), applies to only those entities controlled \nby  a  sanctioned  “individual”--not  “individual  or \nentity.”  However, this strengthens rather than weakens \nthe  conclusion  that  Congress  did  not  intend  to  allow \nfor exclusion in cases where an entity is controlled in \npart by a sanctioned entity.  Had the drafters of the \nstatute intended to do so, they knew how. \n48 \n \n\n(Mass.  1986),  PPFA’s  involvement  in  the  allegedly \nunethical practices of other affiliates is attributable \nto  PPSE  and  constitutes  cause  to  exclude  it  under \n§ 1320a-7(b)(6)(B).    This  might  be  a  persuasive \nargument  if  the  defendants  had  claimed--much  less \ndemonstrated--that  PPFA  had  adopted  and  enforced  a \npolicy  requiring  that  all  affiliates  engage  in \nfetal-tissue  donation,  alter  abortion  procedures  to \nbetter  preserve  intact  specimens,  and  accept \ncompensation in excess of costs.  But they have argued \nno such thing.  Even construing the defendants’ factual \nallegations generously--and setting aside the question \nof evidentiary support--they suggest at most that PPFA \nhas  supported  the  decisions  of  some  affiliates  to \nengage in these practices.  There is no evidence that \nPPFA  requires  affiliates  to  engage  in  fetal-tissue \ndonation  at  all,  much  less  in  unethical  donation \npractices.    What  PPFA  permits  other  affiliates  to  do \n49 \n \n\ntherefore has no bearing on PPSE, which, to reiterate, \nhas elected not to engage in fetal-tissue donation.10 \n                   \n10.  The  defendants  reference  a  letter  from  the \npresident  of  PPFA  to  Congress,  which  they  argue \n“underscores  the  unity  of  the  organization.”    Defs.’ \nBr. in Opp’n 37, doc. no. 29 (citing Defs.’ Ex. 8, at \n3, doc. no. 28-8).  But the letter does not help their \ncase;  it  makes  clear  that  PPFA  has  “policies  and \npractices  that  guide  the  affiliates  that  offer  tissue \ndonation services.”  Id.  These policies and practices \nare inapplicable to PPSE, which does not. \n \nNor does the odd assortment of cases cited in the \ndefendants’  brief,  all  of  which  deal  with  corporate \nrelationships  not  applicable  here,  aid  their  cause.  \nNone of these decisions stands for the proposition that \none  corporation  can  be  held  responsible  for  the \npolicies  of  an  umbrella  organization  regarding  a \npractice that other affiliated corporations engage in.  \nIn  re  Phenylpropanolamine  (PPC)  Prods.  Liab.  Litig., \n344  F.  Supp.  2d  686,  691-92  (W.D.  Wash.  2003) \n(Rothstein,  J.),  discusses  whether  a  court  can  obtain \npersonal  jurisdiction  over  a  parent  corporation  based \non  the  subsidiary  corporation’s  forum  contacts.    \nMoreover, In re Phenylpropanolamine itself states that \nthe contacts of a subsidiary will not be imputed to the \nparent simply because of the parent’s “articulation of \ngeneral  policies  and  procedures.”    Id.  (citing  United \nStates v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 72 (1998).  Bowoto v. \nChevron Texaco Corp., 312 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1237 (N.D. \nCal.  2004)  (Illston,  J.),  which  concerns  piercing  of \nthe  corporate  veil  for  tort-liability  purposes,  is \nlikewise  concerned  with  attribution  of  a  subsidiary’s \nacts to the parent corporation.

Irreparable Injury \nOn  her  Medicaid  Act  claim,  Doe  argues  that  she \nfaces  irreparable  injury  without  an  injunction.    She \nhas  made  a  showing  of  a  substantial  threat  of \nirreparable  injury  sufficient  to  satisfy  the \npreliminary-injunction standard.  Because she has made \n                                                         \nBestfoods,  524  U.S.  at  61  (explaining  that  “parent \ncorporation[s]  [are]  so-called  because  of  control  of \nownership of another corporation’s stock”).  Browning-\nFerris Indus. of Cal., Inc., No. 32-RC-109684, 2015 WL \n5047768, at *1-2 (N.L.R.B. Aug. 27, 2015), is no more \non point, in that it involves the statutorily derived \nand  therefore  inapplicable  “standard  for  assessing \njoint-employer  status  under  the  National  Labor \nRelations Act.”  Finally, the trademark cases cited in \nthe defendants’ brief merely stand for the proposition \nthat  affiliates  who  share  a  mark  with  a  national \norganization  will  generally  have  consistent  policies \nand standards. \n \n51 \n \n\nsuch  a  showing,  it  is  unnecessary  to  consider  any \nirreparable harm to PPSE.11 \nThe plaintiffs rely on Doe’s inability to continue \nreceiving  medical  care  at  PPSE,  specifically  at  the \nBirmingham  clinic,  where  she  goes  every  three  months \nfor a Depo-Provera shot.  Doe states that she “strongly \n                   \n11. Because Doe has shown virtually certain success \non the merits of her Medicaid Act claim, her required \nshowing as to irreparable injury may be lessened. The \nformer  Fifth  Circuit  used  a  “sliding  scale”  standard \nwhen  evaluating  whether  to  issue  a  temporary \nrestraining  order  or  preliminary  injunction.  See  Siff \nv.  State  Democratic  Executive  Comm.,  500  F.2d  1307, \n1309 (5th Cir. 1974) (explaining that “a sliding scale \nmust  be  applied  in  considering  the  probability  of \nplaintiffs’  winning  on  the  merits  and  plaintiffs’ \nirreparable  injury  in  the  absence  of  interlocutory \nrelief”);  see  also  State  of  Tex.  v.  Seatrain  Int'l, \nS.A., 518 F.2d 175, 180 (5th Cir. 1975) (“[N]one of the \nfour  prerequisites  has  a  fixed  quantitative  value. \nRather, a sliding scale is utilized, which takes into \naccount the intensity of each in a given calculus.”).  \nThe  Eleventh  Circuit  has  adopted  as  precedent  all \ndecisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to \nOctober  1,  1981,  and  all  Former  Fifth  Circuit  Unit  B \nand non-unit decisions rendered after October 1, 1981. \nSee  Stein  v.  Reynolds  Secur.,  Inc.,  667  F.2d  33,  34 \n(11th Cir. 1982); Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d \n1206,  1207  (11th  Cir.  1981)  (en  banc).    While  the \nEleventh  Circuit  has  not  explicitly  referred  to  this \nsliding-scale  standard,  even  a  more  rigid  requirement \nthat movants meet a certain threshold as to each prong \nof the test--does not demand a different result.   \n52 \n \n\nprefer[s]” receiving care from PPSE, as opposed to from \na private doctor.  Pls.’ Ex. 1, Declaration of Jane Doe \n2,  doc.  no.  31-1.    She  further  states  that  she  would \ntry to locate another provider if she could not obtain \ncovered care there, but does not know where she would \ngo.  She is due to receive another contraceptive shot \nthis  month.    PPSE  represents  that,  due  to  the \ntermination, it is being forced to turn away Medicaid \npatients.    If  Doe  attempted  to  return  to  PPSE  to \nreceive her shot, she would be turned away. \nThe Governor and the Acting Commissioner argue that \nDoe  can  entirely  mitigate  any  harm  by  seeking  care \nelsewhere.  In particular, they point to the existence \nof  numerous  Medicaid  providers  within  five  miles  of \nPPSE’s  Birmingham  clinic.    As  the  Seventh  Circuit \nrecognized  in  Planned  Parenthood  of  Indiana,  however, \n“[t]his  argument  misses  the  mark.”    699  F.3d  at  981.  \nIn that case, the court affirmed the district court’s \nissuance of a preliminary injunction on the plaintiffs’ \nMedicaid Act claim, reasoning that the fact “[t]hat a \n53 \n \n\nrange  of  qualified  providers  remains  available  is \nbeside  the  point.    [The  ‘free-choice-of-provider’ \nprovision] gives Medicaid patients the right to receive \nmedical  assistance  from  the  provider  of  their  choice \nwithout  state  interference ... .”    Id.  at  981.  \nAlthough  Doe  can  seek  family-planning  services \nelsewhere, this does not diminish the injury that will \nresult  from  her  inability  to  see  the  provider  of  her \nchoice.  See Planned Parenthood Ark. & E. Okla., slip \nop. at 22 (concluding, in a similar case, that “denial \nof ... freedom  of  choice  is  more  likely  than  not \nexactly  the  injury  Congress  sought  to  avoid  when  it \nenacted  [the  free-choice-of-provider  provision]”).  \nThat  Doe  will  be  forced  to  seek  out  a  replacement \nprovider within such a short span of time--and may even \nface  a  long  wait  for  an  appointment,  making  it \ndifficult  to  adhere  to  her  current  Depo-Provera \nregimen--makes this harm especially imminent.   \nFurther,  there  is  no  adequate  remedy  at  law  for \nthis  injury.    The  Supreme  Court  has  stated  that  the \n54 \n \n\nlack of any legal remedy is a central consideration in \nthe  irreparable-injury  analysis.    See  Sampson  v. \nMurray,  415  U.S.  61,  88-89  (1974).    Without  the \ninjunction,  Doe  would  be  forced  to  stop  seeking \nservices from a provider with whom she is comfortable, \nand  she  might  well  not  be  able  to  identify  another \nprovider with whom she could forge such a relationship.  \nSuch an injury is clearly not susceptible to monetary \nrelief.  Doe has therefore demonstrated that she faces \na  substantial  threat  of  irreparable  injury  absent  the \nissuance of an injunction. \n \nC. Other Preliminary-Injunction Considerations \nThe  balance  of  harms  and  the  public  interest \nlikewise  favor  issuance  of  a  preliminary  injunction.  \nAs discussed above, Doe will face significant harm if \nan  injunction  does  not  issue.    The  Governor  and  the \nActing Commissioner rely on the videos’ claims that the \nfetal-tissue donation programs of some PPFA affiliates \nbreach  ethical  standards  to  argue  that  the  continued \n55 \n \n\nfunding  of  PPSE  through  taxpayer  dollars  would  itself \ncause  an  injury  to  the  State.    This  argument  is  not \npersuasive  because  the  defendants  do  not  dispute  the \nplaintiffs’  assertions--or  the  evidence  in  the \nrecord--that  PPSE  does  not  engage  in  fetal-tissue \ndonation.  The practices purported to be portrayed by \nthe  videos,  therefore,  cannot  possibly  cause  any  harm \nto the State or to Alabama taxpayers. \nThe defendants also assert that the issuance of an \ninjunction  would  undermine  the  respect  due  the \nGovernor‘s  decision  to  terminate  the  provider \nagreement.  The defendants offer no legal support for \nthis  argument;  regardless,  such  an  injury  cannot \noutweigh the injury to Doe discussed above. \nMoreover, the issuance of an injunction is in the \npublic  interest.    In  particular,  an  injunction  would \nreinforce Doe’s right to seek family-planning services \nfrom  the  qualified  provider  of  her  choice--a  right \nexplicitly  and  emphatically  protected  under  federal \nlaw. \n56 \n \n\nIn  sum,  the  plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the \nrequirements  for  the  issuance  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction on Doe’s Medicaid Act claim. \n \nIV. SCOPE OF RELIEF \n  Because Doe has satisfied her burden to show that \nentry  of  a  preliminary  injunction  is  warranted,  the \ncourt  now  turns  to  the  appropriate  scope  of  that \ninjunction.    Specifically,  the  court  must  consider \nwhether to order the State to resume Medicaid payments \nto  PPSE  to  cover  the  cost  of  Doe’s  care  alone--as \ndefendants  contend  is  appropriate,  see  Planned \nParenthood Ark. & E. Okla., slip op. at 17 (“[I]n the \nabsence  of  class  certification,  the  preliminary \ninjunction  may  properly  cover  only  named  plaintiffs.” \n(citation  omitted)),  or  to  reinstate  the  State’s \nprovider  agreement  with  PPSE  such  that  PPSE  would  be \nreimbursed  for  care  provided  to  any  Medicaid \nrecipient--as PPSE urges the court to do. \n57 \n \n\nBased on the evidence currently in the record and \nthe  representations  of  the  parties  during  an \non-the-record  telephonic  hearing  on  this  issue,  the \ncourt  finds  that,  at  least  at  present,  the \nreinstatement of the provider agreement is necessary to \nguarantee meaningful relief to Doe.  The Supreme Court \nhas  recognized  the  general  principle  that  injunctive \nrelief should not be “more burdensome to the defendant \nthan  necessary  to  provide  complete  relief \nto ... plaintiffs.”    Califano  v.  Yamasaki,  442  U.S. \n682, 702 (1979); see also Lion Health Servs., Inc. v. \nSebelius,  635  F.3d  693,  703  (5th  Cir.  2011)  (citing \nYamasaki for this rule).  Hence, the question is this: \nwould  an  injunction  that  does  not  reinstate  the \nprovider  agreement  afford  Doe  the  meaningful--and \nurgent--relief she requires.  The answer is apparently \n“no.” \nThe  Acting  Commissioner,  who  is  charged  with \nadministering the state’s Medicaid plan, has indicated \nthat the Alabama Medicaid Agency has sought but not yet \n58 \n \n\nidentified a logistical means of allowing PPSE to file \nfor and receive Medicaid reimbursements for Doe’s care \nwhile  its  provider  agreement  remains,  for  purposes  of \nall  other  recipients,  nonexistent.  See  Official  Tr. \nOctober  14,  2015  Telephone  Conference  Proceedings  11, \ndoc. no. 57.  As of now, then, enabling PPSE to file \nreimbursement requests for Doe’s care will require the \nagency to reauthorize PPSE in its reimbursement system \nwith  respect  to  all  recipients.  Since  the  defendants \nhave not been able to explain to the court how, as a \npractical matter, limited relief is feasible, and have \nstated that it is not immediately feasible, the court \nis  presented  with  no  concrete  way  in  which  to  tailor \nthe  injunction  more  narrowly  while  still  providing \nmeaningful, immediate relief to Doe. \nMoreover,  the  reinstatement  of  the  provider \nagreement  is  no  “more  burdensome  than  necessary”  to \nensure that Doe’s provider of choice, PPSE, is actually \nreimbursed for her care (and thus that she is actually \nable  to  obtain  that  care).    Practically  speaking, \n59 \n \n\ncompliance with an injunction limited to Doe will, the \nState says, be no less burdensome than compliance with \nan  injunction  that  covers  all  recipients.    Because \n“identical  relief  [is]  inevitable  to  remedy  the \nindividual  plaintiff’s  rights,”  Zepeda  v.  I.N.S.,  753 \nF.2d 719, 729 n.1 (9th Cir. 1983) (opinion of Wallace, \nJ.)  (describing  the  crux  of  the  holding  of  Bailey  v. \nPatterson,  323  F.2d  201  (5th  Cir.  1963)),  the  court \nwill enter the injunction requested by the plaintiffs, \nat least until such time as the defendants can assure \nthe court of their ability to reimburse PPSE for Doe’s \ncare without reinstating the provider agreement.12 \nIn  so  doing,  the  court  notes  that,  since  the \nhearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction, Doe \n                   \n12. Aside from the logistical barriers that would \nprevent Doe from receiving care under a grant of relief \nthat did not in practice extend to all recipients, the \nplaintiffs  have  suggested  that  the  State  could  not \nresume Medicaid payments to PPSE only as to Doe without \nrunning  afoul  of  federal  Medicaid  law,  state  law,  or \nboth.    Because  such  a  remedy  is,  as  of  now, \nfunctionally  indistinct  from  a  broader  injunction,  it \nis unnecessary to consider whether limited relief would \nbe permissible under the applicable legal regimes. \n60 \n \n\nhas  filed  a  motion  to  certify  a  class  of  Medicaid \nrecipients who wish to receive care from PPSE (doc. no. \n54).  This  motion,  if  granted,  would  obviate  the \nquestion whether relief should be tailored, if it even \ncan  be  practically,  to  cover  only  Doe.    See,  e.g., \nHollon  v.  Mathis  Indep.  Sch.  Dist.,  491  F.2d  92,  93 \n(5th  Cir.  1974)  (recognizing  that,  had  a  class  been \ncertified, injunctive relief restraining enforcement of \na  regulation  as  to  all  individuals,  rather  than  as \napplied  to  named  plaintiff,  would  have  been \nappropriate);  Soto-Lopez  v.  N.Y.  City  Civil  Service \nComm’n,  840  F.2d  162,  168  (2d  Cir.  1988)  (explaining \nthat  “relief  of  general  application”  is  appropriate \nwhere  a  plaintiff  class  has  been  certified,  and \nconsidering whether such relief was available absent a \nclass).  Because certification of a class would provide \nan  additional  basis  for  injunctive  relief  which \nbenefits recipients other than Doe, the court will set \n61 \n \n\nan  expedited  briefing  schedule  on  Doe’s  motion  in  a \nseparate order.13   \nFinally, the parties both agree that the questions \nanswered here--that the termination of PPSE's provider \nagreement  was  at-will,  and  that  such  at-will \nterminations are not valid under the Medicaid Act--are \nessentially  pure  questions  of  law  to  which  no \nadditional  evidence  would  be  relevant.  This  is \nsignificant for two reasons.  First, although the court \nis presently granting only a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction,  there  is  no  possibility  that  additional \nevidence  will  alter  its  conclusion  at  the  permanent \ninjunction and declaratory relief stage, so the caution \nthat should normally accompany a preliminary injunction \nthat  might  be  vacated  once  additional  evidence  is \nconsidered is not required here.  See Bresgal v. Brock, \n                   \n13. Additionally, based on the current record, the \ncourt is of the belief that the plaintiffs are likely \nto prevail on their motion for class certification.  In \nmaking  this  observation,  the  court  recognizes  that  it \nhas  not  heard  all  of  the  evidence  and,  accordingly, \ndoes not predict the eventual outcome of the motion. \n62 \n \n\n843 F.2d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. 1987) (recognizing that, \nat  the  preliminary  injunction  stage,  the  fact  that  a \ncourt had not “ruled on substantive issues in the case, \nbut had only determined that the plaintiff had a ‘fair \nchance’ of prevailing on the merits” counseled against \na grant of broad relief).  Relatedly, because the only \nattribute of Doe relevant to the court's resolution of \nthis  claim  is  one  that  she  shares  with  all  those \ncovered  by  the  injunction--namely,  that  she  is  a \nMedicaid  recipient  who  wishes  to  receive  covered  care \nfrom  PPSE--there  is  no  possibility  that  additional \nevidence would reveal that the injunction would be any \nless  appropriately  entered  with  respect  to  another \nrecipient not presently a party to the case.  Cf. Soto-\nLopez, 840 F.2d at 168 (“When a state statute has been \nruled unconstitutional, state actors have an obligation \nto  desist  from  enforcing  that  statute.  Thus,  when  it \nhas  been  held  unconstitutional  to  deny  benefits  to \notherwise  qualified  persons  on  the  ground  they  are \nmembers  of  a  certain  group,  the  officials  have  the \n63 \n \n\nobligation  to  cease  denying  benefits  not  just  to  the \nnamed  plaintiffs  but  also  to  all  other  qualified \nmembers of the group.” (citation omitted)). \nA  recent  Eleventh  Circuit  case  supports  this \ncourt’s approach.  In Garrido v. Dudek, 731 F.3d 1152 \n(11th Cir. 2013), the court reviewed a district court’s \nentry of a permanent injunction striking down a state \nagency’s  rule  that  a  particular  form  of  autism \ntreatment  was  experimental  and  therefore  not  covered \nunder  the  Medicaid  Act.    Garrido,  731  F.3d,  at  1159.  \nThe  court  vacated  and  remanded  the  portion  of  the \ndistrict  court’s  injunction  requiring  the  state  to \nprovide  a  blanket  authorization  of  the  treatment  for \nall  Medicaid  recipients  with  autism  because,  as  the \ndistrict court had itself discussed at some length, a \ndetermination  whether  the  treatment  was  indeed \nmedically necessary had to be made for each individual \nrecipient;  the  court  could  properly  make  this \ndetermination only with respect to the named plaintiffs \nbefore  it.    Id.  at  1159-61.    In  other  words,  the \n64 \n \n\nappellate  court  vacated  the  portion  of  the  injunction \nthat  purported  to  guarantee  treatment  to  others  about \nwhom  no  individualized  determination  had  been  made.  \nHere,  by  contrast,  all  Medicaid  recipient-patients  at \nPPSE  are,  for  the  purposes  of  this  narrow  legal \nquestion, indistinguishable.  \nThe  appellate  court  upheld  the  portion  of  the \nGarrido  injunction  analogous  to  the  injunction  being \nentered here--the portion that enjoined the State from \nenforcing  the  rule  that  mandated  denial  of  coverage \ngenerally.  See K.G. ex rel. Garrido v. Dudek, 864 F. \nSupp.  2d  1314,  1328  (S.D.  Fla.  2012)  (Lenard,  J.) \n(“Defendant  is  enjoined  from  enforcing  Florida \nBehavioral Health Rule 2–1–4 as it relates to autism, \nAutism  Spectrum  Disorder,  and  Applied  Behavioral \nAnalysis treatment.”).  Though the court held that it \nwas inappropriate to grant relief ordering coverage of \ntreatment  in  all  cases,  an  injunction  against \nenforcement  of  a  rule  that  prevented  case-by-case \ndeterminations--relief  that  directly  benefitted  far\n65 \n \n\nmore  recipients  than  the  three  named  plaintiffs--was \nnevertheless proper.  It is proper here as well. \n* * * \nIn  summary,  Doe  is  very  likely  to  succeed  on  her \nclaim  that  the  Governor’s  termination  of  PPSE’s \nprovider  agreement  violated  the  Medicaid  Act.    The \nreasons for this are simple.  The Act requires States \nto provide a reason for such terminations.  Here, as is \nplain  from  the  Governor’s  letter,  the  State  provided \nnone.  Finally, even the post-hoc reasons cited by the \ndefendants  in  briefing  before  this  court  are  plainly \ninapplicable to PPSE.  On these bases, Doe’s success on \nthe merits of her Medicaid claim is near-certain. \nAn  appropriate  preliminary  injunction  will  be \nentered,  requiring  that,  for  the  benefit  of  Doe,  the \nState  reinstate  its  Medicaid  provider  agreement  with \nPPSE. \nDONE, this the 28th day of October, 2015. \n   /s/ Myron H.

Becton Dickinson & Co., 486\nU.S.196, 201, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 1721-22, 100 L .Ed.2d 178 (1988); LaChance v.\nDuffy’s Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir. 1998).\n(c)  Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a): Appeals are permitted from orders\n“granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions or refusing to\ndissolve or modify injunctions . . .” and from “[i]nterlocutory decrees . . .\ndetermining the rights and liabilities of parties to admiralty cases in which appeals\nfrom final decrees are allowed.” Interlocutory appeals from orders denying temporary\nrestraining orders are not permitted.\n(d)  Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) and Fed.R.App.P. 5: The certification\nspecified in 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) must be obtained before a petition for permission to\nappeal is filed in the Court of Appeals.

Time for Filing: The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.\nRinaldo v. Corbett, 256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001). In civil cases, Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)\nand (c) set the following time limits:\n(a)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1): A notice of appeal in compliance with the requirements set\nforth in Fed.R.App.P. 3 must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the\nentry of the order or judgment appealed from. However, if the United States or an\nofficer or agency thereof is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed in the district\ncourt within 60 days after such entry. THE NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED AND\nFILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT NO LATER THAN THE LAST DAY OF\nTHE APPEAL PERIOD – no additional days are provided for mailing. Special\nfiling provisions for inmates are discussed below.\n(b)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(3): “If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party\nmay file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was\nfiled, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period\nends later.”\n(c)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4): If any party makes a timely motion in the district court under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a type specified in this rule, the time for\nappeal for all parties runs from the date of entry of the order disposing of the last\nsuch timely filed motion.\n(d)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) and 4(a)(6): Under certain limited circumstances, the district\ncourt may extend the time to file a notice of appeal. Under Rule 4(a)(5), the time may\nbe extended if a motion for an extension is filed within 30 days after expiration of the\ntime otherwise provided to file a notice of appeal, upon a showing of excusable\nneglect or good cause. Under Rule 4(a)(6), the time may be extended if the district\ncourt finds upon motion that a party did not timely receive notice of the entry of the\njudgment or order, and that no party would be prejudiced by an extension.\n(e)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(c): If an inmate confined to an institution files a notice of appeal in\neither a civil case or a criminal case, the notice of appeal is timely if it is deposited in\nthe institution’s internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. Timely filing\nmay be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 or a notarized\nstatement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class\npostage has been prepaid.\n3.  Format of the notice of appeal: Form 1, Appendix of Forms to the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure, is a suitable format. See also Fed.R.App.P. 3(c). A pro se notice of\nappeal must be signed by the appellant.\n4.  Effect of a notice of appeal: A district court loses jurisdiction (authority) to act after the\nfiling of a timely notice of appeal, except for actions in aid of appellate jurisdiction or to rule\non a timely motion of the type specified in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).",
