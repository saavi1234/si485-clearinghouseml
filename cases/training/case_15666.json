    "summary": "<p>On September 11, 2015, two Planned Parenthood clinics and three Arkansas Medicaid patients filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The plaintiffs sued the Arkansas Department of Human Services, under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, for violations of the Medicaid Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, enjoining the Department of Human Services from excluding Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid provider.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that on August 15, 2015, the Department had notified the Planned Parenthood clinics that it would soon terminate their Medicaid provider agreements. While the Department gave no reason for the termination, a press release by Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson indicated that the decision was in reaction to videos released by anti-abortion advocates claiming that Planned Parenthood clinics in other states had illegally sold fetal tissues. The plaintiffs claimed that such videos were both misleading and had no relevance to their ability to offer quality Medicaid services. Further, they claimed that termination of their Medicaid provider agreements violated the Medicaid Act by denying the individual plaintiffs their right to choose the willing and qualified health care provider of their choice; the First and Fourteenth Amendment by penalizing the individual plaintiffs for their constitutionally protected association with abortion providers; and the Equal Protection Clause by singling the plaintiffs out for unfavorable treatment.</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 2015, U.S. District Judge Kristine G. Baker issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the Department from suspending Medicaid payments to the clinics for the following 14 days. On October 2, 2015, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Department from suspending Medicaid payments to the clinics for services received by the individual plaintiffs. On October 5, 2015, the Department appealed the preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>While the appeal was pending, on October 5, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of all Medicaid patients receiving or desiring to receive health services from Planned Parenthood. The court granted class certification on January 25, 2016. On March 3, 2016, the court amended the class certification to remove any requirement that the plaintiffs notify class members.</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2016, the court issued a new preliminary injunction, enjoining the Department from suspending Medicaid payments to the clinics for services received by any members of the plaintiff class. This included any Arkansas Medicaid patient who received services from the clinics.</p>\r\n<p>On October 27, 2016, the Department appealed the second preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This appeal was consolidated with the Department&rsquo;s October 5, 2015 appeal of the first preliminary injunction. On November 30, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion regarding the preliminary injunction on August 16, 2017. 867 F.3d 1034. The court (Judges Colloton, Melloy, and Shepherd), vacated both preliminary injunctions in a 2-1 opinion. The court found that the plaintiffs did not have a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, because the Medicaid Act did not unambiguously create a federal right for individual patients that can be enforced under &sect; 1983. Judge Melloy dissented, because he would join the four other circuit courts and numerous district courts that all have found a private right of enforcement under the Medicaid Act.</p>\r\n<p>After the Eighth Circuit issued its opinion, the plaintiffs again filed a motion for the district court to grant a preliminary injunction on January 19, 2018, this time on their constitutional claims rather than their Medicaid Act claim. The court denied this motion on July 30, 2018. While the court was considering that motion, the Department filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the Medicaid Act claim; the court denied that motion on March 24, 2019. It concluded that judgment on the pleadings was neither necessary nor helpful at this stage of the litigation. In the same order, the court also denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to stay the proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for stay, claiming that they were not able to effectively pursue discovery due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The court granted stay on the same day. The plaintiffs continued filing motions to stay, with the case remaining stayed until May 2022. On July 7, 2022, the plaintiffs stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the case with prejudice. On August 1, the court adopted the joint stipulation, denied all pending motions as moot, and dismissed the case. The case is now closed.</p>",

No. \n98).  Defendant Cindy Gillespie, who is sued in her official capacity as Director of the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services (โADHSโ), has responded in opposition to the motion (Dkt. No. \n105).  PPH and the Jane Does have replied (Dkt. No. 109).  ADHS then filed a sur-reply (Dkt. \nNo. 120) and subsequently informally requested permission from the Court to file a supplemental \nresponse to her response in opposition to the motion to expand the preliminary injunction to the \n                                                           \n1  On January 25, 2016, the Court granted a motion to certify a class (referred to in this \nOrder as the โPatient Classโ) (Dkt. No. 86).  The certified class consists of patients who seek to \nobtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at PPH through the Medicaid \nprogram.  The Court notes that other cases with claims like those presented here have proceeded \nwithout a class being certified, with class-wide injunctive relief being granted based on the \ngeneral equity powers of the court or the so-called โnecessity doctrine.โ  See, e.g., Planned \nParenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri v. Mosier, Case No. 16-2284-JAR-GLR, 2016 WL \n3597457 (D. Kan. 2016) (granting preliminary injunction that reinstates provider agreement \nwithout ruling on motion for class certification); Planned Parenthood S.E., Inc. v. Bentley, 141 \nF.Supp.2d 1207, 1226-27 (M.D. Ala. 2015) (same); Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. \nKliebert, 141 F.Supp.3d 605, 652 (M.D. La. 2015), affโd โ  F.3d โ, 2016 WL 4895921 (5th Cir. \n2016) (same).      \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 2 of 21\nPatient Class.  The Court granted this request, and ADHS filed a supplemental response (Dkt. \nNo. 121).  PPH and the Jane Does then filed supplemental memorandums in support of their \nmotion (Dkt. Nos. 122, 124), to which the Court gave ADHS an opportunity to respond.  ADHS \nfiled a further reply in opposition to plaintiffsโ preliminary injunction motion and a response to \nthe notice of supplemental authority (Dkt. Nos. 125, 126).  \nPPH and the Jane Does ask this Court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, \nfor a preliminary injunction on behalf of the Patient Class preliminarily enjoining ADHS from \nterminating the Medicaid provider agreements of PPH.  Alternatively, PPH and the Jane Does \nask this Court to expand the preliminary injunction to cover the Patient Class pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62(c).   \nI.  Procedural Background \nPPH  and  the  Jane  Does  first  filed  a  motion  for  temporary  restraining  order  and \npreliminary injunction on September 11, 2015 (Dkt. No. 3).  In this motion, PPH and the Jane \nDoes alleged that, starting on September 21, 2015, absent an injunction, patients insured through \nthe Medicaid program who choose to get family planning and other health care services at PPH \nwould lose access to services, would lose their provider of choice, would find their family \nplanning services interrupted, and would be left with few or no adequate alternative providers \n(Dkt. No. 12, ยถยถ 8, 34).  PPH and the Jane Does also contended that, โ[i]f PPH is forced to stop \nproviding  care  through  the  Medicaid  program,  a  dire  situation  will  become  critical.    The \nremaining providers will be simply unable to absorb PPHโs patients, leaving those patients \nwithout access to crucial medical services.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 43).   \nFurther, they alleged that, โ[w]ithout Medicaid reimbursements, PPH may be unable to \ncontinue to provide services in the same manner and may be forced to lay off staff members \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 3 of 21\nand/or reduce hours at one or both health centers.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 49).  They also alleged that, \nโif PPHโs termination from the Medicaid program is allowed to take effect for some period of \ntime and it then is later allowed to become a Medicaid provider again, some patients will remain \nconfused about whether PPH is a Medicaid provider in good standing, and therefore will not \nreturn as patients.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 49).  In their original motion for preliminary injunction PPH \nand the Jane Does claimed, and in their motion to expand the preliminary injunction PPH and the \nJane Does claim, that the suspension of Medicaid payments violates certain provisions of the \nMedicaid statutory and regulatory scheme set out in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396 and violates their rights \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \nCounsel for ADHS has argued to the Court that any assertion of irreparable harm by PPH \nis, and has been, illusory because, under the Medicaid program, PPH has up to one year after \nproviding services to a patient to seek reimbursement for the cost of that service.  In other words, \nADHS advanced the argument that PPH could continue to provide services in the same manner \nwith the possibility of reimbursement within one year after providing services and suffer no real \nfinancial harm.  The one-year reimbursement time limit ends on October 1, 2016.  \nOn September 18, 2015, this Court granted PPH and the Jane Doesโ motion for temporary \nrestraining order (Dkt. No. 21).  The Court temporarily restrained ADHS โfor a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of this Order from suspending Medicaid payments to PPH for services \nrendered to Medicaid beneficiaries, including but not limited to the Jane Does.โ (Dkt. No. 21, at \n19).  At that stage of the proceedings, the Court conducted a status conference with counsel \nconcerning a briefing schedule and potential hearing.  For the reasons set forth in its Order, the \nCourt permitted ADHS to obtain evidentiary material from the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 25).  The \nCourt did not regulate the number, scope, or timing of the written questions ADHS submitted to \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 4 of 21\nthe Jane Does.  The Court instructed counsel from both sides to meet and confer on these \nmatters, and although the Court did later enter an Order clarifying its earlier Order on the \npermitted discovery, the Court was not asked to resolve or clarify any other issues in regard to \nthe questions submitted to the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 32).  Also at that stage of the proceeding, the \nCourt raised with counsel again, and directed counsel to brief, standing issues.       \nOn October 2, 2015, the Court then entered a preliminary injunction more limited in \nscope  โ  limiting  the  relief  granted  to  just  the  Jane  Does  (Dkt.  Nos.  44,  45).    The  Court \nsubsequently granted PPH and the Jane Does leave to file a second amended complaint (Dkt. No. \n63).  In their second amended complaint, PPH and the Jane Does added class action allegations \n(Dkt. No. 64, ยถยถ 50-55).  At the same time, PPH and the Jane Does moved this Court to certify a \nclass of patients who seek to obtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at PPH \nthrough the Medicaid program (Dkt. No. 50). \nOn October 6, 2015, ADHS filed a motion for leave to notice four depositions (Dkt. No. \n56).  The Court conducted a status hearing on the motion.  ADHS requested leave to depose Jane \nDoe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 and to conduct a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) \ndeposition  of  a  PPH  representative  before  responding  to  the  pending  motion  for  class \ncertification.  ADHS claimed that it sought these depositions to test, at least, the typicality and \nadequacy requirements for class certification (Dkt. No. 55, at 4).  ADHS wanted to conduct this \ndiscovery prior to the Court ruling on the then-pending motion for class certification.  For \nreasons set out in its Order, the Court denied the motion for leave to notice four depositions and \nfor expedited discovery (Dkt. No. 66). \nOn January 25, 2016, the Court granted the motion to certify a class (referred to in this \nOrder as the โPatient Classโ) (Dkt. No. 86).  The certified class consists of patients who seek to \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 5 of 21\nobtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at PPH through the Medicaid \nprogram.  ADHS sought interlocutory review of this Courtโs class certification Order and denial \nof the motion for expedited pre-certification discovery decision.  See Planned Parenthood Ark. \n& E. Okla., d/b/a Planned Parenthood of the Heartland v. Selig, Case No. 16-8003 (8th Cir. Feb. \n5, 2016).  The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals denied ADHSโs request for interlocutory review.  \nId.  \nPPH and the Jane Does then moved for a preliminary injunction extending to the newly-\ncertified Patient Class the same relief already granted the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 98).   ADHS \nsubsequently filed a motion seeking expedited discovery before the Court ruled on the motion for \npreliminary injunction seeking to extend to the newly-certified class the same relief already \ngranted to the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 113).  PPH and the Jane Does responded in opposition to the \nmotion for expedited discovery (Dkt. No. 115), and ADHS replied (Dkt. No. 116).  The Court \nthen conducted a status conference to discuss the motion for expedited discovery on August 19, \n2016, before eventually denying the motion (Dkt. No. 119). \nSince the status conference, ADHS has filed a sur-reply (Dkt. No. 120) and subsequently \ninformally requested permission from the Court to file a supplemental response to its response in \nopposition to the motion to expand the preliminary injunction to the patient class.  The Court \ngranted this request, and ADHS filed a supplemental response (Dkt. No. 121).  PPH and the Jane \nDoes then filed supplemental memorandums in support of their motion (Dkt. Nos. 122, 124), to \nwhich  the  Court  gave  ADHS  an  opportunity  to  respond.    ADHS  filed  a  further  reply  in \nopposition to plaintiffsโ preliminary injunction motion and a response to notice of supplemental \nauthority (Dkt. Nos. 125, 126).  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 6 of 21\nII.  Findings Of Fact \n  The Court makes the following findings of fact, and the Court incorporates by reference \nas if restated herein word for word all findings of fact from its Order granting the motion for \npreliminary injunction as to the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 45).  \n1.  The Patient Class certified in this matter consists of patients who seek to obtain, \nor desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at PPH through the Medicaid program.  \n2.  Since this Court issued its Order granting the motion for preliminary injunction as \nto the Jane Does on October 2, 2015, ADHS has only been required to reimburse PPH for \nMedicaid services provided to these three patients identified in this litigation as the Jane Does; \nADHS has not made such reimbursements to PPH for any other Medicaid patients (Dkt. No. 105, \nat 5). \n3.   Mark White, Deputy Director of ADHS, who supervises the Division of Medical \nServices  which  administers  Arkansasโs  Medicaid  Program,  states  that  โat  Governor  Asa \nHutchinsonโs directive, DHS Director John Selig gave written notice that DHS would terminate \nthe three (3) PPH provider agreements in 30 days, exercising its rights to do so under the \nโvoluntaryโ termination provision (Section III.A) of said agreements.โ  (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ5). \n4.   Both prior to October 2, 2015, and between October 2, 2015, and the present, at \nits two Arkansas health centers, PPH has provided services to patients insured through the \nMedicaid program without charging patients for Medicaid-eligible services (Dkt. No. 102, ยถ 1). \n5.   From  October  2,  2015,  to  the  present,  PPH  has  not  reduced,  altered,  or \ndiscontinued the services available to Medicaid patients in its two Arkansas health centers as a \nresult of PPH not currently being able to seek reimbursement for Medicaid-eligible services \nprovided to Medicaid patients other than the three named Jane Doe Plaintiffs (Id., ยถ 2). \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 7 of 21\n6.    From October 2, 2015 to the present, PPH has stated โMedicaid Acceptedโ on the \nwebsites for its Little Rock and Fayetteville, Arkansas, health centers (Id., ยถ 3). \n7.   The clinic hours, the availability and hours of walk-in services, and staffing at \nPPHโs two Arkansas health centers have not decreased since October 2, 2015, as a result of \nPPHโs  current  inability  to  seek  reimbursement  for  Medicaid-eligible  services  provided  to \nMedicaid patients other than the three named Jane Doe Plaintiffs (Id., ยถ 4). \n8.   PPH and the Jane Does state that in late February and early March 2016, Holly \nAjanel, Center Manager of the Little Rock Health Center at PPH, placed telephone calls to the \nLittle Rock Family Practice Clinicโs two locations in Little Rock, Arkansas, and asked about \nappointment  availability  for  a  new  Medicaid  patient  seeking  birth  control  services.  Both \nlocations informed Ms. Ajanel that they are not accepting Medicaid patients.  The staff member \nwith whom Ms. Ajanel spoke also told her that, while their doctors can perform services such as \npap  smears,  they  usually  suggest  that  patients  obtain  such  services  from  their \nobstetrician/gynecologist because that is their specialty (Dkt. No. 99, Ex. A, ยถ 1). \n9.   In  the  same  time  period,  Ms.  Ajanel  placed  a  telephone  call  to  the Genesis \nWomenโs Clinic, PA, in Little Rock, Arkansas, and again asked about appointment availability \nfor a new Medicaid patient seeking birth control services.  The staff member with whom she \nspoke  represented  to  her  that  Medicaid  patients  must  have  a  referral  from  a  primary  care \nphysician in order to obtain these services (Id., ยถ 3). \n10.   In March 2016, Ms. Ajanel placed telephone calls to the Arkansas Department of \nHealthโs Central Unit and North Little Rock, Arkansas, locations and again asked about services \nfor a new Medicaid patient seeking birth control.  Both locations told her that they do not provide \nbirth control on a walk-in basis, and they also informed her that a patient would be required to \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 8 of 21\nhave a pelvic exam before obtaining hormonal birth control such as birth control pills.  Ms. \nAjanel also called the Arkansas Department of Healthโs Southwest Little Rock, Arkansas, unit, \nwas told that they do not offer birth control services, and was referred instead to call the Central \nUnit (Id., ยถ 4). \n11.   Ms. Teesha Taylor, Training Manager at PPH, placed a telephone call on March \n11, 2016, to Her Health Washington Regional in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and inquired about \nappointment availability for a new Medicaid patient seeking birth control services.  The staff \nmember with whom Ms. Taylor spoke informed her that they were not accepting Medicaid \npatients who are not pregnant (Dkt. No. 99. Ex. B, ยถ 2).  \n12.   On the same date, Ms. Taylor placed a telephone call to Northwest Arkansas \nOb/Gyn Associates in Springdale, Arkansas, also known as Creekside Center for Women, and \nagain inquired about appointment availability for a new Medicaid patient seeking birth control \nservices.  The staff member with whom Ms. Taylor spoke informed her that Medicaid patients \nseeking such services must have a referral from a primary care physician.  The staff member also \ntold Ms. Taylor that, to receive hormonal contraception, patients must have a pap smear.   The \nstaff member also represented to Ms. Taylor that patients cannot be seen on a walk-in basis, that \nappointment availability depends on which doctor is requested, but that appointment lead times \nare usually in the three to four week range (Id., ยถ 3). \n13.   On March 14, 2016, Ms. Taylor placed a telephone call to Mercy Health System \nof NWA, Inc., in Rogers, Arkansas, and inquired about appointment availability for a new \nMedicaid patient seeking birth control services.  PPH and the Jane Does represent that, from \nwww.mapquest.com, Rogers, Arkansas, is located approximately 24 miles from Fayetteville, \nArkansas.  The staff member with whom Ms. Taylor spoke told her that Medicaid patients \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 9 of 21\nseeking such services must have a referral from a primary care physician.  The staff member also \ntold Ms. Taylor that, to receive hormonal contraception, patients must have a pap smear.  Finally, \nthe staff member told Ms. Taylor that the first available appointment would not be for at least \nseven weeks.  Ms. Taylor asked if there were any other health centers within the Mercy System \nat which she could obtain reproductive healthcare, and the staff member stated that there were \nnot unless she was pregnant (Id., ยถ 4). \nIII.  Conclusions Of Law \n           PPH and the Jane Does move this Court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 \nfor a preliminary injunction on behalf of the Patient Class preliminarily enjoining Ms. Gillespie, \nher  employees,  agents,  and  successors  in  office  โfrom  terminating  the  Medicaid  provider \nagreements of [PPH]โ (Dkt. No. 98, at 1).  Plaintiffs alternatively request that the Court modify \nthe injunction previously entered and extend its coverage to the Patient Class pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62(c). \n  A.  Jurisdiction \n            On October 2, 2015, when the Court entered the order preliminarily enjoining ADHS \nfrom suspending Medicaid payments to PPH for services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries the \nJane Does until further order from this Court, ADHS immediately appealed that Order.  ADHS \nrepresents that the briefing on the appeal is complete, and the case is ready for oral argument \n(Dkt. No. 105, Ex. F).  โAn appeal to the circuit court divests the district court as to those issues \ninvolved in the appeal.โ  In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 85 F.3d 372, 376 (8th Cir. \n1996); see also Board of Education of St. Louis v. State of Missouri, 936 F.2d 993, 995 (8th Cir. \n1991); St. Jude Medical, S.C., Inc. v. Biosense Webster, Inc., 2015 WL 317362 at *1 (D. Minn. \nJan. 26, 2015).   \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 10 of 21\n  Rule 62(c) is an exception to the general rule that an appeal divests the district court of \njurisdiction with regard to the issues involved in the appeal.  Rule 62(c) provides that, โ[w]hile \nan appeal is pending from an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, dissolves, or \ndenies an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore or grant an injunction on terms for \nbond or other terms that secure the opposing partyโs rights.โ  Fed. R. Civ P. 62(c).   \n  PPH and the Jane Does argue that โ[i]t is axiomatic that while appeal of a preliminary \ninjunction is pending, the district court retains jurisdiction to continue proceedings in the case \nbefore it, including to reach final judgment on the case.  As the Eighth Circuit has observed, โthe \npendency of an interlocutory appeal from an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction \ndoes not wholly divest the District Court of jurisdiction over the entire caseโ and thus is no \nimpediment to its being tried or otherwise finally resolved.  West Pub. Co. v. Mead Data Cent. \nInc., 799 F.2d 1219, 1229 (8th Cir. 1986); see Janousek v. Doyle, 313 F.2d 916, 920 (8th Cir. \n1963) (โfiling of the notice of appeal from [interlocutory order denying a preliminary injunction \nmotion] does notโฆ divest the district court of jurisdiction to proceed with the cause with respect \nto any matter not involved in the appeal.โ); United States v. Queen, 433 F.3d 1076, 1077 (8th Cir. \n2006)  (โAlthough  a  federal  district  court  and  a  federal  court  of  appeals  should  not  assert \njurisdiction over a case at the same time, a notice of appeal only divests the lower court of \njurisdiction over aspects of the case that are the subject of the appeal.โ); 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. \nCiv. ยง 2962 (3d ed.) (โAn appeal from the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction does not \ndivest the trial court of jurisdiction or prevent it from taking other steps in the litigation while the \nappeal is pending.  According to Rule 62(a) there is no automatic stay of the judgment in an \ninjunction suit pending an interlocutory appeal. . . and the case may proceed to a trial on the \nmerits.โ). . . .โ (Dkt. No. 109, at 6-7).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 11 of 21\n   Plaintiffs also note that they are asking the Court to issue a new preliminary injunction \nprotecting Patient Class members who were not previously before the Court.  The members of \nthe class were not parties to this action when the Court issued its preliminary injunction Order as \nto the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 45).  This Court has examined the arguments proffered by ADHS \ncontending that this Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the instant motion under either \nRule 65 or Rule 62(c).  After considering the partiesโ arguments and examining the authorities \ncited, the Court finds that the Court has the authority to proceed in resolving pending issues in \nthis case to move this case toward final disposition.  Thus, this Court finds that it has jurisdiction \nto analyze the pending motion under Rule 65. \n  Further, other courts presiding in cases with claims like those presented here have \nproceeded without a class being certified, with class-wide injunctive relief being granted based \non the general equity powers of the court or the so-called โnecessity doctrine.โ  See, e.g., \nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri v. Mosier, Case No. 16-2284-JAR-GLR, 2016 \nWL 3597457 (D. Kan. 2016) (granting preliminary injunction that reinstates provider agreement \nwithout ruling on motion for class certification); Planned Parenthood S.E., Inc. v. Bentley, 141 \nF.Supp.2d 1207, 1226-27 (M.D. Ala. 2015) (same); Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. \nKliebert, 141 F.Supp.3d 605, 652 (M.D. La. 2015), affโd โ  F.3d โ, 2016 WL 4895921 (5th Cir. \n2016) (same).  This Court finds it appropriate to proceed in analyzing the pending motion and \nconsidering what relief the Patient Class should be afforded at this stage. \nB.  The Dataphase Factors \n  The Court incorporates by reference as if restated herein word for word its analysis of \nthe Dataphase factors in its Order granting the motion for preliminary injunction as to the Jane \nDoes (Dkt. No. 45, at 17-31).  See Kroupa v. Nielsen, 731 F.3d 813, 818 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 12 of 21\nDataphase Sys. Inc. v. CL Sys., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981)).  The analysis of the factors as \nto the Jane Does in the previous Order applies equally to the analysis of these same factors for \nthe Patient Class.  The Court will specifically address in this Order the irreparable harm factor, as \nthis is one of the arguments posited by ADHS in its opposition to the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction to the Patient Class.  \n1.  The Threat Of Irreparable Harm \nA plaintiff seeking temporary injunctive relief must establish that the claimant is โlikely \nto suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.โ  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  A threat of irreparable harm exists when a party alleges a \nharm that may not be compensated by money damages in an action at law.  See Kroupa, 731 \nF.3d at 820; Glenwood Bridge, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 940 F.2d 367, 371-72 (8th Cir. 1991).  \nCourts in the Eighth Circuit will not issue an injunction in the absence of evidence of class-wide \nirreparable harm.  See, e.g., Agnotti v. Rexam Inc., 2006 WL 3043130 at *13 (D. Minn. 2006).  \nAs  this  Court  has  observed,  Arkansas  law  is  instructive  although  admittedly  not \ncontrolling on this issue.  The Supreme Court of Arkansas has found in other contexts that harm \nto a doctor-patient relationship can constitute irreparable harm.  See Baptist Health v. Murphy, \n226 S.W.3d 800 (Ark. 2006); Cf. Roudachevski v. AllโAmerican Care Centers, Inc., 648 F.3d \n701  (8th  Cir.  2011)  (holding  that  an  already-disrupted  doctor-patient  relationship  did  not \nconstitute irreparable harm). \nHere, PPH and the Jane Does allege that the Patient Class will suffer irreparable harm \nabsent the requested injunction because the class membersโ relationship with PPH, their chosen \nfamily planning provider, will be disrupted, causing reduced access to family planning services \nin violation of their statutory rights under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23).  ADHS again argues, as it \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 13 of 21\ndid in opposition to the first motion for preliminary injunction in this matter, that alternative \nproviders are available.  As the Court found in its Order granting the motion for preliminary \ninjunction, the right does not protect the class membersโ right to a substitute or similar provider.  \nAs this Court has concluded, the right entails โan absolute right to be free from government \ninterference with the choice to [receive family planning services from a provider] that continues \nto be qualified.โ  OโBannon v. Town Court Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980).  Here, the \nPatient Class consists of patients who seek to obtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in \nArkansas at PPH through the Medicaid program (Dkt. No. 86).    \nIn addition to disrupting the class membersโ relationship with their chosen provider of \nfamily planning services and other preventive healthcare, this loss would reduce the Patient \nClassโs access to such  services by depriving its members of  access to PPHโs flexible and \nconvenient scheduling.  The Court has already recognized in its motion certifying the class that \nthese harms would affect the class as a whole (Dkt. No. 86, at 16).  Based on the record before \nthe Court, the Court confirms that these harms would affect the Patient Class as a whole.  \nPPH and the Jane Does have also supplementally provided notice to the Court that, on \nSeptember  14,  2016,  a  panel  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fifth  Circuit \nunanimously affirmed a preliminary injunction enjoining Louisiana from terminating a Planned \nParenthood affiliate from Medicaid following the release of the videos at issue here.  Planned \nParenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 2016 WL 4895921 (5th Cir. Sept. 14, 2016).  The Fifth \nCircuit  agreed  with  the  Louisiana  district  court  that  the  individual  plaintiffs  โwill  almost \ncertainly  suffer  irreparable  harmโ  without  a  preliminary  injunction  because  they  โwould \notherwise be denied both access to a much needed medical provider and the legal right to the \nqualified provider of their choice.โ  Id. at *16.  Specifically, the Fifth Circuit found that it was \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 14 of 21\nโbeside the pointโ that the individual plaintiffs could find health services elsewhere because they \nโwould be denied the provider of their choice guaranteed under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23).โ  Id. \nEven if this Court were to assume that the violation of the choice-of-provider right is not \nenough to constitute the threat of irreparable harm, although this Court believes it is, PPH and \nthe Jane Does have placed into the record affidavits of Holly Ajanel, the Center Manager of the \nLittle Rock Health Center at PPH, and Teesha Taylor, the Training Manager at PPH (Dkt. No. \n99, Exs. A, B).  Both Ms. Ajanel and Ms. Taylor state under oath that they contacted other \nproviders in Pulaski County and Washington County, Arkansas, some of whom stated they could \nnot provide specific services offered by PPH, they were not accepting Medicaid patients, and \nenumerated various other hurdles a Medicaid patient would face in obtaining family planning \nand reproductive services from their clinics (Id.).  As a result, it is the finding of this Court for all \nof these reasons that plaintiffs have met their burden to demonstrate the threat of irreparable \nharm to the Patient Class, if the motion for preliminary injunction is not granted.  \n    2.   PPHโs Coverage of Medicaid Patient Costs \n  ADHS contends that the Patient Class does not face the threat of irreparable harm by the \ntermination of PPH from the Medicaid program because PPH has temporarily covered the cost of \nthese services while plaintiffs have gone through the steps needed to try to obtain a broader \npreliminary injunction that would protect the ability of all of PPHโs Medicaid patients to receive \nservices from PPH through the Medicaid program (Dkt. No. 105, at 5-9).  PPH and the Jane \nDoes assert that this argument fails because PPHโa non-profit medical provider committed to \nproviding  family  planning  services  and  other  preventive  care  to  the  women  and  men  of \nArkansasโcannot continue providing services without payment indefinitely.  Rather, PPH puts \nforth record evidence that it decided to take on this burden to protect its patients while plaintiffsโ \nmotion for class certification and subsequent motion for a preliminary injunction on behalf of the \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 15 of 21\nnewly-certified Patient Class were pending (Dkt. No. 109, Ex. A, de Baca Decl. ยถ 6).  Suzanna \nde Baca, President and Chief Executive Officer of PPH, represents that, if the Court denies the \ninstant preliminary injunction motion, PPH will no longer provide services to its Medicaid \npatients without payment; these patients will be forced to either pay out of pocket for these \nservices or attempt to obtain services from another Medicaid provider (Id., ยถ 8). \n  ADHS claims that this Court should not find Ms. de Bacaโs statements credible because \nshe  allegedly  misrepresented  PPHโs  ability  or  willingness  to  provide  services  to  Medicaid \npatients in the absence of a preliminary injunction in her prior declaration and in PPHโs briefing.  \nSpecifically, ADHS claims that Ms. de Baca stated that, if the Court did not grant injunctive \nrelief, patients would be denied access to Medicaid services at PPH, their provider of choice \n(Dkt. No. 105, at 2-5).  That situation has not come to pass yet, based on the record evidence.   \n  In response, PPH and the Jane Does contend that ADHSโs โaccusations ignore the \nprocedural history of this case.  When the statements [ADHS] complains of were made, PPH did \nnot contemplate a scenario where this Court ruled in plaintiffsโ favor on all four preliminary \ninjunction factors but determined that in the absence of class certification it could not grant a \npreliminary injunction that covered all of PPHโs patients.โ (Dkt. No. 109, at 4).  PPH and the \nJane Does also state โthat Ms. de Bacaโs statements were made before [ADHS]โs repeated \nrepresentations that if initial relief was not granted but this Court subsequently granted injunctive \nrelief, PPH would be entitled to seek reimbursement for services provided to Arkansas Medicaid \npatients for a year from the date of service (even though no injunction was in place at the time of \nthe service).โ (Dkt. No. 109, at 4) (citing Dkt. No. 26-1, at 17-18, 52; Dkt. No. 21, at 19)).   \n  Ms. de Bacaโs declaration states that, if not for this Courtโs Order ruling in plaintiffsโ \nfavor on most issues but holding additional procedural steps were needed before the Court could \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 16 of 21\nconsider granting a preliminary injunction on behalf of PPHโs patients other than the individual \nJane  Doe  plaintiffs,  combined  with  the  Stateโs  representation  that  PPH  would  have  the \nopportunity to seek reimbursement for services provided during the period that no injunction was \nin place, PPH would have done exactly what it statedโgiven Medicaid patients the option to \nseek services elsewhere or pay out of pocket at PPH (Dkt. No. 109, Ex. A, ยถ 6).  PPH and the \nJane Does state in their motion for preliminary injunction as to the Patient Class that, should the \nCourt deny the instant preliminary injunction motion, that is precisely what PPH will do (Id., ยถ \n8).  The Court credits Ms. de Bacaโs statements in her most recent affidavit and does not \nquestion the business practices and policies of PPH in deciding to cover the costs of Medicaid \nprocedures despite the funding cut.  Ms. de Baca has explained the decision to cover these costs \nin the interim and the actions taken by PPH, and ADHS has not persuaded this Court of the \ncontrary.  The Court will continue to take at face value the sworn statements of Ms. de Baca \nregarding what PPH will do if a preliminary injunction as to the Patient Class does not issue.  \n  ADHS also takes issue with the sliding scale of potential charges discussed by Ms. de \nBaca in her affidavit, claiming that it is too speculative, and takes issue with the ownership of \nPlanned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma (โPPAEOโ) being transferred from PPH \nto Planned Parenthood of Greater Plains (โPPGPโ).  PPH and the Jane Does represent that this \nownership transfer is not scheduled to take place until October 20, 2016 (Dkt. No. 122, at 1).   \nADHS  suggests  that  the  upcoming  transition  is  a  reason  to  deny  the  pending  motion  for \npreliminary injunction on behalf of the Patient Class, on the theory that once PPGP assumes \ncontrol of PPAEO, it may be willing to continue providing unpaid services to its Medicaid \npatients  even  if  this  Court  denies  the  motion,  thus,  according  to  ADHS,  preventing  any \nirreparable injury to the members of the Patient Class (Dkt. No. 121, ยถยถ 1-2).   \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 17 of 21\n  Specifically, ADHS argues that, โ[i]f Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and de Baca \nare not going to be the ones to make those decisionsโsince the plaintiffs contend there is a real \nand significant distinction between all Planned Parenthood affiliatesโthen de Bacaโs declaration \nis even more meaningless and speculative than it was before this revelation.  Certainly, the \nparticulars of the sliding scale de Baca mentioned, and whether some, most, or all patients would \nreceive services without charge in the absence of an injunction (which they have been for nearly \ntwelve months) cannot be answered by the only declaration presented by Planned Parenthoodโ\nthat of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland CEO.โ (Id., ยถ 3).   \n  However, PPH and the Jane Does have put into the record a declaration from Laura \nMcQuade, Chief Executive Officer of PPGP, which states that PPGPโlike PPHโis not willing \nor able to continue providing unpaid services to its PPAEO Medicaid patients indefinitely.  \nRather,  if  the  Patient  Classโs  preliminary  injunction  motion is  still  pending  at  the  time  of \nPPAEOโs transition to PPGP and is subsequently denied, PPAEO will no longer provide these \nservices without payment and will instead give patients insured through Medicaid the option to \ntry to obtain services at another Medicaid provider or to pay for services at PPAEO (Dkt. No. \n122, Ex. A, Decl. of Laura McQuade, ยถยถ 5, 7, 8).     \n  PPH and the Jane Does argue that โPPAEOโs upcoming transition to operation by PPGP \ndoes not change the fact that, if the pending preliminary injunction motion is denied, members of \nthe Patient Class will be unable to access services at PPAEO without paymentโas the Medicaid \nprogram entitles them to doโand thereby will suffer irreparable injury.  Indeed, if anything, the \nPatient Class will now be left in a more precarious position than it was previously because of \nDefendantโs recent attempt to reverse her prior position regarding reimbursement of the services \nPPAEO has been providing without payment to Medicaid patients during the past year.โ (Dkt. \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 18 of 21\nNo. 122, at 2).  The Court agrees.  The Court rejects ADHSโs argument that a future change in \nownership  that  has  yet  to  occur  should  affect  the  Courtโs  analysis  at  this  time,  especially \nconsidering the affidavit from Ms. McQuade, the Chief Executive Officer of PPGP, stating that \nshe plans to handle the Medicaid funding cut exactly like PPH.   \n    C.  Scope Of The Injunction   \n  ADHS  argues  that,  โ[e]ven  if  the  Court  concludes  that  an  expanded  injunction  is \njustified, it must limit the scope of the injunction to reimbursement for future services (services \nprovided  after  the  date  on  which  the  expanded  injunction  is  issued)  provided  by  PPH  to \npatients.โ (Dkt. No. 120, at 7).  ADHS also notes that, โ[i]n its reply, PPH argued that, at the \ntemporary restraining order hearing in September 2015, [A]DHS suggested there was no need for \na temporary restraining order because PPH could submit receipts up to one year after the services \nwere provided. . . .  In addition to being irrelevant for purposes of the proper analysis of the \nscope of a preliminary injunction, this is a mischaracterization of [A]DHSโs position.โ (Id., at 8 \nn.1). \n  ADHS now contends that its โsuggestion was merely that the Court did not need to issue \na  temporary  restraining  order  because  it  could  address  the  question  of  PPHโs  right  to \nreimbursements in โtwo weeksโ at the preliminary injunction stage . . .  The two intervening \nweeks between the TRO and PI stage is far different than the nearly twelve months we are \ntalking about now.โ (Id.).  ADHS further argues that, โmore importantly, [A]DHSโs statement \nwas about what would happen if PPH prevailed on its argument that it had a right to be in the \nMedicaid program. . .  But PPH did not prevail on the initial PI, and cannot prevail on the \nexpanded PI, because the Court has ruled that PPH does not have standing to pursue the claim on \nwhich the PI is based.  This Court simply cannot conclude that PPH has a right to be in the \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 19 of 21\nMedicaid program.  Accordingly, [A]DHSโs previous statement concerning reimbursements if \nthe Court determined PPH has a right to be in the Medicaid program is inapplicable.โ (Id.).   \n  The record on this point regarding representations made about reimbursements speaks \nfor itself (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 26-1, at 48-50 (โQ: What I'm hearing I think from the State is \nservices could still be provided and be billed for 365 days after the service is provided if they are \nreinstated as a provider.   Is that correct?  A: Thatโs correct, Your honor . . . They, of course, can \nkeep the receipts.  And if the Court reinstates them after a preliminary injunction hearing or after \nthe merits, they can do that for up to 365 days.โ); Dkt. No. 39, at 19 (โNor is the alleged harm \nimminent.  Medicaid reimbursements can be filed up to 365 days after the services are provided . \n. .  This case may well be over by then, and if not the Court could revisit the question of an \ninjunction at that point.โ)).  The Court does not construe this anticipated request by PPH for \nreimbursement as being a dispute presented to this Court for resolution at this stage.  However, \nbased upon the record in this case, the Court declines ADHSโs request to limit the injunctive \nrelief awarded to the Patient Class for future services only or to services provided after the date \non which the expanded injunction is issued.  \n  ADHS further argues regarding the scope of the injunction that, โ[i]f the Court requires \n[A]DHS  to  reimburse  PPH  for  Medicaid-eligible  services  provided  to  Arkansas  Medicaid \npatients pending trial, [A]DHS respectfully asks that the Court make clear that its injunction is \nlimited to the specific conduct in question in this litigation.  That is, the Court should make clear \nthat any such injunction does not enjoin [A]DHS from, in the future, terminating PPH from the \nMedicaid program for acts or omissions (other than the conduct at issue in the videos) that fail to \nmeet PPHโs obligations under federal or state Medicaid laws or otherwise require or allow \n[A]DHS to remove PPH from the Medicaid program.โ (Dkt. No. 105, at 16). \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 20 of 21\n  While the parties are engaged in this litigation, the Court is not inclined to narrow the \ninjunction in the manner ADHS requests.  Instead, the injunction this Court issued as to the Jane \nDoes and that it is being asked to issue as to the members of the Patient Class provides sufficient \nleeway for the parties to petition the Court to alter or amend the terms of the injunction, should \nthe facts of the case warrant.   \n  The Court finds that, for all of these reasons and based on the Courtโs findings of fact in \nthis case, the harms alleged by PPH and the Jane Does on behalf of the Patient Class constitute \nirreparable harm sufficient for an injunction.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. \nCommโr of Ind. State Depโt of Health, 794 F. Supp. 2d 892, 912 (S.D. Ind.) (denial of Medicaid \npatientโs free choice of provider is irreparable harm), affโd in part and revโd in part on other \ngrounds, 699 F.3d 962 (7th Cir. 2012); see also Camacho v. Tex. Workforce Commโn, 326 F. \nSupp. 2d 794, 802 (W.D. Tex. 2004) (reduced access to health care, as a result of a state statute \nrestricting access to Medicaid in violation of federal regulations, constituted irreparable harm). \n  Should the Court fail to issue injunctive relief, members of the Patient Class will be \ndenied their choice of provider for family planning services.  The Court finds that, based on its \nassessment at this stage of the litigation on the likelihood of success on the merits, denial of that \nfreedom of choice is more likely than not exactly the injury that Congress sought to avoid when \nit enacted 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) and that the members of the Patient Class will suffer \nirreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is not entered by the Court to preserve the status quo \nwhile this case is pending.  PPH and the Jane Does have met their burden of demonstrating that \nmembers of the Patient Class will suffer irreparable harm in the absence  of the requested \npreliminary injunction.    \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 127   Filed 09/29/16   Page 21 of 21\nIV.  Security \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), a district court may issue a preliminary \ninjunction โonly if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay \nthe costs and damages  sustained by  any party  found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  As this Court stated when it entered the temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction order on behalf of the Jane Does, this Court does not perceive \nhow  ADHS  could  be  harmed  by  reimbursing  PPH  for  services  provided  to  the  Jane  Doe \nMedicaid patients and the Patient Class members, considering that ADHS likely would and will \nhave to pay the same amount for benefits of these patients regardless of who the patientsโ \nMedicaid provider happens to be.  For these reasons, the Court declines to require security from \nthe Jane Does or members of the Patient Class.   \nV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court determines that PPH and the Jane Does have met \ntheir burden on behalf of the Patient Class for the issuance of a preliminary injunction as to the \nPatient Class members.  Therefore, the Court grants the motion for preliminary injunction on \nbehalf of the Patient Class (Dkt. No. 98).  The Court enjoins ADHS from suspending Medicaid \npayments to PPH for services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries who are members of the Patient \nClass until further order from this Court. \n  So ordered this 29th day of September, 2016, at 3:00 p.m. CST. \n                                                                                               \n \n_______________________________ \n                                  Kristine G.

This civil action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to vindicate rights \nsecured by the federal Medicaid statutes, as well as the U.S. Constitution.   \n2.  Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma, Inc., d/b/a Planned \nParenthood Great Plains (โPPAEOโ), provides critically needed family planning and preventive \nhealth services to hundreds of women and men in underserved Pulaski County (where PPAEOโs \nLittle Rock health center is located) and Washington County (where PPAEOโs Fayetteville \nhealth center is located) through the Medicaid program.   \n \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 2 of 17\n3.  As is required by federal law, Medicaid enrollees may seek family planning and \nother preventive health services from a participating provider of their choice and have those \nservices covered by Medicaid.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 and other \nclass members are such individualsโpatients of PPAEO who are enrolled in Medicaid and who \nprefer PPAEO to other Medicaid providers.  Arkansas Medicaid does not pay for abortions \nexcept in extremely narrow circumstances, and Medicaid reimbursement for abortion is not at \nissue in this litigation.   \n4.  On August 14, 2015, without giving any warning or expressing any previous \nconcerns about PPAEOโs participation in the Medicaid program, Defendant John Selig, then \nDirector of the Arkansas Department of Human Services (โDHSโ), notified PPAEO that DHS \nwas terminating PPAEOโs Medicaid provider agreements, effective 30 days after the date of the \nnotice.  While the notice gave no reason for the termination, Governor Asa Hutchinson issued a \npress release the same day, stating he had directed DHS to terminate the agreements and giving \nas the sole reason that โ[i]t is apparent after the recent revelations on the actions of Planned \nParenthood that this organization does not represent the values of the people of our state and \nArkansas is better served by terminating any and all existing contracts with them.โ  Press \nRelease, Ark. Governor Asa Hutchinson, Governor Asa Hutchinson Directs DHS to End \nContract with Planned Parenthood (Aug. 14, 2015), http://governor.arkansas.gov/press-\nreleases/detail/governor-asa-hutchinson-directs-dhs-to-end-contract-with-planned-parenthood.  \nThe reference to โrecent revelationsโ appears to relate to heavily edited and misleading videos \nthat have been released by opponents of Planned Parenthood, making claims about other Planned \nParenthood providersโ abortion practices in other states.  Notably, nothing in Governor \nHutchinsonโs press release relates to the quality of Medicaid services provided by PPAEO. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 3 of 17\n5.  DHS followed this communication with a second termination letter, this time \npurporting to terminate PPAEOโs Medicaid agreements โfor cause,โ and stating that for-cause \ntermination may be effective immediately, but that DHS would delay the effective date of the \ntermination to coincide with the effective date from the prior termination letter. \n6.  In describing the cause for the termination, the second termination letter states \nsolely that โthe โfor causeโ termination is based in part upon the troubling circumstances and \nactivities that have recently come to light regarding the national Planned Parenthood \norganization, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, and other affiliated Planned Parenthood \nentities, all of which are affiliated with [PPAEO],โ and that โthere is evidence that PPAEO \nand/or its affiliates are acting in an unethical manner and engaging in what appears to be \nwrongful conduct.โ  The letter also states that PPAEO is โwelcome to submit information or \noffer comments on the nationally recognized videos that have raised questions on the conduct of \nPlanned Parenthood.โ  No other cause or explanation for the termination is given.  Again, \nnothing in the letter relates to the quality of Medicaid services provided by PPAEO, and the \nreason for the termination appears to be the same videos that were the basis for the first \ntermination. \n7.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to protect PPAEOโs patientsโ \naccess toโand PPAEOโs own ability to provideโthese critical medical services.  Defendantโs \nactions violate Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States Code (โMedicaid Freedom \nof Choice Provisionโ) because, by barring PPAEO from the Medicaid program, it prevents \nPPAEOโs patients, including Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 and other \nclass members, from receiving services from the qualified, willing provider of their choice.  \n- 3 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 4 of 17\nDefendantโs actions further impermissibly penalize Plaintiffs without adequate justification, in \nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.   \n8.  Unless enjoined, the termination of PPAEOโs Medicaid provider agreements will \nfirst affect patients on September 21, 2015, disqualifying PPAEO from providing basic and \npreventive health care services to the women, men, and teens who depend on that care.  \nDefendantโs actions will cause significant and irreparable harm to PPAEO and to its Medicaid \npatients, including Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 and other class \nmembers, who will lose their provider of choice, will find their family planning services \ninterrupted, and will be left with few or no adequate alternative providers. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  Subject-matter jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and \n1343. \n10.  Plaintiffsโ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court.   \n11.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \nTHE PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs   \n12.  Plaintiff Planned Parenthood of Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma, Inc., doing \nbusiness as Planned Parenthood Great Plains, (โPPAEOโ) is a not-for-profit corporation \nheadquartered in Oklahoma and licensed to do business in Arkansas. When Plaintiffs filed this \naction, PPAEO was a wholly owned subsidiary of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland (โPPHโ) \nand was doing business as Planned Parenthood of the Heartland. On October 20, 2016, PPH \n- 4 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 5 of 17\ntransferred control of PPAEO to Planned Parenthood Great Plains.  Plaintiff PPAEO brings this \naction on behalf of itself and its Arkansas patients.   \n13.  PPAEO (or predecessor organizations) have provided high quality reproductive \nhealth care in Arkansas for more than 30 years.  PPAEO operates two health centers in Arkansas, \none in Little Rock and one in Fayetteville, and participates in the Medicaid program, providing \nmedical services to low-income enrollees in both communities.  The family planning and other \npreventive health services provided by PPAEO at these and its other health centers include \ncontraception and contraceptive counseling; physical exams; screening for breast cancer; \nscreening and treatment for cervical cancer; testing and treatment for certain sexually transmitted \ninfections (โSTIsโ); pregnancy testing and counseling; menโs health services; and general health \nservices including smoking cessation and screening for diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood \npressure, and anemia.   \n14.  In fiscal year (FY) 2015, PPAEO provided more than 1,000 health care visits and \nfiled more than 1,100 prescriptions for over 500 women, men and teens insured through \nMedicaid in Little Rock and Fayetteville.  In FY 2014, the numbers were even higherโmore \nthan 1600 health care visits and 2,600 prescriptions, for over 1,100 women, men and teens \ninsured through Medicaid in Little Rock and Fayetteville.   \n15.  During FY 2015, PPAEO provided over 100 well woman exams (which include \nbreast exams), nearly 100 pap smears, over 350 visits to screen for STIs, and over 450 visits for \nlong acting reversible contraceptives (โLARCsโ) and injectable contraceptives to its Medicaid \npatients.  During FY 2014, PPAEO provided over 250 well woman exams, 180 pap smears, 600 \nvisits to screen for STIs, and 750 visits for LARCs and injectable contraceptives to its Medicaid \npatients.   \n- 5 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 6 of 17\n16.  PPAEO also provides early medication abortions at these health centers.  \nArkansas Medicaid does not cover these services in virtually all circumstances, and Medicaid \npayment for abortion is not at issue in this case. \n17.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, an Arkansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPAEOโs Little Rock health center and desires to continue to do so.   \n18.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #2, an Arkansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPAEOโs Little Rock health center and desires to continue to do so. \n19.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3, an Arkansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPAEOโs Little Rock health center and desires to continue to do so. \n20.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 appear pseudonymously \nbecause of the private and personal nature of the medical care that they receive at PPAEO and \ntheir desire not to have that information become public in order for them to assert their legal \nrights.   \nB.  Defendant \n21.  Defendant Cindy Gillespie is the Director of DHS.  DHS is the agency that \nadministers Arkansasโs state Medicaid program and has notified PPAEO that it intends to \nterminate its provider agreements.  Defendant Gillespie is sued in her official capacity, as are her \nemployees, agents, and successors in office. \nTHE MEDICAID PROGRAM \nA.  The Medicaid Statute \n22.  The Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of \n1935, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396 et seq., pays for medical care for eligible needy people.  A state may \nelect whether or not to participate; if it chooses to do so, it must comply with the requirements \n- 6 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 7 of 17\nimposed by the Medicaid statute and by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services (โHHSโ) in her administration of Medicaid.  See generally 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396a(a)(1)-(83). \n23.  To receive federal funding, a participating state must develop a โplan for medical \nassistanceโ and submit it to the Secretary of HHS for approval.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a). \n24.  Among other requirements, the State plan must provide that: โ[A]ny individual \neligible for medical assistance .  .  .  may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, \ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required .  .  .  who \nundertakes to provide him such services.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A). \n25.  Congress has singled out family planning services for special additional \nprotections to ensure freedom of choice, specifically providing that, with respect to these \nservices and with certain limited exceptions not applicable here, โenrollment of an individual \neligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management system .  .  ., a Medicaid \nmanaged care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person \nfrom whom the individual may receive services.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(B).   \n26.  The federal government reimburses the state of Arkansas 90% of expenditures \nattributable to offering, arranging, and furnishing family planning services and supplies in \nMedicaid.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396b(a)(5). \nB.    Implementation of the Medicaid Act \n27.  For decades, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (โCMSโ), the agency \nwithin HHS that administers Medicaid (and its predecessor organization), has repeatedly \ninterpreted the โqualifiedโ language in Section 1396a(a)(23) to prohibit states from denying \naccess to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that provider to perform Medicaid-\n- 7 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 8 of 17\ncovered services or to properly bill for those services, including reasons such as the scope of the \nmedical services that the provider chooses to offer.   \n28.  CMS has explained that โ[t]he purpose of the free choice provision is to allow \n[Medicaid] recipients the same opportunities to choose among available providers of covered \nhealth care and services as are normally offered to the general population.โ  Ctrs. For Medicare \n& Medicaid Servs., CMS Manuals Publication #45, State Medicaid Manual ยง 2100.   \n29.  Consistent with this understanding, CMS has a long history of rejecting state \nplans that seek to limit the type of provider that can provide particular services.  See, e.g., 53 \nFed. Reg. 8699 (Mar.  16, 1988) (noting rejection of a state plan that would limit providers to \nโprivate nonprofitโ organizations); 67 Fed. Reg. 79121 (Dec.  27, 2002) (noting disapproval of a \nstate plan amendment that would have limited โbeneficiary choice .  .  .  by imposing standards \nthat are not reasonably related to the qualifications of providersโ). \n30.  More recently, CMS rejected an Indiana plan that barred state agencies from \ncontracting with or making grants to any entities that perform abortion because it violated the \nMedicaid freedom of choice provision.  Letter from Donald M. Berwick, Admโr., CMS, to \nPatricia Casanova, Dir., Ind. Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (June 1, 2011), \nhttp://www.politico.com/static/PPM169_110601_indiana_letter.html. \n31.  Moreover, even though CMS is permitted to waive ยง 1396a(a)(23) in \ndemonstration projects approved under Social Security Act ยง 1115, CMS repeatedly rejects state \nrequests to do so for family planning services, including twice in the last year: first in \nPennsylvania, see Letter from Marilyn Tavenner, Admโr, CMS, to Beverly Mackereth, Secโy, Pa. \nDepโt of Public Welfare (Aug.  28, 2014), http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-\nInformation/By-Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/pa/pa-healthy-ca.pdf (โNo waiver of freedom \n- 8 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 9 of 17\nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.โ); and more recently in Iowa, see Letter \nfrom Manning Pellanda, Dir., CMS Div. of State Demonstrations and Waivers, to Julie \nLovelady, Interim Medicaid Dir., Iowa Depโt of Human Servs. (Feb.  2, 2015), \nhttp://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-\nTopics/Waivers/1115/downloads/ia/ia-marketplace-choice-plan-ca.pdf (โNo waiver of freedom \nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.โ). \nHUTCHINSON ADMINISTRATIONโS EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE PPAEO \n32.  On August 14, without prior notice, Defendant notified PPAEO that it was \nterminating PPAEOโs provider agreements, to be effective in 30 days, on September 13, 2015. \n33.  Because of previously scheduled staff training and clinician vacation, the first day \nafter September 13 that patients insured through the Medicaid program are scheduled to be seen \nat one of PPAEOโs Arkansas health centers is September 21, 2015.  Therefore, absent an \ninjunction, patients insured through the Medicaid program who choose to get family planning \nand other health care services at PPAEO will lose access to those services on September 21, \n2015.   \n34.  Defendantโs letter provided no reason for the termination of PPAEOโs \nagreements.  However, that same day, Governor Hutchinson issued a press release stating he had \ndirected DHS to terminate the agreements and giving as the sole reason that โ[i]t is apparent after \nthe recent revelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood that this organization does not \nrepresent the values of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served by terminating any \nand all existing contracts with them.โ  Press Release, Ark. Governor Asa Hutchinson.  The \nreference to โrecent revelationsโ appears to relate to heavily edited and misleading videos that \nhave been released by opponents of Planned Parenthood, making claims about the practices of a \n- 9 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 10 of 17\nsmall number of Planned Parenthood affiliates that allow patients at some health centers to \ndonate fetal tissue following an abortion in order to advance medical research.  While all Planned \nParenthood affiliates comply with all federal and state laws, PPAEO does not participate in any \nfetal tissue donation (in Arkansas or elsewhere), and does not appear in any of the videos.  \n35.  DHS followed this communication with a second termination letter, this time \npurporting to terminate PPAEOโs Medicaid agreements โfor cause,โ and stating that for-cause \ntermination may be effective immediately, but that DHS would delay the effective date of the \ntermination to coincide with the effective date from the prior termination letter. \n36.  In describing the cause for the termination, the second termination letter states \nsolely that it โis based in part upon the troubling circumstances and activities that have recently \ncome to light regarding the national Planned Parenthood organization, Planned Parenthood of the \nHeartland, and other affiliated Planned Parenthood entities, all of which are affiliated with \n[PPAEO],โ and that โโthere is evidence that PPAEO and/or its affiliates are acting in an \nunethical manner and engaging in what appears to be wrongful conduct.โ  The letter also states \nthat PPAEO is โwelcome to submit information or offer comments on the nationally recognized \nvideos that have raised questions on the conduct of Planned Parenthood.โ  No other cause or \nexplanation for the termination is given.  Again, nothing in the letter relates to the quality of \nMedicaid services provided by PPAEO, and the reason for the termination appears to be the \nsame videos that were the basis for the first termination. \n37.  CMS has advised Defendant that her actions to terminate PPAEOโs provider \nagreements likely violate the Medicaid freedom of choice provision.   \n- 10 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 11 of 17\nTHE IMPACT OF DEFENDANTโS ACTIONS ON PPAEO AND ITS PATIENTS \n38.  The need for publicly supported family planning services is great in Arkansas, \nwhich regularly ranks among the worst states for reproductive care.  In 2010, 55% of \npregnancies in Arkansas were unintended.

Moreover, Arkansas has high rates of STIs: the state ranks second in congenital \nsyphilis, eighth in chlamydia, tenth in primary and secondary syphilis, and eleventh in \ngonorrhea.  Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance \n2013 79, 91, 105, 122 (2014), http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/surv2013-print.pdf. \n39.  In Arkansas in 2010, an estimated 317,720 women needed contraceptive services \nand supplies.  Of these, 62%โ198,090 womenโneeded publicly supported services.  \nGuttmacher Inst., Contraceptive Needs and Services, 2010: County Data for Arkansas (2014), \nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/win/counties/pdf/WIN-2010-Arkansas.pdf.  In Pulaski County \nalone (where PPAEOโs Little Rock health center is located), an estimated 47,700 women needed \ncontraceptive services and supplies in 2010, of which 26,390 (55%) needed publicly supported \nservices.  Id.   \n40.  If Defendantโs actions take effect, many of PPAEOโs Medicaid patients in Little \nRock and Fayetteville, who already have few or no alternative options, will find it difficult or \n- 11 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 12 of 17\nimpossible to access the reproductive and other health care services they need.  Those who are \nable to find other providers will often have to wait unacceptable periods of time for an \nappointment.  Those who are unable to find an adequate alternative will not receive the medical \nservices they need, which will lead to higher rates of unintended pregnancies, STIs, and \nundiagnosed cancers. \n41.  Other Medicaid providers in Little Rock and Fayetteville are already stretched to \nthe breaking point, even with PPAEO providing care.  It is very difficult to locate a private \nob/gyn who will take a Medicaid patient who is not pregnant, and the ones that will often have \nwait times of several months.  At both community health centers and private ob/gyns, even if a \npatient can obtain an appointment, she may be unable to obtain (either at all, or without \nsignificant delays) the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives, including IUDs and Depo \nProvera, which are the most effective forms of birth control.  Indeed, other Medicaid providers \nsometimes refer their patients to PPAEOโs health centers for these services.  Other clinics are \ndifficult for PPAEOโs low-income patients to travel to.   \n42.  If PPAEO is forced to stop providing care through the Medicaid program, a dire \nsituation will become critical.  The remaining providers will be simply unable to absorb \nPPAEOโs patients, leaving those patients without access to crucial medical services.   \n43.  Even if other providers were available, patients insured through Medicaid choose \nPPAEO based on a number of factors that are generally not available at other providers.  With its \nevidence-based practices and up-to-date technology, PPAEO is known as a provider of high-\nquality, compassionate medical care.  Many individuals who receive some health care elsewhere \nchoose PPAEO for their reproductive health care because they are concerned about their privacy \nand because they fear being judged by other providers. \n- 12 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 13 of 17\n44.  In addition, many low-income patients have unique scheduling constraints \nbecause they are juggling inflexible work schedules, childcare obligations, transportation \nchallenges, and lack of childcare resources.  To help these patients get access to family planning \nand other services, PPAEO offers its full range of services to walk-in patients.  This flexibility is \nespecially important for patients receiving Depo-Provera injections (which must be given every \nninety days), or starting a new form of birth control, as well as for patients who are having \nsymptoms that make them concerned.  PPAEO gets walk-in patients every day.  In addition, \nPPAEO spaces patient appointments so as to minimize wait times.  PPAEOโs health centers \noften have Spanish-speaking staff available for patients, and have translator services in a wide \nrange of languages available to non-English speaking patients at all times.   \n45.  Defendantโs actions will deprive all of PPAEOโs Medicaid patients, including \nPlaintiffs Jane Doe #1, #2, and #3 and other class members, of access to the high-quality, \nspecialized care that PPAEO provides.   \n46.  All three individual Plaintiffs rely on PPAEO as the place they can turn to for \ncritical medical care and for prompt, efficient, and compassionate services.  If PPAEO is \neliminated from Medicaid, they will be prevented from receiving services through the Medicaid \nprogram from their provider of choice, will have their health care interrupted, and may encounter \ndifficulties finding alternative care. \n47.  Without Medicaid reimbursements, PPAEO may be unable to continue to provide \nservices in the same manner and may be forced to lay off staff members and/or reduce hours at \none or both health centers.  Further, if PPAEOโs termination from the Medicaid program is \nallowed to take effect for some period of time and it then is later allowed to become a Medicaid \nprovider again, some patients will remain confused about whether PPAEO is a Medicaid \n- 13 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 14 of 17\nprovider in good standing, and therefore will not return as patients.  For these reasons, should \nPPAEO be allowed back as a Medicaid provider, it would be very difficultโif not impossibleโ\nfor PPAEO to resume its operations as they are today.  If PPAEO reduces hours at its health \ncenters, this will affect not only its Medicaid patients, but all of its patients.   \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n48.  This suit is properly maintainable as a class action under Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2). \n49.  The class consists of all Medicaid patients in Arkansas who seek to obtain, or \ndesire to obtain, covered health care services at PPAEO. \n50.  Although the size of the class going forward is unknowable, as alleged in \nParagraph 15, PPAEO provided covered health care services to over 500 patients in FY 2015 and \nover 1,100 patients in FY 2014.  Thus the current approximate size of the class is over 500 \nindividuals. \n51.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 are adequate class \nrepresentatives because they, like other members of the class, are Arkansas residents and \nMedicaid patients who obtain their reproductive health care at a PPAEO health center and desire \nto continue to do so.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, class representatives and class \nmembers will suffer the same injury and resulting harm: they will be unable to obtain health care \nservices through the Medicaid program at the provider of their choice, PPAEO.  In addition, as a \nresult, many of PPAEOโs Medicaid patients, including Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and \nJane Doe #3 and other class members, will find it difficult or impossible to access comparable \nreproductive and other health care services. \n- 14 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 15 of 17\n52.  Defendantโs actionsโterminating PPAEO from the Medicaid programโapplies \ngenerally to the class, such that both declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate for all \nmembers of the class. \n53.  Class members raise the same question of law, including whether Defendantโs \ntermination of PPAEOโs Medicaid provider agreements violates the Medicaid freedom-of-choice \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23), such that, as a practical matter, adjudication of their claims \nwould be dispositive of the interests of other class members. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM I โ MEDICAID ACT (TITLE XIX OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT) \n54.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 53 above. \n55.  Defendantโs action violates Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States \nCode by denying PPAEOโs patients, including the Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane \nDoe #3 and other class members, the right to choose any willing, qualified healthcare provider in \nthe Medicaid program. \nCLAIM II โ FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS โ PENALIZING \nCONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITY \n \n56.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 53 above. \n57.  Defendantโs action penalizes Plaintiffs for their constitutionally protected \nassociation with Planned Parenthood and/or abortion, without adequate justification. \nCLAIM III โ FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION \n58.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 53 above. \n59.  Defendantโs action violates Plaintiffsโ rights by singling them out for unfavorable \ntreatment without adequate justification. \n- 15 - \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 135   Filed 11/30/16   Page 16 of 17\nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n60.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendantโs action violates the Medicaid Act; \n61.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendantโs action violates the First and \nFourteenth Amendments; \n62.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without bond, enjoining \nDefendant, her agents, employees, appointees, delegates, or successors from excluding PPAEO \nas a Medicaid provider;  \n63.

This civil action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to vindicate rights \nsecured by the federal Medicaid statutes, as well as the U.S. Constitution. \n2.  Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma, d/b/a Planned \nParenthood of the Heartland (\"PPH\"), provides critically needed family planning and preventive \nhealth services to hundreds of women and men in underserved Pulaski County (where PPH's \nLittle Rock health center is located) and Washington County (where PPH's Fayetteville health \ncenter is located) through the Medicaid program. \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 2 of 14\n3.  As is required by federal law, Medicaid enrollees may seek family planning and \nother preventive health services from a participating provider of their choice and have those \nservices covered by Medicaid.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 are such \nwomen - patients of PPH who are enrolled in Medicaid and who prefer PPH to other Medicaid \nproviders.  Arkansas Medicaid does not pay for abortions except in extremely narrow \ncircumstances, and Medicaid reimbursement for abortion is not at issue in this litigation. \n4.  On August 14, 2015, without giving any warning or expressing any previous \nconcerns about PPH' s participation in the Medicaid program, Defendant John Selig, Director of \nthe Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"DHS\"), notified PPH that DHS was terminating \nPPH's Medicaid provider agreements, effective 30 days after the date of the notice.  While the \nnotice gave no reason for the termination, Governor Asa Hutchinson issued a press release the \nsame day, stating he had directed DHS to terminate the agreements and giving as the sole reason \nthat \"[i]t is apparent after the recent revelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood that this \norganization does not represent the values of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served \nby terminating any and all existing contracts with them.\"  Press Release, Ark.

The reference to \"recent revelations\" \nappears to relate to heavily edited and misleading videos that have been released by opponents of \nPlanned Parenthood, making claims about other Planned Parenthood providers' abortion \npractices in other states.  Notably, nothing in Governor Hutchinson's press release relates to the \nquality of Medicaid services provided by PPH. \n-2 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 3 of 14\n5.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to protect PPH's patients' access \nto - and PPH's own ability to provide - these critical medical services.  Defendant's actions \nviolate Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States Code (\"Medicaid Freedom of \nChoice Provision\") because, by barring PPH from the Medicaid program, it prevents PPH' s \npatients, including Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, from receiving services \nfrom the qualified, willing provider of their choice.  Defendant's actions further impermissibly \npenalize Plaintiffs without adequate justification, in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n6.  Unless enjoined, the termination of PPH's Medicaid provider agreements will \ntake effect on September 13, 2015, disqualifying PPH from providing basic and preventive \nhealth care services to the women, men, and teens who depend on that care.  Defendant's actions \nwill cause significant and irreparable harm to PPH and to its Medicaid patients, including \nPlaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, who will lose their provider of choice, \nwill find their family planning services interrupted, and will be left with few or no adequate \nalternative providers. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Subject-matter jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and \n1343. \n8.  Plaintiffs' claims for d~claratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง 2201and2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court. \n9.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \n- 3 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 4 of 14\nTHE PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n10.  Plaintiff Planned Parenthood of Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma, doing business as \nPlanned Parenthood of the Heartland, (\"PPH\"), is an Arkansas not-for-profit corporation \nheadquartered in Iowa and licensed to do business in Arkansas and is a wholly-owned subsidiary \nof Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.  PPH brings this action on behalf of itself and its \nArkansas patients. \n11.  PPH (or predecessor organizations) have provided high quality reproductive \nhealth care in Arkansas for more than thirty years.  PPH operates two health centers in Arkansas, \none in Little Rock and one in Fayetteville, and participates in the Medicaid program, providing \nmedical services to low-income enrollees in both communities.  The family planning and other \npreventive health services provided by PPH at these and its other health centers include \ncontraception and contraceptive counseling; physical exams; screening for breast cancer; \nscreening and treatment for cervical cancer; testing and treatment for certain sexually transmitted \ninfections (\"STis\"); pregnancy testing and counseling; men's health services; and general health \nservices including smoking cessation and screening for diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood \npressure, and anemia. \n12.  PPH also operates a pharmacy that serves patients in Arkansas.  Through this \nservice patients, including patients insured through Medicaid, are able to have their contraception \nprescriptions automatically refilled and mailed to their homes every month. \n13.  In fiscal year (FY) 2015, PPH provided more than 1,000 health care visits and \nfiled more than 1, 100 prescriptions for over 500 women, men and teens insured through \nMedicaid in Little Rock and Fayetteville.  In FY 2014, the numbers were even higher - more \n-4 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 5 of 14\nthan 1600 health care visits and 2,600 prescriptions, for over 1, 100 women, men and teens \ninsured through Medicaid in Little Rock and Fayetteville. \n14.  During FY 2015, PPH provided over 100 well woman exams (which include \nbreast exams), nearly 100 pap smears, over 350 visits to screen for STis, and over 450 visits for \nlong acting reversible contraceptives (\"LARCs\") and injectable contraceptives to its Medicaid \npatients.  During FY 2014, PPH provided over 250 well woman exams, 180 pap smears, 600 \nvisits to screen for STis, and 750 visits for LARCs and injectable contraceptives to its Medicaid \npatients. \n15.  PPH also provides abortions at some of its health centers.  At its Arkansas health \ncenters, PPH offers only early medication abortions, but Arkansas Medicaid does not cover these \nservices in virtually all circumstances, and Medicaid payment for abortion is not at issue in this \ncase. \n16.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, an Arkansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPH's Little Rock health center and desires to continue to do so. \n17.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #2, an Arkansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPH's Little Rock health center and desires to continue to do so. \n18.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3, an Arkansas resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPH's Little Rock health center and desires to continue to do so. \n19.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 appear pseudonymously \nbecause of the private and personal nature of the medical care that they receive at PPH and their \ndesire not to have that information become public in order for them to assert their legal rights. \n- 5 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 6 of 14\nB.  Defendant \n20.  Defendant John Selig is the Director of DHS.  DHS is the agency that administers \nArkansas's state Medicaid program and has notified PPH that it intends to terminate its provider \nagreements.  Defendant Selig is sued in his official capacity, as are his employees, agents, and \nsuccessors in office. \nTHE MEDICAID PROGRAM \nA.  The Medicaid Statute \n21.  The Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of \n1935, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396 et seq., pays for medical care for eligible needy people.  A state may \nelect whether or not to participate; if it chooses to do so, it must comply with the requirements \nimposed by the Medicaid statute and by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services (\"HHS\") in her administration of Medicaid.  See generally 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396a(a)(l )-(83). \n22.  To receive federal funding, a participating state must develop a \"plan for medical \nassistance\" and submit it to the Secretary of HHS for approval.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a). \n23.  Among other requirements, the State plan must provide that: \"[A]ny individual \neligible for medical assistance ... may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, \ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required ... who \nundertakes to provide him such services.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A). \n24.  Congress has singled out family planning services for special additional \nprotections to ensure freedom of choice, specifically providing that, with respect to these \nservices and with certain limited exceptions not applicable here, \"enrollment of an individual \neligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management system ...,  a Medicaid \n-6 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 7 of 14\nmanaged care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person \nfrom whom the individual may receive services.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(B). \n25.  The federal government reimburses the state of Arkansas 90% of expenditures \nattributable to offering, arranging, and furnishing family planning services and supplies in \nMedicaid.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396b(a)(5). \nB.  Implementation of the Medicaid Act \n26.  For decades, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), the agency \nwithin HHS that administers Medicaid (and its predecessor organization), has repeatedly \ninterpreted the \"qualified\" language in Section 1396a(a)(23) to prohibit states from denying \naccess to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that provider to perform Medicaid \ncovered services or to properly bill for those services, including reasons such as the scope of the \nmedical services that the provider chooses to offer. \n27.  CMS has explained that \"[t]he purpose of the free choice provision is to allow \n[Medicaid] recipients the same opportunities to choose among available providers of covered \nhealth care and services as are normally offered to the general population.\"  Ctrs. For Medicare \n& Medicaid Servs., CMS Manuals Publication #45, State Medicaid Manualยง 2100. \n28.  Consistent with this understanding, CMS has a long history ofrejecting state \nplans that seek to limit the type of provider that can provide particular services.  See, e.g., 53 \nFed. Reg. 8699 (Mar.  16, 1988) (noting rejection of a state plan that would limit providers to \n\"private nonprofit\" organizations); 67 Fed. Reg. 79121 (Dec.  27, 2002) (noting disapproval of a \nstate plan amendment that would have limited \"beneficiary choice .  .  . by imposing standards \nthat are not reasonably related to the qualifications of providers\"). \n-7 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 8 of 14\n29.  More recently, CMS rejected an Indiana plan that barred state agencies from \ncontracting with or making grants to any entities that perform abortion because it violated the \nMedicaid freedom of choice provision.  Letter from Donald M. Berwick, Adm'r., CMS, to \nPatricia Casanova, Dir., Ind. Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (June 1, 2011), \nhttp://www.politico.com/static/PPMl 69 _110601 _indiana_ letter.html. \n30.  Moreover, even though CMS is permitted to waiveยง 1396a(a)(23) in \ndemonstration projects approved under Social Security Actยง 1115, CMS repeatedly rejects state \nrequests to do so for family planning services, including twice in the last year: first in \nPennsylvania, see Letter from Marilyn Tavenner, Adm'r, CMS, to Beverly Mackereth, Sec'y, Pa. \nDep't of Public Welfare (Aug.  28, 2014), http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program \nInformation/By-Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/pa/pa-healthy-ca.pdf (\"No waiver of freedom \nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.\"); and more recently in Iowa, see Letter \nfrom Manning Pellanda, Dir., CMS Div. of State Demonstrations and Waivers, to Julie \nLovelady, Interim Medicaid Dir., Iowa Dep't of Human Servs. (Feb.  2, 2015), \nhttp://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By \nTopics/Waivers/1115/downloads/ia/ia-marketplace-choice-plan-ca.pdf (\"No waiver of freedom \nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.\"). \nHUTCHINSON ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE PPH \n31.  On August 14, without prior notice, Defendant notified PPH that it was \nterminating PPH's provider agreements, to be effective in 30 days, on September 13, 2015. \n32.  Because of previously scheduled staff training and clinician vacation, the first day \nafter September 13 that patients insured through the Medicaid program are scheduled to be seen \nat one of PPH's Arkansas health centers is September 21, 2015.  Therefore, absent an injunction, \n-8 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 9 of 14\npatients insured through the Medicaid program who choose to get family planning and other \nhealth care services at PPH will lose access to those services on September 21, 2015. \n33.  Defendant's letter provided no reason for the termination of PPH's agreements. \nHowever, that same day, Governor Hutchinson issued a press release stating he had directed \nDHS to terminate the agreements and giving as the sole reason that \"[i]t is apparent after the \nrecent revelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood that this organization does not represent \nthe values of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served by terminating any and all \nexisting contracts with them.\"  Press Release, Ark. Governor Asa Hutchinson.  The reference to \n\"recent revelations\" appears to relate to heavily edited and misleading videos that have been \nreleased by opponents of Planned Parenthood, making claims about the practices of a small \nnumber of Planned Parenthood affiliates that allow patients at some health centers to donate fetal \ntissue following an abortion in order to advance medical research.  While all Planned Parenthood \naffiliates comply with all federal and state laws, PPH does not participate in any fetal tissue \ndonation (in Arkansas or elsewhere), and does not appear in any of the videos. \n34.  CMS has advised Defendant that his actions to terminate PPH's provider \nagreements likely violate the Medicaid freedom of choice provision. \nTHE IMPACT OF DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS ON PPH AND ITS PATIENTS \n35.  The need for publicly supported family planning services is great in Arkansas, \nwhich regularly ranks among the worst states for reproductive care.  In 2010, 55% of \npregnancies in Arkansas were unintended.  Guttmacher Inst., State Facts About Unintended \nPregnancy: Arkansas (2014 ), https ://www.guttmacher.org/s tatecenter/unintended-\npregnancy/ pdf/ AR.pdf (hereafter \"State Facts: Arkansas\").  The state is tied for the third highest \nteen pregnancy rate among the 50 states.  Kathryn Kost & Stanley Henshaw, Guttmacher Inst., \n-9 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 10 of 14\nU.S.  Teenage Pregnancies, Births and Abortions, 2010: National and State Trends by Age, Race \nand Ethnicity 4 (2014), http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/USTPtrendslO.pdf.  72% of Arkansas's \nunplanned births are publicly funded, which is higher than the national average of 68%.  State \nFacts: Arkansas.  Moreover, Arkansas has high rates of STis: the state ranks second in congenital \nsyphilis, eighth in chlamydia, tenth in primary and secondary syphilis, and eleventh in \ngonorrhea.  Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, Sexually Transmitted Disease \nSurveillance 2013 79, 91, 105, 122 (2014), http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/surv2013-\nprint.pdf. \n36.  In Arkansas in 2010, an estimated 317,720 women needed contraceptive services \nand supplies.  Of these, 62%- 198,090 women - needed publicly supported services. \nGuttmacher Inst., Contraceptive Needs and Services, 2010: County Data for Arkansas (2014), \nhttp://www. guttmacher. org/pubs/win/c ounties/pdf/WIN-2010-Arkansas. pdf.  In Pulaski County \nalone (where PPH's Little Rock health center is located), an estimated 47,700 women needed \ncontraceptive services and supplies in 2010, of which 26,390 (55%) needed publicly supported \nservices.  Id. \n37.  If Defendant's actions take effect, many of PPH's Medicaid patients in Little \nRock and Fayetteville, who already have few or no alternative options, will find it difficult or \nimpossible to access the reproductive and other health care services they need.  Those who are \nable to find other providers will often have to wait unacceptable periods of time for an \nappointment.  Those who are unable to find an adequate alternative will not receive the medical \nservices they need, which will lead to higher rates of unintended pregnancies, STis, and \nundiagnosed cancers. \n- 10 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 11 of 14\n38.  Other Medicaid providers in Little Rock and Fayetteville are already stretched to \nthe breaking point, even with PPH providing care.  It is very difficult to locate a private ob/gyn \nwho will take a Medicaid patient who is not pregnant, and the ones that will often have wait \ntimes of several months.  At both community health centers and private ob/gyns, even if a patient \ncan obtain an appointment, she may be unable to obtain (either at all, or without significant \ndelays) the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives, including IUDs and Depo Provera, which \nare the most effective forms of birth control.  Indeed, other Medicaid providers sometimes refer \ntheir patients to PPH's health centers for these services.  Other clinics are difficult for PPH's \nlow-income patients to travel to. \n39.  If PPH is forced to stop providing care through the Medicaid program, a dire \nsituation will become critical.  The remaining providers will be simply unable to absorb PPH' s \npatients, leaving those patients without access to crucial medical services. \n40.  Even if other providers were available, patients insured through Medicaid choose \nPPH based on a number of factors that are generally not available at other providers.  With its \nevidence-based practices and up-to-date technology, PPH is known as a provider of high-quality, \ncompassionate medical care.  Many individuals who receive some health care elsewhere choose \nPPH for their reproductive health care because they are concerned about their privacy and \nbecause they fear being judged by other providers. \n41.  In addition, many low-income patients have unique scheduling constraints \nbecause they are juggling inflexible work schedules, childcare obligations, transportation \nchallenges, and lack of childcare resources.  To help these patients get access to family planning \nand other services, PPH offers its full range of services to walk-in patients.  This flexibility is \nespecially important for patients receiving Depo-Provera injections (which must be given every \n- 11 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 12 of 14\nninety days), or starting a new form of birth control, as well as for patients who are having \nsymptoms that make them concerned.  PPH gets walk-in patients every day.  In addition, PPH \nspaces patient appointments so as to minimize wait times.  PPH's health centers often have \nSpanish-speaking staff available for patients, and have translator services in a wide range of \nlanguages available to non-English speaking patients at all times. \n42.  PPH's pharmacy services are similarly set up to minimize logistical burdens so \nthat patients have convenient access to their birth control medications.  PPH's pharmacy service \ngives patients, including Medicaid patients, an easy way to have their prescriptions automatically \nrefilled every month and delivered by mail, so the new prescription is waiting in the mail when \nthe patient needs it. \n43.  Defendant's actions will deprive all of PPH's Medicaid patients, including \nPlaintiffs Jane Doe #1, #2, and #3, of access to the high-quality, specialized care that PPH \nprovides. \n44.  All three individual Plaintiffs rely on PPH as the place they can turn to for critical \nmedical care and for prompt, efficient, and compassionate services.  If PPH is eliminated from \nMedicaid, they will be prevented from receiving services through the Medicaid program from \ntheir provider of choice, will have their health care interrupted, and may encounter difficulties \nfinding alternative care. \n45.  Without Medicaid reimbursements, PPH may be unable to continue to provide \nservices in the same manner and may be forced to lay off staff members and/or reduce hours at \none or both health centers.  Further, if PPH's termination from the Medicaid program is allowed \nto take effect for some period of time and it then is later allowed to become a Medicaid provider \nagain, some patients will remain confused about whether PPH is a Medicaid provider in good \n- 12 -\n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 1   Filed 09/11/15   Page 13 of 14\nstanding, and therefore will not return as patients.  For these reasons, should PPH be allowed \nback as a Medicaid provider, it would be very difficult - if not impossible - for PPH to resume \nits operations as they are today.  If PPH reduces hours at its health centers, this will affect not \nonly its Medicaid patients, but all of its patients. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM I - MEDICAID ACT (TITLE XIX OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT) \n46.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 44 above. \n47.  Defendant's action violates Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States \nCode by denying PPH's patients, including the Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane \nDoe #3, the right to choose any willing, qualified healthcare provider in the Medicaid program. \nCLAIM II - FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS - PENALIZING \nCONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITY \n48.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 44 above. \n49.  Defendant's action penalizes Plaintiffs for their constitutionally protected \nassociation with Planned Parenthood and/or abortion, without adequate justification. \nCLAIM III - FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION \n50.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 44 above. \n51.  Defendant's action violates Plaintiffs' rights by singling them out for unfavorable \ntreatment without adequate justification. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n52.

Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma could have\nchallenged the termination through an administrative appeal and judicial review in\nthe Arkansas courts, but it declined to do so.  Instead, three Arkansas patients\nidentified by the Planned Parenthood affiliate sued the Director of the Department\nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, claiming that the Department violated a federal right of the\npatients under the Medicaid Act to choose any โqualifiedโ provider that offers\nservices that the patients seek.  \n-2-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 2      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 3 of 39\nThe  district  court  enjoined  the  Department  from  suspending  Medicaid\npayments to Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma for services\nrendered to the three patients.  The court later entered a broader injunction that\nforbids  suspending  payments  for  services  rendered  to  a  class  of  Medicaid\nbeneficiaries.  The Director appeals, and we conclude that the plaintiffs do not have\na likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.  The provision of the Medicaid\nAct does not unambiguously create a federal right for individual patients that can be\nenforced under ยง 1983.  We therefore vacate the injunctions.\nI.\nPlanned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma, an affiliate of the\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, operates health centers in Arkansas.  We\nwill call the local affiliate โPlanned Parenthoodโ for short.  The district court found\nthat the Arkansas health centers โprovide family planning services to men and\nwomen, including contraception and contraceptive counseling, screening for breast\nand  cervical  cancer,  pregnancy  testing  and  counseling,  and  early  medication\nabortion.โ\nAs of 2015, Planned Parenthood and the Arkansas Department of Human\nServices were parties to contracts under which Planned Parenthood participated in the\nArkansas Medicaid program.  The contracts provided that either party could terminate\nthem without cause by giving thirty daysโ notice.  The Department also could\nterminate the contracts immediately for several reasons, including for conduct that is\nsanctionable under the applicable Medicaid Provider Manual.\nOn  August  14,  2015,  Governor  Hutchinson  of  Arkansas  directed  the\nDepartment to terminate its Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood. \nThe Governor said in a public statement that it was โapparent . . . after the recent\nrevelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood, that this organization does not\n-3-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 3      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 4 of 39\nrepresent the values of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served by\nterminating any and all existing contracts with them.โ  Context makes clear that the\nโrecent revelationsโ to which the Governor referred were video recordings released\nby the Center for Medical Progress that purported to show employees of other\nPlanned Parenthood affiliates discussing the sale of fetal tissue for profit.  The parties\ndispute whether the Planned Parenthood affiliates involved in the recordings engaged\nin any unlawful or unethical conduct. \nThe Department, on August 14, 2015, notified Planned Parenthood that it was\nterminating the Medicaid provider agreements, effective thirty days later, and notified\nPlanned Parenthood of its right to file an administrative appeal.  Before the thirty\ndays expired, on September 1, the Department sent a second notice.  This one stated\nthat the Department was terminating its agreements with Planned Parenthood for\ncause, because โthere is evidence that [Planned Parenthood] and/or its affiliates are\nacting in an unethical manner and engaging in what appears to be wrongful conduct.โ \nRather than discontinue the contracts immediately, however, the Department set the\ntermination date for September 14, 2015, the same date specified in the first letter. \nFederal regulations authorized by Congress and promulgated by the Secretary\nof Health and Human Services require each State to establish appeal procedures for\nMedicaid providers.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(4), (39); 42 C.F.R. ยง 1002.213.  Under\nArkansas law, a provider who is terminated has a right to file an administrative appeal\nwithin thirty days of the termination, and then to seek judicial review.  Ark. Code R.\nยง 016.06.35-161.400; Ark. Code Ann. ยง 20-77-1718.  Planned Parenthood, however,\ndeclined to exercise its appeal rights under Arkansas law and instead identified three\npatients who were willing to join the organization in a federal lawsuit.\nOn September 11, 2015, Planned Parenthood and three patients identified as\nโJane Doesโ sued the Departmentโs Director in the district court, seeking a temporary\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction to prevent the Department from\n-4-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 4      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 5 of 39\nterminating Planned Parenthoodโs contract.  The plaintiffs alleged that they were\nlikely to prevail on a claim that the Department, by excluding Planned Parenthood\nfrom the Medicaid program for a reason unrelated to its fitness to provide medical\nservices, had violated ยง 23(A) of the Medicaid Act.  This section is described as the\nMedicaid โfree-choice-of-providerโ provision.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A).  The\nplaintiffs further asserted that without an injunction, they would suffer irreparable\nharm.  The plaintiffs claimed that ยง 23(A) creates a judicially enforceable right, a\nviolation of which can be remedied through an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  The\ndistrict court granted a temporary restraining order.  \nAfter further briefing by the parties, Planned Parenthood withdrew its claim for\nrelief as a provider, but the Jane Does proceeded with their claims as patients, and the\ndistrict court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the Jane Does.  The court\nconcluded that ยง 23(A) creates a private right enforceable by the Jane Does under\nยง 1983, and that they were likely to prevail on the merits of their claim that the\nDepartment unlawfully terminated its contract with Planned Parenthood.  The court\nalso determined that, without an injunction, the Jane Does would suffer irreparable\nharm.  The Department appealed the grant of the preliminary injunction, and we heard\noral argument.\nAfter the appeal was submitted, the district court granted the plaintiffsโ motion\nto certify a class of โpatients who seek to obtain, or desire to obtain, health care\nservices in Arkansas at [Planned Parenthood] through the Medicaid program.โ  The\ndistrict court then issued a second, broader injunction that forbids the Department to\nsuspend Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for services rendered to Medicaid\nbeneficiaries who are members of the class.  The district courtโs order granting the\nsecond injunction incorporated the courtโs reasoning from the first order.\nThe  Department  filed  a  notice  of  appeal  of  the  class-wide  preliminary\ninjunction.  The parties then filed a joint motion requesting that we consolidate the\n-5-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 5      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 6 of 39\ntwo appeals, and they waived further briefing and argument.  We consolidated the\nappeals and now consider them together.\nII.\nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate, among other\nthings, a likelihood of success on the merits.  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690\n(2008).  In this case, a threshold question bearing on likelihood of success is whether\nthe Jane Doe plaintiffs and the certified class of Medicaid patients have a judicially\nenforceable  right  under  the  cited  provision  of  the  Medicaid  Act,  42  U.S.C.\nยง 1396a(a)(23)(A).  If the statute does not create an enforceable federal right, then the\nJane Does and the class members cannot sue under ยง 1983, and there is no likelihood\nof success on the merits.\nSection 1983 provides a cause of action against any person who, under color\nof law, subjects a citizen to the deprivation of any rights secured by the laws of the\nUnited States.  Generally speaking, ยง 1983 supplies the remedy for vindication of\nrights arising from federal statutes.  Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4-8 (1980).  For\nlegislation enacted pursuant to Congressโs spending power, however, โthe typical\nremedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private\ncause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to\nterminate funds to the State.โ  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S.\n1, 28 (1981).\nTo support an action under ยง 1983, a plaintiff relying on a federal law must\nestablish that Congress clearly intended to create an enforceable federal right. \nGonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002).  There was a time, illustrated by\nWilder v. Virginia Hospital Assโn, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), when the Medicaid Act was\ndeemed to create an enforceable right if the provision in question was โintend[ed] to\nbenefit the putative plaintiff.โ  Id. at 509 (alteration in original) (quoting Golden State\n-6-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 6      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 7 of 39\nTransit Corp. v. City of L.A., 493 U.S. 103, 106 (1989)).  Starting from that premise,\nWilder held that the Boren Amendment to ยง 13(A) of the Medicaid Act created a\nfederal right for providers that was enforceable under ยง 1983.\nLater decisions, however, show that the governing standard for identifying\nenforceable federal rights in spending statutes is more rigorous.  It is not enough, as\nWilder and Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), might have suggested, to\nshow simply that a plaintiff โfalls within the general zone of interest that the statute\nis intended to protect.โ  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283.  It is now settled that nothing\nโshort of an unambiguously conferred rightโ will support a cause of action under\nยง 1983.  Id.\nMost recently, therefore, the Court observed that Medicaid providers seeking\nto enforce ยง 30(A) of the Medicaid Act did not rely on Wilder to proceed under\nยง 1983, because the Courtโs later decisions โplainly repudiate the ready implication\nof a ยง 1983 action that Wilder exemplified.โ  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr.,\nInc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1386 n.* (2015).  The Court explained that Gonzaga expressly\nrejected the notion, โimplicit in Wilder,โ that something โshort of an unambiguously\nconferred rightโ can support a cause of action under ยง 1983.  Id.  Armstrong thus\nmade explicit what was implicit in Gonzaga, where the dissenting opinion concluded\nthat the Court โsub silentio overrule[d] cases such as . . . Wilder,โ because the Boren\nAmendment did not โclear[ly] and unambiguous[ly] intend enforceability under\nยง 1983.โ  536 U.S. at 300 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (second and third alteration and\nemphasis in original) (citation omitted).  Congress repealed former ยง 13(A) and the\nBoren Amendment in 1997, see Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33,\nยง 4711, 111 Stat. 251, 507-08, so the Court will have no occasion formally to\noverrule  Wilder.    But  for  purposes  of  our  obligation  to  apply  Supreme  Court\nprecedent, see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997), the Courtโs โrepudiationโ\nof Wilder is the functional equivalent of โoverruling,โ as the Court uses the terms\ninterchangeably.  Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2606 (2015); Keene Corp.\n-7-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 7      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 8 of 39\nv. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 215 (1993); Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey,\n505 U.S. 833, 864 (1992).2\nThe provision at issue in this case appears in a section of the Medicaid Act\nconcerning state plans for medical assistance.  The Act provides, with exceptions not\nrelevant here, that the Secretary of Health and Human Services โshall approve any\nplan which fulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a).โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(b). \nSubsection (a), in turn, declares that โ[a] State plan for medical assistance mustโ\nsatisfy some eighty-three conditions.  The condition involved here is ยง 23(A), namely,\nthat the state plan must โprovide that . . . any individual eligible for medical\nassistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency,\ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required\n. . . who undertakes to provide him such services.โ  Id. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A).  \nThe Jane Does contend that ยง 23(A) creates an enforceable federal right for\nindividual patients to receive services from any provider who is โqualified to perform\nthe serviceโ that they seek.  If Planned Parenthood is qualified to perform the service,\nthey argue, then ยง 1983 provides a remedy through which a court can require the\nState to maintain its contract with Planned Parenthood, so that the Jane Does can\nobtain assistance from that provider.\nWe see significant difficulties with the contention that ยง 23(A) unambiguously\ncreates an enforceable federal right.  First, the focus of the Act is two steps removed\n2Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas Department of Human Services,\n293 F.3d 472 (8th Cir. 2002), cited by the dissent, post, at 24, 26-27, preceded\nGonzaga  and  did  not  consider  whether  the  statutory  provisions  at  issue  there\nunambiguously conferred an enforceable right on the plaintiffs.  Center for Special\nNeeds Trust Administration, Inc. v. Olson, 676 F.3d 688 (8th Cir. 2012), also cited\nby the dissent, did not apply Gonzaga, was decided before Armstrong, and concerned\na different provision of the Medicaid Act that is not at issue here.\n-8-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 8      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 9 of 39\nfrom the interests of the patients who seek services from a Medicaid provider.  Like\nthe provision at issue in Armstrong, โ[i]t is phrased as a directive to the federal\nagency charged with approving state Medicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right\nto sue upon the beneficiaries of the Stateโs decision to participate in Medicaid.โ  135\nS. Ct. at 1387 (plurality opinion).  In other words, โ[i]t focuses neither on the\nindividuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated, but on the\nagenc[y] that will do the regulating.โ  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 289\n(2001).  A statute that speaks to the government official who will regulate the\nrecipient of federal funding โdoes not confer the sort of โindividual entitlementโ that\nis enforceable under ยง 1983.โ  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S.\nat 343).  Even where a subsidiary provision includes mandatory language that\nultimately benefits individuals, a statute phrased as a directive to a federal agency\ntypically does not confer enforceable federal rights on the individuals.  Univs.\nResearch Assโn, Inc. v.

Congress also authorized the Secretary to promulgate regulations\nthat  are  necessary  for  the  proper  and  efficient  operation  of  a  state  plan.    Id.\nยง 1396a(a)(4).

The  collateral  federal\nconsequences of a State exclusion led the Secretary to mandate that States afford due\nprocess protections to excluded providers.

Artist M., 503\nU.S. 347, 360-61, 363 (1992), superseded by statute on other grounds, 42 U.S.C.\nยงยง 1320a-2, 1320a-10; see also Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 281 (applying Suter).\nAccepting the Jane Doesโ position would result in a curious system for review\nof a Stateโs determination that a Medicaid provider is not โqualified.โ  Federal law,\nas noted, requires that when a State terminates a Medicaid provider, the State must\nafford the provider an opportunity for administrative appeal and judicial review in the\nstate courts.  Under  the  Jane Doesโ vision, while the  provider is litigating its\nqualifications in the state courts, or after the provider unsuccessfully appeals a\ndetermination that it is not qualified, individual patients separately could litigate or\nrelitigate the qualifications of the provider in federal court under ยง 1983.  Each\nadjudicator must apply a rather imprecise standard, asking whether the provider is\nโqualified to perform the service or services required.โ  The potential for parallel\nlitigation and inconsistent results gives us further reason to doubt that Congress in\nยง  23(A)  unambiguously  created  an  enforceable  federal  right  for  patients.    Cf.\nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 292 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment).\nThird, statutes with an โaggregateโ focus do not give rise to individual rights. \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 343).  This court in Midwest\nFoster Care & Adoption Assโn v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190 (8th Cir. 2013), reasoned\nthat  where  โa  statute  links  funding  to  substantial  compliance  with  its\nconditionsโincluding  forming  and  adhering  to  a  state  plan  with  specified\nfeaturesโthis counsels against the creation of individually enforceable rights.โ  Id.\nat 1200.  โFocusing on substantial compliance is tantamount to focusing on the\naggregate practices of a state funding recipient.โ  Id. at 1201; see Gonzaga, 536 U.S.\nat 288 (explaining that Blessing โfound that Title IV-D failed to support a ยง 1983 suit\nin part because it only required โsubstantial complianceโ with federal regulationsโ);\n-10-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 10      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 11 of 39\nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 335, 343.  The statute at issue in Midwest Foster Care\nconcerned โpayments on behalf of each child,โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 672(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded), thus arguably suggesting a focus on individuals, but this court concluded that\nthe โsubstantial compliance funding conditionโ indicated that the statute had an\naggregate focus.  712 F.3d at 1201.  \nSection 23(A) is likewise part of a substantial compliance regime.  The\nSecretary is directed to discontinue payments to a State if he finds that โin the\nadministration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantiallyโ with a provision\nof ยง 1396a.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396c(2).  Although Wilder identified an enforceable right\nin former ยง 13(A) of the Medicaid Act despite the statuteโs substantial compliance\nrequirement, see Midwest Foster Care, 712 F.3d at 1201, we put little stock in that\nparadigm after Armstrongโs express disavowal of Wilderโs mode of analysis.  There\nis stronger reason after Armstrong to infer an aggregate focus for ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A)\nbased on the substantial compliance funding requirement of ยง 1396c.\nThe Jane Does, citing decisions of other circuits, rely on the fact that ยง 23(A)\nrefers to โany individual eligible for medical assistance,โ and that the Medicaid Act\nspeaks in mandatory language when it says that a state plan โmustโ provide for an\nindividual to obtain assistance from a qualified provider.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a).  They\nsay that this text includes the sort of โrights-creating languageโ that supports an\naction under ยง 1983.  See Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v.

Where\nstructural elements of the statute and language in a discrete subsection give mixed\nsignals about legislative intent, Congress has not spokenโas required by Gonzaga,\n536 U.S. at 280โwith a โclear voiceโ that manifests an โโunambiguousโ intentโ to\nconfer individual rights.  See John B. v.

The proper inquiry is whether Congress intended to create an\nenforceable  federal  right  when  it  enacted  the  specific  provision  in  question. \nCongressional intent or meaning is not discerned by considering merely a portion of\na statutory provision in isolation, but rather by reading the complete provision in the\n4Because we conclude that Congress did not unambiguously confer a federal\nright that is presumptively enforceable under ยง 1983, we do not adopt the view\nattributed to us by the dissent, post, at 26, that Congress adopted a comprehensive\nadministrative  scheme  that  precludes  private  enforcement  under  ยง  1983.

The Third Circuit in 2004 similarly relied on\nWilder in reversing a district courtโs decision that ยงยง 1396a(a)(8), 1396a(a)(10), and\n1396d(a)(15) did not unambiguously create enforceable rights in light of Gonzaga. \nSabree ex rel. Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d 180, 184, 192-93 (3d Cir. 2004).  A\nconcurring opinion, however, suggested that the result might not endure:  โWhile the\nanalysis and decision of the District Court may reflect the direction that future\nSupreme Court cases in this area will take, currently binding precedent supports the\ndecision of the Court.โ   Id. at 194 (Alito, J., concurring).5\n5The district court in Sabree concluded:\nBecause Title XIX speaks more in terms of what a State must do to\nmake itself  eligible for funding  versus the  individual  treatment  of\nrecipients, and because the State need only โcomply substantiallyโ with\nstatutory provisions to receive funding, the Secretaryโs function is to\nassess the โaggregate function of the State,โ rather than โwhether the\nneeds of any particular person have been satisfied.โ\nSabree ex rel.

That section, enacted in 1994, provides:\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of [the Social Security Act],\nsuch  provision  is  not  to  be  deemed  unenforceable  because  of  its\ninclusion in a section of [the Act] requiring a State plan or specifying\nthe required contents of a State plan.  This section is not intended to\nlimit or expand the grounds for determining the availability of private\nactions to enforce State plan requirements other than by overturning any\nsuch grounds applied in Suter v. Artist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but\nnot  applied  in  prior  Supreme  Court  decisions  respecting  such\nenforceability; provided, however, that this section is not intended to\nalter the holding in Suter v.

Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1057 n.5 (9th Cir. 2005).  The operative first sentence\naddresses and apparently disapproves one portion of Suter:  the Court had suggested\nthat when a provision of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act required a\nstate plan and specified the mandatory elements of a plan, it required only that a State\nhave a plan approved by the Secretary which contained those features, not that the\nplan actually be in effect.  Suter, 503 U.S. at 358; see Brief of National Health Law\nProgram, et al. as Amici Curiae at 15.6  We do not rely on this aspect of Suter; we\nomitted); see also Grammer v. John J.

The second sentence of\nยง 1320a-2 declares what is โintendedโ by the statute, but does not include an\noperative provision that adds to the specific direction of the first sentence.  See Scalia\n& Garner, supra, at 219-20 (explaining that โan expansive purpose . . . cannot add to\nthe specific dispositions of the operative text,โ whether the expression of purpose is\ncontained in a preface or in the body of the text); cf. FERC v. Elec. Power Supply\nAssโn, 136 S. Ct. 760, 775 n.6 (2016) (โThe operative provision is what counts.โ).  In\nany event, other points discussed in Suter, including the requirement of unambiguous\nnotice to States about conditions on the receipt of federal funds and the significance\nof an alternative enforcement mechanism, were relevant considerations before Suter\nand are beyond the scope of ยง 1320a-2.  See LaShawn A. v. Barry, 69 F.3d 556, 569\n(D.C. Cir. 1995), vacated, 74 F.3d 303, and revโd en banc on other grounds, 87 F.3d\n1389 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  The statute provides that Congress did not intend to alter the\nholding of Suter, and the provision leaves undisturbed enough of Suterโs rationale to\njustify the holding.\nBecause ยง 1320a-2 was adopted seven years before Gonzaga clarified the law\nin this area, moreover, the statute does not address the same question that a court must\ninjured by a Stateโs failure to comply with the Federal mandates of the\nState plan titles of the Social Security Act are able to seek redress in the\nfederal courts to the extent they were able to prior to the decision in\nSuter v.

Section  1320a-2  speaks  to  when  a  โprovisionโ  is  โdeemed\nunenforceableโ;  we  must  decide  whether  a  statute  unambiguously  โconfers  an\nindividual rightโ that can be enforced under ยง 1983.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284.  We\nknow that ยง 1320a-2 did not freeze the law as it was before Suter in 1992:  Armstrong\nconfirmed that the 1990 Wilder decision has been repudiated by post-1994 precedent. \nSee also Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1057 n.5 (concluding that a court must apply Blessing\nand Gonzaga, which followed the enactment of ยง 1320a-2, in determining whether\na provision of the Medicaid Act confers an individual right); Harris v. James, 127\nF.3d 993, 1002 (11th Cir. 1997) (rejecting the proposition that courts must โdetermine\nthe โfederal rightsโ question only according to the pre-Suter precedentsโ).\nSection 1320a-2 does not show that ยง 23(A) of the Medicaid Act creates an\nenforceable right.  This court in Midwest Foster Care interpreted ยง 1320a-2 to mean\nthat a provision of the Act โcannot be deemed individually unenforceable solely\nbecause of its situs in a larger regime โrequiring a State plan or specifying the\nrequired contents of a state plan.โโ  712 F.3d at 1200 (quoting 42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-2). \nThis  does  not mean that we  should ignore  the  elements of the  text discussed\naboveโthe structure of the statute and its focus on a federal regulator who is two\nsteps removed from individual patients, the availability of alternative means to\nenforce compliance with the requirements of ยง 23(A), and the aggregate focus of the\nstatute in light of its connection between funding and substantial compliance with the\ncondition.  Where a provision is included in a section of the Act requiring a state plan\nor specifying the required contents of a state plan, Congress still must create new\nrights in clear terms that show unambiguous intent before they are enforceable under\nยง 1983.  Conflicting textual cues are insufficient.\nThe plurality opinion in Part IV of Armstrong fortifies this conclusion.  Four\nJustices considered whether Medicaid providers had a cause of action under the\nMedicaid Act itself to enforce ยง 30(A) of the Act.  The first step in that analysis was\n-16-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 16      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 17 of 39\nto determine whether Congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of\nbeneficiariesโthe  same  inquiry  that  informs  whether  a  statute  confers  rights\nenforceable under ยง 1983.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 285.  The Armstrong plurality\nconcluded that ยง 30(A) lacked โrights-creating language,โ because it was โphrased\nas a directive to the federal agency charged with approving state Medicaid plans, not\nas a conferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries of the Stateโs decision to\nparticipate in Medicaid.โ  135 S. Ct. at 1387 (citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(b)).  To accept\namiciโs suggestion here that ยง 1320a-2 precludes this analysis would require us to\nconclude that the Armstrong plurality overlooked ยง 1320a-2 or misunderstood it. \nNeither is likely.7\nThe lack of a judicially enforceable federal right for Medicaid patients does not\nmean that state officials have unfettered authority to terminate providers.  Patients can\nreceive services only from a willing provider.  Medicaid providers whose contracts\nare terminated but who wish to continue providing services have an obvious incentive\nto pursue administrative appeals and judicial review in state court if the alternative\navenue of recruiting patients to sue in federal court is not available.  Providers and\npatients also may urge the Secretary to withhold federal funds from a State that fails\nto comply substantially with the condition of ยง 23(A).  The absence of a remedy for\npatients under ยง 1983 therefore does not make the free-choice-of-provider provision\nan empty promise.  We conclude only that Congress did not unambiguously confer\nthe particular right asserted by the patients in this case.\n7The respondents, the Solicitor General, and several other amici brought\nยง 1320a-2 to the Courtโs attention in Armstrong.

We need not address the Directorโs alternative contention\nthat the Jane Does failed to show that irreparable harm would result from the denial\nof an injunction because other qualified providers could provide the services that they\nseek.  Without a likelihood of success on the merits, an injunction is not justified. \nThe orders of the district court enjoining the Arkansas Department of Human\nServices from suspending Medicaid payments are therefore vacated.\nSHEPHERD, Circuit Judge, concurring.\nI concur in the courtโs opinion today, but I write separately to present an\nalternative ground for reversal.  In my view, even if ยง 23(A) provides a substantive\nright that the plaintiffs can enforce through a ยง 1983 suit, the right provided is to a\nrange of qualified providersโnot the right to a particular provider the State has\ndecertified.  For this alternative reason, the plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claim fails.\nAssuming that ยง 23(A) grants the plaintiffs a private right of action, we must\nexamine the precise contours of that right.  Cf. Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273,\n280 (2002) (requiring that conferred benefits be sufficiently specific and definite to\nqualify as enforceable rights).  The plaintiffs frame the right as an absolute right to\nuse the qualified provider of their own choosing without governmental interference. \nBecause Arkansas decertified Planned Parenthoodโplaintiffsโ preferred healthcare\nproviderโas a qualified provider, the plaintiffs allege they have a right under ยง 23(A)\nto challenge that decertification.  \nBut the Supreme Courtโs decision in OโBannon v. Town Court Nursing Center,\n447 U.S. 773 (1980), tells us the right created by ยง 23(A) is far more narrow:  the\n-18-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 18      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 19 of 39\nright to choose among a range of qualified providers.  OโBannon involved Medicaid\nrecipients residing in a nursing home that initially qualified as a Medicaid provider. \nId. at 775.  After the nursing home was decertified and removed from the list of\nqualified providers, residents brought suit, alleging a constitutional right to an\nevidentiary hearing on the merits of the decertification decision.  The Supreme Court\nrejected this argument.  Analyzing the โsubstantive rightโ provided by ยง 23(A), the\nCourt held that โthe Medicaid provisions . . . do not confer a right to continued\nresidence in the home of oneโs choice.โ  Id. at 785-86.  Section 23(A), the Court\nexplained, โgives recipients the right to choose among a range of qualified providers,\nwithout government interference.โ  Id. at 785.  So long as the provider remains\nqualified, therefore, Medicaid recipients remain free to stay there.  But ยง 23(A)\nโclearly does not . . . confer a right on a recipient to continue to receive benefits for\ncare in a home that has been decertified.โ  Id.  In sum, the Court carefully delineated\nthe limits of the right conferred by ยง 23(A); there is no enforceable right of continued\ncare from a provider determined by the state to be unqualified.\nI see two important takeaways from OโBannon.  First, the contours of the right\ngranted by ยง 23(A) are circumscribed.  Medicaid recipients have the enforceable right\nto a range of qualified providers.  So state agencies cannot steer patients to certain\nqualified providers at the expense of other qualified providers.  Nor can an agency\nartificially create a monopoly in Medicaid care.8  But there exists no right to a\nparticular provider the State has decertified.  Second, ยง 23(A) does not give Medicaid\n8For these reasons, the dissentโs complaint about my construction of the right\ngranted by ยง 23(A)โ that it would be โself-evisceratingโโis unfounded.  Section\n23(A) protects Medicaid recipients from government interference in their choice of\na qualified provider, examples of which I have described in the text above.  Were the\nState to so interfere, the plaintiffs would have the right to challenge the Stateโs\nactions.  So the right granted by ยง 23(A) is real and meaningful.  It simply doesnโt\nhave the meaning the dissent wishes it to have.  \n-19-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 19      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 20 of 39\nrecipients the right โto challenge the merits of a Stateโs assertion that a provider of\nMedicaid services is no longer qualified to provide Medicaid services or to challenge\nthe Stateโs termination of a providerโs Medicaid agreements on the basis of the\nproviderโs noncompliance with state and federal regulatory requirements.โ  Planned\nParenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, No. 15-30987, 2017 WL 2805637, at *20 (5th\nCir. June 29, 2017) (Owen, J., dissenting).  The OโBannon Court explained that\nโdecertification does not reduce or terminate a patientโs financial assistance, but\nmerely requires him to use it for care at a different facility.โ  447 U.S. at 785-86. \nโBecause the patients had no substantive right to demand care from a provider that\nhad been decertified, they had no due process rights to participate in a hearing\nregarding certification or decertification of the provider.โ  Gee, 2017 WL 2805637,\nat *21 (Owen, J., dissenting). \nOโBannon controls the outcome of this case.  The plaintiffs are asserting a\nrightโthe absolute right to a particular provider of their choosingโthat ยง 23(A) does\nnot grant them.  The rights granted to these plaintiffs under the statute, as explained\nby OโBannon, remain intact because the record confirms that they still have access\nto a range of qualified providers.  Further, the plaintiffs have no right under federal\nlaw to collaterally attack the merits of Arkansasโs decision to decertify Planned\nParenthood.  Planned Parenthood had the right to challenge that decision, but instead\nelected not to do so.  \nThe plaintiffs argue on appeal that OโBannon concerned โonly a procedural due\nprocess claim,โ and therefore we should not consider it controlling because the\nplaintiffs in this case assert a violation of a substantive right.  To be sure, some of our\nfellow circuit courts have agreed with this view.  See Gee, 2017 WL 2805637, at *9\n(distinguishing OโBannon because it involved procedural due process rights and not\nsubstantive rights); Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Commโr of Ind. State Depโt\nof Health, 699 F.3d 962, 977 (7th Cir. 2012) (same).  \n-20-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 20      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 21 of 39\nThis view, however, is patently flawed because it ignores the very language of\nOโBannon.  The Supreme Court clearly stated that it was defining the contours of the\nโsubstantive right . . . conferred by the statutes and regulations.โ  OโBannon, 447 U.S.\nat 786.  We, as courts of appeals, have no authority to dismiss binding precedent from\nthe highest court in the land, especially when that precedent is on point.  See\nHennepin Cnty. v. Fed. Natโl Mortg. Assโn, 742 F.3d 818, 823 (8th Cir. 2014)\n(โLower courts must follow Supreme Court precedent which directly applies to a case\nbefore them . . . .โ).\nThe plaintiffsโ argument also exhibits a fundamental misunderstanding of due\nprocess rights.  Any right to due process, whether asserted as a procedural or\nsubstantive claim, exists only when there is an underlying substantive right at issue. \nSee Gee, 2017 WL 2805637, at *21 (Owen, J., dissenting) (โ[T]here is no right to due\nprocess unless there is a substantive right that may be vindicated if adequate process\nis accorded.โ).  The OโBannon plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim required a\nshowing that the State had deprived them of โlife, liberty, or property.โ  See U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV.  They identified ยง 23(A) as the source of their due process rights. \nSee OโBannon, 447 U.S. at 784-85 (discussing ยง 23(A) as one of two sources\nidentified by the plaintiffs as providing a substantive right).  The Supreme Court thus\nexamined  whether  ยง  23(A)  provides  Medicaid  recipients  the  right  to  receive\nhealthcare services from a particular provider the State has decertified.  The Court\nconcluded that no such right exists.  Id. at 785-86.  On this basisโthe lack of a\nsubstantive right to a particular, decertified providerโthe Court denied the plaintiffsโ\nprocedural due process claim.  Id.  The OโBannon Courtโs reasoning and decision\napply with equal force to the plaintiffsโ present claim, and for this alternative reason\nI would reverse the district court.  \nThe dissent contends that I misunderstand the plaintiffsโ argument.  It then\nexplains that the plaintiffs are not claiming that ยง 23(A) entitles them to choose a\n-21-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 21      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 22 of 39\nprovider rightfully disqualified from the pool of Medicaid providers, but rather they\nargue that Arkansasโs decertification of Planned Parenthood as a qualified provider\nconstitutes  government  interference  with  their  freedom  of  choice.    OโBannon,\ntherefore, is supposedly inapposite.  See Gee, 2017 WL 2805637, at *10 (โ[T]he\n[OโBannon] plaintiffs had no right to reside in an unqualified facility when the\ndisqualification decision was connected to the stateโs enforcement of its health and\nsafety regulations.โ).\nThe dissentโs attempt to distinguish OโBannon fails because it assumes that\nPlanned Parenthood was somehow wrongfully disqualified as a Medicaid provider. \nThe dissent claims to find proof of this wrongful termination in the fact that Planned\nParenthood remains licensed to serve other patients.  So according to the dissent, a\nMedicaid recipient has the right to challenge the merits of a providerโs decertification\nwhen the State permits that provider to continue providing care to other patients.  But\nthis  interpretation  is  plainly  wrong.    โUnder  federal  statutory  and  regulatory\nprovisions, a State may terminate a providerโs Medicaid agreement on many grounds,\nand it is not a prerequisite for such terminations that the State preclude a provider\nfrom providing services to any and all patients.โ  Gee, 2017 WL 2805637, at *22\n(Owen, J., dissenting); see also 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(p)(1) (โIn addition to any other\nauthority, a State may exclude any individual or entity for purposes of participating\nunder the State plan under this subchapter for any reason for which the Secretary\ncould  exclude  the  individual  or  entity  from  participation  in  a  program  under\nsubchapter XVII of this chapter under section 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, or 1395cc(b)(2) of\nthis title.โ).  And OโBannonโs holding did not rest on whether the State allowed the\nnursing home to continue servicing other patients.  The Court based its decision on\nthe  Stateโs  termination  of  the  nursing  homeโs  Medicare  provider  agreement. \nOโBannon, 447 U.S. at 776.  So OโBannon remains controlling over this case.\n-22-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 22      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 23 of 39\nMELLOY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\nBecause I would join the four other circuit courts and numerous district courts\nthat all have found a private right of enforcement under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A),\nI respectfully dissent.

Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), the Supreme Court set forth a\nthree-factor test to determine whether a statutory provision creates a private right of\naction enforceable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Under that test, we consider (1) whether\nโCongress . . . intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiffโ; (2)\nwhether the right โis not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain\njudicial competenceโ; and (3) whether the provision โimpose[s] a binding obligation\non the States.โ  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340โ41 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).  Later, in Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002), the Court\namended  the  first  prong  of  the  analysis,  holding  that  nothing  โshort  of  an\nunambiguously  conferred  right  [will]  support  a  cause  of  action  brought  under\nยง 1983.โ \nThis court has applied the Blessing test a number of times to other statutory\nprovisions.  See Spectra Commcโns Grp., LLC v. City of Cameron, 806 F.3d 1113\n(8th Cir. 2015) (finding no private right of action under 47 U.S.C. ยง 253); Midwest\nFoster Care & Adoption Assโn v.

This provision unambiguously confers an individual right to\nMedicaid-eligible patients.  Section 23(A) states that โany individual eligible for\nmedical assistanceโ can obtain that assistance from a provider of their choice.  42\nU.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A) (emphasis added).  Thus, this provision is โphrased in terms\nof the persons benefitted,โ Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 (quoting Cannon v. Univ. of\nChi., 441 U.S. 677, 692 & n.13 (1979)), and uses โindividually focused terminology,โ\nid. at 287.  See OโBannon v. Town Court Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980) (The\nfreedom-of-choice provision โgives recipients the right to choose among a range of\nqualified providers, without government interference.  By implication, it also confers\nan absolute right to be free from government interference with [that] choice[.]โ\n(emphasis added and omitted)); see also Gee, 862 F.3d at 459; Betlach, 727 F.3d at\n966โ67; Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 974; Harris, 442 F.3d at 461โ62. \nFurther, the freedom-of-choice provision โis not so vague and amorphous that\nits enforcement would strain judicial competence.โ  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340โ41\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The provision states that a Medicaid-\neligible  individual  โmay  obtain  .  .  .  assistance  from  any  institution,  agency,\ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required\n. . . , who undertakes to provide him such services.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A). \n-24-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 24      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 25 of 39\nThus, there are two criteria providers must meet: (1) the provider must be โqualified\nto perform the service or services requiredโ; and (2) the provider must โundertake[ ]\nto provide . . . such services.โ  Id.  As the Ninth Circuit stated, โthe two criteria do not\nrequire courts to engage in any balancing of competing concerns or subjective policy\njudgments, but only to answer factual yes-or-no questions: Was an individual denied\nthe choice of a (1) qualified and (2) willing provider? The answer to these questions\nis โlikely to be readily apparent.โโ  Betlach, 727 F.3d at 967 (quoting Harris, 442 F.3d\nat 462).  The Ninth Circuit further explained: \nA court can readily determine whether a particular health care provider\nis qualified to perform a particular medical service, drawing on evidence\nsuch  as  descriptions  of  the  service  required;  state  licensing\nrequirements; the providerโs credentials, licenses, and experience; and\nexpert testimony regarding the appropriate credentials for providing the\nservice.  This standard is not subjective or amorphous, and requires no\nbalancing.  It is no different from the sorts of qualification or expertise\nassessments that courts routinely make in various contexts.\nId. at 968 (footnote omitted).  And as the Sixth Circuit noted, โwhile there may be\nlegitimate  debates  about  the  medical  care  covered  by  or  exempted  from  the\nfreedom-of-choice  provision,  the  mandate  itself  does  not  contain  the  kind  of\nvagueness that would push the limits of judicial enforcement.โ  Harris, 442 F.3d at\n462.\nMoreover, the freedom-of-choice provision is a mandatory provision.  Under\nthe provision, states โmust provideโ the free choice of providers to Medicaid-eligible\nindividuals.  As a result, the freedom-of-choice provision unambiguously refers to\nMedicaid-eligible individuals and confers an individual entitlement: the right to\nreceive medical services from any qualified provider of their choice.  See Planned\n-25-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 25      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 26 of 39\nParenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 974.  Thus, I would hold that ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A)\nunambiguously creates a presumption of a private right enforceable under ยง 1983. \nSee Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 (โOnce a plaintiff demonstrates that a statute confers\nan individual right, the right is presumptively enforceable by ยง 1983.โ).\nโThe State may rebut this presumption by showing that Congress โspecifically\nforeclosed a remedy under ยง 1983.โโ  Id. at 284 n.4 (quoting Smith v. Robinson, 468\nU.S. 992, 1004โ05 & n.9 (1984)).  โCongress may do so expressly, by forbidding\nrecourse to ยง 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating a comprehensive\nenforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under ยง 1983.โ \nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 341.  The major thrust of the majorityโs opinion appears to rest\non a finding that the Medicaid Actโs regulatory scheme rebuts any presumption of\nprivate enforceability.  For several reasons, I disagree that the regulatory scheme is\nso comprehensive as to be a clear expression of Congressโs intent to preclude private\nenforcement.\nFirst, the majority, ante, at 8โ10, finds that the freedom-of-choice provision\ndoes not unambiguously confer an individual right.  In so finding, the majority\nconsiders the Medicaid Act as a whole to find that the freedom-of-choice provision\nis part of a directive to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  Such a broad\nfocus is inappropriate.  See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 342 (โWe [do] not ask whether the\nfederal . . . legislation generally [gives] rise to rights; rather, we focus[ ] our analysis\non a specific statutory provision . . . .โ); Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of L.A.,\n493 U.S. 103, 106 (1989) (asking whether the โprovision in questionโ was designed\nto benefit the plaintiff).  And such a broad analysis cannot stand because it is\ninconsistent with circuit precedent, which has found a private right of action under\nother provisions of the Medicaid Act.  See Olson, 676 F.3d at 699โ700 (finding a\nprivate right of action to enforce the Medicaid Actโs pooled trusts provision under 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1396p(d)(4)(C)); Pediatric Specialty Care, 293 F.3d at 478โ79 (finding a\n-26-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 26      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 27 of 39\nprivate right of action to challenge proposed state budget cutbacks that would violate\nthe right to early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment services under 42\nU.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(10)(A), (a)(43), and 1396d(a, r)). \nSecond, the majority, ante, at 9, states that โ[b]ecause other sections of the Act\nprovide mechanisms to enforce the Stateโs obligation under ยง 23(A) to reimburse\nqualified providers who are chosen by Medicaid patients, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat Congress did not intend to create an enforceable right for individual patients\nunder ยง 1983.โ  However, โ[t]he availability of administrative mechanisms to protect\nthe plaintiffโs interestsโ alone cannot defeat the plaintiffโs ability to invoke ยง 1983\nso long as the other requirements of the three-part test are met.  Blessing, 520 U.S.\nat 347 (alteration in original) (quoting Golden State Transit Corp., 493 U.S. at 106).\nThird, the majority, ante, at 10โ11, finds private enforcement foreclosed\nbecause ยง 23(A) is โpart of a substantial compliance regime.โ  Thus, according to the\nmajority,  we  can  โinfer  an  aggregate  focus  forโ  ยง  23(A).    I  disagree  that  the\nsubstantial compliance regime supports a finding that Congress intended to foreclose\nprivate enforcement.  In Blessing, the Court concluded that the enforcement scheme\nunder Title IVโD of the Social Security Act was not sufficiently comprehensive to\nforeclose ยง 1983 liability.  520 U.S. at 348.  In so concluding, the Court noted the\nlack  of  any โprivate  remedyโeither  judicial  or administrativeโthrough which\naggrieved persons can seek redress.โ  Id.  Further, the Court found that the Secretary\nof Health and Human Servicesโ โlimited powers to audit [for substantial compliance]\nand cut federal fundingโ were not enough to foreclose private enforcement.  Id. \nSimilarly, in this case, the Secretaryโs power to cut funding if a State is not in\nsubstantial compliance with ยง 1396a is not enough to foreclose private enforcement. \nAnd while a provider in Arkansas may file an administrative appeal and then seek\njudicial review of Arkansasโs decision to terminate the providerโs contract under\n-27-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 27      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 28 of 39\nArkansas law, there is no remedy available for Medicaid-eligible individuals harmed\nby the termination decision.\nFourth, the majority relies on Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center Inc., 135\nS. Ct. 1378 (2015), in reaching its decision.  I do not read Armstrong to overrule or\neven undermine the reasoning of the other circuits that have addressed whether\nยง 23(A) creates a private right of action under ยง 1983.  Armstrong involved the\nSupremacy  Clause  and  a  claim  for  equitable  relief  under  42  U.S.C.\nยง 1396a(a)(30)(A).  There, it was undisputed that ยง 1983 was not an available\nremedy, as ยง 30(A) does not have any rights-creating language nor does it refer to\nindividual Medicaid beneficiaries.  Specifically, ยง 30(A) requires state Medicaid\nplans to:\nprovide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and\nthe payment for, care and services available under the plan . . . as may\nbe necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care\nand services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,\neconomy,  and  quality  of  care  and  are  sufficient  to  enlist  enough\nproviders so that care and services are available under the plan at least\nto the extent that such care and services are available to the general\npopulation in the geographic area . . . .\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A).  The Supreme Court held that \n[t]he provision for the Secretaryโs enforcement by withholding funds\nmight not, by itself, preclude the availability of equitable relief.  But it\ndoes so when combined with the judicially unadministrable nature of\nยง 30(A)โs text.  It is difficult to imagine a requirement broader and less\nspecific than ยง 30(A)โs mandate that state plans provide for payments\nthat are โconsistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care,โ all\nthe while โsafeguard[ing] against unnecessary utilization of . . . care and\nservices.โ\n-28-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 28      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 29 of 39\nArmstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1385 (second alteration and omission in original) (citation\nomitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A)).  In contrast, ยง 23(A) has only two\ncriteria, neither of which are too broad or too general for courts to consider.  Thus,\nโ[t]he provision for the Secretaryโs enforcement by withholding fundsโ does not\npreclude private enforcement under ยง 1983.\nFinally, to the extent the majority discounts the four other circuits that have\nfound a private right of action under the freedom-of-choice provision based upon an\nalleged evolution of law, ante, at 12, I disagree.  The majority asserts that the\nSupreme Courtโs opinions in Gonzaga and Armstrong overruled Wilder v. Virginia\nHospital Association, 496 U.S. 498 (1990).  In Wilder, the Court held that the Boren\nAmendment to the Medicaid Act created a private right of action because it โwas\nintend[ed] to benefit the putative plaintiff.โ  Id. at 509 (alteration in original) (citation\nomitted).  I do not dispute the fact that Gonzaga amended that prong of the Blessing\ntest.  See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283 (โWe now reject the notion that our cases permit\nanything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action\nbrought under ยง 1983.โ).  But I do not read the other circuitsโ opinions to rely on\nWilder in such a manner as to make those cases bad law.  \nThe Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits all applied the Blessing/Gonzaga\nframework to hold that the freedom-of-choice provision creates a private right\nenforceable under ยง 1983.  Gee, 862 F.3d at 457โ61; Betlach, 727 F.3d at 966โ67;\nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 972โ74; Harris, 442 F.3d at 461โ63. \nNotably, all of these opinions were issued after Wilder was, as the majority claims,\noverruled by Gonzaga.  Further, only two of these opinions rely on Wilder.  Planned\nParenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 969, 974โ76; Harris, 442 F.3d at 461, 463.  And\nwhere  those  opinions  do  rely  on  Wilder,  they  do  so  for  propositions  that  are\nunchallenged by subsequent caselaw.  See Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at\n969 (โMedicaid โis a cooperative federal-state program through which the Federal\n-29-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 29      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 30 of 39\nGovernment provides financial assistance to States so that they may furnish medical\ncare to needy individuals.โโ (quoting Wilder, 496 U.S. at 502)); id. at 974โ75 (relying\non Wilder to find that the Medicaid Actโs regulatory scheme was not sufficiently\ncomprehensive to show Congressional intent to preclude ยง 1983 enforcement, the\nunderlying reasoning of which is also supported by Blessing); Harris, 442 F.3d at 463\n(same).  Most importantly, as noted above, all four circuits concluded, as required by\nGonzaga, that the freedom-of-choice provision unambiguously confers a private right\nof action under ยง 1983.  Gee, 862 F.3d at 458โ59; Betlach, 727 F.3d at 966; Planned\nParenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 974; Harris, 442 F.3d at 461.  I therefore read those\ncircuitsโ opinions as persuasive authority that cannot be discounted by an alleged\nevolution of Supreme Court precedent.\nI also disagree with the concurrenceโs alternative argument for reversing the\ndistrict court.  OโBannon held:\nWhen  enforcement  of  [minimum  standards  of  care]  requires\ndecertification of a facility, there may be an immediate, adverse impact\non some residents. But surely that impact, which is an indirect and\nincidental result of the Governmentโs enforcement action, does not\namount to a deprivation of any interest in life, liberty, or property.\n447 U.S. at 787.  As the Fifth Circuit recently explained, โthe [OโBannon] plaintiffs\nhad no right to reside in an unqualified facility when the disqualification decision was\nconnected to the stateโs enforcement of its health and safety regulations.โ  Gee, 862\nF.3d  at  461.    The  language  of  the  freedom-of-choice  provision  supports  this\nunderstanding because the word โqualifiedโ is modified by the phrase โto perform the\nservice or services required.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396(a)(23)(A).  โThe provision thus\nindexes the relevant โqualificationsโ not to any Medicaid-specific criteria (whether\nimposed by the federal government or the states), but to factors external to the\n-30-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 30      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 31 of 39\nMedicaid program; the providerโs competency and professional standing as a medical\nprovider generally.โ  Betlach, 727 F.3d at 969.\nHere, like in Gee, Arkansas did not decertify Planned Parenthood as a medical\nprovider.  Rather, the state terminated only Planned Parenthoodโs Medicaid Provider\nAgreement; Planned Parenthood is still licensed to serve other patients.  See Gee, 862\nF.3d at 461 (discussing the Stateโs actions and explaining that โ[t]he Individual\nPlaintiffs in this case are trying to sustain their โright to choose among a range of\nqualified providers, without government interferenceโโa right explicitly recognized\nin OโBannon.โ (quoting OโBannon, 447 U.S. at 785 (emphasis in original))).  The\nplaintiffs in this case do not claim that the freedom-of-choice provision entitles them\nto choose a provider rightfully disqualified from the pool of Medicaid providers.  See\nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978โ80 (discussing the Stateโs limited\nauthority to disqualify providers).  Instead, they argue that Arkansasโs termination of\nthe Medicaid Provider Agreement constitutes government interference with their\nfreedom of choice.  If the right is given the construction the concurrence suggests,\nโthe free-choice-of-provider requirement would be self-eviscerating.โ Betlach, 727\nF.3d at 970; see Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978 (โIf the states are free\nto set any qualifications they wantโno matter how unrelated to the providerโs fitness\nto treat Medicaid patientsโthen the free-choice-of-provider requirement could be\neasily undermined by simply labeling any exclusionary rule as a โqualification.โโ). \nAnd while it is true that a state may terminate a Medicaid provider on many grounds,\nthe provision the concurrence cites, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(p)(1), cross-references other\nprovisions of the Medicaid Act limiting the stateโs authority to make qualification\ndecisions to โvarious forms of malfeasance such as fraud, drug crimes, and failure to\ndisclose necessary information to regulators.โ  Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d\nat 979.  The provisions do not grant plenary power to the states to make these\ndeterminations.  Betlach, 727 F.3d at 971โ72; Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d\nat 979. \n-31-\nAppellate Case: 15-3271     Page: 31      Date Filed: 08/16/2017 Entry ID: 4568936  \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 140   Filed 08/16/17   Page 32 of 39\nBased on the foregoing discussion, I would hold that the freedom-of-choice\nprovision does create an individual right enforceable under ยง 1983.  That  right allows\nindividuals to challenge a stateโs actions when a providerโs Medicaid Agreement is\nterminated for reasons unrelated to the providerโs qualifications.  Additionally, I \nagree with the district courtโs analysis of the Dataphase factors governing the\nissuance of an injunction.9  As a result, I would affirm the orders of the district court\nenjoining the Arkansas Department of Human Services from suspending Medicaid\npayments.\n______________________________\n9Dataphase Sys., Inc. v.

Case No. 4:15-cv-00566-KGB \n \nJOHN M. SELIG, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS \nDEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES, in his \nofficial capacity                                           DEFENDANT \n \nAMENDED AND SUBSTITUTED PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDER1 \nBefore the Court is the motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \nfiled  by  plaintiffs  Planned  Parenthood  of  Arkansas  &  Eastern  Oklahoma,  d/b/a  Planned \nParenthood of the Heartland (โPPHโ) and Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 (โJane \nDoesโ) (Dkt. No. 3).  Currently before the Court is a request by PPH and the Jane Does for a \npreliminary injunction, extending the temporary restraining order this Court previously entered \nagainst Defendant John Selig, Director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services in his \nofficial capacity (โADHSโ) (Dkt. No. 21).  \nSince entry of the temporary restraining order on September 18, 2015, PPH, the Jane \nDoes, and ADHS have submitted to the Court additional briefing and evidentiary material (Dkt. \nNos. 26, 27, 30, 35, 36, 37 38, 39, 40, 41).  Included in those submissions are PPH and the Jane \nDoesโ motion to strike (Dkt. No. 27), to which ADHS has responded (Dkt. No. 38), and ADHSโs \nmotion to strike (Dkt. No. 30), to which PPH and the Jane Does have responded (Dkt. No. 41).  \n                                                           \n  1  The findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Amended and Substituted Order \nhave not changed from the Preliminary Injunction Order (Dkt No. 44).  The Court issues this \nOrder to correct certain typographical errors only. \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 2 of 31\nThe Court denies the motions to strike (Dkt. Nos. 27, 30) and grants the Jane Does a preliminary \ninjunction.     \nI.  Motions To Strike \nPPH and the Jane Does have filed a motion to strike (Dkt. No. 27).  They move this Court \npursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 802 to strike Exhibits 2, 3, and 4 from ADHSโs \nresponse to PPH and the Jane Doesโ motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. Nos. 16-3, 16-4, and \n16-5) and to strike Exhibit F to, and all references therefore in, the Affidavit of Mark White (Dkt. \nNos. 16-1, 19).   \nADHS has filed a motion to strike (Dkt. No. 30).  ADHS moves pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Evidence 602 to strike specific portions of Suzanna de Bacaโs declarations claiming that Ms. \nde Baca does not have the personal knowledge necessary to testify to the statements cited (Dkt. \nNo. 30, at 1).   \nPPH and the Jane Does, as well as ADHS, cite this Court to numerous cases for the \nproposition that, in preliminary relief proceedings, evidentiary requirements are less formal than \nat trial.  PPH and the Jane Does claim that, because a preliminary injunction request โoften \nrequires an expeditious hearing and decision,โ creating problems โin attempting to gather the \nnecessary witnesses,โ courts may consider reliable hearsay evidence in lieu of testimony from \nmultiple witnesses.  Wounded Knee Legal Def./Offense Comm. v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, \n507 F.2d 1281, 1286-87 (8th Cir. 1974).  ADHS also takes the position that hearsay evidence is \nfrequently  admitted  and  that  an  objection  to  hearsay  evidence  offered  at  the  preliminary \ninjunction hearing goes to its weight, not its admissibility (Dkt. No. 38, at 2).  See, e.g., U.S. v. \n$8,440,190.00 in U.S. Currency, 719 F.3d 49, 65 n.17 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing Mullins v. City of \nNew York, 626 F.3d 476, 52 (2d Cir. 2010)); Kos Pharm., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 718 \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 3 of 31\n(3d Cir. 2004); Flynt Distrib. Co. v. Harvey, 734 F.2d 1389, 1394 (9th Cir. 1984); Monterey Bay \nMilitary Hous., LLC v. Pinnacle Monterey LLC, No. 14-cv-03953-BLF, 2015 WL 1548833, at \n*11 n.14 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2015); Damonโs Restaurants, Inc. v. Eileen K., Inc., 461 F.Supp.2d \n607, 620 (S.D. Ohio 2006); Heidelberg Harris, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., 1996 \nWL 189398 (N.D. Ill. 1996); VโGuara, Inc. v. Dec, 925 F.Supp.2d 1120, 1123 (D. Nev. 2013).  \nThe Court will consider all of the challenged evidence at this stage of the proceeding, based upon \nwhat the parties agree is the controlling evidentiary standard at this juncture of the litigation.  \nThe Court denies the motions to strike at this time (Dkt. Nos. 27, 30).      \nII.  Findings Of Fact \n1.  PPH operates health centers in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Fayetteville, Arkansas, \nand has done so for over 30 years.   \n2.  These centers provide family planning services to men and women, including \ncontraception and contraceptive counseling, screening for breast and cervical cancer, pregnancy \ntesting and counseling, and early medication abortion.  \n3.  PPH states that, at its Arkansas health centers, PPH offers only early medication \nabortions, services that Arkansas Medicaid does not cover in virtually all circumstances (Dkt. \nNo. 12, ยถ 17).   \n4.  PPH and the Jane Does also represent that Medicaid payment for abortion is not at \nissue in this case (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 17).   \n5.  PPH  also  operates  a  pharmacy  that  serves  Arkansas  residents  which  allows \npatients to have their birth control prescriptions automatically refilled.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 4 of 31\n6.  During the 2015 fiscal year, PPH represents that it provided approximately 1,000 \nhealth care visits and filled more than 1,100 prescriptions, for over 500 women, men, and teens \ninsured through Medicaid in Little Rock and Fayetteville, Arkansas.   \n7.  In 2014, almost 40% of PPHโs Little Rock, Arkansas, patients, and 15% of its \nFayetteville, Arkansas, patients were insured through Medicaid, according to PPH.   \n8.  Plaintiffs Jane  Does  are  patients  of  PPH  who  receive  their  care  through  the \nMedicaid program.  \n9.  Jane Doe #1 is 26 years old and resides in Little Rock, Arkansas (Dkt. No. 3, at \n14, ยถ 1).  She has three children, is a member of the National Guard, and is insured through \nMedicaid (Id., ยถ 2). \n10.  She has been a patient of PPH for about three years.  She receives annual exams, \ntesting for sexually transmitted infections, and birth control (Id., ยถ 3).  She goes to PPH every 90 \ndays for Depo-Provera injections (Id.).   \n11.  She also goes to PPH if she has any symptoms that she is concerned about or \nquestions about her body (Id.).  She does not have a doctor she uses for general health care; she \nuses PPH (Dkt. No. 3, at 15, ยถ 5). \n12.  Jane  Doe  #1  states  that,  if  she  is  unable  to  obtain  birth  control  and  other \nhealthcare at PPH, she will have to go back to a provider she likes less and that will have longer \nwait times.  She also believes she might have to stop using Depo-Provera as her birth control \nmethod of choice because she worries about the difficulty in scheduling an appointment every 90 \ndays.  She does not like that option because she likes her current method of birth control and \nworries about side effects and effectiveness of other methods (Id., ยถ 7). \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 5 of 31\n13.  Jane Doe #2 is 30 years old, resides in Jacksonville, Arkansas, and is a PPH \npatient (Dkt. No. 3, at 17, ยถ 1).  She is insured through Medicaid (Id., ยถ 2). \n14.  She has a son who is 13, and she works part-time as a cashier (Id.). \n15.  She goes to PPH for annual exams, including breast and pelvic exams, and to \nreceive Depo-Provera injections (Id., ยถ3).  She has a strong preference for Depo-Provera as her \nbirth control of choice because it is reliable and because, before she used it, she often had \nmigraines and heavy cramping with her period, causing her to miss work and school (Id.). \n16.  Jane Doe #2 states that she wants to remain with PPH as her provider (Dkt. No. 3, \nat 18, ยถ 6) \n17.   Jane Doe #3 is 26 years old and lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.  She is a patient of \nPPH (Dkt. No. 3, at 19, ยถ1).  She is insured through Medicaid (Id., ยถ2).  The Court recognizes \nthat there seem to be billing discrepancies based upon the services that Jane Doe #3 claims she \nreceived, and the services that ADHS has in its billing records (Dkt. No. 40).  At this stage in the \nproceeding, the Court finds it prudent to credit the testimony in Jane Doe #3โs affidavit.  \n18.  She has a 2 year old son and works for a family business (Id.). \n19.  She relies on PPH for an annual physical, breast exams, and birth control (Id., ยถ3).  \nShe is using a form of birth control for help with severe cramps and a history of ovarian cysts.  \nShe reports that PPH assisted her in finding this solution, which has worked well for her (Id.). \n20.  Jane Doe #3 likes that PPH specializes in reproductive health, she trusts the \ninformation and advice she receives, and she likes the atmosphere and treatment she receives.  \nShe likes that the office is convenient and that there is never a long wait for her at PPH (Dkt. No. \n3, at 20, ยถ4). \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 6 of 31\n21.  Jane Doe # 3 enrolled in Medicaid specifically to get good access to birth control, \ndue to her life circumstances right now.  She also understands the importance of regular exams \nand wants to continue them.  She has only started obtaining regular exams since enrolling in \nMedicaid because she could not afford these services out of pocket before (Id., ยถยถ5 ฬถ 6).   \n22.  Jane Doe #3 reports that PPH is her only medical provider; she does not have a \ngeneral physician (Id.). \n23.  Jane Doe # 3 wants to continue with PPH as her provider but could not do so if \nPPH no longer accepts Medicaid.  She worries about where she will go or what she will do if she \nis unable to utilize the services of PPH (Id., ยถ7).    \n24.  All three of the Jane Does claim that for a variety of the following reasons, they \nchoose PPH because it is convenient, they are able to obtain appointments quickly, they obtain \ntest results quickly and reliably, they like the atmosphere and staff, they like that they receive the \ninformation they need, and they like the services they can receive as a walk-in patient, especially \ngiven their time commitments to children, inflexible work schedules, and other responsibilities \nthat make it difficult to schedule appointments at a set time (Dkt. No. 3, at 1 ฬถ 20). \n25.    Before choosing PPH, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 tried to obtain healthcare in \nother ways.  With a private provider, Jane Doe #1 found the wait times long for an appointment \nand recalls being referred to the emergency room or offered an appointment in three to four \nweeks when she called concerned about symptoms (Dkt. No. 3, at 15, ยถ 6).  With a county health \nclinic,  Jane  Doe  #1  recalls  wait  times  of  three  or  four  weeks  and  bad  experiences  with \nunpleasant, not helpful staff members (Id.).  Jane Doe #2 recalls long wait times and several \nweeks from calling to get an appointment.  Although she acknowledges other providers take \npatients on a walk-in basis, the wait times were even longer (Dkt. No. 3, at 18, ยถ 5). \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 7 of 31\n26.  The Arkansas Department of Healthโs own documents reflect that long wait times \nand delays in scheduling appointments are commonplace among county health clinics that offer \nfamily planning services and other preventative care.  (Dkt. Nos. 26-5, 26-6). \n27.  ADHS, through its director Mr. Selig, notified PPH on August 14, 2015, that \nADHS was terminating its Medicaid provider agreements, effective 30 days from the date of the \nletter (Dkt. No.16-1, at 19).   \n28.  Mark White, Deputy Director of ADHS, who supervises the Division of Medical \nServices  which  administers  Arkansasโs  Medicaid  Program,  states  that  โat  Governor  Asa \nHutchinsonโs directive, DHS Director John Selig gave written notice that DHS would terminate \nthe three (3) PPH provider agreements in 30 days, exercising its rights to do so under the \nโvoluntaryโ termination provision (Section III.A) of said agreements.โ  (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ5). \n29.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson issued a press release on August 14, 2014, \nthe day the termination letter was sent to PPH.  Governor Hutchinson states that he directed \nADHS to terminate the agreements because โ[i]t is apparent that after the recent revelations on \nthe actions of Planned Parenthood, that this organization does not represent the values of the \npeople of our state and Arkansas is better served by terminating any and all existing contracts \nwith them.โ  (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 35). \n30.  The  August  14,  2015,  letter  provided  directions  on  how  PPH  could \nadministratively appeal the termination (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ6). \n30(a).  Mr. White states, โ[a]fter the letter was issued, the Governor directed DHS to \nreview the videos released by the Center for Medical Progress.โ  (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ9). \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 8 of 31\n31.  Mr. White states that he reviewed the first seven (7) of the eight (8) videos that \nwere available at that time on behalf of DHS and made several observations (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ \n10). \n32.  Mr. White states that โ[t]he videos appear to demonstrate that Planned Parenthood \nand/or its affiliates have violated American Medical Association Guidelines, as well as the \nfederal ban on partial birth abortions (18 U.S.C. ยง 1531), the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act \nof  2002  (1  U.S.C.  ยง  8),  the  federal  ban  on  transferring  human  fetal  tissue  for  valuable \nconsideration (42 U.S.C. ยง 289g-2), and other federal and state laws.โ  (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ 13). \n33.  The transfer of fetal tissue is against Arkansas law.  See Ark. Code Ann. ยง 20-17-\n802. \n34.  The videos do not depict any representatives of PPH. \n35.  The videos include no statements from representatives of PPH. \n36.  The videos do not discuss any conduct by any PPH medical provider. \n37.  Mr.  White  states  that,  on  September  1,  2015,  he  issued  a  second  notice  of \ntermination to PPH โacting under the โfor causeโ termination provision (Section III.C) of the \nthree (3) provider agreements.โ  (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ 16).   \n38.  Mr. White makes clear that, although he believes his authority would permit him \nto terminate immediately PPH as a provider under the for cause termination provision, ADHS \nโdelayed the effective date to coincide with that of the first letter.โ (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ 16). \n39.  This second letter states that it โis based in part upon the troubling circumstances \nand  activities  that  have  recently  come  to  light  regarding  the  national  Planned  Parenthood \norganization, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, and other affiliated Planned Parenthood \nentities, all of which are affiliated with [PPH],โ and that โthere is evidence that [PPH] and/or its \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 9 of 31\naffiliates  are  acting  in  an  unethical  manner  and  engaging  in  what  appears  to  be  wrongful \nconduct.โ  (Dkt. Nos. 12, ยถ 37; 16-1 at 21-26).   \n40.  The letter states that PPH is โwelcome to submit information or offer comments \non  the  nationally  recognized  videos  that  have  raised  questions  on  the  conduct  of  Planned \nParenthood.โ  (Dkt. Nos. 12, ยถ 37; 16-1 at 21-26). \n41.  ADHS, through Mr. White, claims that it terminated PPHโs provider agreements \nโbased on what is in the public domainโ and โdetermined that termination is in the public \ninterest.โ  (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ 18). \n42.  Sources in the public domain report that completed governmental investigations \nin response to the videos in Georgia, South Dakota, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts \nhave fully vindicated Planned Parenthood (Dkt. No. 4, at 6 n.7 (citing and collecting media \nsources)). \n43.  The  second  termination  letter  included  instructions  on  how  to  appeal  the \ntermination (Dkt. No. 16-1, ยถ 19). \n44.  As of September 16, 2015, PPH had filed no administrative appeal (Dkt. No. 16-\n1, ยถ 20).   \n45.  PPH complies with all federal and state laws (Dkt. No. 3, at 8, de Baca Decl. ยถ \n13). \n46.  The first date after September 14, 2015, that patients insured through Medicaid \nwere scheduled to visit PPH health centers was September 21, 2015 (Dkt. No. 12, ยถยถ 8, 34). \n47.  If โPPHโs termination from the Medicaid program is allowed to take effect for \nsome period of time and it then is later allowed to become a Medicaid provider again, some \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 10 of 31\npatients will remain confused about whether PPH is a Medicaid provider in good standing, and \ntherefore will not return as patients.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 49).     \n48.  PPH and the Jane Does have sued ADHSโs director, Mr. Selig, in his official \ncapacity, only seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (Dkt. No. 12, at 15).   \nIII.  Conclusions Of Law \nWhen  determining  whether  to  grant  a  motion  for  preliminary  injunction,  this  Court \nconsiders:  (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the movantโs likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (3) the balance between the harm to the movant and the injury that \ngranting an injunction would cause other interested parties; and (4) the public interest.  Kroupa v. \nNielsen, 731 F.3d 813, 818 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Dataphase Sys. Inc. v. CL Sys., 640 F.2d \n109, 114 (8th Cir.1981)).  Preliminary injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy, and the party \nseeking such relief bears the burden of establishing the four Dataphase factors.  Watkins Inc. v. \nLewis, 346 F.3d 841, 844 (8th Cir. 2003).  The focus is on โwhether the balance of the equities so \nfavors the movant that justice requires the court to intervene to preserve the status quo until the \nmerits are determined.โ Id.  โAlthough no single factor is determinative when balancing the \nequities,โ a lack of irreparable harm is sufficient ground for denying a temporary restraining \norder.  Aswegan v. Henry, 981 F.2d 313, 314 (8th Cir. 1992). \nIn this case, application of the Dataphase factors depends on this Courtโs analysis of \nwhich plaintiffs, if any, have standing to bring this suit.  All parties have addressed this issue.  \nThe Court turns to examine this issue first, as the Courtโs analysis regarding standing implicates \ninquiries into irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits.  \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 11 of 31\n  A.  Standing \nPlaintiffs bring this civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 based on rights allegedly \nsecured by federal Medicaid statutes and the  United States Constitution.   Plaintiffs seek a \npreliminary  injunction  based  solely  on  the  federal  Medicaid  statutory  claim,  not  the \nconstitutional  claims  (Dkt.  Nos.  3,  4).    Specifically,  plaintiffs  allege  violations  of  federal \nMedicaid statute 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A), which states that โ[A]ny individual eligible for \nmedical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community \npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required . . . who undertakes to \nprovide him such services.โ  Plaintiffs contend that this โfree choice provisionโ is violated \nbecause PPH is qualified and willing to undertake family planning services.  In addition to this \ncontention, plaintiffs also note that Congress has distinguished family planning services by \ngiving this type of service even greater protections to ensure freedom of choice.   \nPlaintiffs cite 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(B), which states in pertinent part that, โ[a] State \nplan for medical assistance mustโ โprovide that . . . an enrollment of an individual eligible for \nmedical assistance in a primary care case-management system . . ., a medicaid managed care \norganization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person from whom \nthe  individual  may  receive  services  under  section  1396d(a)(4)(C)  of  this  title.  .  .  .โ    This \nprovision  then  lists  enumerated  exceptions,  none  of  which  the  parties  contend  apply  here.  \nFurther, PPH and the Jane Does contend that, by referencing 42 ยง 1396d(a)(4)(C), this provision \ncarves out and insulates family planning services from limits that may otherwise apply under \napproved  state  Medicaid  plans,  assuring  covered  patients  an  unfettered  choice  of  qualified \nprovider for family planning services.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 12 of 31\nThis  Court  concludes,  as  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  did,  that  42  U.S.C.  ยง \n1396a(a)(23) โgives recipients the right to choose among a range of qualified providers, without \ngovernment interference.โ  OโBannon v. Town Court Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980).  \nFurther, the Court agrees that the right entails โan absolute right to be free from government \ninterference with the choice to [receive family planning services from a provider] that continues \nto be qualified.โ  Id. at 785.   \n1.  Jane Doesโ Private Right Of Action \nAs  an  initial  matter,  the  Court  addresses  ADHSโs  contention  that  42  U.S.C.  ยง \n1396a(a)(23) does not provide a private right of action for PPH or even the Jane Does.  This \nCourt determines that, despite ADHSโs arguments otherwise, Armstrong v. Exceptional Child \nCenter, __ U.S. __, 135 S. Ct. 1378 (2015), does not overrule, or even significantly undermine, \nthe  precedent  that  informed  the  reasoning  of  the  Sixth,  Seventh,  and  Ninth  Circuits  in \nrecognizing a private right of action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23).  See Planned Parenthood \nAriz., Inc. v. Betlach, 899 F. Supp. 2d 868 (D. Ariz. 2012), appeal dismissed as moot, 727 F.3d \n960, 962 (9th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1283 (2014); Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. \nv. Commโr of Ind. State Dep โt of Health, 699 F.3d 962 (7th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. \n2736 (2013); Harris v. Olszewski, 442 F.3d 456 (6th Cir. 2006).   \nThe Supremacy Clause and a claim for equitable relief, not 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, were at \nissue in Armstrong.  The case involved 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A) of the Medicaid Act which \nincludes  meaningfully  different  language  from  the  statutory  language  at  issue  here.    See \nArmstrong, 135 S.Ct. at 1385.  Further, a provider was the only named plaintiff in Armstrong, \nwhich is not the case here.  The Jane Does are named plaintiffs, along with PPH.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 13 of 31\nAs to other arguments raised by ADHS to defeat the private right of action under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983, to the extent those arguments are addressed by the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth \nCircuits, the Court finds the reasoning in these prior cases persuasive and determines that, at a \nminimum, the Jane Does likely will succeed in bringing a private right of action under 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1396a(a)(23) based on the facts alleged.  The Courtโs analysis here is intended to summarize \nthat persuasive authority, not supplant the detailed reasoning on these points adopted by those \nother courts. \nThe Court determines that the Jane Does are  likely to succeed in arguing that this \nstatutory provision satisfies the factors set forth in Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 \n(2002), and Blessing v. Freestone, 502 U.S. 329, 341 (1997).  The Court determines that the Jane \nDoes are likely to prevail when evaluating the first Blessing prong that requires examining \nwhether  Congress  used  โrights-creatingโ  language  to  create  individual  rights  that  were \nโunambiguously conferred.โ  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283-84.  Section 1396a(a)(23) is phrased in \nterms of the individualโs right to select among qualified providers and is unmistakably focused \non the specific individuals the provision is intended to benefit.  This determination is bolstered \nby language that applies in the family planning context.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(B). \nIn addition to the plain text, the structure of the statute in its entirety must be considered \nto determine whether Congress intended to confer individual rights.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 286.  \nThe Court determines that the Jane Does are likely to succeed in arguing against ADHSโs \ncontention that, because this provision is part of a larger funding statute, Congress created a \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme incompatible with individual enforcement under 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983.  See Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Assโn., 496 U.S. 498, 521-22 (1990); Frazar v. Gilbert, \n300 F.3d 530, 539 (5th Cir. 2002), revโd sub nom. on other grounds, Frew ex. rel. Frew v. \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 14 of 31\nHawkins, 540 U.S. 431 (2004); Commโr of Ind. State Depโt of Health, 699 F.3d at 974-75; \nHarris, 442 F.3d at 463.  If this Court were to adopt ADHSโs argument, it supports a conclusion \nthat would prohibit the enforcement of any provision of the Medicare Act through ยง 1983.  That \nconclusion is against the great weight of authority derived from the many cases cited in the \npartiesโ filings. \nThe second Blessing prong requires the Jane Does to demonstrate that the right conferred \nis not so โvagueโ that it would โstrain judicial competenceโ to enforce the right.  520 U.S. at 340.  \nThis Court determines that the provision sets forth an explicit right that guarantees individuals \neligible for medical assistance the ability to choose from a range of qualified providers without \ngovernment interference.  Here, the issue is whether ADHS, by declaring PPH an unqualified \nprovider and terminating its provider agreements in the manner and for the reasons ADHS has \narticulated to date and will reveal through discovery in this case, violated the Jane Doesโ rights \nconferred by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23).  The determination of whether a provider is โqualified to \nperform the service or services required,โ under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) โfalls comfortably \nwithin the judiciaryโs core interpretive competence. . . [and] is a legal question fully capable of \njudicial resolution.โ  Commโr of Ind. State Depโt of Health, 699 F.3d at 974.  โA court can \nreadily determine whether a state is fulfilling these statutory obligations by looking to sources \nsuch as a stateโs Medicaid plan, agency records and documents, and the testimony of Medicaid \nrecipients and providers.โ  Ball v. Rodgers, 492 F.3d 1094, 1115 (9th Cir. 2007).   \nWhen pushed by plaintiffs to defend the evidence upon which ADHS claims to have \nrelied to issue its second termination letter, ADHS stated, โ[t]his case essentially is an appeal of \nthe administrative termination taken by DHS.โ  (Dkt. No. 38, at 3).  The Court is not certain it \nagrees  with  that  characterization,  but  ADHSโs  characterization  belies  its  attempts  to  argue \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 15 of 31\nelsewhere in its filings that such a review does not fall โcomfortably within the judiciaryโs core \ninterpretive competence. . . [and] is [not] a legal question fully capable of judicial resolution.โ  \nCommโr of Ind. State Depโt of Health, 699 F.3d at 974.  For these reasons, the Court determines \nthat the Jane Does are likely to succeed in arguing against the points ADHS raises in its sur-reply \nregarding whether 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) requires the type of judgment-laden standard the \nArmstrong court identified.   \nThe  third  prong  of  the  Blessing  test  requires  consideration  of  whether  the  statute \nโunambiguously impose[s] a binding obligation on the States.โ  420 U.S. at 347.  The relevant \nterms in the freedom of choice provision are โmandatory rather than precatory.โ  Sabree v. \nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 190 (3d Cir. 2004).  As a result, the final Blessing factor โis perhaps the \nmost obviously met by the free choice provisions.โ  Ball, 492 F.3d at 1116. \n2.  PPHโs Standing \nIn its temporary restraining order, the Court did not foreclose the possibility that PPH \nmight succeed in bringing its own private right of action, along with the Jane Does.  The Court \nrequested at the status conference that the parties address this issue, as in the Courtโs view this \nissue impacts the Dataphase analysis.   \nIn its most recent filing, PPH does not seem to assert its own private right of action under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to enforce rights conferred by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23).  Therefore, that \nquestion is no longer before the Court.  Instead, PPH takes the position in its reply that โPPH \nalso has a private right-of-action under the free-choice-of-provider provision on behalf of its \npatients.โ  (Dkt. No. 26, at 8).  PPH cites, in support, the test for third-party standing from \nPowers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 411 (1991).  See also Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 136-37 \n(2004); Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 112-16 (1976) (plurality opinion).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 16 of 31\nThis Court concludes that, because the Jane Does are named plaintiffs here, and the Court \ndetermines that the Jane Does have standing, PPH does not have standing in this case to assert a \nclaim based on third-party standing.  The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals limits the use of third-\nparty standing to assert another individualโs private right of action to situations where the third-\nparty plaintiff can prove that (1) the third-party plaintiff suffered an injury in fact, (2) the third-\nparty plaintiff โhas a โcloseโ relationship with the person who possesses the right,โ and (3) โthere \nis a โhindranceโ to the possessorโs ability to protect his own interests.โ  Hodak v. City of St. \nPeters, 535 F.3d 899, 904 (8th Cir. 2008); Ben Oehrleins & Sons & Daughter, Inc. v. Hennepin \nCnty., 115 F.3d 1372, 1378-79 (8th Cir. 1997).   \n  This case is pursued by three Medicaid recipients, the Jane Does.  ADHS therefore \ncontends that PPH cannot show that there is a โhindranceโ to the ability of Medicaid patients to \nprotect their own interests.  The third factor in the Powers test focuses on the ability of third \nparties to assert their own rights.  See Hodak, 535 F.3d at 904.  The Eighth Circuit has concluded \nthat, even assuming the third-party plaintiff suffers an injury in fact and has a close relationship \nwith the person who possesses the right, โ[n]o practical barriers exist if the third party actually \nasserts his own rights.โ  Id.  The Court declines to address whether, if the Jane Does were not \nnamed plaintiffs here or if it were determined that the Jane Does lack standing, PPH would meet \nthe requirements of third-party standing.   \n      3.  Limits On The Scope Of The Rights The Jane Does \n May Seek To Vindicate \n \nAlthough this Court recognizes the Jane Does have a private right of action and standing \nto seek to assert that right, the Jane Does are suing as individuals, not in a representative \ncapacity.  There has been no request made to the Court for class certification under Rule 23 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, although the Court acknowledges the time for seeking such \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 17 of 31\ncertification has not passed.  See Local Rule 23.1, Local Rules of the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas.  Given this, the relief the Jane Does may seek \nand the relief this Court may grant, if any, must be tailored to the individual plaintiffs who \nbrought the lawsuit:  Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3.  See, e.g., Monahan v. State of \nNebraska, 491 F. Supp. 1074, 1081 (D. Neb. 1980) (rejecting preliminary injunctive relief to the \nextent it was โdesigned to protect those persons whom the plaintiffs wish to represent through a \nclass action suitโ in the absence of class certification), affโd in part and vacated in part by 645 \nF.2d 592 (8th Cir. 1999); see also St. Louis Efforts for Aids v. Huff, 782 F.3d 1016, 1021-23 (8th \nCir. 2015) (affirming a preliminary injunction for only those named plaintiffs who satisfied the \nDataphase factors and noting the importance of narrowly tailoring preliminary relief). \n   In  the  Eighth  Circuit  and  in  a  number  of  other  circuits,  โin  the  absence  of  class \ncertification, the preliminary injunction may properly cover only the named plaintiffs.โ  See \nZepeda v. US I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727-28 (9th Cir. 1985) (โ[An] injunction must be limited to \napply only to the individual plaintiffs unless the district judge certifies a class of plaintiffs.โ); \nHollon v. Mathis Independent School District, 491 F.2d 92, 93 (5th Cir. 1974) (โIn this case, \nwhich  is  not  a  class  action,  the  injunction  against  the  School  District  from  enforcing  its \nregulation against anyone other than Hollon reaches further than is necessary . . . .โ); Berger v. \nHeclker, 771 F.2d 1556, 1567 (2d Cir. 1980) (recognizing constraints of a preliminary injunction \ninclude only covering the named plaintiffs in absence of class certification). \nB.  The Dataphase Factors \nHaving determined that the Jane Does have a private right of action, the Court turns to \nexamine the Dataphase factors as applied to that right of action.  The right the Court recognizes \nis that 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) โgives recipients the right to choose among a range of qualified \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 18 of 31\nproviders, without government interference.โ  OโBannon v. Town Court Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. \n773, 785 (1980).  Further, the Court agrees that the right entails โan absolute right to be free from \ngovernment interference with the choice to [receive family planning services from a provider] \nthat continues to be qualified.โ  Id. at 785.   \n1.  The Threat Of Irreparable Harm \nA plaintiff seeking temporary injunctive relief must establish that the claimant is โlikely \nto suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.โ  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  A threat of irreparable harm exists when a party alleges a \nharm that may not be compensated by money damages in an action at law.  See Kroupa, 731 \nF.3d at 820; Glenwood Bridge, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 940 F.2d 367, 371-72 (8th Cir. 1991).   \nAccordingly,  โ[l]oss  of  intangible  assets  such  as  reputation  and  goodwill  can  constitute \nirreparable injury.โ  United Healthcare Ins. Co. v. Advance PCS, 316 F.3d 737, 741 (8th Cir. \n2002).  Furthermore, a threat of irreparable harm may exist when relief through money damages \nin an action at law will not fully compensate a claimantโs economic loss.  See Glenwood Bridge, \n940 F.2d at 367.   \nAs  this  Court  has  observed,  Arkansas  law  is  instructive  although  admittedly  not \ncontrolling on this issue. The Supreme Court of Arkansas has found in other contexts that harm \nto a doctor-patient relationship can constitute irreparable harm. See Baptist Health v. Murphy, \n226 S.W.3d 800 (Ark. 2006); Cf. Roudachevski v. AllโAmerican Care Centers, Inc., 648 F.3d \n701  (8th  Cir.  2011)  (holding  that  an  already-disrupted  doctor-patient  relationship  did  not \nconstitute irreparable harm). \nHere,  the  Jane  Does  allege  that  they  will  suffer  irreparable  harm  because  their \nrelationship with PPH, their chosen family planning provider, will be disrupted, causing reduced \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 19 of 31\naccess  to  family  planning  services  in  violation  of  their  statutory  rights  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง \n1396a(a)(23).  ADHS argues against irreparable harm in the first instance by asserting that the \nJane Does misconstrue their statutory right.  ADHS contends that the right under the statute only \nrequires that the Jane Does be allowed their choice of qualified providers free from government \ninterference, not the choice of an unqualified provider.  In support of this argument, ADHS cites \nOโBannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U.S. 773, 787 (1980).  Framing the argument this \nway misstates the nature of the dispute. \nHere, the dispute is whether the government, either through the Governor or through \nADHSโs actions, impermissibly interfered with the Jane Doesโ choice of a qualified provider \nwhen it terminated PPH as a provider in the manner and for the reasons it articulates.  If this right \nfound in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) and conferred on Medicaid recipients is to have meaning, and \nif it is to have the meaning ascribed to it by the Court in OโBannon, ADHS cannot be permitted \nto declare a provider unqualified and then to use that declaration to put out of reach any future \nchallenges to its conduct by Medicaid recipients. \nThis Court has struggled with ascertaining what significance, if any, the fact that PPH has \nnot availed itself of the administrative appeals process has on this dispute.  At this stage of the \nproceeding, the Court settles on this.  The effect ADHS wants to give that fact dovetails with its \nattempt to misstate the nature of the dispute.  ADHS advocates that, because PPH has not \nappealed ADHSโs determination that PPH is no longer a qualified provider in Arkansas, the Jane \nDoes have no ability to vindicate their rights under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) (Dkt. No. 39, at \n17).   \nIf  the  Court  gives  this  fact  the  significance  ADHS  seeks,  the  Court  questions  why \nCongress would confer a right on Medicaid beneficiaries when that right seemingly has to be \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 20 of 31\nenforced  by  the  provider  through  the  administrative  appeals  process  as  ADHSโs  argument \nsuggests.  This Court also questions how, if at all, the current procedural posture of the case \ndiffers from the hypothetical case in which PPH pursues the administrative appeal and loses.  An \nargument can be made, given the undisputed facts regarding the sequence of events surrounding \nthe issuance of the termination letters here, that such would have been the result.  ADHS seems \nto want to make the Jane Does wait for that result, or the contrary result which seems remote, \nbefore attempting to vindicate their rights.  As ADHS points out, however, the Jane Does sue \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and there is no exhaustion requirement under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Even if \nthere were, all parties agree that the Jane Does do not have access to the administrative appeals \nprocess; they cannot vindicate their rights under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) in that forum.  This \nfact is not in dispute.   \nFor these reasons, at this stage of the litigation, the Court declines to find that PPHโs \ndecision not to appeal ADHSโs determination forecloses the Jane Doesโ ability to vindicate their \nrights  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1396a(a)(23)  through  this  lawsuit.    The  Court  will  not  examine \nirreparable harm through the lens ADHS suggests.   \nThe Court turns then to examine the allegations of irreparable harm advanced by the Jane \nDoes in relation to the right at issue.  As an initial matter, the Court takes the Jane Doesโ \naffidavits and responses to ADHSโs written questions at face value; the Court credits their \ntestimony in the form submitted.  The Court gives very little weight to ADHSโs attempts to \ndiminish the provider-patient relationships the Jane Does testify they have with PPH as their \nfamily planning provider.  Further, that the Jane Does see their family planning provider one \ntime per year to obtain a method of birth control, when pregnancy or complications are not at \nissue; that a staff member, not the physician, administers the shot of a birth control medication; \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 21 of 31\nand that a patient might see more than one family planning doctor or different family planning \ndoctors does not convince this Court that the Jane Doesโ relationship with PPH as their family \nplanning  provider  deserves  less  protection  or  recognition  than  other  patient-physician \nrelationships.    Mark  Whiteโs  supplemental  affidavit  which  is  submitted  under  seal  for  this \nCourtโs consideration suggests the Jane Does seek or have sought through the years treatment \nfrom various providers.     \nIn support of their claims of irreparable harm, affidavits from Jane Does #1, #2, and #3 \nindicate that, because of various family and occupational responsibilities, it is difficult for all \nthree of these women to plan health care visits weeks in advance.  Thus, they prefer going to \nPPH, where they can walk in for an appointment, obtain an appointment quickly, and the wait \ntimes are less than those at a private physicianโs office or public health clinics (See Dkt. No. 3, at \n14-20).  These affidavits also demonstrate that these women could not afford to pay for their \nnormal services out of pocket (Id.).  The Court still finds unpersuasive ADHSโs position that, \nalleged long wait times even when appointments are secured, and overall scheduling issues, is \nnot harm great enough to meet the Jane Doesโ burden of proof on irreparable harm, especially \nwhen family planning and reproductive health care needs are at issue.    \nADHSโs position that alternative providers are available again shifts the examination of \nthe right.  The right does not protect the Jane Doesโ right to a substitute or similar provider.  As \nthis  Court  has  concluded,  the  right  entails  โan  absolute  right  to  be  free  from  government \ninterference with the choice to [receive family planning services from a provider] that continues \nto be qualified.โ  OโBannon, 447 U.S. at 785.  Here, all three Jane Does state they wish to \ncontinue with PPH as their family planning provider of choice (Dkt. No. 3, at 14-20).   \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 22 of 31\nThe Court finds that, for all of these reasons and based on the Courtโs findings of fact in \nthis case, the harms alleged by the Jane Does do constitute irreparable harm sufficient for an \ninjunction.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm โr of Ind. State Dep โt of Health, \n794 F. Supp. 2d 892, 912 (S.D. Ind.) (denial of Medicaid patientโs free choice of provider is \nirreparable harm), affโd in part and rev โd in part on other grounds, 699 F.3d 962 (7th Cir. \n2012); see also Camacho v. Tex. Workforce Commโn, 326 F. Supp. 2d 794, 802 (W.D. Tex. \n2004) (reduced access to health care, as a result of state statute restricting access to Medicaid in \nviolation of federal regulations, constituted irreparable harm). Should the Court fail to issue \ninjunctive relief, the Jane Does will be denied their choice of provider for family planning \nservices.  The Court finds that, based on its assessment at this stage of the litigation on the \nlikelihood of success on the merits, denial of that freedom of choice is more likely than not \nexactly the injury that Congress sought to avoid when it enacted 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) and \nthat the Jane Does will suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is not entered by the \nCourt to preserve the status quo while this case is pending. \nFor these reasons, the Court determines that the Jane Does have met their burden of \ndemonstrating they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  \n2.  Likelihood Of Success On The Merits \nThis Courtโs analysis of the likelihood of success on the merits has changed little since \nthe Courtโs entry of the temporary restraining order, but the Court has modified it slightly based \non the partiesโ recent filings.  In support of their assertion that ADHSโs efforts to exclude PPH \nfrom Medicaid violate federal law guaranteeing a Medicaid patientโs right to receive care from \nthe provider of her choice, the Jane Does rely on recent Seventh and Ninth Circuit case law and \nthe discussions by those courts of the merits of such a claim.  This Court finds those cases, and \nthe reasoning of those courts, persuasive.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 23 of 31\nThe Seventh Circuit held that excluding โPlanned Parenthood from Medicaid for a reason \nunrelated to its fitness to provide medical services[] violate[s] its patients statutory right to obtain \nmedical care from the qualified provider of their choice.โ Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d \nat 962.  Similarly, the Ninth Circuit case dealt with an Arizona law that โbar[red] patients \neligible  for  the  stateโs  Medicaid  program  from  obtaining  covered  family  planning  services \nthrough health care providers who perform[ed] abortions in cases other than medical necessity, \nrape, or incest.โ  Betlach, 899 F. Supp. 2d at 874.  Although these cases addressed legislative \nenactments and the instant case involves a decision made by the Governor and communicated \nthrough  ADHS  or  a  decision  made  by  ADHS,  depending  on  which  termination  letter  is \nexamined, those facts do not sufficiently distinguish the instant case from the aforementioned \ncases, and the holdings of those cases weigh in favor of the Jane Doesโ likely success on the \nmerits here.  The Court determines that the Jane Does have carried their burden on demonstrating \na likelihood of success on the merits of their 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 claim so as to warrant the entry of \na preliminary injunction.   \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court has examined the arguments ADHS advances for \nits determination and the Jane Doesโ countervailing arguments.  Though participating states must \ncomply with all requirements of Title XIX, including the freedom of choice provision, states \nretain some autonomy and flexibility in devising Medicaid plans.  Specifically, a state may \nestablish โreasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers. . . .โ  42 C.F.R. ยง \n431.51(c)(2).  A state may also exclude health care providers under certain circumstances:  โ[i]n \naddition to any other authority, a State may exclude an individual or entity. . . for any reason for \nwhich the Secretary could exclude the individual or entity from participation.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396a(p)(1).  The central conflict between the parties in this case is whether Arkansas can \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 24 of 31\nterminate PPH as a qualified Medicaid provider for the reasons it articulates in this litigation \nwithout violating the freedom of choice provision.  ADHS recognizes that one of the key issues \nin this litigation will be whether ADHSโs termination decision was proper under federal law \n(Dkt. No. 16, at 20).   \nAs an initial matter, and in support of the first termination letter sent to PPH, ADHS \nargues that its termination of PPHโs provider agreement is allowed, based upon provisions in the \nagreements  itself,  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1396a(p),  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1320a-7,  and  Ark.  Admin.  Code  ยง \n016.06.35-151.000(B) (Dkt. No. 16, at 2, 20).  Specifically, ADHS argues that Section III.A of \nthe agreement provides that, โ[t]his contract may be voluntarily terminated by either party by \ngiving thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.โ (Dkt. No. 16, Aff. 1).   \nThis Court raised at the hearing an issue as to what, if anything, ADHS reviewed prior to \nissuing the initial contract-based decision.  ADHS submitted with its initial response an affidavit \nfrom Mark White, the Deputy Director of ADHS, that seems to suggest only after this letter was \nissued did Governor Hutchinson direct ADHS employees to review the videos upon which \nADHS relies in this lawsuit (Dkt. No. 16-1, at 2, ยถ 9).     \nFurther, legal arguments of this type, citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(p) and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-\n7 of the Medicaid Act, were addressed by the Seventh and Ninth Circuits.  These courts rejected \nclaims by the states in those cases that the cited provisions provide any sort of expanded, \nunchecked state authority for terminating provider contracts for reasons unrelated to the purposes \nof the Medicaid Act.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(p)(1) provides specifically that: \nIn addition to any other authority, a State may exclude any individual or entity for \npurposes of participating under the State plan under this subchapter for any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual or entity from participation \nin a program under subchapter XVIII of this chapter under section 1320a-7, \n1320a-7a, or 1395cc(b)(2) of this title. \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 25 of 31\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(p)(1).  The cross-referenced sections of the Medicaid Act cited within this \nprovision  pertain  to  mandatory  or  permissive  exclusions  of  providers  for  various  forms  of \nmalfeasance  such  as  fraud,  drug  crimes,  and  failure  to  disclose  necessary  information  to \nregulators.  See 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, 1395cc(b)(2).  To the extent ADHS intends to \nrely on these provisions, or comparable state provisions, to argue a plenary power of the states to \nexclude Medicaid providers as the states see fit, this Court is mindful that other courts have \nsoundly  rejected  such  arguments.    See  Planned  Parenthood  of  Indiana,  699  F.3d  at  979.  \nSpecifically,  the  Seventh  Circuit  determined  that  the  phrase  โโ[i]n  addition  to  any  other \nauthorityโ signals only that what follows is a non-exclusive list of specific grounds upon which \nstates may bar providers from participating in Medicaid.  It does not imply that the states have an \nunlimited authority to exclude providers for any reason whatsoever.โ  Id.    \nFurther, as to this contractual issue, the Jane Does are not parties to the agreements cited.  \nThe Jane Doesโ claimed federal statutory right to the family planning provider of their choice is \nnow the claim before the Court at this stage, and the Jane Does claim that language of the \nMedicaid  Act  conferring  this  right  is  mandatory  language  for  any  state  plan  for  medical \nassistance.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(B). \nADHS also sent the second for-cause termination letter.  ADHS raises Section III.C of \nthe provider agreements, which states that a provider may be terminated for a number of reasons, \nincluding, but not limited to:  โ(1) the sanction of a provider; (2) other reasons set out in the \nappropriate Arkansas Medicaid Provider Manual; or (3) failure to conform to the terms or \nrequirements of this contract.โ (Dkt. No. 16, Aff. 1).  ADHS claims that its second letter, \nterminating PPH โfor cause,โ is justified under Section III.C of the provider agreements because \nof โ. . . evidence that [PPH] and/or its affiliates are acting in an unethical manner and engaging \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 26 of 31\nin what appears to be wrongful conduct.โ (Dkt. No. 16, Aff. 1).  In justifying this, ADHS asserts \nthat โPlanned Parenthood affiliates have likely engaged in questionable transactions involving \nfetal parts and tissueโ and that Arkansas law prohibits the donation of fetal tissue, citing Ark. \nCode Ann. ยง 20-17-802(c) (Dkt. No. 16, at 22). \nADHS also contends that Planned Parenthood affiliates have โapparently altered abortion \nprocedures with an eye toward consummating the fetal-tissue transactions,โ which it believes is \nin violation of American Medical Association standards (Dkt. No. 16, at 23-25).  ADHS argues \nthat all of the aforementioned alleged conduct justifies ADHSโs determination that Planned \nParenthood has acted in an unethical manner, so as to remove itself from the category of \nqualified providers.  For the reasons its states in this Order, the Court does not strike the videos \nbut  gives  them  little  weight.    ADHSโs  argument  about  what  the  statements  in  the  videos \ndemonstrate, even if taken as true and assumed to be in context, which PPH and the Jane Does \ncontest,  may  overstate  this  proof.    Further,  PPH  and  the  Jane  Does  contest  whether  any \nโdeterminationโ as required by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-7(b)(6)(B) was made by ADHS here.     \nADHS also argues that ยง 1396a(23) does not define the term โqualifiedโ and that 42 \nC.F.R.  ยง  431.51(c)(2)  permits  states  to  โestablish  reasonable  standards  relating  to  the \nqualifications of providers.โ  The term โqualifiedโ is at issue in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A), in \nthe context of providers being โqualified to perform . . . the service or services required.โ  The \nSeventh Circuit has held that the term โqualifiedโ as used in the Medicaid Act โunambiguously \nrelate[s] to a providerโs fitness to perform the medical service the patient requires.โ  Commโr of \nInd. State Dep โt of Health, 699 F.3d at 978; see also Betlach, 727 F.3d at 969 (โWe therefore \nread that term, as it appears in ยง 1396a(a)(23), as conveying its ordinary meaning, which is:  \nโhaving an officially recognized qualification to practice as a member of a particular profession; \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 27 of 31\nfit, competent.โโ); see also Qualified, Blackโs Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining qualified \nas โcapable or competentโ).  If there is ambiguity in this term, the Jane Does argue the agencyโs \ninterpretation should be afforded deference and that it would not support ADHSโs conduct (Dkt. \nNo. 26, 26-2).  At this stage, the Court has not determined that there is an ambiguity so as to \nresort to giving deference to the agency.  The Court simply notes this argument exists.   \nThe record before the Court includes Ms. de Bacaโs affidavit (Dkt. No. 3, at 4  ฬถ 12).  Ms. \nde Baca states, โWhile all Planned Parenthood affiliates comply with federal and state law on the \ndisposal of fetal tissue, PPH does not participate in any fetal tissue donation, and does not appear \nin any of the videos.โ  (Dkt. No. 3, at 4, ยถ 13).  The Court acknowledges that ADHS moves this \nCourt to strike this statement from Ms. de Bacaโs affidavit, but the Court denies the motion.  The \nCourt finds persuasive the reasoning provided by plaintiffs in response to the motion to strike as \nto how Ms. de Baca acquired the knowledge upon which she basis this statement.  Further, there \ncan  be  no  meaningful  challenge  to  Ms.  de  Bacaโs  statements  as  to  PPHโs  activities;  it  is \nundisputed that she serves as the president and chief executive officer of PPH (Dkt. No. 3, at 4, ยถ \n1).  At this stage of the proceeding, the Court considers these statements.  It gives great weight to \nMs.  de  Bacaโs  statements  about  PPH  and  lesser  weight  to  the  remaining  portions  of  the \nstatement. \nAside from Ms. de Bacaโs statements there remains no contrary evidence in the record \nabout PPH at this stage.  For example, there is no evidence that PPH performs surgical abortions \nin Arkansas from which fetal tissue could be obtained.  There is no evidence that PPH performs \nmedication abortions in Arkansas from which fetal tissue can be obtained and donated for any \npurpose.  ADHS seems to acknowledge this when it recognizes that โthe vast majority of PPHโs \npatients in Arkansas are not abortion patients; they are patients seeking run-of-the-mill and \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 28 of 31\nuncontroversial decisions like wellness exams, pelvic exams, and birth control.  Indeed, there is \nno indication that the Jane Doe plaintiffs in this case are abortion patients.โ  (Dkt. No. 39, at 12).  \nMoreover, there also is no evidence that PPH has been cited, reprimanded, or cautioned by \nADHS in the past about its qualifications as a provider of the services it offers.   \nThis is consistent with what ADHS argues in support of its determination to terminate \nPPH as a provider.  ADHS does not specifically mention, or provide evidence in the record, that \nPPH itself has participated in any of this conduct cited by ADHS as a basis for its termination \ndecision, but instead ADHS relies on its contention that Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica and its affiliates function as a unified whole, and thus, the acts of one affiliate may be \nattributed to all other affiliates.  In support of this, ADHS cites among other matters personal \njurisdiction, tort liability, and joint employer cases, arguing that โPlanned Parenthood Federation \nโcodeterminesโ essential policies with its affiliates, and so its affiliates can be deemed to follow \nthose policies in a uniform fashion.โ (Dkt. No. 16, at 29-31).  The Jane Does have supplemented \ntheir response as to the merits of this dispute about ADHSโs ability to terminate the provider \nagreements of PPH if in fact PPH engaged in no alleged conduct (Dkt. No. 26, at 13 ฬถ 16).  Based \non a review of the authorities cited by both parties, the Court still finds that, at this stage, the \nJane Does are likely to prevail on the merits of this argument. \nThe Court acknowledges that the Jane Does move this Court to exclude the videos and \ntranscripts that ADHS cites because, as the Jane Does contend, they are irrelevant and unreliable.  \nThe Jane Does request that this Court strike them from the record and not consider them in \nmaking a determination on the Jane Doesโ motion for preliminary injunction.  This Court denies \nthe motion to strike (Dkt. No. 27, at 2). \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 29 of 31\nThe Jane Does first argue that the videos and transcripts are not relevant to whether \nADHSโs  termination  of  PPHโs  Medicaid  provider  agreements  likely  violates  the  Medicaid \nfreedom of choice provision, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23), which is the basis for the pending \nrequest  for  injunctive  relief.    ADHS  argues  โ[t]hese  videos  establish  a  basis  for  the \nadministrative termination, establish background and context for the agencyโs decision and, \nsignificantly, demonstrate Planned Parenthoodโs corporate knowledge and intent.โ (Dkt. No. 38, \nat 4).  Although the Court agrees with PPH and the Jane Does in that the videos do not show \nanything at all about PPH, its employees, or its practices, the Court declines at this stage of the \nlitigation to strike the videos under Rule 402, given the purpose for which ADHS cites them and \ngiven the evidentiary standards the parties agree apply to the Courtโs current inquiry. \nAt this stage of the proceeding, however, the videos are inadmissible hearsay.  This is the \nsecond basis for PPH and the Jane Doesโ request that the Court strike the videos under Rule 802.  \nAuthentication of videos as evidence is not a difficult requirement to meet in most instances.  \nHere, the individual who could submit an affidavit to this Court or appear before this Court to \nauthenticate the videos has not done so; the Court has not heard from the individual who created \nthe videos or edited the footage.  Instead, the Court is presented with conflicting reports on the \nextent of the editing and misrepresentations, if any, in the content and context of the videos and \ntranscripts (Dkt. No. 38-A).  Further, ADHS cites as the only basis for the admission of this \nhearsay evidence the residual clause of Rule 807โs hearsay exceptions (Dkt. No. 38, at 6).  Given \nthe evidentiary standards the parties agree the Court should apply at this stage, the Court declines \nto strike the videos.   \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 30 of 31\nThe  Court  has  reviewed  the  affidavits  and  exhibits  before  it  and  the  legal  theories \nadvanced by both sides.  The Court concludes that the Jane Does likely will succeed on the \nmerits of their 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 claims.     \n3.  Balance Of Equities And Public Interest \n  The Jane Does argue that the aforementioned threats of injury to them outweigh any harm \ncaused to ADHS.  In fact, the Jane Does contend that โthe state will suffer no harm at all.  \nRather, the state will continue to reimburse PPH for providing Medicaid services as it has for \nyears . . . and patients will continue to receive high-quality reproductive health careโ (Dkt. No. 4, \nat 17).  ADHS argues that Planned Parenthoodโs alleged conduct is โnot reflective of the values \nof Arkansas or Arkansans.โ (See Dkt. No. 16, at 33).  It claims that Arkansas should, within the \nbounds of the Medicaid program, be able to pursue its public policy objectives by excluding this \nnetwork from Arkansasโs Medicaid program.  \nThe Court must examine its case in the context of the relative injuries to the parties and to \nthe public.  Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 114.  After balancing these relative injuries and the equities \nargued by the parties, the Court finds that because any suspension of Medicaid payments would \nresult in threatened irreparable harm to the Jane Does and because the quality of PPHโs care \nrendered to Arkansas patients does not appear to be questioned by ADHS or other officials at this \ntime, the resulting harm to the Janes Does, who are PPHโs patients, is greater than the potential \nharm to ADHSโs pursuit of its stated public policy objectives.  At this stage of the proceedings, \nthe Court finds that the threat of irreparable harm to the Jane Does, and the public interest, \noutweighs the immediate interests and potential injuries to ADHS.  \n \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 45   Filed 10/05/15   Page 31 of 31\nIII.  Security \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), a district court may issue a preliminary \ninjunction โonly if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay \nthe costs and damages  sustained by  any party  found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  In these proceedings, ADHS has neither requested security in \nthe event this Court enters a preliminary injunction nor has it presented any evidence that it will \nbe financially harmed if it were wrongfully enjoined.  Further, as this Court stated when it \nentered the temporary restraining order, this Court does not perceive how ADHS could be \nharmed  by  reimbursing  PPH  for  services  provided  to  the  Jane  Doe  Medicaid  patients, \nconsidering that ADHS likely will have to pay the same amount for benefits of these patients \nregardless of who the patientsโ Medicaid provider happens to be.  For these reasons, the Court \ndeclines to require security from the Jane Does.   \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court determines that the Jane Does have met their burden \nfor the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  Therefore, the Court grants the Jane Doesโ motion \nfor preliminary injunction.  The Court enjoins ADHS from suspending Medicaid payments to \nPPH for services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries the Jane Does until further order from this \nCourt. \n  SO ORDERED this 5th day of October, 2015, at 8:35 a.m. \n                                                                                               \n \n_______________________________ \n                                  Kristine G.

Case No. 4:15-cv-00566-KGB \n \nCINDY GILLESPIE, Director, Arkansas   \nDepartment of Human Services, in her Official \nCapacity   DEFENDANT \n \nORDER \n \nBefore the Court is a motion to stay proceedings filed by plaintiffs Planned Parenthood \nArkansas & Eastern Oklahoma d/b/a Planned Parenthood Great Plains (โPPAEOโ), Jane Doe #1, \nJane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, on their behalf and all others similarly situated (Dkt. No. 185).  \nDefendant Cindy Gillespie, Director of Arkansas Department of Human Services (โADHSโ), \nresponded in opposition (Dkt. No. 188), and plaintiffs replied (Dkt. No. 189).  Also before the \nCourt is Ms. Gillespieโs motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim \n(Dkt. No. 168).  Plaintiffs responded in opposition (Dkt. No. 171), and Ms. Gillespie replied (Dkt. \nNo. 174).  For the reasons discussed below, the Court denies plaintiffsโ motion to stay proceedings \nand declines, at this time, to rule on defendantsโ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to \nplaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim (Dkt. Nos. 168, 185).   \nI.  Background \nA detailed history of the procedural background in this matter may be found in this Courtโs \nprior Order denying plaintiffsโ latest motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 181, at 1-5).  \nWithout repeating that history in full, the Court provides a brief overview to provide context for \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 192   Filed 03/24/19   Page 2 of 7\nthis Order.  On September 11, 2015, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that defendant John Selig1 \nviolated the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23), by denying PPAEOโs Medicaid patients the \nopportunity to obtain family planning and other preventative health care services from a qualified \nprovider of their choosing (Dkt. No. 1).  Plaintiffs also alleged that Mr. Selig violated the First and \nFourteenth Amendments by penalizing plaintiffs for associating with Planned Parenthood and \nabortion and that Mr. Selig had singled out plaintiffs for unfavorable treatment in violation of the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Id., ยถยถ 49, 51).  The Court granted \nplaintiffs a temporary restraining order on September 18, 2015 (Dkt. No. 21).  Then, on October \n2, 2015, the Court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of just the Jane Doe plaintiffs (Dkt. \nNo. 44, 45).   \nOn January 25, 2016, the Court certified a class of patients (the โPatient Classโ), which \nconsists of those patients who seek to obtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas \nat PPAEO through the Medicaid program (Dkt. No. 86).  The plaintiffs then moved for a new \npreliminary injunction; the plaintiffs sought to have this new preliminary injunction extend to the \nnewly-certified class (Dkt. No. 98).  On September 29, 2016, the Court entered a preliminary \ninjunction on behalf of the Patient Class enjoining the ADHS from suspending Medicaid payments \nto PPAEO for services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries who are members of the Patient Class \n(Dkt. No. 127).  This preliminary injunction was based upon plaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim.  On \nNovember 30, 2016, with the Courtโs permission, plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint, \nalleging  that  ADHSโ  actions  violate  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1396a(a)(23),  penalize  plaintiffs  for  their \nconstitutionally protected right to associate with Planned Parenthood and/or abortion, and unfairly \n                                                      \n1  Ms. Gillespie was automatically substituted as defendant when she became director of \nthe ADHS.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25 (โThe officerโs successor is automatically substituted as a \nparty.โ).   \n2 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 192   Filed 03/24/19   Page 3 of 7\ntarget plaintiffs for unfavorable treatment without adequate justification in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Dkt. No. 135-1, ยถยถ 54-59).  \nOn August 16, 2017, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion vacating the \nCourtโs second preliminary injunction order on the grounds that 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A) does \nnot create an enforceable federal right for individual patients.  Does v. Gillespie, 867 F.3d 1034, \n1046 (8th Cir. 2017).  The Eighth Circuitโs mandate was entered on November 20, 2017, at which \npoint this Court regained jurisdiction of the case.  On January 19, 2018, PPAEO and the Jane Does \nfiled a motion for preliminary injunction on their constitutional claims (Dkt. No. 144).  While the \nCourt was considering the motion for preliminary injunction, Ms. Gillespie filed her motion for \njudgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim (Dkt. No. 168).  The Court denied \nthe motion for a preliminary injunction based upon plaintiffsโ constitutional claims on July 30, \n2018 (Dkt. No. 181). \nWhile this litigation was ongoing, other Circuit Courts of Appeals held that 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396a(a)(23)(A)  creates  an  enforceable  federal  right  for  individual  patients.    See  Planned \nParenthood of Kan., Inc. v. Andersen, 882 F.3d 1205 (10th Cir. 2018) (holding that ยง 1396a(a)(23) \ncreates a private right of action in individual patients); Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. \nGee, 862 F.3d 445 (5th Cir. 2017) (same); see also Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Betlach, 727 \nF.3d 960, 968 (9th Cir. 2013) (same); Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Commโr of the Ind. State \nDepโt of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir. 2012) (same); Harris v. Olszewski, 442 F.3d 456 (6th \nCir. 2006) (same).  To resolve the circuit split created by the Eighth Circuitโs decision in Does, \ntwo petitions for writs of certiorari were filed with the Supreme Court, and plaintiffs filed their \npresent motion to stay proceedings pending the final disposition of the petitions for writs of \ncertiorari (Dkt. No. 185).  Before the Court could rule on the motion to stay proceedings or the \n3 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 192   Filed 03/24/19   Page 4 of 7\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, the Supreme Court denied the petitions for writs of \ncertiorari on December 10, 2018.  See Andersen v. Planned Parenthood of Kan. and Mid-Missouri, \nNo. 17-1340, 2018 WL 1456394 (2018); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 S. \nCt. 408 (2018).      \nII.  Motion To Stay Proceedings \nIn their motion to stay proceedings, plaintiffs argue that issues of judicial economy weigh \nin favor of staying the present proceedings while the Supreme Court considers the pending \npetitions for writs of certiorari (Dkt. No. 185).  Plaintiffs specifically argue that, โif the Supreme \nCourt grants certiorari in the Gee or Andersen casesโ and finds that there is an individual right of \naction under ยง 1396a(a)(23), then it may be unnecessary for this Court to reach plaintiffsโ \nconstitutional claims (Id., at 4).  In response, Ms. Gillespie points out that the earliest deadline \nagreed to by the parties in the Rule 26(f) report is the August 12, 2019, deadline for joining parties \nand amending the pleadings and argues that any decision by the Supreme Court will be rendered \nbefore that date (Dkt. No. 188, at 4).  Ms. Gillespie also points out that the Rule 26(f) report sets \nthe deadline for completing discovery on November 20, 2019 (Id., at 4-5).  Thus, according to Ms. \nGillespie, the primary result of a stay pending the Supreme Courtโs consideration of the certiorari \npetitions would be to delay discovery in this matter (Id., at 5).    \nWhile the Court has broad discretion to stay discovery under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 26(c), see Steinbuch v. Cutler, 518 F.3d 580, 588 (8th Cir. 2008), the Court concludes \nthat a stay is not appropriate at this time.  The Court first notes that plaintiffsโ arguments for a stay \nare predicated upon the Supreme Court granting the petitions for writs of certiorari in the Gee and \nAndersen cases; those arguments have been mooted by the Supreme Courtโs denial of certiorari \nin those cases.  See Andersen, 2018 WL 1456394; Gee, 139 S. Ct. 408.  Thus, if the Court were to \n4 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 192   Filed 03/24/19   Page 5 of 7\ngrant a stay at this time, the primary effect of the stay would be to delay discovery on plaintiffsโ \nremaining constitutional claims.  Courts have used various standards in determining whether to \nstay discovery, including:  (1) whether there is a strong showing that a claim is unmeritorious; (2) \nthe breadth of discovery and burden of responding to it; and (3) the risk of unfair prejudice to the \nparty opposing the stay.  Chesney v. Valley Stream Union Free Sch. Dist., 236 F.R.D. 113, 116 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2006).  Courts may also consider the complexity of the action and the stage of litigation.  \nChesney, 236 F.R.D. at 116; see TE Connectivity Networks, Inc. v. All Sys. Broadband, Inc., Case \nNo. CIV. 13-1356 ADM/FLN, 2013 WL 4487505, at *2 (D. Minn. Aug. 20, 2013) (โAmong other \nthings, district courts have taken a โpeekโ at the merits of the pending dispositive motion, \nconsidered the breadth of pending discovery, and balanced the harm produced by delaying \ndiscovery against the possibility that the entire matter will be resolved by the motion.โ); Benge v. \nEli Lilly & Co., 553 F. Supp. 2d 1049, 1050 (N.D. Ind. 2008) (identifying three factors a court may \nuse in determining whether a stay is appropriate:  โ(1) potential prejudice to the non-moving party; \n(2) hardship and inequity to the moving party if the matter is not stayed; and (3) economy of \njudicial resources.โ).   \nConsidering the factors other courts have identified in determining the propriety of a stay \nof discovery, the Court finds that, at this time, a stay in this action is not warranted.    \nIII.  Motion For Judgment On The Pleadings \nIn her motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim, Ms. \nGillespie argues that, given the Eighth Circuitโs decision in Does v. Gillespie, plaintiffs no longer \nhave standing to bring their claim under the Medicaid Act, and therefore it should be dismissed \n(Dkt. No. 169, at 2).  Plaintiffs make three arguments in response:  (1) the Eighth Circuitโs decision \nin Does v. Gillespie may be unsettled by a decision from the Supreme Court; (2) any order from \n5 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 192   Filed 03/24/19   Page 6 of 7\nthe Court dismissing the Medicaid Act claim would be interlocutory; and (3) dismissing the \nMedicaid Act would have no practical effect on discovery because the scope of discovery on \nplaintiffsโ constitutional claims are the same as on their Medicaid Act claim (Dkt. No. 171).  \nPlaintiffs also ask the Court to defer any decision on Ms. Gillespieโs motion until the close of the \ncase (Id., at 5).  In reply, Ms. Gillespie argues that it is not appropriate to deny the motion because \nof โthe off-chanceโ of a Supreme Court decision, the fact that a dismissal of the Medicaid Act \nclaim would be interlocutory means that it should be granted, and that there is no authority for \nallowing a claim to proceed because the dismissal of that claim would have no effect on the \nlitigation (Dkt. No. 174, at 1-3). \nThe Court concludes that a ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to \nplaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim is neither necessary nor helpful at this stage of the litigation.  See \nU.S. v. 687.30 Acres of Land, More or Less, in Dakota and Thurston Counties, State of Neb., 451 \nF.2d 667, 670 (8th Cir. 1971) (โRulings on pleadings are clearly interlocutory and are not \nappealable.  Of course all interlocutory rulings are subject to review upon appeal from final \njudgment.โ).  Any ruling from this Court on the pending motion for judgment on the pleadings as \nto plaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim would be an interlocutory order that the Court could reconsider \nprior to entering a final judgment.  Accordingly, the Court will hold the motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings as to plaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim under advisement until a later date (Dkt. No. \n168). \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court denies plaintiffsโ motion to stay proceedings \n(Dkt. No. 185).  The motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffsโ Medicaid Act claim \nremains under advisement (Dkt. No. 168).  \n6 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 192   Filed 03/24/19   Page 7 of 7\nIt is so ordered, this the 24th day of March, 2019. \n                                                                                              _______________________________ \n                                            Kristine G.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS \nWESTERN DIVISION \n  \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD ARKANSAS \n& EASTERN OKLAHOMA, d/b/a \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD OF THE  \nHEARTLAND; JANE DOE #1; JANE DOE \n#2; and JANE DOE #3                PLAINTIFFS \n \nv.             Case No. 4:15-cv-00566-KGB \n \nJOHN M. SELIG, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS \nDEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES, in his \nofficial capacity                                           DEFENDANT \n \nORDER \n  Before  the  Court  is  the  motion  for  class  certification  filed  by  plaintiffs  Planned \nParenthood  of  Arkansas  &  Eastern  Oklahoma,  d/b/a  Planned  Parenthood  of  the  Heartland \n(โPPHโ)  and  Jane  Doe  #1,  Jane  Doe  #2,  and  Jane  Doe  #3  (โJane  Doesโ)  (Dkt.  No.  50).  \nDefendant John M. Selig, sued in his official capacity only as the Director of the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services (โADHSโ), has responded in opposition to the motion for class \ncertification (Dkt. No. 71), and PPH and the Jane Does have filed a reply (Dkt. No. 72).  The \nCourt conducted a hearing in this matter on January 14, 2016, at which counsel for all parties \nwere present.  ADHS filed a post-hearing supplemental response to plaintiffsโ motion for class \ncertification (Dkt. No. 82).  For the reasons that follow, plaintiffsโ motion for class certification \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 is granted.   \nI.  Background \nPPH operates health centers in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Fayetteville, Arkansas, and has \ndone so for over 30 years.  These centers provide family planning services to men and women, \nincluding contraception and contraceptive counseling, screening for breast and cervical cancer, \n\npregnancy  testing  and  counseling,  and  early  medication  abortion.    PPH  states  that,  at  its \nArkansas health centers, PPH offers only early medication abortions, services that Arkansas \nMedicaid does not cover in virtually all circumstances (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 17).  PPH and the Jane \nDoes represent that Medicaid payment for abortion is not at issue in this case (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 17).  \nPPH also operates a pharmacy that serves Arkansas residents which allows patients to have their \nbirth control prescriptions automatically refilled.  During the 2015 fiscal year, PPH represents \nthat it provided approximately 1,000 health care visits and filled more than 1,100 prescriptions, \nfor over 500 women, men, and teens insured through Medicaid in Little Rock and Fayetteville, \nArkansas.  In 2014, almost 40% of PPHโs Little Rock, Arkansas, patients, and 15% of its \nFayetteville, Arkansas, patients were insured through Medicaid, according to PPH.  Plaintiffs \nJane Does are patients of PPH who receive their care through the Medicaid program.  \nPPH and the Jane Does allege that ADHS, through its director Mr. Selig, notified PPH on \nAugust 14, 2015, that ADHS was terminating its Medicaid provider agreements, effective 30 \ndays from the date of the letter (Dkt. No. 16-1, at 19).  PPH and the Jane Does further allege that \nthis initial notification letter provided no reason for the termination of the agreements; they assert \nthat this initial termination appears to stem from PPHโs association with Planned Parenthood and \nabortion (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 35).  To support their contention that ADHS wrongfully suspended \nMedicaid payments to PPH, PPH and the Jane Does cite Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinsonโs \npress release from August 14, 2014, the day the termination letter was sent to PPH.  In this \nrelease, Governor Hutchinson states that he directed ADHS to terminate the agreements because \nโ[i]t is apparent that after the recent revelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood, that this \norganization does not represent the values of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served \nby terminating any and all existing contracts with them.โ  (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 35). \n2 \n \n\nPPH and the Jane Does further assert that Governor Hutchinsonโs reference to โrecent \nrevelationsโ  regarding  Planned  Parenthood  refers  to  recent  videos  released  about  Planned \nParenthood, claiming that some Planned Parenthood affiliates allow patients to donate fetal \ntissue to medical research following abortions (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 35).   \nADHS followed this August 14, 2015, letter  with a second termination letter dated \nSeptember 1, 2015, that ADHS characterizes as a โfor causeโ letter.  PPH and the Jane Does \nallege  that  this  second  letter  states  solely  that  it  โis  based  in  part  upon  the  troubling \ncircumstances and activities that have recently come to light regarding the national Planned \nParenthood organization, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, and other affiliated Planned \nParenthood entities, all of which are affiliated with [PPH],โ and that โthere is evidence that \n[PPH] and/or its affiliates are acting in an unethical manner and engaging in what appears to be \nwrongful conduct.โ (Dkt. Nos. 12, ยถ 37; 16-1, at 21 ฬถ 26).  The letter also states that PPH is \nโwelcome to submit information or offer comments on the nationally recognized videos that \nhave raised questions on the conduct of Planned Parenthood.โ (Dkt. Nos. 12, ยถ 37; 16-1, at 21 ฬถ \n26). \nPPH and the Jane Does filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction on September 11, 2015 (Dkt. No. 3).  This motion alleges that, starting on September \n21, 2015, absent an injunction, patients insured through the Medicaid program who choose to get \nfamily planning and other health care services at PPH will lose access to services, will lose their \nprovider of choice, will find their family planning services interrupted, and will be left with few \nor no adequate alternative providers (Dkt. No. 12, ยถยถ 8, 34).  As for PPH, PPH and the Jane Does \ncontend that, โ[i]f PPH is forced to stop providing care through the Medicaid program, a dire \nsituation will become critical.  The remaining providers will be simply unable to absorb PPHโs \n3 \n \n\npatients, leaving those patients without access to crucial medical services.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 43).  \nFurther, they allege that โ[w]ithout Medicaid reimbursements, PPH may be unable to continue to \nprovide services in the same manner and may be forced to lay off staff members and/or reduce \nhours at one or both health centers.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 49).  They also allege that, โif PPHโs \ntermination from the Medicaid program is allowed to take effect for some period of time and it \nthen is later allowed to become a Medicaid provider again, some patients will remain confused \nabout whether PPH is a Medicaid provider in good standing, and therefore will not return as \npatients.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 49).  PPH and the Jane Does claim that the suspension of Medicaid \npayments violates certain provisions of the Medicaid statutory and regulatory scheme set out in \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1396 and violates their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution.  They have sued ADHSโs director, Mr. Selig, in his official capacity \nonly seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (Dkt. No. 12, at 15).   \nThis Court granted PPH and the Jane Doesโ motion for temporary restraining order (Dkt. \nNo. 21).  The Court temporarily restrained ADHS โfor a period of 14 days from the date of entry \nof this Order from suspending Medicaid payments to PPH for services rendered to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, including but not limited to the Jane Does.โ (Dkt. No. 21, at 19).  At that stage of \nthe proceedings, the Court conducted a status conference with counsel concerning a briefing \nschedule and potential hearing.  For the reasons set forth in its Order, the Court permitted ADHS \nto obtain evidentiary material from the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 25).  The Court did not regulate the \nnumber, scope, or timing of the written questions ADHS submitted to the Jane Does.  The Court \ninstructed counsel from both sides to meet and confer on these matters, and although the Court \ndid later enter an Order clarifying its earlier Order on the permitted discovery, the Court was not \nasked to resolve or clarify any other issues in regard to the questions submitted to the Jane Does \n4 \n \n\n(Dkt. No. 32).  Also at this stage of the proceeding, the Court raised with counsel again and \ndirected counsel to brief standing issues.       \nThe Court then entered a preliminary injunction more limited in scope โ limiting the \nrelief granted to just the Jane Does (Dkt. Nos. 44, 45).  The Court then granted PPH and the Jane \nDoes  leave  to  file  a  second  amended  complaint  (Dkt.  No.  63).    In  their  second  amended \ncomplaint, PPH and the Jane Does add class action allegations (Dkt. No. 64, ยถยถ 50 ฬถ 55).     \nOn October 6, 2015, ADHS filed a motion for leave to notice four depositions (Dkt. No. \n56).  The Court conducted a status hearing on the motion.  ADHS requested leave to depose Jane \nDoe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 and to conduct a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) \ndeposition  of  a  PPH  representative  before  responding  to  the  pending  motion  for  class \ncertification.  ADHS claims that it seeks these depositions to test, at least, the typicality and \nadequacy requirements for class certification (Dkt. No. 55, at 4).  For the reasons set forth in its \nOrder, the Court denied the motion for leave to notice four depositions (Dkt. No. 66). \nPPH and the Jane Does are now asking this Court to certify a class, and ADHS at the \nhearing conducted in this matter orally renewed its request to conduct precertification discovery.  \nII.  Discussion \n  PPH and the Jane Does seek class-action certification under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure for โthe Jane Doe plaintiffs and all other persons similarly situated, namely:  \npatients who seek to obtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at PPH through the \nMedicaid program.โ  (Dkt. No. 50, at 1).   \n  To obtain class certification, plaintiffs must meet all four requirements of Federal Rule of \nCivil  Procedure  23(a),  commonly  referred  to  as  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and \nadequacy of representation, and must fall into one of the categories of Rule 23(b).  Amchem \nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997); Blades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, \n5 \n \n\n568 ฬถ 69 (8th Cir. 2005); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  The party seeking certification bears the burden of \nshowing that the class should be certified and that the requirements of Rule 23 are met.  Coleman \nv. Watt, 40 F.3d 255, 258 ฬถ 59 (8th Cir. 1994).  The district court is afforded broad discretion to \ndecide whether certification is appropriate.  Luiken v. Dominoโs Pizza, LLC, 705 F.3d 370, 372 \n(8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Profโl Firefigthers Assโn of Omaha, Local 385 v. Zalewski, 678 F.3d \n640, 645 (8th Cir. 2012)).  According to the Eighth Circuit: \nA district court considering a motion for class certification must undertake a \nrigorous  analysis  to  ensure  that  the  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)  are  met.  \nFrequently that rigorous analysis will entail some overlap with the merits of the \nplaintiffโs underlying claim, and the district court may resolve disputes going to \nthe factual setting of the case if necessary to the class certification analysis.  The \ncourtโs  factual  findings  with  respect  to  the  class  certification  question  are \nreviewed for clear error.  \nBennett v. Nucor Corp., 656 F.3d 802, 814 (8th Cir. 2011) (internal quotations and citations \nomitted).  The Court will consider Rule 23(a) and (b) in turn.   \nA.  Rule 23(a)  \nTo certify a class pursuant to Rule 23(a)(1), this Court must first make a finding that โthe \nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  \nPPH and the Jane Does assert that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.  In support of this assertion, plaintiffs note that, in fiscal year 2015, PPH provided \ncare to over 500 Arkansas women, men, and teens insured through Medicaid, and in the previous \nfiscal year, PPH saw more than 1,100 women, men, and teens insured through Medicaid (Dkt. \nNo. 51, at 3).  PPH and the Jane Does contend that the size of the proposed class readily meets \nthe numerosity requirement, as joinder of all of PPHโs Medicaid patients is impractical.   \nPPH and the Jane Does also argue that โjoinder of each of PPHโs individual Medicaid \npatients is impractical for the additional reason that many patients may be hindered in their \nability to join the litigation by the highly sensitive and personal nature of reproductive health \n6 \n \n\ncare decisions, and because of their fear of becoming the targets of anti-abortion or anti-Planned \nParenthood hostility.โ  Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (โ[an abortion patient] may \nbe chilled from such assertion [of her rights] by a desire to protect the very privacy of her \ndecision from the publicity of a court suit.โ); Gold Cross Ambulance & Transfer v. City of \nKansas City, 705 F.2d 1005, 1016 (8th Cir. 1983) (characterizing the abortion decision at issue \nin Singleton as โan intimate, private decisionโ that hindered patientsโ ability to assert their \nrights); Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, Inc. v. Citizens for Cmty. Action, 558 F.2d 861, 865 \nn.3 (8th Cir. 1977) (recognizing that โthe pregnant womanโs ability to assert her own rights is \nbeset with obstacles,โ including โher desire to protect her privacyโ).  \nADHS does not dispute that the numerosity requirement has been met.  Plaintiffs have \nprovided sufficient evidence to satisfy their burden as to this factor.  See Boyd v. Ozark Air \nLines, Inc., 568 F.2d 50, 54 (8th Cir. 1977) (โNo arbitrary rules on the size of classes have been \nestablished by the courts and the question of what constitutes impracticability depends upon the \nfacts of each case.โ) \nRule 23(a)(2) next requires there to be โquestions of law or fact common to the class.โ  \nRule 23(a)(2) does not require that every question of law or fact be common to every member of \nthe class.  Paxton v. Union Nat. Bank, 688 F.2d 552, 561 (8th Cir. 1982).  Commonality may be \nsatisfied โwhere the question of law linking the class members is substantially related to the \nresolution of the litigation even though the individuals are not identically situated.โ  Id.  (internal \nquotations and citations omitted).  The existence of even a single common question is sufficient \nto establish commonality.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, โ, 131 S. Ct. 2541, \n2556 (2011).  PPH and the Jane Does contend that, since this litigation focuses on the injury \ncaused to all class members by the stateโs actions, questions of law are necessarily common.  See \n7 \n \n\nU.S. Fid. and Guar. Co. v. Lord, 585 F.2d 860, 871 (8th Cir. 1978) (commonality requirement \nmet where there is a โbasic legal and factual allegation in the Complaint which applies โacross \nthe boardโ to all members of plaintiffsโ classโ).   \nPPH and the Jane Does argue that the Jane Does and the other proposed class members \nraise the same question of law:  whether defendantโs termination of PPH Medicaid provider \nagreements violates the Medicaid free choice of provider requirement, which states that โany \nindividual eligible for medical assistance. . . may obtain such assistance from any institution, \nagency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required. . . \nwho undertakes to provide him such services.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23).  To this point, this \nCourt noted in the Preliminary Injunction Order that the question turns on โwhether Arkansas \ncan terminate PPH as a qualified Medicaid provider for the reasons it articulates in this litigation \nwithout violating the freedom of choice provisionโ (Dkt. No. 45, at 23 ฬถ 24).  \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that there is, in fact, a question of law common to the class.  \nThe Court finds this requirement met. \n  Rule 23(a)(3) includes a โtypicality provision [that] requires a demonstration that there \nare other members of the class who have the same or similar grievances as the plaintiff.โ  \nDonaldson v. Pillsbury Co., 554 F.2d 825, 830 (8th Cir. 1977).  The typicality requirement \ngenerally is satisfied โif the claims or defenses of the representatives and the members of the \nclass stem from a single event or are based on the same legal or remedial theory.โโ  Paxton, 688 \nF.2d at 561โ62 (quoting C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1764 at n.21.1 \n(Supp. 1982)).  โThe burden of showing typicality is not an onerous one.โ  Id.  It requires \nsomething more than general conclusory allegations, id., but it โis fairly easily met so long as \nother class members have claims similar to the named plaintiff.โ  DeBoer v. Mellon Mortgage \n8 \n \n\nCo., 64 F.3d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir. 1995).  โWhen the claim arises out of the same legal or \nremedial theory, the presence of factual variations is normally not sufficient to preclude class \naction treatment.โ  Donaldson, 554 F.2d at 831.   \n  ADHS  argues  that  there  are  differences  weighing  against  a  finding  of  typicality, \nincluding that โabsent class members will have vastly different circumstances from each other \nand from the Jane Does that will affect the irreparable harm analysis.โ  (Dkt. No. 71, at 16).  \nADHS contends that these differences include, but are not limited to, whether a patient prefers \nPPH to other Medicaid providers, whether a person has experienced or will experience longer \nlines and more difficult scheduling at other Medicaid providers compared to PPH, and whether a \nperson has another Medicaid provider to which they have gone, can go, and will go.  ADHS also \nargues that these differences include whether a proposed class member is a Little Rock resident \n(where  the  named  Jane  Does  live  and  about  which  they  have  provided  information)  or  a \nFayetteville  resident  (where  the  named  Jane  Does  do  not  live  and  about  which  they  have \nprovided no information) (Dkt. No. 71, at 16).  ADHS further contends that typicality is absent \nbecause the claim brought for injunctive relief requires resolution not just of the 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396a(a)(23) issue but also of the threat of irreparable harm.  ADHS argues that, given what it \ncontends is an overly broad proposed class, the Court should conclude the differences concerning \nirreparable harm cause a lack of typicality even where the legal 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) issue is \nsimilar to all (Dkt. No. 71, at 16 ฬถ 17). \n  PPH and the Jane Does counter this argument by citing an Alabama district court case \nwith facts almost identical to the facts presented here.  In that case, the Court found that, \nโbecause the only attribute of Doe relevant to the courtโs resolution of this claim is one that she \nshares with all [patients]  ฬถ  namely, that she is a Medicaid recipient who wishes to receive \n9 \n \n\ncovered care from [Planned Parenthood]  ฬถ  there is no possibility that additional evidence would \nreveal  that  the  injunction  would  be  any  less  appropriately  entered  with  respect  to  another \nrecipient not presently a party to the case.โ  See Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. v. Bentley, \nCase No. 2:15-cv-620-MHT, 2015 WL 6517875, at *15 (M.D. Ala. Oct. 28, 2015).  In addition, \nthere is Eighth Circuit precedent that โ[f]actual variations in the individual claims will not \nnormally preclude class certification if the claim arises from the same event or course of conduct \nas the class claims, and gives rise to the same legal or remedial theory.โ  See Alpern v. UtiliCorp \nUnited, Inc., 84 F.3d 1525, 1540 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Donaldson, 554 F.2d at 831). \n  The Court is satisfied that the typicality requirement is met here.  ADHSโs termination of \nPPHโs Medicaid provider agreements gives rise to identical claims for violation of the free \nchoice of provider right by the Jane Doe plaintiffs and PPHโs other existing and future Medicaid \npatients.    Plaintiffs  and  other  class  members  will  rely  on  the  exact  same  legal  theory  in \nchallenging ADHSโs actions.   \nAs for ADHSโs argument that typicality is absent because the purported differences \nconcerning  irreparable  harm  cause  a  lack  of  typicality  even  where  the  legal  42  U.S.C.  ยง \n1396a(a)(23) issue is similar to all, the Court rejects the argument.  Throughout this litigation, \nADHS has cited the Court to various non-controlling authority from district courts in other \ncircuits in support of its contention that โit is also black letter law that irreparable harm may not \nbe presumed merely from a violation of a statute.โ (Dkt. No. 71, at 15).  In its analysis of \nirreparable harm in the Preliminary Injunction Order, the Court discussed more than just the \nalleged statutory harm (Dkt. No. 45).  The Court concluded that the Jane Does, based on the \nalleged threat of statutory harm and other irreparable harms identified, met their burden to merit \ninjunctive relief (Dkt. No. 45, 18 ฬถ 22).  On the record before the Court, the Janes Does have put \n10 \n \n\ninto the record evidence that the other forms of harm they identified likely apply to all of the \nproposed class members.  In the Courtโs Preliminary Injunction Order, the Court found that the \nArkansas Department of Healthโs own documents reflect that long wait times and delays in \nscheduling  appointments  are  commonplace  among  county  health  clinics  that  offer  family \nplanning services and other preventative care (Dkt. No. 45, ยถ 26; Dkt. Nos. 26-5, 26-6).  The \nCourt finds the typicality requirement met on this record.   \nLastly, Rule 23(a)(4) requires that โthe representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  โThe focus of Rule 23(a)(4) is \nwhether:  (1) the class representatives have common interests with the members of the class, and \n(2) whether the class representatives will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through \nqualified counsel.โ  Paxton, 688 F.2d at 562 ฬถ 63.   \n  The Jane Does argue that they have the same injuries, interests, and legal theories as the \nclass as a whole, demonstrating their ability to represent adequately the class interests.  They \nclaim that their interests are not โantagonistic to the remainder of the class,โ and, as can be seen \nalready in this case by their quickly responding to the written discovery propounded by ADHS, \nthey โvigorously pursue[]โ their claims.  DeBoer, 64 F.3d at 1175. \n  ADHS asserts that โ[t]he inquiry into adequacy of representation, in particular, requires \nthe district courtโs close scrutiny . . . .โ  Rattray v. Woodbury County, IA, 614 F.3d 831, 835 (8th \nCir. 2010) (citing Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 41 (1940)).  ADHS cites this Court to non-\nbinding  precedent  in  support  of  its  argument  that  โto  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  named \nrepresentatives, courts have looked to factors such as their honesty, conscientiousness, and other  \naffirmative personal qualities.โ  7A C. Wright, A. Miller and M. Kane, Federal Practice and \nProcedure, Civil 2d ยง 1766 at 308 ฬถ 10.   \n11 \n \n\n  Based upon the cases from other circuits cited by ADHS in its filing in support of this \ncontention, ADHS asserts that the Jane Does are not conscientious because of certain mistakes \non the record that the Jane Does made and later corrected during the very short time frame they \nwere given to respond to the propounded questions.  The Eighth Circuit has articulated no \nspecific requirement that courts assess conscientiousness when analyzing whether to certify a \nclass under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  As such, the Court declines to do so.  Even if \nthe  Court  were  required  to  do  so,  the  Court  rejects  the  suggestion  that  any  lack  of \nconscientiousness is demonstrated by the record before it or that any purported issues of honesty \nor  other  affirmative  personal  qualities  of  the  Jane  Does  dictate  that  class  certification  is \ninappropriate here.   \n  ADHS  next  argues  that  federal  courts  across  the  county  require  potential  class \nrepresentatives to prove they are both willing and able to control and supervise class counsel and \nto participate in the direction and strategy of the litigation.  \n  The Court is unpersuaded by this attempt to expand the adequacy requirement beyond \nwhat  is  required  by  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  โ  โwhether:    (1)  the  class \nrepresentatives have common interests with the members of the class, and (2) whether the class \nrepresentatives will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.โ  \nPaxton, 688 F.2d at 562 ฬถ 63.  As to the first prong, the Court finds that plaintiffs have common \ninterests with the members of the proposed class.  As to the second prong, the Court finds that \nplaintiffs  have  โdemonstrated  a  willingness  to  prosecute  the  interests  of  the  class  through \nqualified counsel.โ  Id. at 563.  Even if the requirements are as ADHS suggests, this Court noted \nin a prior Order in this case that โ[t]he Jane Does, through the materials they have submitted, \nhave demonstrated they are in communication with counsel and interested in this litigation.โ \n12 \n \n\n(Dkt. No. 66, at 2).  The Jane Does have responded to ADHSโs written discovery โin detail and \non very short notice.โ (Id.).  In short, the Court finds even the requirements ADHS suggests \nsatisfied here.       \n  ADHS also attempts to persuade the Court that, because the Jane Does were โrecruitedโ \nfor this litigation and have โwork schedules, life schedules, and other obligations,โ that they are \nsomehow inadequate to serve as class representatives (Dkt. No. 71, at 9).  How the Jane Does \ncame  to  be  involved  in  this  litigation  is  immaterial  to  their  adequacy  to  serve  as  class \nrepresentatives.  See Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 101 n.11 (1981); In re Primus, 436 \nU.S. 412, 422, 426 ฬถ 31 (1978).  In addition, that the Jane Does have busy work schedules and \nother obligations does not lead this Court to conclude on the record before it that they โhave not \nbeen in control of this lawsuit, and they are not able and willing to meaningfully control or \nsupervise Planned Parenthoodโs counsel,โ as ADHS argues (Dkt. No. 71, at 11). \n  ADHS next attempts to refute the Jane Doesโ claim of adequacy by contending that \nattorney Jennifer Sandman, counsel for the Jane Does, is โDeputy Director of the Planned \nParenthood Federation of America.โ (Dkt. No. 71, at 2, n.2).  Again, the Court finds it difficult to \ndiscern how this argument fits into the Eighth Circuitโs Paxton analysis, but the Court notes that, \naccording to the record before it, Ms. Sandman is Deputy Director of a department within \nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America (โPPFAโ) called Public Policy Litigation and Law โ \na department that conducts litigation throughout the country on behalf of Planned Parenthood \naffiliates and their patients and, thus, has a traditional attorney-client relationship with PPH and \nthe Jane Does.  Neither she nor the organization with whom she works has control over the \nbusiness decisions of PPH, PPFA, or any other Planned Parenthood entity (Dkt. No. 26-3, ยถ 6).  \n  ADHS also argues that PPH has a financial stake in this litigation that could create a \n13 \n \n\nconflict.  PPH and the Jane Does counter this by claiming that โPPH is a nonprofit organization \nthat brought this action (along with the Jane Does) to enjoin Defendant from excluding PPH \nfrom  the  Medicaid  program  and  to  ensure  that  PPH  can  continue  to  โprovid[e]  basic  and \npreventive health care services and medications to the Arkansas women and men who depend on \n[PPH] for these services.โโ (Dkt. No. 3, at 5 ฬถ 9, ยถยถ 3, 6, 15).  The Jane Does are also represented \nby Bettina E. Brownstein on behalf of the Arkansas Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the \nArkansas affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, a not-for-profit organization that has no \nfinancial stake in the litigation.  On the record before it, and considering all authorities cited, the \nCourt finds that Rule 23(a)(4)โs adequacy requirement has been met.  \n    B.  Rule 23(b) \n  Having determined that the Jane Does meet Rule 23(a)โs requirements, the Court turns to \nexamine the requirements of Rule 23(b).  PPH and the Jane Does move to certify the class under \nRule 23(b)(2), or, in the alternative, under Rule 23(b)(1)(B).  Rule 23(b)(2)  applies if the \ndefendant has โacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as  a \nwhole.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The Jane Does argue that the United States Supreme Court \nand the Eighth Circuit have recognized that class actions under Rule 23(b)(2) are particularly \nappropriate in the context of civil-rights litigation.  See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 614; see also Coley \nv. Clinton, 635 F.2d 1364, 1378 (8th Cir. 1980) (reversing denial of certification under 23(b)(2) \nof a class of inmates confined at the state hospital claiming violation of their constitutional \nrights); U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co., 585 F.2d at 875 (affirming certification under 23(b)(2) of a \nclass of female employees claiming sex discrimination).  Indeed, โ[b]ecause one purpose of Rule \n23(b)(2) was to enable plaintiffs to bring lawsuits vindicating civil rights, the rule must be read \n14 \n \n\nliberally in the context of civil rights suits.โ  Coley, 635 F.2d at 1378 (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted). \nPPH and the Jane Does also claim that certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate \nhere because the primary relief sought is declaratory or injunctive.  See Avritt v. Reliastar Life \nIns. Co., 615 F.3d 1023, 1035 (8th Cir. 2010); In re St. Jude Med., Inc., 425 F.3d 1116, 1121 (8th \nCir. 2005).  If the Rule 23(a) prerequisites have been met and injunctive or declaratory relief has \nbeen  requested,  the  action  usually  should  be  allowed  to  proceed  under  subdivision  (b)(2).  \nDeBoer, 64 F.3d at 1175.  In addition, class claims must be cohesive:  โInjuries remedied \nthrough (b)(2) actions are really group, as opposed to individual injuries.โ  In re St. Jude, 425 \nF.3d at 1122 (citation omitted); see also Paxton, 688 F.2d at 563 (district court erred in denying \ncertification  under  23(b)(2)  in  โcase  seeking  injunctive  relief  against  class-wide  race \ndiscrimination in the bankโs promotion practices.โ); Coley, 635 F.2d at 1378 (district court erred \nin  denying  certification  under  23(b)(2)  where  inmate  class  members  presented  common \nquestions of allegedly unlawful commitment procedures and conditions); U. S. Fid. and Guar. \nCo., 585 F.2d at 875 (certification of class claiming sex discrimination proper under 23(b)(2) \nwhere dispute turned on โacts of an employer on. . . grounds generally applicable to the classโ) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n  PPH and the Jane Does state that, because their claims โturn[] on a single question that \nuniformly applie[s] to all class members . . . ,โ and โ[r]esolution of that question as to one of the \nplaintiffs  necessarily  resolve[s]  the  issue  for  the  entire  class,โ  Avritt,  615  F.3d  at  1036 \n(discussing DeBoer, 64 F.3d 1171), and because class certification is sought to vindicate the \nrights of PPHโs patients under the Medicaid Act through injunctive and declaratory relief, class \ncertification should be granted pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  PPH and the Jane Does argue that \n15 \n \n\nADHSโs decision to terminate PPH from participation in the Medicaid program affects all class \nmembers identically, in that, absent relief from this Court, they will no longer be able to obtain \nfamily planning and other preventative healthcare services from their Medicaid provider of \nchoice.  PPH and the Jane Does further argument that the relief sought โ a declaratory judgment \npreventing PPHโs termination from the Medicaid program and an injunction allowing it to \ncontinue providing services to its existing and future Medicaid patients โ is identical as to all \nclass members. \n  ADHS argues that, because of the scope of the proposed class, the Jane Does also cannot \nmeet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) (Dkt. No. 71, at 17, n.18).  ADHS claims that injunctive \nrelief is โnot appropriate to the whole class because the proposed class would include people \nwho โ under anybodyโs conception of the correct legal test โ either definitely do not, or may not, \nhave irreparable harm.โ (Id.).  ADHS claims that the proposed class is too broad, imprecise, and \nsubjective to meet Rule 23(b)(2)โs requirements.   \nThe Court finds that ADHS acted on grounds that generally apply to the class when it \nterminated PPH from the Medicaid program, affecting all class members, and that injunctive \nrelief is appropriate as to the class as a whole if relief is to be granted.  Finding that the \nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are met, the Court does not reach plaintiffsโ arguments as to Rule \n23(b)(1)(B). \n    C.   Scope of the Class \n  ADHS argues that, if the Court decides to certify a class, it should certify a โmore \nprecise, ascertainable, and efficient classโ (Dkt. No. 71, at 19).  ADHS requests that the Court \nlimit the class to existing patients of PPHโs Little Rock facility because it claims those are \nobjectively the patients whose claims, including irreparable harm, are similar enough to the \n16 \n \n\nnamed Jane Doesโ claims for class certification.   โThe class definition must be drafted in such \na  way  to  ensure  that  membership  is  ascertainable  by  some  objective  standard.โ    Walls  v. \nSagamore Ins. Co., 274 F.R.D. 243, 250 (W.D. Ark. 2011) (citing In re Teflon Products Liab. \nLitig., 254 F.R.D. 354, 360 (S.D. Iowa 2008)).  In ascertaining the class, the court โshould not be \nrequired to resort to speculation, or engage in lengthy, individualized inquiries.โ  Brown v. \nKerkhoff, 279 F.R.D. 479, 496 (S.D. Iowa 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(B) states that โan order that certifies a class action must \ndefine the class and the class claims, issues, or defenses . . . .โ  Courts should make sure the class \ndefinition is clear and that the membership of the class is ascertainable.  See Riedel v. XTO \nEnergy, Inc., 257 F.R.D. 494, 506 (E.D. Ark. 2009); see also Brown, 279 F.R.D. at 496 (same).  \n  ADHS argues that the proposed class definition is overbroad, imprecise, and subjective \n(Dkt. No. 71, at 18).  ADHS claims that it is unclear what the difference is between patients \nโwho seek to obtain . . . covered health services at PPHโ and patients who โdesire to obtain . . . \ncovered health services at PPH.โ  It also claims that, โto the extent that the proposed class \nincludes people who have never set foot in a PPH facility or can afford to pay for PPH services \neven  without  the  Medicaid  program,  it  would  cause  significant  typicality  and  efficiency \nconcerns.โ (Dkt. No. 71, at 18).  PPH and the Jane Does contend that the argument that some \nclass members will be able to pay for care out of pocket is misplaced because, by definition, \nMedicaid recipients are needy individuals and families who cannot afford medical care on their \nown and have therefore been determined by the state to be financially eligible for the program. \nSee Ark. Admin. Code R. 016.20.1-A-100; R. 016.20.1-E-100.   \n  In response, PPH and the Jane Does contend that the proposed class is sufficiently precise \nand ascertainable, and they contend that there exists an administratively feasible method for \n17 \n \n\nascertaining the class (Dkt. No. 72, at 9).  They claim that the proposed class definition is based \non objective, straightforward criteria:  whether a Medicaid patient seeks or desires to seek \nservices from PPH.  PPH and the Jane Does state that the distinction between patients who โseek \nto obtainโ and โdesire to obtainโ covered services from PPH is necessary at this time because the \ninjunction currently in place does not enjoin ADHS from suspending Medicaid payments to PPH \nfor services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries other than the Jane Does.  Thus, there may be \nclass members who desire to obtain Medicaid services from PPH but will not seek to obtain them \nat this time.  PPH and the Jane Does add that, should the class be certified and the preliminary \ninjunction extended, these two categories would merge to cover all current and future Medicaid \npatients of PPH.  PPH and the Jane Does further note that both ADHS and PPH keep records of \nthe patients who  receive Medicaid-eligible services at PPH and that, therefore, there is an \nadministratively simple way to determine who the class members are both currently and as new \npatients seek Medicaid services at PPH.   \n  Ascertainability  does  not  require  that  a  plaintiff  must  be  able  to  identify  all  class \nmembers at the time of class certification; rather, a plaintiff need only show that class members \ncan be identified.  See Riedel, 257 F.R.D. at 506 (quoting Manual for Complex Litigation ยง \n21.222 (4th ed. 2004)).  PPH and the Jane Does argue that fluidity of a class weighs in favor of \nclass certification.  See Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1926, 1940 (2011) (affirming class-wide \ninjunctive  relief  for  classes  of  โseriously  mentally  ill  persons  in  California  prisonsโ  and \nCalifornia โstate prisoners with serious medical conditionsโ and observing that โ[r]elief targeted \nonly at present members of the plaintiff classes may . . . fail to adequately protect future class \nmembers who will develop serious physical or mental illnessโ; injunctive relief should extend to \nโ[p]risoners who are not sick or mentally ill [and thus who] do not yet have a claim that they \n18 \n \n\nhave been subjected to care that violates the Eighth Amendment . . . [because] [t]hey are that \nsystemโs next potential victimsโ). \n  The Court finds that the class definition is drafted in a way such that class members are \nascertainable by objective criteria and declines to narrow the scope of the class. \n    D.  Certification As To All Claims \n  ADHS argues that, in PPH and the Jane Doesโ motion for class certification, they only \nsuggest that the 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) claim meets Rule 23(a)โs commonality and typicality \nrequirements.  ADHS also states that inPPH and the Jane Doesโ discussion of the reasons that \ncertification is proper under Rule 23(b)(2) or 23(b)(1)(b), they only discuss the Medicaid Act \nclaim.  In response to ADHSโs claims that the Rule 23 requirements have not been met for PPH \nand  the  Jane  Doesโ  two  constitutional  claims  in  this  case,  plaintiffs  argue  that  the  class \ncertification analysis is the same for the statutory Medicaid Act claims and the constitutional \nclaims, in that, under either legal theory, the Jane Does and other members of the proposed class \nare identically situatedโโthey are individuals who desire to receive family planning and other \npreventive health services from PPH through the Medicaid program, and whose ability to do so \nis jeopardized by DHSโs termination of PPH from the Medicaid programโ (Dkt. No. 72, at 11). \nThe Court declines to limit class certification to the 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) claim because the \ninjunctive relief that PPH and the Jane Does seek applies to all claims.  \n    E.  Evidentiary Hearing On Class Certification \n  ADHS requested an evidentiary hearing on the matters of class certification, and the \nCourt denied that request.  At the hearing conducted on this motion, ADHS orally renewed its \nrequest for precertification discovery or an evidentiary hearing on class certification.  The Court \nagain denies these requests. \n19 \n \n\nADHS claims that precertification discovery or an evidentiary hearing will provide the \nCourt the best opportunity to determine whether or not the moving party has satisfied the \nrequirements of Rule 23 and, thus, will best protect absent potential class members.  In support \nof its argument, ADHS cites International Woodworkers of America AFL-CIO, CLC v. Georgia-\nPacific Corp., 568 F.2d 64 (8th Cir. 1977), and claims that the Eighth Circuit reversed the \ndistrict court where the district court denied class certification and dismissed outright a putative \nclass action complaint, acting without holding a hearing or taking evidence on the Rule 23 \nfactors.  PPH and the Jane Does argue that the current record contains enough evidence to show \nthat the Jane Doe plaintiffs have met the standard for class certification.   \nThe case on which ADHS relies quotes another Eighth Circuit case, Walker v. World Tire \nCorporation, 563 F.2d 918 (8th Cir. 1977), for the proposition that โ[t]he District Court must \nhave before it โsufficient material . . . to determine the nature of the allegations, and rule on \ncompliance with the Ruleโs requirements . . . .โ  Securing this material does not always require a \nformal evidentiary hearing. . . .  Where, however, the pleadings themselves do not conclusively \nshow whether the Rule 23 requirements are met, the parties must be afforded the opportunity to \ndiscover and present documentary evidence on the issue.โ  Id. at 921.  This Court concludes that \nthe record before the Court is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the Rule 23 requirements \nexamined by this Court have been met.  The Court sees no reason to reconsider its prior rulings \non these issues.     \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, plaintiffsโ motion for class certification pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23 is granted.  Counsel for PPH and the Jane Does, Jennifer Sandman \n20 \n \n\nand Bettina Brownstein, are appointed as class counsel for this action.  The Court directs the \nparties to confer to submit a proposed class notice within 10 days of the date of this Order.   \n  SO ORDERED this 25th day of January, 2016. \n                                                                                               \n \n_______________________________ \n                                  Kristine G.

      "text": "Case 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 1 of 32\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS \nWESTERN DIVISION \n \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD ARKANSAS \n& EASTERN OKLAHOMA,  \nJANE DOE #1, JANE DOE #2, \nAND JANE DOE #3, and all others \nsimilarly situated  PLAINTIFFS \n \nv.          Case No. 4:15-cv-566-KGB \n \nCINDY GILLESPIE, DIRECTOR, \nARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF \nHUMAN SERVICES, IN HER OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY  DEFENDANT \n \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDER \n \nPlaintiffs Planned Parenthood Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma d/b/a Planned Parenthood \nGreat Plains (โPPAEOโ), Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, on their behalf and all others \nsimilarly situated, filed a motion for preliminary injunction on the constitutional claims on January \n19, 2018 (Dkt. No. 144).  Plaintiffs move to enjoin defendant Cindy Gillespie, Director of Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services (โADHSโ), her employees, agents, and successors in office from \nterminating the Medicaid provider agreements of PPAEO (Id., at 1).  Defendant responded in \nopposition to the motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 175).  Plaintiffs filed a reply (Dkt. \nNo. 178).  For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden \nof proof for a preliminary injunction on their constitutional claims.    \nI.  Procedural Background \nPPAEO and the Jane Does first  filed a motion  for temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction on September 11, 2015, contending that plaintiffs were likely to succeed \non their claim that termination of PPAEOโs Medicaid provider agreements violated the right of the \nJane Does and all of PPAEOโs Medicaid patients to obtain family planning and other preventative \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 2 of 32\nhealth care services from the qualified provider of their choosing under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23) \n(Dkt. No. 3).  PPAEO and the Jane Does alleged that, starting on September 21, 2015, absent an \ninjunction, patients insured through the Medicaid program who choose to get family planning and \nother health care services at PPAEO would lose access to services, would lose their provider of \nchoice, would find their family planning services interrupted, and would be left with few or no \nadequate alternative providers (Dkt. No. 12, ยถยถ 8, 34).  PPAEO and the Jane Does also contended \nthat, โ[i]f [PPAEO] is forced to stop providing care through the Medicaid program, a dire situation \nwill become critical.  The remaining providers will be simply unable to absorb [PPAEO]โs patients, \nleaving those patients without access to crucial medical services.โ (Id., ยถ 43).  On September 18, \n2015, this Court granted PPAEO and the Jane Doesโ motion for temporary restraining order (Dkt. \nNo. 21).   \nOn October 2, 2015, the Court then granted a preliminary injunction more limited in \nscopeโlimiting the relief granted to just the Jane Doe plaintiffs (Dkt. Nos. 44, 45).  The Court \nsubsequently granted PPAEO and the Jane Does leave to file a second amended complaint (Dkt. \nNo. 63).  In their second amended complaint, PPAEO and the Jane Does added class allegations \n(Dkt. No. 64, ยถยถ 50-55).  At the same time, PPAEO and the Jane Does moved this Court to certify \na class of patients who seek to obtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at \nPPAEO through the Medicaid program (Dkt. No. 50). \nOn October 6, 2015, ADHS filed a motion for extension of time to respond to plaintiffsโ \nclass certification motion and a motion for leave to notice four depositions (Dkt. Nos. 55, 56).  The \nCourt conducted a status hearing on the motions.  ADHS requested leave to depose Jane Doe #1, \nJane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 and to conduct a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) deposition \nof a PPAEO representative before responding to the then-pending motion for class certification.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 3 of 32\nADHS claimed that it sought these depositions to test, at least, the typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for class certification (Dkt. No. 55, at 4).  For reasons set out in its Order, the Court \ndenied the motion for leave to notice four depositions and for expedited discovery (Dkt. No. 66). \nOn January 25, 2016, the Court granted the motion to certify a class (referred to in this \nOrder as the โPatient Classโ) (Dkt. No. 86).  The certified class consists of patients who seek to \nobtain, or desire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at PPAEO through the Medicaid \nprogram.  ADHS sought interlocutory review of this Courtโs class certification Order and denial \nof the motion for expedited pre-certification discovery decision.  See Planned Parenthood Ark. & \nE. Okla., d/b/a Planned Parenthood of the Heartland v. Selig, Case No. 16-8003 (8th Cir. Feb. 5, \n2016).  The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals denied ADHSโs request for interlocutory review (Dkt. \nNos. 96, 97).  \nPPAEO and the Jane Does then moved for a preliminary injunction extending to the newly-\ncertified Patient Class the same relief already granted the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 98).  ADHS \nsubsequently filed a motion seeking expedited discovery before the Court ruled on the motion for \npreliminary injunction seeking to extend to the newly-certified class the same relief previously \ngranted to the Jane Does (Dkt. No. 113).  PPAEO and the Jane Does responded in opposition to \nthe motion for expedited discovery (Dkt. No. 115), and ADHS replied (Dkt. No. 116).  The Court \nthen conducted a status conference to discuss the motion for expedited discovery on August 19, \n2016, before denying the motion (Dkt. No. 119). \nADHS  then  filed  a  sur-reply  (Dkt.  No.  120)  and  subsequently  informally  requested \npermission from the Court to file a supplemental response to its response in opposition to the \nmotion to expand the preliminary injunction to the Patient Class.  The Court granted this request, \nand ADHS filed a supplemental response (Dkt. No. 121).  PPAEO and the Jane Does then filed \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 4 of 32\nsupplemental memorandums in support of their motion (Dkt. Nos. 122, 124), to which the Court \ngave ADHS an opportunity to respond.  ADHS filed a further reply in opposition to plaintiffsโ \npreliminary injunction motion and a response to notice of supplemental authority (Dkt. Nos. 125, \n126). \nOn September 29, 2016, this Court entered a preliminary injunction on behalf of the Patient \nClass granting the motion for preliminary injunction and enjoining ADHS from suspending \nMedicaid payments to PPAEO for services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries who are members \nof the Patient Class (Dkt. No. 127).  ADHS filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Circuit on October \n27, 2016, as to this Courtโs preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 128).  On August 16, 2017, the Eighth \nCircuit issued an opinion vacating this Courtโs preliminary injunction order on the grounds that 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23)(A) does not create an enforceable federal right for individual patients.  Does \nv. Gillespie, 867 F.3d 1034, 1046 (8th Cir. 2017).  The Eighth Circuitโs mandate was entered on \nNovember 20, 2017, at which point this Court regained jurisdiction of the case.   \nWhile the appeal was pending, PPAEO and the Jane Does sought leave to file a third \namended complaint, which this Court granted (Dkt. No. 134).  PPAEO and the Jane Does filed \ntheir third amended complaint on November 30, 2016 (Dkt. No. 135-1).  In this complaint, PPAEO \nand the Jane Does, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, bring claims against \nADHS pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(23), alleging that ADHSโ actions violate 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396a(a)(23), penalize plaintiffs for their constitutionally protected right to associate with Planned \nParenthood  and/or abortion,  and unfairly target plaintiffs for unfavorable treatment without \nadequate justification in violation of the Equal Protection Clause (Id., ยถยถ 54-59).  On January 19, \n2018, PPAEO and the Jane Does filed a motion for preliminary injunction on their constitutional \nclaims (Dkt. No. 144).  ADHS filed motions to stay the preliminary injunction briefing and for a \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 5 of 32\nscheduling order (Dkt. Nos. 150, 151).  On February 1, 2018, the Court entered an order staying \npreliminary injunction briefing (Dkt. No. 152). \nPPAEO and the Jane Does filed a motion for limited expedited discovery in support of the \nlatest preliminary injunction motion (Dkt. No. 153-3).  ADHS responded, and PPAEO and the \nJane Does replied (Dkt. Nos. 155, 156).  The Court ordered the parties to file additional briefing, \nand the Court also asked the parties to inform the Court of their respective positions on the \nconsolidation of the motion for preliminary injunction with the trial on the merits (Dkt. No. 157).  \nADHS filed another response to PPAEO and the Jane Doesโ request  for limited expedited \ndiscovery arguing that it should be denied and arguing that this Court should consolidate the \npreliminary injunction with the trial on the merits (Dkt. No. 161).  PPAEO and the Jane Does filed \nadditional briefings in which they argued that limited expedited discovery was warranted and that \nthe consolidation of the preliminary injunction and the trial on the merits would compound their \ninjuries (Dkt. Nos. 162, 165).  On March 20, 2018, the Court entered an order denying PPAEO \nand the Jane Doesโ motion for limited expedited discovery, granting ADHSโ motion for an initial \nscheduling order, and lifting the stay on briefing the motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. \n170).  ADHS then filed a response to the motion for preliminary injunction, and PPAEO and the \nJane Does replied (Dkt. Nos. 175, 178). \nII.  Findings Of Fact \nThe Court adopts by reference its findings of fact in its prior Orders entered in this matter, \nto the extent those findings do not conflict with factual findings recited here (Dkt. Nos. 45, at 3-\n10; 127, at 6-9).  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c).  The Court also makes the following additional findings \nof fact.  To the extent the findings of fact in this Order contradict the findings of fact made in the \nCourtโs prior Orders, the findings of fact in this Order control.  Further, the Court will address \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 6 of 32\nthese and additional factual matters in the context of its discussion of the legal issues; the Court \nmakes the findings of fact addressed in that context as well.  In making the following findings of \nfact and conclusions of law, the Court has considered the record as a whole.  All findings of fact \ncontained herein that are more appropriately considered conclusions of law are to be so deemed.  \nLikewise, any conclusions of law more appropriately considered a finding of fact shall be so \nclassified.  The Court has considered and weighed all of the evidence presented in the record at \nthis stage; the Court has resolved any disputes consistent with the statements in this Order. \n1.  PPAEO is a Planned Parenthood entity providing health care services in Arkansas \n(Declaration of Aaron Samulcek, Dkt. No. 145-1, ยถ 2 (โSamulcek Decl.โ)).  PPAEO operates \nhealth centers in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Fayetteville, Arkansas (Id., ยถ 4).    \n2.  These centers provide family planning services to men and women, including \ncontraception and contraceptive counseling, screening for breast and cervical cancer, pregnancy \ntesting and counseling, and early medication abortion (Id.).  \n3.  In Fiscal Year (โFYโ) 2017, PPAEO provided over 1,000 health care visits for over \n750 women, men, and teens insured through Medicaid in Little Rock and Fayetteville (Id., ยถ 5).  \nIn FY 2016, PPAEO provided over 1,000 health care visits for over 650 women, men, and teens \ninsured  through  Medicaid  in  Little  Rock  and  Fayetteville  (Id.).    Throughout  Arkansas, \napproximately 20% of PPAEOโs FY 2017 patients were insured through Medicaid, and those \npatients were responsible for nearly 20% of PPAEOโs total Arkansas health care visits in FY 2017 \n(Id.).   \n4.  According  to  data  compiled  by  the  Guttmacher  Institute,  in  Pulaski  County, \nArkansas, publicly funded health clinics served 7,680 women who obtained contraceptive services \nin 2015 (Dkt. No. 145-1, Samulcek Decl., ยถ 6).  PPAEOโs Little Rock health center served over \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 7 of 32\n40%, or 3,200, of these women (Id.).  According to the same data, in Washington County, \nArkansas, publicly funded health clinics served 4,030 women who obtained contraceptive services, \nand PPAEOโs Fayetteville health center served approximately 35%, or 1,400, of these women \n(Id.).   \n5.  PPAEO does not and has not ever facilitated fetal tissue donation (Dkt. No. 13-2, \nat 3).   \n6.  At its Arkansas health centers, PPAEO offers only early medication abortions, \nwhich is a Federal Drug Administration-approved process in which a patient takes oral medication \nthat causes her to pass the products of conception at a later time, usually away from the health \ncenter; as a result, there is no fetal tissue extracted at PPAEOโs health centers (Id., at 2; Dkt. No. \n145-1, Samulcek Decl., ยถ 8).   \n7.  PPAEO and the Jane Does represent that Arkansas Medicaid does not cover \nmedication abortion in virtually all circumstances, and all parties agree that Medicaid payment for \nabortion is not at issue in this case (Dkt. Nos. 135-1, ยถ 16; 139, ยถ 16).   \n8.  PPAEO also operates a pharmacy that serves Arkansas residents which allows \npatients to have their birth control prescriptions automatically refilled (Dkt. No. 3, Declaration of \nSuzanna de Baca, ยถ 7 (โde Baca Decl.โ)). \n9.  The Patient Class certified in this matter consists of patients who seek to obtain, or \ndesire to obtain, health care services in Arkansas at PPAEO through the Medicaid program (Dkt. \nNo. 86, at 5). \n10.  Plaintiffs Jane Does are patients of PPAEO who received their care through the \nMedicaid program (Id.) (see Dkt. No. 3, Declaration of Jane Doe # 1 in Support of Plaintiffsโ \nMotion for TRO and/or PI, ยถ 1 (โDecl. Jane Doe #1โ); Declaration of Jane Doe # 2 in Support of \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 8 of 32\nPlaintiffsโ Motion for TRO and/or PI, ยถ 1 (โDecl. Jane Doe #2โ); Declaration of Jane Doe # 3 in \nSupport of Plaintiffsโ Motion for TRO and/or PI, ยถ 1 (โDecl. Jane Doe #3โ)).   \n11.  All three of the Jane Does claim that, for a variety of the following reasons, they \nchoose PPAEO because it is convenient, they are able to obtain appointments quickly, they obtain \ntest results quickly and reliably, they like the atmosphere and staff, they like that they receive the \ninformation they need, and they like the services they can receive as a walk-in patient, especially \ngiven their time commitments to children, inflexible work schedules, and other responsibilities \nthat make it difficult to schedule appointments at a set time (Dkt. No. 3, at 1-20).  \n12.  Before choosing PPAEO, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 tried to obtain healthcare \nin other ways.  With a private provider, Jane Doe #1 found the wait times long for an appointment \nand recalls being referred to the emergency room or offered an appointment in three to four weeks \nwhen she called concerned about symptoms (Dkt. No. 3, Decl. Jane Doe #1, ยถ 6).  With a county \nhealth clinic, Jane Doe #1 recalls wait times of three or four weeks and bad experiences with \nunpleasant and unhelpful staff members (Id.).  Jane Doe #2 recalls long wait times and being \nrequired to wait several weeks from calling to get an appointment.  Although she acknowledges \nother providers take patients on a walk-in basis, the wait times were even longer (Dkt. No. 3, Decl. \nJane Doe #2, ยถ 5). \n13.  ADHSโ own documents reflect that long wait times and delays in scheduling \nappointments are commonplace among county health clinics that offer family planning services \nand other preventative care (Dkt. Nos. 26-5, 26-6).  \n14.  ADHS, through its then-Director John Selig, notified PPAEO on August 14, 2015, \nthat ADHS was terminating its Medicaid provider agreements, effective 30 days from the date of \nthe letter (Dkt. No. 16-1, at 19).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 9 of 32\n15.  Mark White, Deputy Director of ADHS, who supervises the Division of Medical \nServices  which  administers  Arkansasโ  Medicaid  Program,  states  that  โat  Governor  Asa \nHutchinsonโs directive, DHS Director John Selig gave written notice that DHS would terminate \nthe three (3) [PPAEO] provider agreements in 30 days, exercising its rights to do so under the \nโvoluntaryโ termination provision (Section III.A) of said agreements.โ (Affidavit of Mark White, \nDkt. No. 16-1, ยถ 5 (โWhite Aff.โ)).  \n16.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson issued a press release on August 14, 2015, the \nday the termination letter was sent to PPAEO.1  In this press release, Governor Hutchinson states \nthat he directed ADHS to terminate the agreements because โ[i]t is apparent that after the recent \nrevelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood, that this organization does not represent the \nvalues of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served by terminating any and all existing \ncontracts with them.โ (Dkt. No. 12, ยถ 35).  \n17.  The  August  14,  2015,  letter  provided  directions  on  how  PPAEO  could \nadministratively appeal the termination (Dkt. No. 16-1, White Aff., ยถ 6).  \n18.  Mr. White states, โ[a]fter the letter was issued, the Governor directed DHS to \nreview the videos released by the Center for Medical Progress.โ  (Id.).  The Court hereafter refers \nto these videos as the โCMP videos.โ \n19.  Mr. White states that he reviewed the first seven (7) of the eight (8) videos that \nwere available at that time on behalf of ADHS and made several observations (Id., ยถ 10). \n                                                 \n1  See Press Release, Ark. Governor Asa Hutchinson, Governor Asa Hutchinson Directs \nDHS  to  End  Contract  with  Planned  Parenthood  (Aug.  14,  2015), \nhttps://governor.arkansas.gov/press-releases/detail/governor-asa-hutchinson-directs-dhs-to-end-\ncontract-with-planned-parenthood.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 10 of 32\n20.  Mr. White states that โ[t]he videos appear to demonstrate that Planned Parenthood \nand/or its affiliates have violated American Medical Association Guidelines, as well as the federal \nban on partial birth abortions (18 U.S.C. ยง 1531), the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 \n(1 U.S.C. ยง 8), the federal ban on transferring human fetal tissue for valuable consideration (42 \nU.S.C. ยง 289g-2), and other federal and state laws.โ (Id., ยถ 13). \n21.  The transfer of fetal tissue is against Arkansas law. See Ark. Code Ann. ยง 20-17-\n802. \n22.  Based on record evidence at this stage of the litigation, the CMP videos do not \ndepict any representatives of PPAEO. \n23.  Based on record evidence at this stage of the litigation, the CMP videos include no \nstatements from representatives of PPAEO. \n24.  Based on record evidence at this stage of the litigation, the CMP videos do not \ndiscuss any conduct by any PPAEO medical provider. \n25.  Mr.  White  states  that,  on  September  1,  2015,  he  issued  a  second  notice  of \ntermination to PPAEO โacting under the โfor causeโ termination provision (Section III.C) of the \nthree (3) provider agreements.โ (Dkt. No. 16-1, White Aff., ยถ 16). \n26.  Mr. White makes clear that, although he believes his authority would permit him to \nterminate immediately PPAEO as a provider under the for cause termination provision, ADHS \nโdelayed the effective date to coincide with that of the first letter.โ (Id.). \n27.  This second letter states that it โis based in part upon the troubling circumstances \nand  activities  that  have  recently  come  to  light  regarding  the  national  Planned  Parenthood \norganization, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, and other affiliated Planned Parenthood \nentities, all of which are affiliated with [PPAEO],โ and that โthere is evidence that [PPAEO] and/or \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 11 of 32\nits affiliates are acting in an unethical manner and engaging in what appears to be wrongful \nconduct.โ (Dkt. Nos. 12, ยถ 37; 16-1 at 21-26).  \n28.  The letter states that PPAEO is โwelcome to submit information or offer comments \non  the  nationally  recognized  videos  that  have  raised  questions  on  the  conduct  of  Planned \nParenthood.โ (Dkt. Nos. 12, ยถ 37; 16-1 at 21-26).  \n29.  ADHS, through Mr. White, claims that it terminated PPAEOโs provider agreements \nโbased on what is in the public domainโ and โdetermined that termination is in the public interest.โ \n(Dkt. No. 16-1, White Aff., ยถ 18).  \n30.  Sources in the public domain report that completed governmental investigations in \nresponse to the videos in Georgia, South Dakota, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts have \nfound that Planned Parenthood committed no wrongdoing with regard to the CMP videos (Dkt. \nNo. 4, at 6 n. 7 (citing and collecting media sources)).  \n31.  The  second  termination  letter  included  instructions  on  how  to  appeal  the \ntermination (Dkt. No. 16-1, White Aff., ยถ 19).  \n32.  PPAEO and the Jane Does sued ADHSโ director, Mr. Selig, in his official capacity, \nonly seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (Dkt. No. 12, at 15).  As a result, PPAEO and the \nJane Does now sue Cindy Gillespie, Director, Arkansas Department of Human Services, in her \nofficial capacity.2 \n33.  This Court entered a preliminary injunction that prevented ADHS from terminating \nPPAEO from the Medicaid program.  That preliminary injunction has been vacated by the Eighth \nCircuit.   \n                                                 \n2  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Ms. Gillespie, as the successor in \noffice to Mr. Selig, is automatically substituted as a party on these types of claims.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 12 of 32\n34.  On  December  13,  2017,  in  response  to  inquiries  by  plaintiffsโ  counsel  to \ndefendantโs counsel, defendantโs counsel explained that ADHS may not reimburse PPAEO for \nMedicaid claims made during the pendency of this case if PPAEO prevails on its constitutional \nclaims (Dkt. No. 145-1, at 12-13).   \n35.  On January 5, 2018, counsel for defendant informed plaintiffsโ counsel that โit \nwould be improper to reimburse where the referring or proscribing physician has been terminated \nfrom the Medicaid program.โ (Id., at 19).   \n36.  Promptly after PPAEO was informed of ADHSโ position regarding reimbursement, \nPPAEO stopped providing services to patients insured through the Medicaid program on an unpaid \nbasis (Dkt. No. 145-1, Samulcek Decl., ยถ 15). \n37.  PPAEO opted not to provide these services to patients, as PPAEO was aware that \nthere was a risk that its patients would be unable to fill prescriptions or obtain needed follow-up \ncare that would be covered by the Medicaid program (Id.).  \n38.  Since  January  2018,  PPAEO  has  reached  out  to  its  patients  insured  through \nMedicaid who had appointments scheduled with PPAEO; PPAEO has informed these patients that \nPPAEO can no longer provide services to them and has referred these patients to other Medicaid \nproviders (Id., ยถ 18).   \n39.  The patients with whom PPAEO has spoken have been upset and dismayed, and \nmany of them have expressed concerns about their ability to be seen elsewhere in a timely way \n(Id.).   \n40.  Since January 2018, Holly Ajanel, the Center Manager of the Little Rock health \ncenter at PPAEO, made a series of phone calls to determine the best location to refer PPAEOโs \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 13 of 32\npatients who are insured through Medicaid (Dkt. No. 145-2, Declaration of Holly Ajanel, ยถยถ 1-2 \n(โAjanel Decl.โ)).   \n41.  Since  January  2018,  Rosa  Adams,  the  Front  Office  Assistant  at  PPAEOโs \nFayetteville health center, made several phone calls to determine the best location to refer \nPPAEOโs Medicaid patients (Dkt. No. 145-3, Declaration of Rosa Adams, ยถยถ 1-2 (โAdams \nDecl.โ)).   \n42.  As a result of these phone calls, Ms. Ajanel and Ms. Adams aver that the choice of \nproviders for PPAEOโs current Medicaid patients is limited because some providers are not \naccepting new Medicaid patients in certain categories; other providers require a referral before \nseeing a new Medicaid patient; even with a referral, a new Medicaid patient may have to wait \nweeks before being seen; and for certain family planning services, more than one appointment may \nbe required for the Medicaid patient to receive the service or care he or she seeks (see generally \nDkt. Nos. 145-2, Ajanel Decl.; 145-3, Adams Decl.). \nIII.  Conclusions Of Law \n  In the light of the change of circumstances since the original complaint and amended \ncomplaints were filed, the Court will consider plaintiffsโ motion for preliminary injunction on their \nconstitutional claims (Dkt. No. 144).  The Court is authorized to take into account โsubsequent \nchanges in the facts or the lawโ when determining whether to modify an injunction or decree.  \nMovie Sys., Inc. v. MAD Minneapolis Audio Distr., a Div. of Smoliak & Sons, Inc., 717 F.2d 427, \n430 (8th Cir. 1983); see McDonald v. Armontrout, 908 F.2d 388, 390 (8th Cir. 1990) (deferring to \ndistrict courtโs decision to modify a consent decree because facts had changed).  For example, in \n2018, ADHS announced that it may not reimburse PPAEO for Medicaid claims made during the \npendency of this case, even if PPAEO prevails on its constitutional claims (Dkt. No. 145-1, at 12-\n13 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 14 of 32\n13).  While it is true that this case has been pending for over two years, the Court finds that this \nfactual change, among others, warrants consideration of plaintiffsโ present motion. \nWhether  a  preliminary  injunction  should  issue  involves  consideration  of:    (1)  the \nprobability that the movant will succeed on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable harm; (3) the \nbalance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other interested \nparties, and (4) the public interest.  Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th \nCir. 1981).  Dataphase unified two tests to determine a moving partyโs substantial probability of \nsuccess at trial by rejecting the notion the party seeking relief must show โa greater than fifty per \ncent likelihood that he will prevail on the merits,โ and holding that โwhere the balance of other \nfactors tips decidedly toward plaintiff a preliminary injunction may issue if movant has raised \nquestions so serious and difficult as to call for more deliberate investigation.โ  Id. at 114.  A moving \nparty is required to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits to meet the threshold.  \nKai v. Ross, 336 F.3d 650, 656 (8th Cir. 2003).   \nDefendant contends that the Court should apply the more rigorous standard required when \na preliminary injunction is sought to enjoin the implementation of a duly enacted state statute or \nregulation developed through presumptively reasoned democratic processes.  Planned Parenthood \nMinn., N.D., S.D v. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 732-33 (8th Cir. 2008).  Under these circumstances, the \ndistrict court is required to apply a โlikely to prevail on the meritsโ or likelihood of success on the \nmerits standard.  Id. at 732.  Otherwise, the district court should โapply the โfair chance of \nprevailingโ  test  where  a  preliminary  injunction  is  sought  to  enjoin  something  other  than \ngovernment action based on presumptively reasoned democratic processes.โ  Id. \nIt is not all together clear to this Court whether the more rigorous standard from Rounds \napplies to the type of governmental action involved here.  The parties, however, both apply the \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 15 of 32\nmore deferential โlikely to prevail on the meritsโ standard in their briefings (Dkt. Nos. 145, at 17 \n(โPlaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claimsโ); 175 (applying โlikely to prevail \non the meritsโ standard); 178, at 2 (โPPAEO is likely to succeed on its unconstitutional conditions \nclaim . . . .โ)).  Accordingly, the Court will also apply the more deferential โlikely to prevail on \nthe meritsโ standard to plaintiffsโ request for a preliminary injunction.   \nA.  Likely To Prevail On The Merits \nThe Court will first examine whether plaintiffs have established that they are likely to \nprevail on the merits of their unconstitutional conditions claim.  The Court views plaintiffs as \nmaking two arguments in support of this claimโone based on the Fourteenth Amendment and the \nother based on the First Amendment.  As discussed below, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have \nnot met their burden of proof to show that they are likely to prevail on the merits of their \nunconstitutional conditions claim.  The Court also concludes that plaintiffs have not met their \nburden of proof to show that they are likely to prevail on the merits of their Fourteenth Amendment \nequal protection claims.   \n1.  Unconstitutional  Conditions  Claim  Based  Upon  Fourteenth \nAmendment Right \n \nPlaintiffs assert an unconstitutional conditions claim in their third amended complaint (Dkt. \nNo. 135-1, ยถยถ 56-57).3  The Court will first analyze PPAEOโs claim that ADHSโ termination of \nPPAEO from the Arkansas Medicaid program was intended to penalize PPAEO for advocating for \n                                                 \n3  Plaintiffs in their complaint appear to bring an unconstitutional conditions claim on \nbehalf of all โplaintiffs,โ meaning PPAEO and the Jane Doe plaintiffs (Dkt. No. 135-1, ยถยถ 56-57).  \nHowever, as defendant points out, plaintiffs appear to contend that they have not asserted such a \nclaim on behalf of the Jane Doe plaintiffs (Dkt. No. 164, at 9).  For purposes of resolving the \npending motion for preliminary injunction, the Court will confine its analysis as the parties did in \ntheir briefing to PPAEOโs unconstitutional conditions claim and PPAEOโs and the Jane Doesโ \nequal protection claims.    \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 16 of 32\nreproductive freedom and/or association with abortion (Dkt. Nos. 135-1, ยถ 57; 145, at 22, 26).  For \nthe reasons discussed below, the Court finds that plaintiffs have not established at this point in the \nlitigation that they are likely to succeed on the merits of this argument so as to warrant the entry \nof a preliminary injunction.    \nIt is settled law that the federal government and the governments of the States may prohibit \nthe use of public funds to provide or support abortions.  See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, \n314-17 (1980); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 473-74 (1977).  On the other hand, the Supreme Court \nhas made clear โeven though a person has no โrightโ to a valuable governmental benefit and even \nthough the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some \nreasons upon which the government may not rely.โ  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 \n(1972).  Specifically, the government may not deny governmental benefits in such a way that the \ndenial infringes upon an individualโs constitutionally protected interests.  Id.; see, e.g., Rumsfeld \nv. Forum for Academic and Inst. Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59-60 (2006); Regan v. Taxation With \nRepresentation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 545 (1983); Memโl Hosp. v. Maricopa Cty., 415 U.S. 250 \n(1974).  โ[These] cases reflect an overarching principle, known as the unconstitutional conditions \ndoctrine, that vindicates the Constitutionโs enumerated rights by preventing the government from \ncoercing people into giving them up.โ  Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595, \n604 (2013). \nGenerally, โ[t]he Supreme Court has applied this doctrine in two distinct contexts.โ  \nPlanned Parenthood Assoc. of Utah v. Herbert, 828 F.3d 1245, 1258 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal \nquotations omitted).  The doctrine has been applied โwhen the condition acts prospectively in \nstatutes or regulations that limit a government-provided benefitโtypically a subsidy or tax \nbreakโto those who refrain from or engage in certain expression or association.โ  Id. (internal \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 17 of 32\nquotations omitted) (emphasis added).  โ[T]he unconstitutional-conditions doctrine [also] has been \napplied when the condition acts retrospectively in a discretionary executive action that terminates \na  government-provided  benefitโtypically  public  employment,  a  government  contract,  or \neligibility for eitherโin retaliation for prior protected speech or association.โ   Id. (internal \nquotations omitted) (emphasis added in part); see Bd. of Cty. Commโrs, Wabaunsee Cty., Kan. v. \nUmbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 671 (1996) (examining the doctrine where an independent contractor was \nterminated by a governmental body in response to his outspoken criticism); Perry, 408 U.S. at 597 \n(examining the doctrine where the board of regents failed to renew a professorโs contract with state \nuniversity in retaliation for his criticism). \nFor example, in Rust v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court upheld a restriction on the use of Title \nX funds for abortion because that restriction governed only โthe scope of the Title X projectโs \nactivities,โ but did not restrict an abortion providerโs ability โto pursue abortion-related activities \nwhen they are not acting under the auspices of the Title X project.โ  500 U.S. 173, 196, 198 (1991).  \nIn Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International (โAOSIโ), \nhowever, the Supreme Court struck down a federal grant program that conditioned receipt of grant \nmoney on an organizationโs pledge to oppose prostitution and sex trafficking.  570 U.S. 205, 221 \n(2013).  The Supreme Court held that, because โ[t]he Policy Requirement compels as a condition \nof federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope \nof the Government program, . . . it violates the First Amendment and cannot be sustained.โ  Id.  \nThere  is  a  distinction  โbetween  conditions  that  define  the  limits  of  government  spending \nprogramsโthose that specify the activities Congress wants to subsidizeโand conditions that seek \nto leverage funding to regulate [activity] outside the contours of the program itself.โ  Id. at 214-\n15. \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 18 of 32\nThe Eighth Circuit examined the unconstitutional conditions doctrine in relation to a \nMissouri funding statute and what plaintiffs alleged was an attempt to prohibit abortion service \nproviders from receiving certain government funds.  Planned Parenthood of Mid-Mo. and E. Kan., \nInc.  v.  Dempsey,  167  F.3d  458  (8th Cir.  1999).    Other  federal  courts  also  have  examined \ngovernmentally-imposed  conditions  to  determine  whether  those  conditions  impermissibly \nattempted to leverage funding to regulate speech and association related to abortion outside the \ncontours of a governmental program.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Sw. and Cent. Fla. v. \nPhilip, 194 F. Supp. 3d 1213 (N.D. Fla. 2016); Planned Parenthood of Cent. N.C. v. Cansler, 877 \nF. Supp. 2d 310 (M.D. N.C. 2012).   \nNot all litigants, and not all courts, agree on how these claims should be examined in the \nabortion context.  Some advocate that the unconstitutional conditions doctrine does not apply in \nthe abortion context.  Instead, they advocate that, in the abortion context, the only constitutional \nlimit is the Casey requirement that the state not impose an undue burden on womenโs right to \nabortion.  See Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).  This dispute was \nmost recently addressed in a now vacated Sixth Circuit Court of Appealsโ panel decision in \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Ohio v. Hodges, 201 F. Supp. 3d 898 (S.D. Ohio 2016), affโd 888 \nF.3d 224 (6th Cir. 2018), granting rehโg en banc, vacating opinion 892 F.3d 1283 (6th Cir. 2018).  \nIn Hodges, a federal district court struck down Ohio Revised Code ยง 3701.034, which required the \nOhio Department of Health to ensure that federal funds were not distributed to any entity that \nperforms, promotes, or contracts with entities that perform or promote nontherapeutic abortions, \non the grounds that Section 3701.034 violates the First Amendment.  201 F. Supp. 3d at 900-01, \n908.  The district court found that Section 3701.034, which impacted programs that subsidized \nSTD  screenings,  cancer  screenings,  HIV  testing  and  education,  measures  to  reduce  infant \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 19 of 32\nmortality, education for teens regarding abstinence and contraception, and the prevention of sexual \nviolence, unconstitutionally conditioned the funding of such programsโnone of which had any \nrelation to abortionโupon a recipientโs exercise of the right to free speech or association outside \nof those programs.  Id. at 906 (citing Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 462 (โLegislation that simply dictates \nthe proper scope of government-funded programs is constitutional, while legislation that restricts \nprotected grantee activities outside government programs is unconstitutional . . . .โ)). \nHere, to the extent PPAEO argues a Fourteenth Amendment right, the constitutional right \nat issueโa womanโs right to a previability abortionโbelongs to the Patient Class.  See Casey, 505 \nU.S. at 884-85 (majority opinion); Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 464.  The Court acknowledges precedent \nfrom the Eighth Circuit which addressed this type of unconstitutional conditions claim when \nupholding a state statute as construed to not impose an unconstitutional condition on women \nseeking abortion, Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 464-65, and the Seventh Circuit which addressed this type \nof unconstitutional conditions claim when upholding an Indiana law which prohibited abortion \nproviders  from  receiving  any  state  contracts  and  grants,  including  those  involving  state-\nadministered federal funds, Planned Parenthood of Indiana v. Commissioner of Indiana State \nDepโt of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 987-88 (7th Cir. 2012).  Both the Eighth and Seventh Circuits \ndetermined that the โundue burdenโ test from Casey applied to unconstitutional conditions claims \npremised upon the right to a previability abortion and further determined that, because the \nrespective state legislation at issue did not unduly burden a womanโs ability to choose to have a \npreviability abortion, that legislation did not impose an unconstitutional condition.  Dempsey, 167 \nF.3d at 464-65; Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 988. \nBased on the record evidence before the Court at this stage of the litigation, the Court \nconcludes that, assuming without deciding that the Casey undue burden test applies to this type of \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 20 of 32\nclaim, plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their argument \nthat ADHS withdrew funding in retaliation for PPAEOโs advocacy for reproductive freedom \nand/or association with abortion. \nAssuming without deciding that the Casey undue burden test does not apply to plaintiffsโ \nargument that ADHS has unconstitutionally conditioned funding upon PPAEOโs advocating for \nreproductive freedom and/or association with abortion, it is not clear what alternate test applies \nunder the circumstances.  In Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert, the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals appeared to examine an unconstitutional conditions argument premised on a \nFourteenth Amendment right, but the court did not apply Casey to that argument nor did the court \narticulate a specific test applied to that argument different from the Umbehr test the court applied \nto the First Amendment right examined in that case.  828 F.3d at 1259-63 (examining the \nFourteenth Amendment argument).  Plaintiffs argue that the facts and legal arguments presented \nin the Tenth Circuitโs decision in Herbert are substantively identical to the case at bar.4  Other \ncourts examining arguments premised on a Fourteenth Amendment right also have forgone the \napplication of Casey and applied what appears to be a more straightforward unconstitutional \nconditions analysis, but those courts admittedly have examined facts more straightforward than \nthose presented here.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Sw. & Cent. Fla., 194 F. Supp. 3d at 1216-\n20; Planned Parenthood of Cent. N.C., 877 F. Supp. 2d at 314-15, 318-21.    \nConsidering all controlling and persuasive precedents and the record facts before the Court, \nthe Court finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden of proving that they are likely to succeed \n                                                 \n4  The Court examines this test, and the Tenth Circuitโs application of it, in more detail in \nsection III.A.2. of this Order.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 21 of 32\non their unconstitutional conditions claim based on an asserted Fourteenth Amendment right so as \nto warrant the entry of a preliminary injunction.   \n2.  Unconstitutional  Conditions  Claim  Based  Upon  First \nAmendment Right \n \nThe Court will also analyze PPAEOโs claim that ADHSโ actions penalize PPAEO for its \nconstitutionally protected association with its Planned Parenthood affiliates (Dkt. No. 135-1, ยถ 57).  \nPPAEO has long affiliated with Planned Parenthood Federation of America (โPPFAโ) and other \nPlanned  Parenthood  organizations  across  the  country  out  of  a  shared  mission  to  advance \nreproductive health and freedom (Dkt. No. 145, at 22).  PPAEO alleges that the First Amendment, \nwhich encompasses the right โto engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas,โ \nprotects this affiliation (Id., at 23).  Additionally, PPAEO argues its advocacy for reproductive \nfreedom is similarly protected by the First Amendment (Id.).       \nPlaintiffs argue that the facts and legal arguments presented in the Tenth Circuitโs decision \nin Herbert are substantively identical to the case at bar.  Following a release of the same videos at \nissue in this matter, Utah Governor Gary Herbert issued a โDirectiveโ terminating the contractual \nrelationships of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah (โPPAUโ) with the Utah Department of \nHealth.  Herbert, 828 F.3d at 1259.  In analyzing PPAUโs unconstitutional conditions claim based \non its First Amendment right, the Tenth Circuit noted that โ[plaintiff]โs unconstitutional conditions \nclaims appear to us to fit comfortably within the context exemplified by Umbehr,โ and then it \napplied the test from Umbehr.  Id.  In Umbehr, the Supreme Court concluded that โthe First \nAmendment protects independent contractors from the termination of at-will government contracts \nin retaliation for their exercise of the freedom of speech.โ  518 U.S. at 670.   \nApplying  this  test  in  Herbert,  the  Tenth  Circuit  first  examined  Governor  Herbertโs \nDirective.    The  Directive  referred  to  PPAU  as  Planned  Parenthood  and  stated  that  โโ[t]he \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 22 of 32\nallegations against Planned Parenthood are deeply troubling,โ . . . that โ[t]he federal government \nhas provided grants to Planned Parenthood, distributed through the Utah Department of Health,โ \nand ultimately state[d] that [Governor] Herbert โinstructed state agencies to cease acting as an \nintermediary for pass-through federal funds to Planned Parenthood.โโ  828 F.3d at 1261.  In his \npost-Directive statement, Governor Herbert further stated โโit happened in their organizationโ and \nโfor coloring outside the lines, Planned Parenthood forfeits some of their benefits.โโ  Id.   \nThe Tenth Circuit specifically noted that, โ[i]f [this] were all the evidence we had before \nus, we would thus be left to conclude that the most reasonable finding a court or jury could make \nis that the Directive was issued based upon a mistake of fact made by [Governor] Herbert.โ  Id.  \nHowever, the Tenth Circuit determined that PPAU presented additional evidence which, when \ncoupled with the evidence that Governor Herbert failed to distinguish between PPAU and Planned \nParenthood (or affiliates in other states), led the Tenth Circuit to conclude plaintiffs were likely to \nprevail on their unconstitutional conditions claim.   \nSpecifically, the Tenth Circuit relied on record evidence in which Governor Herbert:  (1) \nacknowledged the events depicted in the CMP videos did not happen in Utah; (2) admitted the \nCMP videos involved affiliates of Planned Parenthood, not PPAU; (3) admitted there was no \nevidence,  or  even  accusation,  that  PPAU  engaged  in  misconduct  because  PPAU  does  not \nparticipate in any program that provides fetal tissue for scientific research; (4) admitted that none \nof the federal funds that flow through the state to PPAU are โused to provide abortions;โ (5) \nadmitted that the accusations made by CMP in the videos regarding Planned Parenthood and its \nother affiliates had not been proven and were indeed false; (6) agreed the national โpolitical climate \n. . . [wa]s very hostile to Planned Parenthood;โ (7) steadfastly refused to retract the Directive; and \n(8) participated in a pro-life event held at the Utah State Capitol five days after he issued his \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 23 of 32\ndirective where the purpose of the event was โto ask lawmakers to defund [PPAU]โ and where he \nmade statements to the crowd regarding abortion.  828 F.3d at 1261-62.  Governor Herbert stated \nat that pro-life event:  โIโm here today to add my voice to yours and speak out on the sanctity of \nlife,โ and โ[t]he thing I find most appalling is the casualness, the callousness . . . the lack of respect, \nthe lack of sensitivity to the unborn.โ  Id. at 1262.  The Tenth Circuit found that a reasonable finder \nof fact on that record evidence was more likely than not to determine that Governor Herbert issued \nthe Directive to punish PPAU for exercising its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, thereby \nreversing the decision reached by the district court.  Id. at 1261-62. \nAssuming without deciding that PPAEO has asserted a valid First Amendment right, the \nquestion now is whether PPAEO has succeeded in establishing that it is likely to prevail on the \nissue of whether its Medicaid contracts were terminated for exercising that right.  Based on the \nrecord evidence before the Court at this stage of the litigation, the Court concludes that, assuming \nwithout deciding that the Casey undue burden test applies to this type of claim, plaintiffs have not \nestablished a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their argument that ADHSโ termination of \nPPAEOโs Medicaid contracts in retaliation for PPAEOโs exercising its First Amendment right \ncreates an undue burden. \nEven if the Court applies the test from Umbehr to analyze PPAEOโs unconstitutional \nconditions claim based on its First Amendment right, the Court reaches the same conclusion.  \nUnder Umbehr, to prevail on this claim, PPAEO โmust prove that the conduct at issue was \nconstitutionally protected, and that it was a substantial or motivating factor in the termination.โ  \nUmbehr, 518 U.S. at 675.  The focus necessarily is on alleged retaliation against the protected \nconduct;  alleged  retaliation  against  non-protected  conduct  falls  outside  the  unconstitutional \nconditions doctrine.  Even if PPAEO meets that burden, defendant โcan escape liability by showing \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 24 of 32\nthat [she] would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.โ  Id.; \nsee Lyons v. Vaught, 875 F.3d 1168, 1172 (8th Cir. 2017) (applying test in public employment \ncontext).  Further, defendant can โalso prevail if [she] can persuade [the fact finder] that [her] \nlegitimate interest as contractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh[s] the free speech interests at \nstake.โ  Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685.  \nHere, the Court determines the record evidence at this stage of the litigation falls short of \nthat recited and relied upon by the Tenth Circuit in Herbert.  For this reason, the Court determines \nthat, even if Umbehr applies, plaintiffs have not met their burden to demonstrate that they are likely \nto succeed in showing that PPAEOโs termination was in retaliation for its exercising its First \nAmendment right.  Such evidence might or might not be developed in this litigation as discovery \nproceeds, but it is not a part of the undisputed record presented to this Court at this stage of the \nlitigation. \nWhile reaching this decision, the Court acknowledges the following record evidence.  \nADHS acknowledged the video evidence used to justify PPAEOโs termination was not viewed \nuntil after Governor Hutchisonโs press release and the issuance of the first termination letter (Dkt. \nNo. 16-1, White Aff., ยถ 9).  Mr. Whiteโs affidavit, which recites the offending portions of the CMP \nvideos, does not indicate that any of the Planned Parenthood staff members who were videotaped \nwere affiliated with PPGP or PPAEO (Id., ยถ 10).  Indeed, Governor Hutchinsonโs press release \nreferenced โthe recent revelations on the actions of Planned Parenthoodโ as the basis for PPAEOโs \ntermination.  See Press Release, Ark. Governor Asa Hutchinson (emphasis added).   \nFurther, even if ADHSโ termination of PPAEO was initially a mistake, on September 15, \n2015, PPAEO informed ADHS via letter that it provides only early medication abortions, the fetal \nproducts of which are passed away from PPAEOโs health centers (Dkt. No. 13-2, at 2).  In the \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 25 of 32\nsame letter, PPAEO informed ADHS that neither it nor its parent organization have participated \nin fetal tissue donation or received reimbursement for fetal tissue (Id., at 3).  ADHS has offered no \nother rationale for terminating PPAEO as a Medicaid provider.  ADHSโ continued refusal to \nreinstate PPAEO as a Medicaid provider following this clarificationโif indeed such clarification \nwas even necessaryโtroubles the Court.   \nThe record evidence indicates that ADHS has been aware for nearly three years that \nPPAEO was not, and could not have been, involved in any way with the practices described in the \nCMP videos.  Accordingly, the Court does not discount that ADHSโ continued refusal to reinstate \nPPAEO as a Medicaid provider, along with other record evidence, may tend to support the \ninference that ADHS has used the CMP videos as a pretext to punish PPAEO for its role as a \nmedication abortion provider and/or for its speech and association with abortion.  While this \ninference gives this Court pause, under the circumstances, the Court finds that plaintiffs have not \nmet their burden of showing that they are likely to prevail on the merits of their unconstitutional \nconditions claim at this stage of the litigation so as to warrant the entry of a preliminary injunction. \nTo the extent that ADHS maintains PPAEO should have sought a state administrative \nremedy before filing this lawsuit, so PPAEO could provide evidence that it was not involved in \nthe widespread misconduct demonstrated by the CMP videos, the Court rejects the argument (Dkt. \nNo. 175, at 20-21).  Generally, a plaintiff does not need to exhaust administrative remedies before \nseeking federal court relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, \nInc. v. Atchison, 126 F.3d 1042, 1047 (8th Cir. 1997) (citing Patsy v. Bd. of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982)).  This Court does not understand plaintiffs to be alleging a \nprocedural due process violation.  Cf. Hopkins v. City of Bloomington, 774 F.3d 490 (8th Cir. 2014) \n(examining the exhaustion requirement when a litigant asserts the deprivation of procedural due \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 26 of 32\nprocess under ยง 1983).  Further, based on the record evidence and the briefings, the Court \nunderstands defendant has taken the position that there are no available state administrative \nremedies to address defendantโs recent representations regarding reimbursement, as defendant \nmaintains that any administrative appeal by PPAEO is now barred (Dkt. Nos. 145-1, at 12-13; 175, \nat 26 (arguing that PPAEOโs termination is โfinal and bindingโ because PPAEO โchose not to \nappeal it.โ)).5  See Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, Inc., 126 F.3d at 1046-48 (examining \nabstention and exhaustion as applied to a ยง 1983 action filed in federal court).  Moreover, requiring \nall plaintiffs to go through an administrative appeals process when they allege constitutional \nviolations under ยง 1983 against a state entity undermines the congressional intent to establish \nfederal-court review under ยง 1983.  Patsy, 457 U.S. at 503-505.  Accordingly, the Court finds that \nplaintiffsโ claims are not barred by an exhaustion requirement.   \nConsidering all of this evidence together, when compared to controlling and persuasive \nprecedents, the Court concludes plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate, on the record currently \nbefore the Court, that they are likely to succeed on their unconstitutional conditions claim.  \n3.  Equal Protection Claims \nPlaintiffs assert a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim in their third amended \ncomplaint (Dkt. No. 135-1, ยถยถ 58-59).  Plaintiffs allege ADHSโ termination of PPAEO as a \nMedicaid provider unconstitutionally singles plaintiffs out for unfavorable treatment without \nadequate justification (Id., ยถ 59).  Plaintiffs claim that ADHSโ termination of PPAEO โat the \ndirection of an anti-abortion Governor, based on the misleadingly-edited videos claiming bad \n                                                 \n5    The  Court  notes  that  PPAEO  has  filed  a  state  court  action  challenging  ADHSโ \ntermination of its status as a Medicaid provider.  See Planned Parenthood of Arkansas & Eastern \nOklahoma, Inc. d/b/a Planned Parenthood Great Plains v. Cindy Gillespie, Case No. 72CV-18-\n591 (Wash. Cty. Cir. Ct. March 2, 2018).  No party briefed the issue of abstention. \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 27 of 32\nconduct by other entities in other statesโ without clarification or confirmation that PPAEO \nparticipated in fetal tissue donation stands in โstark contrast to [ADHS]โs treatment of all other, \nnon-Planned Parenthood Medicaid providers.โ (Dkt. No. 178, at 9).  Plaintiffs assert that they are \nlikely to succeed on the equal protection claim as a โclass of one.โ (Dkt. No. 178, at 9).   \nTo move forward as a โclass of one,โ plaintiffs must allege and prove that they โha[ve] \nbeen intentionally treated differently from other[] similarly situated,โ non-Planned Parenthood \nMedicaid providers and โthat there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.โ  Vill. of \nWillowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000).  The Eighth Circuit limits โclass-of-oneโ actions \nfrom  applying  to  โforms  of  state  action  .  .  .  which  by  their  nature  involve  discretionary \ndecisionmaking.โ  Robbins v. Becker, 794 F.3d 988, 995 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Engquist v. Or. \nDepโt of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 602-4 (2008)). \nAt issue in Engquist was โwhether a public employee [could] state a claim under the Equal \nProtection Clause by alleging that she was arbitrarily treated differently from other similarly \nsituated employees, with no assertion that the different treatment was based on the employeeโs \nmembership in any particular class.โ  Engquist, 533 U.S. at 594.  The Supreme Court held โ[the] \ntraditional view of the core concern of the Equal Protection Clause as a shield against arbitrary \nclassifications, combined with the unique considerations applicable when the government acts as \nemployer as opposed to sovereign, lead us to conclude that the class-of-one theory of equal \nprotection does not apply in the public employment context.โ  Id. at 598.  The key distinction for \nthe Court came in differentiating between the government โexercising โthe power to regulate or \nlicense,  as  lawmaker,โ  and  the  government  acting  โas  proprietor,  to  manage  [its]  internal \noperation.โโ  Id. (quoting Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895 (1961)).   \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 28 of 32\nADHS argues that class-of-one claims do not extend to cases where โa state official \nexercises his discretionary authority based on subjective, individualized determinations.โ (Dkt. \nNo. 175, at 8-10 (citing and quoting Higgins Elec., Inc. v. OโFallon Fire Prot. Dist., 813 F.3d \n1124, 1129 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation and citation omitted)).  In Higgins, where an \nelectrical vendor claimed it was singled out for differential treatment in bidding for a construction \nproject, the Eighth Circuit dismissed the vendorโs class-of-one claim reasoning that governments \nhave the right to choose โwinners and losersโ in a bidding process and determining that the vendor \ndid not allege that a similarly situated individual was treated more favorably by the government.  \n813 F.3d at 1129-30.  ADHS argues that, because federal and state Medicaid regulations permit it \nto establish reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers and exclude providers \nfor such reasons, ADHSโ termination of PPAEO falls squarely into the type of discretionary \ndecision-making discussed in Engquist (Dkt. No. 175, at 10-11).     \nPlaintiffs assert that the discretion afforded to ADHS in the Medicaid context is not \nsufficient to bar a class-of-one claim (Dkt. No. 178, at 12).  Plaintiffs point out that the federal \nMedicaid Actโs freedom of choice provision limits ADHSโ authority to exclude providers from \nthe Arkansas Medicaid program (Id.).  Plaintiffs also point to this Courtโs prior preliminary \ninjunction Order, wherein this Court found that the Jane Doe plaintiffs were likely to prevail on \ntheir claim that ADHS violated the freedom of choice provision by terminating PPAEO (Dkt. No. \n45, at 22-23).  In that prior Order, this Court noted that a State, when devising a Medicaid plan, is \nempowered to establish a โreasonable standard relating to the qualifications of providers . . . .โ 42 \nC.F.R. ยง 431.51(c)(2).  Further, this Court noted that federal law allows a State to โexclude an \nindividual or entity . . . for any reason for which the Secretary could exclude the individual or \nentity from participation [in a Medicaid plan].โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(p)(1).  This Court also \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 29 of 32\nconsidered precedent from the Seventh and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal where those courts \nfound that, under the federal Medicaid Act, States do not have โunlimited authority to exclude \nproviders for any reason whatsoever.โ  Planned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 979; see Planned \nParenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960 (9th Cir. 2013).   \nThe Court is cognizant that neither party has cited precedent for the authority that a \nprovider terminated, perhaps wrongfully, from a state Medicaid program may bring a class-of-one \nequal protection claim.  Further, this Court notes, as it has previously, that it is an open question \nwhether ADHS is entitled to deference in its determination that a provider is โqualifiedโ as that \nterm is used in the Medicaid Act (Dkt. No. 45, at 26-27).  Finally, as the Eighth Circuit noted in \nDoes v. Gillespie, terminated providers have the option to pursue administrative appeals if they \ndisagree with their termination.  867 F.3d at 1046.   \nThis Court concludes that it need not resolve these issues at this stage of the litigation to \nresolve the pending motion.  Instead, based upon the record evidence before it at this time, the \nCourt concludes that, even if it can maintain such a claim under the circumstances presented here, \nPPAEO has failed to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its equal protection claim.  \nThere is no record evidence indicating how the State of Arkansas determines whether providers \nare โqualified.โ  It may be that the State of Arkansas has little to no discretion to determine whether \nproviders are qualified or whether to terminate them.  While the record evidence does indicate the \nnumber of times ADHS has terminated providers (Dkt. No. 145-7), the record is bereft of any \nevidence indicating the level of discretion afforded to ADHS to terminate or accept providers.  \nGiven the lack of evidence indicating the level of discretion ADHS uses to terminate or accept \nproviders, the Court finds that plaintiffs have failed to satisfy their burden of establishing a \nlikelihood of success on PPAEOโs equal protection claim. \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 30 of 32\nIn addition, on the record before it, at this stage of the litigation, the Court determines that \nplaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the question of whether PPAEO was \nโarbitrarily treated differently from other similarly situatedโ Medicaid providers.  Engquist, 553 \nU.S. at 594.  โTo be similarly situated for purposes of a class-of-one equal protection claim, the \npersons alleged to have been treated more favorably must be identical or directly comparable to \nthe plaintiff in all material respects.โ  Robbins, 794 F.3d at 996 (internal quotations omitted).  The \nrecord contains some evidence that, of the hundreds of providers that have been terminated from \nArkansasโ Medicaid program, two of those were terminated for โfraud and abuseโ and five were \nterminated for delinquent tax payments (Dkt. No. 145-7).  In their latest reply, plaintiffs also cite \nthis Court to internet articles indicating that several other providers who participate in Arkansasโ \nMedicaid program have been investigated in other states yet have not been terminated by ADHS \n(Dkt. No. 178, at 17-20).  Those articles provide few details.  Further, the record evidence before \nthe Court does not include any information about ADHSโ interaction with or investigation of those \nproviders identified in plaintiffsโ reply.  Accordingly, this Court is unwilling at this stage of the \nlitigation and on the record before it to compare ADHSโ treatment of PPAEO with other putatively \nsimilarly-situated providers.  Therefore, for these reasons, the Court finds that plaintiffs have failed \nto establish that they are likely to prevail on the merits of PPAEOโs class-of-one equal protection \nclaim at this time.  \nFinally, the Court also finds that the Patient Class has failed to establish that it is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of its equal protection claim.  Assuming without deciding that the Patient \nClass has standing to bring an equal protection claim due to PPAEOโs termination as a Medicaid \nprovider, the record evidence at this time is insufficient for this Court to conclude that plaintiffs \nare likely to prevail on their claim that the Patient Class is treated differently than any other class \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 31 of 32\nof individuals.  Plaintiffsโ citation to June Medical Services LLC v. Gee does not convince this \nCourt otherwise:  that decision was based upon a motion to dismiss, not a motion for preliminary \ninjunction.  280 F. Supp. 3d 849, 859, 867, 870 (M.D. La. 2017).  Plaintiffs other citations are to \nAmerican Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery v. Bowen, 725 F. Supp. 606, 612-14 (D.D.C. \n1989), where the district court ultimately decided that the challenged law did not violate the \nplaintiffsโ equal protection rights, and to Hill v. Evans, No. CIV. A. 91-A-626-N, 1993 WL \n595676, at *16 (M.D. Ala. Oct. 7, 1993), where a district court found that a statute allowing doctors \nto test certain patients for Human Immunodeficiency Virus without their consent violated the equal \nprotection rights of those patients.  The decision in Hill, however, was clearly predicated on the \nexistence of a class of individuals who were treated differently from other classes of individuals.  \nAt this point, based on the limited record evidence before the Court, the Court concludes that \nplaintiffs have failed to establish at this time that they are likely to prevail on the Patient Classโ \nequal protection claim.  \nB.  Remaining Dataphase Factors \nBecause the Court concludes at this stage of the litigation and on the record evidence before \nit that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that they are likely to prevail on \nthe merits of their constitutional claims, the Court need not consider the remaining Dataphase \nfactors.  The Eighth Circuit has observed that a determination regarding the merits is a threshold \nmatter, which โsimply reflects that the courtโs consideration of the remaining Dataphase factors \ncannot tip the balance of harms in the movantโs favor when the requirement is not satisfied.โ  \nRounds, 530 F.3d at 737 n. 11.   \n   \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:15-cv-00566-KGB   Document 181   Filed 07/30/18   Page 32 of 32\nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court determines that the plaintiffs have not met their burden \nfor the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  Therefore, the Court denies plaintiffsโ motion for \npreliminary injunction (Dkt.
