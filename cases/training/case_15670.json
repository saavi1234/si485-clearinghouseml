    "summary": "<p>On August 25, 2015, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (PPGC) and three Louisiana Medicaid patients filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs, represented by Planned Parenthood and private counsel, sued the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 for violations of the Medicaid Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the defendant from terminating PPGC&rsquo;s Medicaid provider agreements.</p>\r\n<p>On August 3, 2015, the governor of Louisiana and DHH chose to terminate PPGC's Medicaid provider agreement in response to a misleading video that falsely alleged Planned Parenthood clinics around the country had sold fetal body parts. The plaintiffs claimed that DHH's actions could lead to a critical lack of health care for Louisiana's Medicaid patients such as the three Jane Does plaintiffs in this case. Further, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant's actions violated the Medicaid Act by denying Medicaid patients the right to choose any willing, qualified healthcare provider in the Medicaid program, and First and Fourteenth Amendment by penalizing the plaintiffs for their constitutionally protected connection to Planned Parenthood and/or abortion.</p>\r\n<p>After commencement of this case, DHH rescinded the first termination of PPGC's Medicaid provider agreement and replaced it with a second termination. In their October 7, 2015 amended complaint, the plaintiffs outlined DHH's stated reasoning for the second termination attempt. Specifically, DHH alleged that PPGC was in violation of Louisiana Administration Code, had failed to follow Medicaid program policies, and had made misrepresentations following the release of the misleading videos. The plaintiffs argued that none of these reasons related to PPGC's competence as a Louisiana Medicaid provider program. In this amended complaint, the plaintiffs further filed for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>On October 18, 2015, Judge deGravelles denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case, granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, and deferred the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge deGravelles enjoined the defendant from terminating PPGC's Medicaid provider agreement for fourteen days until the court could rule on the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On October 29, 2015, Judge deGravelles granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and indefinitely enjoined the defendant from terminating its Medicaid provider agreement with PPGC. Judge deGravelles held that the plaintiff would likely be able to show that the Medicaid Act's \"free-choice-of-provider\" provision created a private right of action under &sect; 1983, and that they would likely succeed on the merits of their claim because the defendant admitted that PPGC was competent. Further, Judge deGravelles held that the plaintiffs had shown likely irreparable harm based on the disruption to their healthcare. 141 F.Supp.3d 604.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2015, the defendant appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Case Number 15-30987). The following year, on September 14, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision, agreeing that the Medicaid Act creates a private right of action and that the plaintiffs would likely succeed because the defendant's termination of PPGC's provider agreement was not due to its qualifications. 837 F.3d 477. The following year, on June 29, the Fifth Circuit issued an amended opinion with a dissent from a member of the panel that had changed her mind about the ruling. 862 F.3d 445. The defendant asked the Fifth Circuit to rehear the case en banc, but it declined to do so on November 28, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>On December 12, 2017, the defendant filed an unopposed motion to stay the proceedings. On January 2, 2018, the court granted the stay to see whether the United States Supreme Court would take up the case. Later that year, on December 10, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. 139 S.Ct. 408.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendant once again filed a motion to stay the proceedings on March 28, 2019. The court granted the motion on May 17, 2019 and stayed all proceedings pending decisions in the en banc rehearing of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/15655/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Family Planning &amp; Preventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Smith</a></em>, and the appeal in <em>Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee</em>, No. 18-30699 (5th Cir.).</p>\r\n<p>On November 23, 2020, the Fifth Circuit issued an en banc opinion in&nbsp;<em>Smith</em>, holding that the Medicaid Act did not create a private right of action under &sect; 1983 regarding a state's determination that a provider is unqualified. 981 F.3d 347.</p>\r\n<p>On March 8, 2021, the defendant filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction. The district court denied it on April 7, 2021, because there had not yet been a ruling in <em>Gee</em>, so the requirements to lift the stay had not been satisfied.</p>\r\n<p>The defendant moved to lift the stay and vacate the preliminary injunction on September 19, 2022. As the parties briefed the issue, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on November 9, 2022 because the parties had reached a settlement. The next day, the district court granted the motion, which vacated the injunction entered and rendered all other motions moot. The claims were dismissed with prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, \nand Jane Doe #3 are such women – patients of PPGC who are enrolled in Medicaid and who \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 2 of 16\nprefer PPGC to other Medicaid providers. Louisiana Medicaid does not pay for abortions except \nin extremely narrow circumstances, and PPGC has not to date provided abortions in Louisiana at \nall.  \n3.  On August 3, 2015, without giving any warning or expressing any previous \nconcerns about PPGC’s participation in the Medicaid program, Defendant Kathy Kliebert, \nSecretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”) notified PPGC that \nDHH was terminating PPGC’s Medicaid provider agreements, effective 30 days after the date of \nthe notice. While the notice gave no reason for the termination, Governor Jindal referred in a \npress release that same day to heavily edited and misleading videos that opponents of Planned \nParenthood have recently released with regard to Planned Parenthood’s abortion practice in other \nstates, and stated that he terminated the agreements because “Planned Parenthood does not \nrepresent the values of the State of Louisiana in regards to respecting human life.” Press Release, \nOffice of La. Governor Bobby Jindal, Governor Jindal Announces the Termination of Medicaid \nContract with Planned Parenthood (Aug. 3, 2015), \nhttp://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm?md=newsroom&tmp=detail&articleID=5061. Notably, \nnothing in Governor Jindal’s press release relates to the quality of Medicaid services provided by \nPPGC. \n4.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to protect PPGC’s patients’ access \nto – and PPGC’s own ability to provide – these critical medical services. Defendant’s actions \nviolate Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States Code (“Medicaid freedom of choice \nprovision”) because, by barring PPGC from the Medicaid program, it prevents PPGC’s patients, \nincluding Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, from receiving services from \nthe qualified, willing provider of their choice. Defendant’s actions further impermissibly \n- 2 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 3 of 16\npenalize Plaintiffs without adequate justification, in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and deprive Plaintiff PPGC of property without sufficient due process.  \n5.  Unless enjoined, the termination of PPGC’s Medicaid provider agreements will \ntake effect on September 2, 2015, immediately disqualifying PPGC from providing basic and \npreventive health care services to over 5200 Louisiana women and men who depend on that care. \nDefendant’s actions will cause significant and irreparable harm to PPGC and to its Medicaid \npatients, including Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, who will lose their \nprovider of choice, will find their family planning services interrupted, and will be left with few \nor no alternative providers. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Subject-matter jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343. \n7.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court.   \n8.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nTHE PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs   \n9.  Plaintiff PPGC is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of Texas \nand licensed to do business in Louisiana. PPGC brings this action on behalf of itself and its \nLouisiana patients.  \n10.  PPGC (or predecessor organizations) have provided high quality reproductive \nhealth care for more than 30 years in Louisiana.  PPGC operates two health centers in Louisiana, \n- 3 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 4 of 16\none in New Orleans and one in Baton Rouge, and participates in the Medicaid program, \nproviding medical services to low-income enrollees in both underserved communities. The \nfamily planning and other preventive health services provided by PPGC at these and its other \nhealth centers include physical exams, contraception and contraceptive counseling, screening for \nbreast cancer, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, testing and treatment for certain \nsexually transmitted infections (“STIs”), pregnancy testing and counseling, and certain \nprocedures including colposcopy. \n11.  PPGC does not provide abortions in Louisiana. (An organization affiliated with \nPPGC, Planned Parenthood Center for Choice, provides abortions only in Texas.) \n12.  In fiscal year (FY) 2014, PPGC provided more than 15,000 health care visits to \nover 10,000 women, men and teens in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Nearly 75% of those \nvisits were for patients enrolled in Medicaid in Baton Rouge, and nearly 40% of the visits in \nNew Orleans were for Medicaid patients. Those numbers have only increased in the last year–\nover 60% of PPGC’s Louisiana visits are currently for patients enrolled in the Medicaid \nprogram. \n13.  During the FY 2014 visits, PPGC provided over 2100 well women exams, over \n1200 pap smears, over 11,000 tests for STIs, and over 4100 long acting reversible contraceptives, \nimplant contraceptives, and injectible contraceptives to its Medicaid patients.  \n14.  PPGC has been an excellent Medicaid provider. Indeed, PPGC was audited by the \nState Legislative Auditor in 2014, pursuant to a politically motivated request from the \nlegislature, and he concluded that PPGC’s Medicaid billings were appropriate and supported. \nLetter from Daryl Purpera, La. Legis. Auditor, to Daniel Martiny, La. State Senator, and Frank \nHoffman, La. State Representative (Feb. 19, 2014), \n- 4 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 5 of 16\nhttp://app.lla.state.la.us/PublicReports.nsf/5256EC014378E02E86257D57005363A0/$FILE/000\n37C6C.pdf.. \n15.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, a Louisiana resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPGC’s Baton Rouge health center and desires to continue to do so.  \n16.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #2, a Louisiana resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPGC’s New Orleans health center and desires to continue to do so. \n17.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3, a Louisiana resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPGC’s Baton Rouge health center and desires to continue to do so. \n18.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 appear pseudonymously \nbecause of the private and personal nature of the medical care that they receive at PPGC, and \ntheir desire not to have that information become public in order for them to assert their legal \nrights.   \nB.  Defendant \n19.  Defendant Kathy Kleibert is the Secretary of DHH. DHH is the agency that \nadministers Louisiana’s state Medicaid program and has notified PPGC that it intends to \nterminate its provider agreement. Defendant Kleibert is sued in her official capacity, as are her \nemployees, agents, and successors in office. \nTHE MEDICAID PROGRAM \nA.  The Medicaid Statute \n20.  The Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of \n1935, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., pays for medical care for eligible needy people. A state may elect \nwhether or not to participate; if it chooses to do so, it must comply with the requirements \nimposed by the Medicaid statute and by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and \n- 5 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 6 of 16\nHuman Services (“HHS”) in her administration of Medicaid. See generally 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(1)-(83). \n21.  To receive federal funding, a participating state must develop a “plan for medical \nassistance” and submit it to the Secretary of HHS for approval. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). \n22.  Among other requirements, the State plan must provide that: “[A]ny individual \neligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, \ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required . . . who \nundertakes to provide him such services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A). \n23.  Congress has singled out family planning services for special additional \nprotections to ensure freedom of choice, specifically providing that, with respect to these \nservices and with certain limited exceptions not applicable here, “enrollment of an individual \neligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management system . . ., a Medicaid \nmanaged care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person \nfrom whom the individual may receive services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(B).  \n24.  The federal government reimburses the state of Louisiana 90% of expenditures \nattributable to offering, arranging, and furnishing family planning services and supplies in \nMedicaid. 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(a)(5). \nB.   Implementation of the Medicaid Act \n25.  For decades, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the agency \nwithin HHS that administers Medicaid (and its predecessor organization), has repeatedly \ninterpreted the “qualified” language in Section 1396a(a)(23) to prohibit states from denying \naccess to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that provider to perform Medicaid-\n- 6 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 7 of 16\ncovered services or to properly bill for those services, including reasons such as the scope of the \nmedical services that the provider chooses to offer.  \n26.  CMS has explained that “[t]he purpose of the free choice provision is to allow \n[Medicaid] recipients the same opportunities to choose among available providers of covered \nhealth care and services as are normally offered to the general population.” Ctrs. For Medicare & \nMedicaid Servs., CMS Manuals Publication #45, State Medicaid Manual § 2100.  \n27.  Consistent with this understanding, CMS has a long history of rejecting state \nplans that seek to limit the type of provider that can provide particular services. See, e.g., 53 Fed. \nReg. 8699 (Mar. 16, 1988) (noting rejection of a state plan that would limit providers to “private \nnonprofit” organizations); 67 Fed. Reg. 79121 (Dec. 27, 2002) (noting disapproval of a state plan \namendment that would have limited “beneficiary choice . . . by imposing standards that are not \nreasonably related to the qualifications of providers”). \n28.  More recently, CMS rejected an Indiana plan that barred state agencies from \ncontracting with or making grants to any entities that perform abortion because it violated the \nMedicaid freedom of choice provision. Letter from Donald M. Berwick, Adm’r., CMS, to \nPatricia Casanova, Dir., Ind. Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (June 1, 2011), \nhttp://www.politico.com/static/PPM169_110601_indiana_letter.html. \n29.  Moreover, even though CMS is permitted to waive § 1396a(a)(23) in \ndemonstration projects approved under Social Security Act § 1115, CMS repeatedly rejects state \nrequests to do so for family planning services, including twice in the last year: first in \nPennsylvania, see Letter from Marilyn Tavenner, Adm’r, CMS, to Beverly Mackereth, Sec’y, Pa. \nDep’t of Public Welfare (Aug. 28, 2014), http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-\nInformation/By-Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/pa/pa-healthy-ca.pdf (“No waiver of freedom \n- 7 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 8 of 16\nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.”); and more recently in Iowa, see Letter \nfrom Manning Pellanda, Dir., CMS Div. of State Demonstrations and Waivers, to Julie \nLovelady, Interim Medicaid Dir., Iowa Dep’t of Human Servs. (Feb. 2, 2015), \nhttp://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-\nTopics/Waivers/1115/downloads/ia/ia-marketplace-choice-plan-ca.pdf (“No waiver of freedom \nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.”). \nJINDAL ADMINISTRATION’S EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE PPGC \n30.  On August 3, 2015, without prior notice, Defendant notified PPGC that it was \nterminating PPGC’s provider agreements, to be effective in 30 days. \n31.  Therefore, absent an injunction, Defendant will terminate PPGC’s provider \nagreements on September 2, 2015. \n32.  Defendant’s letter provided no reason for the termination of the agreement. \nHowever, that same day, Governor Jindal referred in a press release to heavily edited and \nmisleading videos that opponents of Planned Parenthood have recently released with regard to \nPlanned Parenthood’s abortion practice in other states. Press Release, Office of Bobby Jindal. \nThe allegations in the misleading videos that Planned Parenthood abortion providers are \nviolating the law regarding the use of fetal tissue in scientific research are false.  \n33.  Governor Jindal further stated that he and DHH “decided to . . . terminate the \nPlanned Parenthood Medicaid provider contract because Planned Parenthood does not represent \nthe values of the State of Louisiana in regards to respecting human life.” Id.   \n34.  On information and belief, the procedures used by Defendant in terminating \nPPGC’s provider agreements are highly irregular. Defendant has imposed a sanction of exclusion \n- 8 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 9 of 16\nfrom Medicaid on PPGC without a finding of a “violation” by PPGC and without providing \nPPGC the opportunity for a pre-deprivation hearing as state law requires. \n35.  Defendant’s action is part and parcel of Governor Jindal’s campaign against \nabortion and to punish abortion providers, even though the only services PPGC provides in \nLouisiana are family planning and other preventive health services to women, men and teens \nwho need them. \n36.  CMS has advised Defendant that her actions to terminate PPGC’s provider \nagreements likely violate the Medicaid freedom of choice provision. \nTHE IMPACT OF DEFENDANT’S ACTIONS ON PPGC AND ITS PATIENTS \n37.  The need for publicly supported family planning services is great in Louisiana, \nwhich regularly ranks among the worst states for reproductive care. In 2010, 60% of pregnancies \nin Louisiana were unintended. Guttmacher Inst., State Facts About Unintended Pregnancy: \nLouisiana (2014), https://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/unintended-pregnancy/pdf/LA.pdf  \n(hereafter “State Facts: Louisiana”). The state ranks fifth highest among 50 states in teen \npregnancy rates. Kathryn Kost & Stanley Henshaw, Guttmacher Inst., U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, \nBirths and Abortions, 2010: National and State Trends by Age, Race and Ethnicity 4 (2014), \nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/USTPtrends10.pdf. Nearly 80% of Louisiana’s unplanned \nbirths are publicly funded, higher than the national average of 68%. State Facts: Louisiana. \nMoreover, Louisiana has high rates of STIs: the state ranks first in congenital syphilis and \ngonorrhea, second in chlamydia, and third in primary and secondary syphilis. Ctrs. for Disease \nControl and Prevention, 2013 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Surveillance, Table 41. Congenital \nSyphilis - Reported Cases and Rates of Reported Cases in Infants, by State, Ranked by Rates \n(2013) http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/tables/41.htm; Table 13. Gonorrhea - Reported Cases and \n- 9 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 10 of 16\nRates of Reported Cases by State, Ranked by Rates (2013) \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/tables/13.htm; Table 2. Chlamydia - Reported Cases and Rates of \nReported Cases by State, Ranked by Rates (2013) http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/tables/2.htm; \nTable 26. Primary and Secondary Syphilis - Reported Cases and Rates of Reported Cases by \nState, Ranked by Rates (2013). \n38.  As DHH has recognized, “[i]n Louisiana, for 2002, there were an estimated \n515,960 women, ages 13 to 44 years, needing contraceptive services and supplies. Of those, 59 \npercent needed publicly supported services.” DHH, East Baton Rouge Parish Health Profile 30 \n(2005), \nhttp://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/assets/docs/SurveillanceReports/php/PHP2005/PDF/EastBatonRou\nge/PHPEastBatonRouge.pdf (hereinafter “DHH, East Baton Rouge Parish Health Profile”). In \nEast Baton Rouge Parish alone, DHH estimated in 2005 that of the 54,980 women needing \ncontraceptive services and supplies, 31,770 (58%) were in need of publicly supported services \nand supplies. Id.  \n39.  In spite of the great needs, there are simply not enough providers of the critical \ncare PPGC provides. PPGC’s New Orleans health center is in an area that the federal \ngovernment has classified as “medically underserved” based on four variables: 1) the ratio of \nprimary medical care physicians per 1,000 population, 2) the infant mortality rate, 3) the \npercentage of the population with incomes below the poverty level, and 4) the percentage of the \npopulation age 65 or over. Both of PPGC’s health centers are in areas classified as a “Primary \nCare Health Professional Shortage Area,” a designation for areas with a population to full-time \nprimary care physician ratio of 3500:1 – or a ratio between 3000-3500:1 in areas with unusually \nhigh demand for primary care services – and in which primary care professionals in contiguous \n- 10 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 11 of 16\nareas are practically inaccessible.  See U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Find Shortage \nAreas, Health Resources and Services Administration, \nhttp://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/GeoAdvisor/ShortageDesignationAdvisor.aspx (enter each clinic \naddress and click “submit”) (last accessed Aug. 21, 2015); U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human \nServs., Guidelines for MUA and MUP Designation, Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/shortage/muaps/index.html (last accessed Aug. 21, 2015); \nU.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Primary Medical Care HPSA Designation Overview, \nHealth Resources and Services Administration, \nhttp://bhpr.hrsa.gov/shortage/hpsas/designationcriteria/primarycarehpsaoverview.html (last \naccessed Aug. 21, 2015).  \n40.  With these significant provider shortages, PPGC plays a key role in providing \nneeded care to Louisiana’s low-income population, treating over 5200 Louisiana Medicaid \npatients annually. In East Baton Rouge Parish alone, 5460 female contraceptive clients were \nserved by publicly funded health clinics in 2010, the latest year that data is available; Planned \nParenthood—by far the largest provider—served over half (3130) of these women. Guttmacher \nInst., Contraceptive Needs and Services, 2010 (2013) \nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/win/2010/WIN-2010-Louisiana.pdf.  \n41.  Many of PPGC’s patients come only to PPGC for their health care. As DHH has \nitself recognized, “[w]ith the high rate of people living without health insurance in Louisiana, a \nfamily planning visit may be the only time that a woman ever has a preventive health clinic \nvisit.” DHH, East Baton Rouge Parish Health Profile 28. \n42.  If Defendant’s actions take effect, many of PPGC’s Medicaid patients in Baton \nRouge and New Orleans, who already have few or no alternative options, will find it difficult or \n- 11 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 12 of 16\nimpossible to access the reproductive health care services they need. Those who are able to find \nother providers will often have to wait unacceptable periods of time for an appointment. Those \nwho are unable to find an adequate alternative will not receive the medical services they need, \nwhich will lead to higher rates of unintended pregnancies, STIs, and undiagnosed cancers. \n43.  Other Medicaid providers in Baton Rouge and New Orleans are already stretched \nto the breaking point, even with PPGC providing care. It is virtually impossible to locate a \nprivate ob/gyn who will take a Medicaid patient who is not pregnant. At other clinics, it is \ndifficult to schedule appointments, and even if a patient can obtain one, they may be unable to \nobtain the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives, including IUDs and Depo Provera, which \nare the most effective forms of birth control. Other clinics are difficult for PPGC’s low-income \npatients to travel to, or have excessive waits to obtain critical cancer screenings. And, with cuts \nand closures at local public hospitals and clinics, it is difficult for low-income patients in need of \nmedical care to obtain it. \n44.  If PPGC is forced to stop providing care in the Medicaid program, a dire situation \nwill become critical. The remaining providers will be simply unable to absorb PPGC’s patients, \nleaving those patients without access to critical medical services.  \n45.  Even if other providers were available, patients insured through Medicaid choose \nPPGC based on a number of factors that are generally not available at other providers. With its \nevidence-based practices and up-to-date technology, PPGC is known as a provider of high-\nquality medical care. Many individuals who receive other health care through community care \nproviders or other Medicaid providers choose to have a separate provider such as PPGC for their \nreproductive health care because they are concerned about their privacy and because they fear \nbeing judged by other providers.     \n- 12 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 13 of 16\n46.  In addition, many low-income patients have unique scheduling constraints \nbecause they are juggling inflexible work schedules, childcare obligations, transportation \nchallenges, and lack of childcare resources. To ensure that these patients have access to family \nplanning services, PPGC offers extended hours. In addition, PPGC spaces patient appointments \nso as to minimize wait times. PPGC has either a full-time Spanish speaker on staff or translator \nservices available to non-English speaking patients at all times. \n47.  Defendant’s actions will deprive all of PPGC’s Medicaid patients, including \nPlaintiffs Jane Doe #1, #2, and #3, of access to the high-quality, specialized care that PPGC \nprovides.   \n48.  All three individual Plaintiffs rely on PPGC as the place they can turn to for \ncritical medical care and for prompt, efficient, and compassionate services. If PPGC is \neliminated from Medicaid, they will be prevented from receiving services from their provider of \nchoice, will have their health care interrupted, and may encounter difficulties finding alternative \ncare. \n49.  In FY 2014, PPGC’s reimbursements for providing these critical health services \nto low-income patients totaled nearly $730,000. Without this revenue, PPGC may be unable to \ncontinue to provide services in the same manner, and may be forced to lay off staff members, \nreduce hours, or close the Baton Rouge health center, as Medicaid reimbursements amount to \nover 60% of the revenue at that health center. Should PPGC ever be allowed back as a Medicaid \nprovider, it would be very expensive – if not impossible – for PPGC to resume operations as they \nare today. If PPGC closes its Baton Rouge health center, this will affect not only the Medicaid \npatients at the health center, but all of the patients who seek reproductive health care at that \nhealth center.    \n- 13 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 14 of 16\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM I – MEDICAID ACT (TITLE XIX OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT) \n50.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 49 above. \n51.  Defendant’s action violates Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States \nCode by denying PPGC’s patients, including the Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane \nDoe #3, the right to choose any willing, qualified healthcare provider in the Medicaid program. \nCLAIM II – FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS – PENALIZING \nCONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITY \n \n52.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 49 above. \n53.  Defendant’s action penalizes Plaintiffs for their constitutionally protected \nassociation with Planned Parenthood and/or abortion, without adequate justification. \nCLAIM III – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION \n54.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 49 above. \n55.  Defendant’s action violates Plaintiffs’ rights by singling them out for unfavorable \ntreatment without adequate justification. \nCLAIM IV – PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n56.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 49 above. \n57.  Defendant’s action to terminate PPGC’s provider agreements without pre-\ndeprivation notice, eliminating over 60% of the revenue of PPGC’s Baton Rouge health center \nand threatening the future of that health center, deprives PPGC of property without \nconstitutionally sufficient due process.  \n- 14 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 1    08/25/15   Page 15 of 16\nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n58.

This civil action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate rights \nsecured by the federal Medicaid statutes, as well as the U.S. Constitution.  \n2.  Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (“PPGC”) provides critically \nneeded family planning and preventive health services to thousands of women and men in \nunderserved Orleans and East Baton Rouge Parishes through the Medicaid program. As is \nrequired by federal law, Medicaid enrollees may seek services from a participating provider of \ntheir choice and have those services covered by Medicaid. Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 2 of 21\n \nand Jane Doe #3 are such women – patients of PPGC who are enrolled in Medicaid and who \nprefer PPGC to other Medicaid providers. Louisiana Medicaid does not pay for abortions except \nin extremely narrow circumstances, and PPGC does not provide abortions in Louisiana.  \n3.  On August 3, 2015, without giving any warning or expressing any previous \nconcerns about PPGC’s participation in the Medicaid program, Defendant Kathy Kliebert, \nSecretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”) notified PPGC that \nDHH was terminating PPGC’s Medicaid provider agreements, effective 30 days after the date of \nthe notice (“first termination”). While the notice gave no reason for the termination, Governor \nJindal referred in a press release that same day to heavily edited and misleading videos that \nopponents of Planned Parenthood have recently released on YouTube with regard to Planned \nParenthood’s abortion practice in other states, and stated that he terminated the agreements \nbecause “Planned Parenthood does not represent the values of the State of Louisiana in regards \nto respecting human life.” Press Release, Office of La. Governor Bobby Jindal, Governor Jindal \nAnnounces the Termination of Medicaid Contract with Planned Parenthood (Aug. 3, 2015), \nhttp://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm?md=newsroom&tmp=detail&articleID=5061. Notably, \nnothing in Governor Jindal’s press release relates to the quality of Medicaid services provided by \nPPGC. \n4.  After this action was commenced and after Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary \nRestraining Order was argued and briefed, Defendant changed tactics and rescinded the first \ntermination, and on September 15, replaced it with a second termination, also effective 30 days \nafter the notice, in which she put forth several alleged grounds for the termination (“second \ntermination”). Each ground is baseless and unsupported as a matter of fact and law, and not one \nrelates to PPGC’s competence to provide services in Louisiana’s Medicaid program. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 3 of 21\n \n5.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to protect PPGC’s patients’ access \nto – and PPGC’s own ability to provide – these critical medical services. Defendant’s actions \nviolate Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States Code (“Medicaid freedom of choice \nprovision”) because, by barring PPGC from the Medicaid program, it prevents PPGC’s patients, \nincluding Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, from receiving services from \nthe qualified, willing provider of their choice. Defendant’s actions further impermissibly single \nout Plaintiffs for unfavorable treatment and penalize them for the exercise of constitutional rights \nwithout adequate justification, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n6.  Unless enjoined, the termination of PPGC’s Medicaid provider agreements will \ntake effect on October 17 and 18, immediately disqualifying PPGC from providing basic and \npreventive health care services to over 5200 Louisiana women and men who depend on PPGC \nannually for that care. Defendant’s actions will cause significant and irreparable harm to PPGC \nand to its Medicaid patients, including Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3, \nwho will lose their provider of choice, will find their family planning services interrupted, and \nwill be left with few or no alternative providers. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Subject-matter jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343. \n8.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court.   \n9.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n- 3 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 4 of 21\n \nTHE PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs   \n10.  Plaintiff PPGC is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of Texas \nand licensed to do business in Louisiana. PPGC brings this action on behalf of itself and its \nLouisiana patients.  \n11.  PPGC (or predecessor organizations) have provided high quality reproductive \nhealth care for more than 30 years in Louisiana.  PPGC operates two health centers in Louisiana, \none in New Orleans and one in Baton Rouge, and participates in the Medicaid program, \nproviding medical services to low-income enrollees in both underserved communities. The \nfamily planning and other preventive health services provided by PPGC at these and its other \nhealth centers include physical exams, contraception and contraceptive counseling, screening for \nbreast cancer, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, testing and treatment for certain \nsexually transmitted infections (“STIs”), pregnancy testing and counseling, and certain \nprocedures including colposcopy. \n12.  PPGC does not provide abortions. (An organization affiliated with PPGC, \nPlanned Parenthood Center for Choice, provides abortions only in Texas.) \n13.  In fiscal year (FY) 2014, PPGC provided more than 15,000 health care visits to \nover 10,000 women, men and teens in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, over 5200 of whom have \ncoverage under the Medicaid program. Nearly 75% of those visits in Baton Rouge were for \npatients enrolled in Medicaid, and nearly 40% of the visits in New Orleans were for Medicaid \npatients. Those numbers have only increased in the last year–over 60% of PPGC’s Louisiana \nvisits are currently for patients enrolled in the Medicaid program. \n- 4 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 5 of 21\n \n14.  During the FY 2014 visits, PPGC provided over 2100 well women exams, over \n1200 pap smears, over 11,000 tests for STIs, and over 4100 long acting reversible contraceptives, \nimplant contraceptives, and injectable contraceptives to its Medicaid patients.  \n15.  PPGC has been an excellent Medicaid provider. Prior to DHH’s recent actions, \nDHH has never expressed any concerns about PPGC’s performance in that program. Indeed, \nPPGC was audited by the State Legislative Auditor in 2014, pursuant to a politically motivated \nrequest from the legislature, and he concluded that PPGC’s Medicaid billings were appropriate \nand supported. Letter from Daryl Purpera, La. Legis. Auditor, to Daniel Martiny, La. State \nSenator, and Frank Hoffman, La. State Representative (Feb. 19, 2014), \nhttp://app.lla.state.la.us/PublicReports.nsf/5256EC014378E02E86257D57005363A0/$FILE/000\n37C6C.pdf.. \n16.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, a Louisiana resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPGC’s Baton Rouge health center and desires to continue to do so.  \nShe sues on behalf of herself and as a representative of a class of Louisiana Medicaid \nbeneficiaries who obtain, or who seek to obtain, covered health care services at PPGC. \n17.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #2, a Louisiana resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPGC’s New Orleans health center and desires to continue to do so. \nShe sues on behalf of herself and as a representative of a class of Louisiana Medicaid \nbeneficiaries who obtain, or who seek to obtain, covered health care services at PPGC. \n18.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3, a Louisiana resident and Medicaid patient, obtains her \nreproductive health care at PPGC’s Baton Rouge health center and desires to continue to do so. \nShe sues on behalf of herself and as a representative of a class of Louisiana Medicaid \nbeneficiaries who obtain, or who seek to obtain, covered health care services at PPGC. \n- 5 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 6 of 21\n \n19.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 appear pseudonymously \nbecause of the private and personal nature of the medical care that they receive at PPGC, and \ntheir desire not to have that information become public in order for them to assert their legal \nrights.   \nB.  Defendant \n20.  Defendant Kathy Kliebert is the Secretary of DHH. DHH is the agency that \nadministers Louisiana’s state Medicaid program and has notified PPGC that it intends to \nterminate its provider agreements. Defendant Kliebert is sued in her official capacity, as are her \nemployees, agents, and successors in office. \nTHE MEDICAID PROGRAM \nA.  The Medicaid Statute \n21.  The Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of \n1935, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., pays for medical care for eligible needy people. A state may elect \nwhether or not to participate; if it chooses to do so, it must comply with the requirements \nimposed by the Medicaid statute and by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services (“HHS”) in her administration of Medicaid. See generally 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(1)-(83). \n22.  To receive federal funding, a participating state must develop a “plan for medical \nassistance” and submit it to the Secretary of HHS for approval. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). \n23.  Among other requirements, the State plan must provide that: “[A]ny individual \neligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, \ncommunity pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required . . . who \nundertakes to provide him such services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A). \n- 6 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 7 of 21\n \n24.  Congress has singled out family planning services for special additional \nprotections to ensure freedom of choice, specifically providing that, with respect to these \nservices and with certain limited exceptions not applicable here, “enrollment of an individual \neligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management system . . ., a Medicaid \nmanaged care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person \nfrom whom the individual may receive services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(B).  \n25.  The federal government reimburses the state of Louisiana 90% of expenditures \nattributable to offering, arranging, and furnishing family planning services and supplies in \nMedicaid. 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(a)(5). \nB.   Implementation of the Medicaid Act \n26.  For decades, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the agency \nwithin HHS that administers Medicaid (and its predecessor organization), has repeatedly \ninterpreted the “qualified” language in Section 1396a(a)(23) to prohibit states from denying \naccess to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that provider to perform Medicaid-\ncovered services or to properly bill for those services, including reasons such as the scope of the \nmedical services that the provider chooses to offer.  \n27.  CMS has explained that “[t]he purpose of the free choice provision is to allow \n[Medicaid] recipients the same opportunities to choose among available providers of covered \nhealth care and services as are normally offered to the general population.” Ctrs. For Medicare & \nMedicaid Servs., CMS Manuals Publication #45, State Medicaid Manual § 2100.  \n28.  Consistent with this understanding, CMS has a long history of rejecting state \nplans that seek to limit the type of provider that can provide particular services. See, e.g., 53 Fed. \nReg. 8699 (Mar. 16, 1988) (noting rejection of a state plan that would limit providers to “private \n- 7 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 8 of 21\n \nnonprofit” organizations); 67 Fed. Reg. 79121 (Dec. 27, 2002) (noting disapproval of a state plan \namendment that would have limited “beneficiary choice . . . by imposing standards that are not \nreasonably related to the qualifications of providers”). \n29.  More recently, CMS rejected an Indiana plan that barred state agencies from \ncontracting with or making grants to any entities that perform abortion because it violated the \nMedicaid freedom of choice provision. Letter from Donald M. Berwick, Adm’r., CMS, to \nPatricia Casanova, Dir., Ind. Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (June 1, 2011), \nhttp://www.politico.com/static/PPM169_110601_indiana_letter.html. \n30.  Moreover, even though CMS is permitted to waive § 1396a(a)(23) in \ndemonstration projects approved under Social Security Act § 1115, CMS repeatedly rejects state \nrequests to do so for family planning services, including twice in the last year: first in \nPennsylvania, see Letter from Marilyn Tavenner, Adm’r, CMS, to Beverly Mackereth, Sec’y, Pa. \nDep’t of Public Welfare (Aug. 28, 2014), http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-\nInformation/By-Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/pa/pa-healthy-ca.pdf (“No waiver of freedom \nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.”); and more recently in Iowa, see Letter \nfrom Manning Pellanda, Dir., CMS Div. of State Demonstrations and Waivers, to Julie \nLovelady, Interim Medicaid Dir., Iowa Dep’t of Human Servs. (Feb. 2, 2015), \nhttp://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-\nTopics/Waivers/1115/downloads/ia/ia-marketplace-choice-plan-ca.pdf (“No waiver of freedom \nof choice is authorized for family planning providers.”). \nJINDAL ADMINISTRATION’S EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE PPGC \n31.  On August 3, 2015, without prior notice, Defendant notified PPGC that it was \nterminating PPGC’s provider agreements, effective in 30 days (“first termination”). \n- 8 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 9 of 21\n \n32.  Defendant’s letters provided no reason for the first termination of the agreements. \nHowever, that same day, Governor Jindal referred in a press release to heavily edited and \nmisleading videos that opponents of Planned Parenthood have recently released on YouTube \nwith regard to Planned Parenthood’s abortion practice in other states. Press Release, Office of \nBobby Jindal. \n33.  Governor Jindal further stated that he and DHH “decided to . . . terminate the \nPlanned Parenthood Medicaid provider contract because Planned Parenthood does not represent \nthe values of the State of Louisiana in regards to respecting human life.” Id.   \n34.  On September 2, 2015, after the commencement of this action, Defendant through \ncounsel maintained that she had no “reason” for the termination (while admitting that the videos \nwere the “motive” for it). In fact, Defendant conceded that as of that date, there was no question \nabout the competency of PPGC to provide Medicaid services. \n35.  CMS advised Defendant that her actions to terminate PPGC’s provider \nagreements likely violate the Medicaid freedom of choice provision, and filed a Statement of \nInterest in this action reiterating that position. \n36.  Soon after, however, Defendant rescinded the first termination, and replaced it \nwith a second attempt to terminate PPGC’s provider agreements in letters dated September 15, \n2015 (“second termination”).  \n37.  Defendant’s second termination letters seem to rely on three alleged “reasons” for \nthe termination, but each of them is baseless and unsupported in both fact and law: \na)  First, Defendant states that it was a “violation” of “Louisiana \nAdministration Code, Title 50,” without identifying a specific section of \nthat title, to settle a federal False Claims Act case, Reynolds v. Planned \n- 9 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 10 of 21\n \nParenthood Gulf Coast, Inc., No. 9:09-cv-124 (E.D. Tex. 2013) over two \nyears ago. Not only is it not a violation of state law for a Medicaid \nprovider to settle a case with a “Qui-Tam plaintiff,” La. Admin. Code tit. \n50, § 4147(A)(12)(c), but PPGC settled that case (which was brought by a \nformer employee) without any admission of wrongdoing and for practical \nreasons. Defendant’s second termination letter also informs PPGC that it \nwas required to notify DHH of the Reynolds settlement, but nothing in \nLouisiana law requires that and, moreover, Defendant knew about the \nsettlement as soon as it was filed. \nb)  Second, Defendant states that “[a]lso under consideration . . . are provider \naudits and federal false claims cases against Planned Parenthood of \nAmerica (PPFA) affiliates.” Defendant claims that “PPGC and its parent \norganization PPFA” failed both “to ensure that all their agents and \naffiliates are in compliance with all federal and state law as well as rules, \npolicies and procedures of the Medicaid program” and “to notify DHH of \nviolations and misconduct by affiliates and providers-in-fact.” Defendant \nis wrong on many levels: \ni.  Planned Parenthood Federation of America (“PPFA”) is not \nPPGC’s parent organization, nor are other Planned \nParenthood affiliates elsewhere in the country, which are \ncompletely separate corporations, PPGC’s “agents,” \n“affiliates” or “providers-in-fact.” \n- 10 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 11 of 21\n \nii.  Defendant, moreover, does not identify any laws or \nregulations relating to the Louisiana Medicaid program (as \nis required by La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 4147(A)(1), a \nprovision of law within the Title that Defendant cites), that \nPPGC (or other Planned Parenthood entities for that matter) \nhave supposedly violated.  \niii.  The only “provider audit” or “federal false claims case” \nlisted by Defendant is another False Claims Act case \nagainst PPGC initiated by a qui tam plaintiff in Texas. \nDefendant cites misleadingly from the Texas district \ncourt’s denial of PPGC’s motion to dismiss to suggest that \nPPGC has knowingly filed false claims, but PPGC \nvigorously disputes that contention, and the matter is \ncurrently in discovery. DHH, moreover, has never sought \nany information from PPGC about that case. \nc)  Finally, Defendant refers to its “review” of two letters (dated July 24 and \nAugust 4, 2015) provided by PPGC in response to questions posed by \nDHH following the release of the misleading YouTube videos. DHH \nstates that: “After said review, DHH believes that PPGC misrepresented \nits actions therein and had contradictions within the body of the letter and \nwith the statements and admissions made in the . . . videos.” Defendant \nfurther states that: “DHH believes PPGC’s responses to inquiries, when \n- 11 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 12 of 21\n \ncompared to clear representations in various videos, rises to the level of \nmisrepresentation.”  \ni.  Defendant does not specify the alleged \n“misrepresentations” or “contradictions” she contends \nPPGC made in those letters, nor does she contend that the \n“misrepresentations” relate to the Louisiana Medicaid \nprogram, even though that is required by the state law \nprovision cited by Defendant. La. Stat. Ann. \n§ 46:437.14(A)(1). \nii.  Moreover, the allegations suggested within the misleading \nYouTube videos, that Planned Parenthood abortion \nproviders are violating the law regarding the use of fetal \ntissue in scientific research, are false. Defendant, moreover, \ndid not request additional information from PPGC after \nreceiving the letters, did not seek to conduct any \ninvestigation to determine whether her belief was correct, \ndid not give PPGC the opportunity to clarify or correct any \nalleged misrepresentations, and did not make any additional \nfindings. \n38.  None of the grounds asserted by Defendant relate at all to PPGC’s competence to \nprovide care in the Louisiana Medicaid program. \n39.  Defendant’s letters further state that she reserves the right to terminate the \nprovider agreements “immediately and without written notice” based on the “further findings of \n- 12 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 13 of 21\n \nthe pending investigations by any department of Louisiana, any other State or state agency, or \nthe pending investigations in the congressional committees.”  \n40.  On information and belief, the procedures used by Defendant in terminating \nPPGC’s provider agreements are highly irregular and have not been applied to any other \nMedicaid provider. Defendant first tried to terminate PPGC without any reason at all and without \nproviding PPGC the opportunity for a pre-deprivation hearing as state law requires. Defendant \nthereafter invented baseless allegations of “cause” and threatened PPGC with further \nterminations in her continued efforts to remove PPGC from Medicaid. The effort amounts to \nnothing more than a witch-hunt against an entity that DHH has never previously suggested \nprovides anything other than excellent Medicaid care. \n41.  Defendant’s action is part and parcel of Governor Jindal’s campaign against \nabortion and to punish abortion providers, even though the only services PPGC provides in \nLouisiana are family planning and other preventive health services to women, men and teens \nwho need them. \n42.  Absent an injunction from the Court, Defendant will terminate one of PPGC’s \nprovider agreements on October 17 and the remaining three on October 18, 2015. \nTHE IMPACT OF DEFENDANT’S ACTIONS ON PPGC AND ITS PATIENTS \n43.  The need for publicly supported family planning services is great in Louisiana, \nwhich regularly ranks among the worst states for reproductive care. In 2010, 60% of pregnancies \nin Louisiana were unintended. Guttmacher Inst., State Facts About Unintended Pregnancy: \nLouisiana (2014), https://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/unintended-pregnancy/pdf/LA.pdf  \n(hereafter “State Facts: Louisiana”). The state ranks fifth highest among 50 states in teen \npregnancy rates. Kathryn Kost & Stanley Henshaw, Guttmacher Inst., U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, \n- 13 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 14 of 21\n \nBirths and Abortions, 2010: National and State Trends by Age, Race and Ethnicity 4 (2014), \nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/USTPtrends10.pdf. Nearly 80% of Louisiana’s unplanned \nbirths are publicly funded, higher than the national average of 68%. State Facts: Louisiana. \nMoreover, Louisiana has high rates of STIs: the state ranks first in congenital syphilis and \ngonorrhea, second in chlamydia, and third in primary and secondary syphilis. Ctrs. for Disease \nControl and Prevention, 2013 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Surveillance, Table 41.

Primary and Secondary Syphilis - Reported Cases and Rates of Reported Cases by \nState, Ranked by Rates (2013). \n44.  As DHH has recognized, “[i]n Louisiana, for 2002, there were an estimated \n515,960 women, ages 13 to 44 years, needing contraceptive services and supplies. Of those, 59 \npercent needed publicly supported services.” DHH, East Baton Rouge Parish Health Profile 30 \n(2005), \nhttp://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/assets/docs/SurveillanceReports/php/PHP2005/PDF/EastBatonRou\nge/PHPEastBatonRouge.pdf (hereinafter “DHH, East Baton Rouge Parish Health Profile”). In \nEast Baton Rouge Parish alone, DHH estimated in 2005 that of the 54,980 women needing \ncontraceptive services and supplies, 31,770 (58%) were in need of publicly supported services \nand supplies. Id.  \n- 14 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 15 of 21\n \n45.  In spite of the great needs, there are simply not enough providers of the critical \ncare PPGC provides. PPGC’s New Orleans health center is in an area that the federal \ngovernment has classified as “medically underserved” based on four variables: 1) the ratio of \nprimary medical care physicians per 1,000 population, 2) the infant mortality rate, 3) the \npercentage of the population with incomes below the poverty level, and 4) the percentage of the \npopulation age 65 or over. Both of PPGC’s health centers are in areas classified as a “Primary \nCare Health Professional Shortage Area,” a designation for areas with a population to full-time \nprimary care physician ratio of 3500:1 – or a ratio between 3000-3500:1 in areas with unusually \nhigh demand for primary care services – and in which primary care professionals in contiguous \nareas are practically inaccessible.  See U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Find Shortage \nAreas, Health Resources and Services Administration, \nhttp://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/GeoAdvisor/ShortageDesignationAdvisor.aspx (enter each clinic \naddress and click “submit”) (last accessed Aug. 21, 2015); U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human \nServs., Guidelines for MUA and MUP Designation, Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/shortage/muaps/index.html (last accessed Aug. 21, 2015); \nU.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Primary Medical Care HPSA Designation Overview, \nHealth Resources and Services Administration, \nhttp://bhpr.hrsa.gov/shortage/hpsas/designationcriteria/primarycarehpsaoverview.html (last \naccessed Aug. 21, 2015).  \n46.  With these significant provider shortages, PPGC plays a key role in providing \nneeded care to Louisiana’s low-income population, treating over 5200 Louisiana Medicaid \npatients annually. In East Baton Rouge Parish alone, 5460 female contraceptive clients were \nserved by publicly funded health clinics in 2010, the latest year that data is available; Planned \n- 15 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 16 of 21\n \nParenthood—by far the largest provider—served over half (3130) of these women. Guttmacher \nInst., Contraceptive Needs and Services, 2010 (2013) \nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/win/2010/WIN-2010-Louisiana.pdf.  \n47.  Many of PPGC’s patients come only to PPGC for their health care. As DHH has \nitself recognized, “[w]ith the high rate of people living without health insurance in Louisiana, a \nfamily planning visit may be the only time that a woman ever has a preventive health clinic \nvisit.” DHH, East Baton Rouge Parish Health Profile 28. \n48.  If Defendant’s actions take effect, many of PPGC’s Medicaid patients in Baton \nRouge and New Orleans, who already have few or no alternative options, will find it difficult or \nimpossible to access the reproductive health care services they need. Those who are able to find \nother providers will often have to wait unacceptable periods of time for an appointment. Those \nwho are unable to find an adequate alternative will not receive the medical services they need, \nwhich will lead to higher rates of unintended pregnancies, STIs, and undiagnosed cancers. \n49.  Other Medicaid providers in Baton Rouge and New Orleans are already stretched \nto the breaking point, even with PPGC providing care. It is virtually impossible to locate a \nprivate ob/gyn who will take a Medicaid patient who is not pregnant. At community health \nclinics, it is often difficult for low-income patients to connect with a scheduler to make an \nappointment. Even if a patient can obtain an appointment, she may be unable to obtain (either at \nall, or without significant delays) the services she seeks, such as long acting reversible  \ncontraceptives (“LARCs”), which are the most effective forms of birth control, or lifesaving \ncancer screening procedures, such as colposcopies. Some other clinics abide by the Catholic \nhealth directives and do not provide birth control at all. Indeed, other Medicaid providers \nsometimes refer their patients to PPGC’s health center for those services. Other clinics are \n- 16 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 17 of 21\n \ndifficult for PPGC’s low-income patients to travel to. And, with cuts and closures at local public \nhospitals and clinics, it is difficult for low-income patients in need of medical care to obtain it. \n50.  If PPGC is forced to stop providing care in the Medicaid program, a dire situation \nwill become critical. The remaining providers will be simply unable to absorb PPGC’s patients, \nleaving those patients without access to critical medical services.  \n51.  Even if other providers were available, patients insured through Medicaid choose \nPPGC based on a number of factors that are generally not available at other providers. With its \nevidence-based practices and up-to-date technology, PPGC is known as a provider of high-\nquality medical care. Many individuals who receive other health care through community care \nproviders or other Medicaid providers choose to have a separate provider such as PPGC for their \nreproductive health care because they are concerned about their privacy and because they fear \nbeing judged by other providers.     \n52.  In addition, many low-income patients have unique scheduling constraints \nbecause they are juggling inflexible work schedules, childcare obligations, transportation \nchallenges, and lack of childcare resources. To ensure that these patients have access to family \nplanning services, PPGC offers extended hours. In addition, PPGC spaces patient appointments \nso as to minimize wait times. PPGC also offers the birth control shot, the birth control implant \nand IUDs same-day, so that patients only need to make one trip to a PPGC health center to \nobtain their contraceptive method of choice. PPGC has either a full-time Spanish speaker on staff \nor translator services available to non-English speaking patients at all times. \n53.  Defendant’s actions will deprive all of PPGC’s Medicaid patients, including \nPlaintiffs Jane Doe #1, #2, and #3, of access to the high-quality, specialized care that PPGC \nprovides.   \n- 17 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 18 of 21\n \n54.  All three individual Plaintiffs rely on PPGC as the place they can turn to for \ncritical medical care and for prompt, efficient, and compassionate services. If PPGC is \neliminated from Medicaid, they will be prevented from receiving services from their provider of \nchoice, will have their health care interrupted, and may encounter difficulties finding alternative \ncare. \n55.  In FY 2014, PPGC’s reimbursements for providing these critical health services \nto low-income patients totaled nearly $690,000. Without this revenue, PPGC may be unable to \ncontinue to provide services in the same manner, and may be forced to lay off staff members, \nreduce hours, or close the Baton Rouge health center, as Medicaid reimbursements amount to \nover 60% of the revenue at that health center. If PPGC closes its Baton Rouge health center, it \nwould be very expensive – if not impossible – for PPGC to resume operations as they are today \nshould PPGC ever be allowed back as a Medicaid provider. Further, if PPGC closes its Baton \nRouge health center, this will affect not only the Medicaid patients at the health center, but all of \nthe patients who seek reproductive health care at that health center.    \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n56.  This lawsuit is properly maintained as a class action under Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2). \n57.  The class consists of all Louisiana Medicaid beneficiaries who obtain, or who \nseek to obtain, covered health care services at PPGC. \n58.  Although the size of the class is unknowable, as alleged in paragraph 13 above, \nPPGC provided covered health care services to over 5200 Medicaid patients in FY 2014.  \nTherefore the approximate size of the class is over 5200 individuals. \n- 18 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 19 of 21\n \n59.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 are adequate class \nrepresentatives because they, like other members of the class, are Louisiana residents and \nMedicaid patients who obtain their reproductive health care at PPGC health centers and desire to \ncontinue to do so. Unless Defendant is enjoined, class representatives and class members will \nsuffer the same injury and resulting harm:  they will be unable to obtain health care services at \nthe provider of their choice, PPGC. As a result, many of PPGC’s Medicaid patients, including \nPlaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane Doe #3 and other class members, who already \nhave few or no alternative options, will find it difficult or impossible to access the reproductive \nand other health care services they need. \n60.  Defendant’s action – terminating PPGC from the Medicaid program – applies \ngenerally to the class, such that both declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate for all \nmembers of the class. \n61.  Class members raise the same questions of law, including whether Defendant’s \ntermination of PPH Medicaid provider agreements violates the Medicaid freedom-of-choice \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23), such that, as a practical matter, adjudication of their claims \nwould be dispositive of the interests of the other class members. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM I – MEDICAID ACT (TITLE XIX OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT) \n62.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 61 above. \n63.  Defendant’s action violates Section 1396a(a)(23) of Title 42 of the United States \nCode by denying PPGC’s patients, including the Plaintiffs Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, and Jane \nDoe #3, the right to choose any willing, qualified healthcare provider in the Medicaid program. \n- 19 - \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 43    10/07/15   Page 20 of 21\n \nCLAIM II – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION \n64.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 61 above. \n65.  Defendant’s action violates Plaintiffs’ rights by singling them out for unfavorable \ntreatment without adequate justification. \nCLAIM III – FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS – PENALIZING \nCONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITY \n \n66.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 61 above. \n67.  Defendant’s action penalizes Plaintiffs for their constitutionally protected \nassociation with Planned Parenthood and/or abortion, without adequate justification. \n \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n68.  Order that this action be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B) and/or 23(b)(2); \n69.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendant’s action violates the Medicaid Act; \n70.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendant’s action violates the First and \nFourteenth Amendments; \n71.  Issue temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without bond, \nenjoining Defendant, her agents, employees, appointees, delegates, or successors from \nterminating, or threatening to terminate PPGC’s Medicaid provider agreements;  \n72.  Grant Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \nand \n73.

INTRODUCTION \n  Before the Court is the Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction filed by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (“PPGC” or “Planned \nParenthood”), appearing on behalf of both itself and three patients—Jane Does #1, 2, and 3 \n1 of 59 \n \n\n(“Individual Plaintiffs”)1 (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). (Doc. 45.) The arguments made in support \nof this motion appear in the Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (“Plaintiffs’ Renewed Memorandum”), \n(Doc. 46), and Memorandum Regarding Availability of State Remedy (“Plaintiffs’ Remedy \nMemorandum”), (Doc. 52). Plaintiffs’ request is opposed by Louisiana’s Department of Health \nand Hospitals (“DHH”), whose head, Secretary Kathy Kliebert, is being sued in her official \ncapacity and is therefore this matter’s named defendant (“Kliebert” or “Defendant”).2  \nDefendant’s arguments are put forth in the Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Lack of Subject \nMatter Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim (“Motion to Dismiss”), (Doc. 53), supported by \nthe attached Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Lack of Subject \nMatter Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim (“Defendant’s Memorandum”), (Doc. 53-1). \nAlthough no evidentiary hearing has yet been held, the matter has been thoroughly briefed and \nargued. The Court has carefully considered the pleadings and briefings to date, which are \ndiscussed in more detail below.3 The Court has also carefully considered the oral arguments and \n                                                      \n1 The Individual Plaintiffs “appear pseudonymously because of the private and personal nature of \nthe medical care that they receive at PPGC, and their desire not to have that information become \npublic in order for them to assert their legal rights.” (Doc. 1 at 5.) Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion \nseeking permission to use these pseudonyms was filed on August 25, 2015, (Doc. 5), and granted \non August 26, 2015, (Doc. 11). \n2 As permitted by precedent, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 152, 28 S. Ct. 441, 451, 52 L. Ed. \n714 (1908); accord Guillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-Gomez, 585 F.3d 508, 530 n.24 (1st Cir. \n2009), Plaintiffs sue for injunctive relief against Ms. Kliebert in her official capacity, (Doc. 1 at \n5). To wit, the true defendant here is Louisiana, not Ms. Kliebert or even DHH. See Will v. Mich. \nDep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989). In light of this \nduality, this Court will therefore alternate between feminine and third person pronouns \nthroughout this opinion.   \n3 These motions include the first Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction (“Motion for TRO”), (Doc. 4); first Memorandum of Law in Support of \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (“Plaintiffs’ \nMemorandum”), (Doc. 4-1); Defendant’s Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary \n2 of 59 \n \n\nrepresentations of counsel at hearings held on September 2, 2015 (“First Hearing”), and on \nOctober 16, 2015 (“Second Hearing”). \nFor the reasons more fully set forth below, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have met \ntheir burden for a temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo. The Court therefore \ntemporarily restrains Defendant for a period of fourteen (14) days from the date of the entry of \nthis order from suspending Medicaid payments to PPGC for services rendered to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, including but not limited to the Individual Plaintiffs. The temporary restraining \norder will remain in force for fourteen (14) days from the date of its entry unless, pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2),4 the Court, for good cause shown or with the \nagreement of the Parties, extends it. For the reasons set forth hereinafter, the Court declines to \nrequire security under Rule 65(c) from PPGC or the Individual Plaintiffs. \nThe Court defers ruling on the Plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction in order that \nthe parties be given an opportunity to perform discovery and present evidence and any additional \narguments at a preliminary injunction hearing. \nA telephone status conference is set for Monday, October 19, 2015, at 2:30 p.m., Central \nStandard Time (“CST”), for the purpose of discussing the extension of this order during \ndiscovery, setting a scheduling order for discovery, a hearing date for the preliminary injunction, \nand setting other appropriate cut-offs. The Plaintiffs will arrange for the conference call and \ncirculate the number to the Court and counsel by 1:00 p.m., CST, on October 19, 2015. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \nRestraining Order (“Defendant’s Opposition”), (Doc. 13); Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum of \nLaw in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (“Plaintiffs’ Reply \nMemorandum”), (Doc. 22); the Statement of Interest of the United States (“Statement of \nInterest”), (Doc. 24),; and Defendant’s Reply to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Statement of \nInterest (“Defendant’s Reply”), (Doc. 31). \n4 Any and all references to “Rule” or “Rules” in this order are to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure unless otherwise noted. \n3 of 59 \n \n\n \nII.  FACTUAL AND STATUTORY BACKGROUND \nA.  PARTIES \nDefendant is sued in her official capacity, as she is the head of DHH, (Doc. 1 ¶ 19 at 4; \nDoc. 53-1 at 3, 4). DHH administers this state’s Medicaid Program, a dual state-federal \nassistance program for families and individuals with low income and limited resources encoded \nin 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq. (“Medicaid Act”).5 (See also, e.g., Doc. 1 ¶ 20 at 5; Doc. 13-1 ¶¶ 1–4 at \n1–2; Doc. 43 ¶ 11 at 4; Doc. 53-1 at 1–4.) DHH does so by monitoring the allocation of federal-\nstate funds in Louisiana and submitting a state plan for medical assistance for review and \napproval to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), operating under a \ndelegation of authority from the Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services \n(“DHHS”). LA. R.S. §§ 46:437:2(B), 46:437.13;6 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a).7 In accordance with the \nLouisiana Medical Assistance Programs Integrity Law (“MAPIL”), Medicaid providers must \nsign a contract with DHH. LA. R.S. §§ 46:437:11, 46:437.13. (See also Doc. 13-1 ¶¶ 1–4 at 1–2.) \nDHH’s powers are circumscribed by statute while its official regulations appear in Title 50 of the \n                                                      \n5 Created by the addition of Title XIX to the Social Security Act, Social Security Amendments of \n1965, Pub. L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.), \nMedicaid “furnishes . . . medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of \naged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services,” 42 U.S.C. § 1396-1. Medicaid offers the “States a bargain: \nCongress provides federal funds in exchange for the States’ agreement to spend them in \naccordance with congressionally imposed conditions” and the statute’s implementing \nregulations. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1382, 191 L. Ed. 2d 471 \n(2015); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a; 42 C.F.R. § 430.15.   \n6 In this opinion, any reference to “Section 46:437.11” or “§ 46:437.11” is to this statutory \nsubsection unless otherwise noted. \n7 In this opinion, any reference to “Section 1396a(a)” or “§ 1396a(a)” is to this section of the \nMedicaid Act unless otherwise noted. \n4 of 59 \n \n\nLouisiana Administrative Code.8 (Doc. 53-1 at 2–4; see also Doc. 13-1 ¶ 3 at 1.) \nPPGC is a charitable organization, so classified under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(1). (Doc. 43 ¶ 10 at 4.) Headquartered in Houston, Texas, it \nmaintains its legal domicile in the Lone Star State, U.S. DEP’T OF THE TREASURY, INTERNAL \nREVENUE SERV., FORM 990 at 1 (2012), but is licensed to do business in Louisiana, (Doc. 43 ¶ 10 \nat 4; see also Doc. 1 ¶ 9 at 3.) At present, PPGC operates family planning centers and clinics in \nthe Houston area of Texas and in Louisiana. (Doc. 43 ¶¶ 10–11 at 4; see also Doc. 1 ¶ 10 at 3–4.) \nIts first center founded in 1984, PPGC’s two Louisiana clinics—the Baton Rouge Health Center \n(“BRHC”) and the New Orleans Health Center (“NOHC”)—participate in Louisiana’s Medicaid \nProgram, “providing medical services to low-income enrollees in both underserved \ncommunities.” (Doc. 1 ¶ 10 at 3–4; Doc. 43 ¶ 11 at 4.)  \nThe two facilities in Louisiana serve approximately 5200 patients. (See, e.g., Doc. 43 ¶ 13 \nat 4; Doc. 1 ¶ 40 at 11; Hr’g Tr. 8:23–24, Sept. 2, 2015.)  “Nearly 75%” of the visits to BRHC \nwere by patients enrolled in Medicaid; “[n]early 40%” of appointments at NOHC were with \nsimilarly classified individuals. (Doc. 3 ¶¶ 9–10 at 3–4; Doc. 43 ¶ 11 at 4.) The services offered \nby these two centers include “physical exams, contraception and contraceptive counseling, \nscreening for breast cancer, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, testing and treating for \ncertain sexually transmitted diseases . . ., pregnancy testing and counseling, and certain \nprocedures[,] including colposcopy.” (Doc. 3 ¶ 10 at 3–4; Doc. 43 ¶ 11 at 4.)  \nNeither BRHC nor NOHC performs abortions. (Doc. 1 ¶ 11 at 4; Doc. 43 ¶ 12 at 4.) \n  The Individual Plaintiffs rely upon Medicaid and receive their medical care from one of \nPPGC’s two facilities. (Doc. 4-3, 4-4, 4-5.) They wish to continue to obtain their reproductive \n                                                      \n8 In this opinion, any reference to “Title 50” is to this part of Louisiana’s administrative code. \n5 of 59 \n \n\ncare from PPGC. (Doc. 4-3 ¶¶ 6–7 at 2; Doc. 4-4 ¶ 8 at 2; Doc. 4-5 ¶ 6 at 2.) In this proceeding, \nthey are intended to represent the interests of many of PPGC’s other Louisiana Medicaid \npatients. (See, e.g., Doc. 49-1 at 10; Doc. 46 at 29–30.) \n \nB.  PRECIPITATING EVENTS \nIn July 2015, the Center for Medical Progress (“CMP”) released a series of edited videos \nwhich purported to document discussions regarding the acquisition of tissue samples between \nvarious Planned Parenthood affiliates’ officials and disguised actors. See Kevin Litten, Bobby \nJindal Announces Investigation into Planned Parenthood, THE TIMES-PICAYUNE, July 14, 2015; \nPlanned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s \nLargest Abortion Provider: Hearing Before the H. Comm on Judiciary, 114th Cong. 192–201 \n(2015) (Analysis of CMP Video by Fusion GPS). Thereafter, DHH exercised its “oversight over \nall health facilities in the state” and requested that PPGC “answer some simple questions about . . \n. [its] current operations and planned operations in Louisiana.” Letter from Kathy Kliebert, \nSec’y, Dep’t of Health & Hosps., State of Louisiana, to Melaney Linton, Pres., Planned \nParenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (July 15, 2015) (“Defendant’s July Letter”). DHH gave PPGC until \nJuly 24, 2015, to respond. Id.  \nOn July 24, 2015, PPGC did so. Letter from Melaney A. Linton, Pres. & CEO, Planned \nParenthood Gulf Coast, Inc., to Kathy Kliebert, Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & Hosps., State of \nLouisiana (July 24, 2015) (“PPGC’s July Letter”). This letter recaps PPGC’s history in Louisiana \nand denies the accusations made by CMP. Id. at 1. In it, Ms. Melaney A. Linton, PPGC’s \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and this letter’s author (“Ms. Linton”), clarifies that PPGC \n“does not offer abortion services” in Louisiana. Id. at 2.  PPGC acknowledged its link to Planned \n6 of 59 \n \n\nParenthood Center for Choice, Inc. (“PPCFC”), a “standalone corporation” and a department of \nPPGC until 2005, and described itself as an “affiliate” of Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica (“PPFA”). Id. PPGC then responded to each of Defendant’s questions, emphasizing that \nneither PPGC nor PPCFC provide abortion services in Louisiana. Id. at 2, 3, 5. To the questions \nof whether any PPGC “facilities, or any affiliates, subsidiaries, or associates thereof, sell or \ndonate any unborn baby organs or body parts”9 and “[h]ow many clinics operated by Planned \nParenthood Gulf Coast, or any affiliates, subsidiaries, or associates thereof, do business with . . . \nany . . . organizations in the business of selling or donating the remains of unborn babies,” PPGC \nanswered, “No.” Id. at 3. \nOn August 4, 2015, Defendant sent a second letter to PPGC. Letter from Kathy Kliebert, \nSec’y, Dep’t of Health & Hosps., State of Louisiana, to Melaney Linton, Pres., Planned \nParenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (Aug. 4, 2015) (“Defendant’s August Letter”). This missive zeroes \nin on three statements in PPGC’s July Letter: “PPFCFC does not have a fetal tissue donation \nprogram in Texas currently”; “PPCFC disposes of Pathological Waste through an entity that is \nlicensed for disposal of Special Waste from Health Care-Related Facilities”; and “No” to the \nquestion of whether “any Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast facilities, or any affiliates, subsidiaries, \nor associates thereof, sell or donate any unborn baby organs or body parts.” Id. Defendant \ncharacterized these answers as being “directly contradict[ed]” by another “recently released \nvideo made on April 9, 2015 at the Planned Parenthood facility in Houston, Texas, in which \nMelissa Farrell, Director of Research at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (PPGC), discusses \nexisting contracts for fetal tissue donation for the purpose of research.” Id.  \n                                                      \n9 Texas law apparently allows for the donation of the “products of spontaneous or induced \nhuman abortions, regardless of the period of gestation” to certain types of organizations and for \nparticular purposes. 25 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 1.132(40)(B), 1.133(a)(2)(B). In PPGC’s July \nLetter, it admitted that PPCFC disposes of such products in accordance with this law.  \n7 of 59 \n \n\nOn August 14, 2015, PPGC responded. Letter from Melaney A. Linton, Pres. & CEO, \nPlanned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc., to Kathy Kliebert, Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & Hosps., State \nof Louisiana (Aug. 14, 2015) (“PPGC’s August Letter”). (Doc. 46-1 at 63–64.) On behalf of both \nPPGC and PPCFC, Ms. Linton denied the existence of any contradiction, as “neither PPCFC nor \nPPGC currently has a fetal tissue donation program in Texas, and neither sells nor donates fetal \ntissue.” Id.  The letter then answers each question posed in Defendant’s August Letter. Id. at 64–\n65. \n \nC.  OVERVIEW OF THE FIRST AND SECOND TERMINATION ACTIONS \n1.  First Termination Letters, Kennedy Declarations, and CMS’ Statement of Interest \nOn August 3, 2015, Defendant notified PPGC of its intent to terminate the Agreements \npursuant to § 46:137.11(D)(1) via four letters (“First Termination Letters”). (Doc. 1 ¶ 30 at 8; \nDoc. 13 at 1.) As this statute required, DHH gave PPGC 30-days’ notice from the relevant \nletters’ receipt. (Doc. 13 at 1–2.) The letters gave no reason for DHH’s decision. (Doc. 1 ¶ 32 at \n8; see also Doc. 13 at 18, 20; Hr’g Tr. 14:6–8, Sept. 2, 2015.) In response, Plaintiffs filed their \nfirst complaint. (Doc. 1.)  \nOn that day, the Honorable Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana (“Jindal” or \n“Governor”), published a press release announcing the Agreements’ looming terminations. Press \nRelease, Hon. Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, Governor Jindal Announces the \nTermination of Medicaid Contract with Planned Parenthood (Aug. 3, 2015). This document \nstates: “Governor Jindal and DHH decided to give the required 30-day notice to terminate the \nPlanned Parenthood Medicaid provider contract because Planned Parenthood does not represent \nthe values of the State of Louisiana in regards to respecting human life.” Id. It continues: \n8 of 59 \n \n\n“Planned Parenthood does not represent the values of the people of Louisiana and shows a \nfundamental disrespect for human life,” and, “It has become clear that this is not an organization \nthat is worthy of receiving public assistance from the state.” Id. It refers to the possibility that \nPPGC “could be acting in violation of Louisiana law that states no person or group contracting \nwith the state or receiving governmental assistance shall require or recommend that any women \nhave an abortion.” Id. It concludes: “Pending the ongoing investigation, DHH reserves the right \nto amend the cancellation notice and terminate the provider agreement immediately should cause \nbe determined.” Id.  \nDuring the First Termination Action, among the many documents docketed by the \nParties, Defendant submitted a declaration by Ms. J. Ruth Kennedy (“Ms. Kennedy”), the \nMedicaid Director of DHH (“First Kennedy Declaration”), (Doc. 13-2 ¶¶ 1–5 at 1). (Doc. 13 at \n21–22.) The First Kennedy Declaration’s sixth paragraph states: “There are no Medicaid services \nthat only family planning clinics provide that could not be provided by other enrolled Medicaid \nproviders in the State of Louisiana, including in New Orleans and Baton Rouge.”  (Id. ¶ 6 at 2.) \nIts seventh further explains: “Any physician/physician extender and appropriately certified lab \ncan provide family planning and related services as long as it is within their license and scope.” \n(Id. ¶ 7, at 2.) Per the next paragraph, “[t]here are 1,146 actively enrolled Medicaid providers in \nRegion 1, covering the Greater New Orleans area, and 864 actively enrolled Medicaid providers \nin Region 2, covering the Greater Baton Rouge area, that can provide family planning and \nrelated services.” (Id. ¶ 8 at 2; see also Doc. 13 at 21.) A sorted provider list is attached; it \nincludes dermatologists, dentists, audiologists, cosmetic surgeons, and orthopedic surgeons. \n(Doc. 13-2 at 5–41; see also Hr’g Tr. 23:18–25:2, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \nThis First Kennedy Declaration also describes two telephonic conferences between CMS \n9 of 59 \n \n\nand DHH officials. According to Ms. Kennedy, on August 6, 2015, CMS advised DHH that the \nlatter “has the authority to withhold federal Medicaid dollars from Louisiana or seek injunctive \nrelief for the failure to comply with the Medicaid Act.” (Doc. 13-2 ¶ 10 at 2.) CMS and DHH \nheld a second conference call on August 21, 2015, in which CMS “advised” DHH “it would be \nsending a letter . . . confirming what CMS and HHS counsel had verbally conveyed to the \nDepartment during the August 6, 2015 conference call.” (Id. ¶ 11 at 2.) 10 \nOn August 31, 2015, CMS filed a Statement of Interest. (Doc. 24.) CMS did so due to \n“its strong interests in the proper operation of the Medicaid program . . . and in ensuring that the \n[s]tates administer their federally-subsidized Medicaid programs in a manner that is consistent \nwith the Medicaid statute.” (Id. at 2.) Basically, the Statement of Interest makes three broad \npoints.  \nFirst, because DHH has sought to terminate the Agreements “without providing any \njustification related to PPGC’s qualifications to provide medical services,” DHH’s proposed \ntermination will run afoul of § 1396a(a)(23).” (Id.; see also Doc. 22 at 2, 5, 6.) To read Section \n1396a(a)(23) differently would both “strip the Medicaid Act’s free choice of provider provision \nof all meaning.” (Doc. 24 at 3.) It would simultaneously “contravene clear congressional intent \nto give Medicaid beneficiaries the right to receive covered services from any qualified and \nwilling provider.” (Id.)  \nSecond, the Statement of Interest declares that DHH’s interpretation is “inconsistent” \n                                                      \n10 A second declaration submitted by Ms. Kennedy (“Second Kennedy Declaration”) gives a \nsomewhat different description of this call with CMS: “On the August 6, 2015, conference call . . \n. CMS and HHS told the Department that the any willing provider provisions under § \n1396a(a)(23) was not all inclusive, but illustrative and that the Department could have other \nreasons to remove a provider from its program that were unrelated to the provider’s ability to \nperform the Medicaid-covered services or properly bill for those services.” (Doc. 31-1 ¶ 6 at 2.) \nThe Second Kennedy Declaration continues: “CMS and HHS advised the Department that the \nvalidity of a state’s reasons for terminating a provider are made on a case by case basis.” (Id.) \n10 of 59 \n \n\nwith “the overwhelming weight of authority” and with CMS’ own “considered and longstanding \nviews.” (Id. at 3, 4, 19–22.) It describes DHH’s interpretation of Section 1396a(a)(23) as “not \neven a plausible reading of the statute,” “certainly not compelled by the text of the provision,” \nand likely to “undermine[] the provision’s purpose.” (Id. at 20–21.) Meanwhile, DHHS “has \nrepeatedly and consistently interpreted the qualified language in § 1396a(a)(23) to prohibit a \nState from denying access to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that provider to \nperform Medicaid-covered services or to properly bill for those services.” (Id. at 3–4.) \nFinally, the Statement of Interest affirms CMS’ view that “Medicaid beneficiaries” like \nthe Individual Plaintiffs “may enforce their statutory rights under § 1396a(a)(23) to their choice \nof a qualified provider through a private action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983” even after Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1382, 191 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2015) (“Armstrong”). (Id. \nat 2; see also Doc. 22 at 2–5.)  \n \n2.  First Hearing  \nOn September 2, 2015, the First Hearing was held. (Doc. 30.) \nDuring its course, the Parties’ positions on Section 1396a(a)(23) were clarified. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel explained: “We’re here because the termination violates the Jane Doe \nPlaintiffs’ . . . right to free choice of provider under Section 1396a(a)(23) of the Medicaid Act.” \n(Hr’g Tr. 4:10–12, Sept. 2, 2015.) Because PPGC is “competent to provide services,” it argued \nthat it was “qualified” within this subsection’s meaning. (Hr’g Tr. 5:20–23.) The claim before \nthe Court in the Motion for TRO was the Individual Plaintiffs’ claims under this provision of the \n“federal Medicaid act,” Plaintiffs’ counsel emphasized. (Hr’g Tr. 10:17–19, Sept. 2, 2015.) In \nPlaintiffs’’ view, whether or not PPGC held some administrative right was irrelevant, as the \n11 of 59 \n \n\nIndividual Plaintiffs always lacked such prerogatives. (Hr’g Tr. 10:15–19, Sept. 2, 2015.) On the \nIndividual Plaintiffs’ behalves, PPGC contested Defendant’s claim that Section 1396a(a)(23) \ncreates no private cause of action. (Hr’g Tr. 3:13–19, 6:23–7:4, Sept. 2, 2015.) Specifically, it \nargued that it “clearly fulfills the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Blessing [v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329, 117 S. Ct. 1353, 137 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1997) (“Blessing”),] and then in \nthe Gonzaga [University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 153 L. Ed. 2d 309, 122 S. Ct. 2268 (2002) \n(“Gonzaga”),] . . . cases.”11 (Hr’g Tr. 3:13–19, Sept. 2, 2015.) In other words, this subsection \nuses “rights creating language that unambiguously confers a right on Medicaid patients” and is \nnot “so vague and so amorphous that . . . [it would] strain judicial competence to enforce.” (Hr’g \nTr. 6:6–19, Sept. 2, 2015.) Plaintiffs sought to distinguish the more recent Armstrong from the \nbody of law spawned by these cases by maintaining that it not only dealt with “a completely \ndifferent section of the Medicaid Act,” one “without the same kind of rights creating language,” \nbut also lacked any Section 1983 claim. (Hr’g Tr. 6:24–7:4, 7:8–9, 7:1, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \nDefendant’s counsel countered that Section 1396a(a)(30) was substantially identical to \nSection 1396a(a)(23). These two subsections have “the exact same rights creating type of \nlanguage”; both “say what the state plan should provide.” (Hr’g Tr. 16:17–22, Sept. 2, 2015.) He \nthus urged the Court to adopt the reasoning of the plurality in Armstrong. (Hr’g Tr. 14:10–15:8, \n16:4–10, 16:13–14, 19:21–24, 22:24, 23:13 14, Sept. 2, 2015.) Defendant’s counsel also insisted \nthat Section 1396a(a)(23)’s “qualified” requirement was “a very vague standard.” (Hr’g Tr. \n18:1–2, Sept. 2, 2015.) Having proposed a number of denotations, (Doc. 13 at 8), Defendant’s \ncounsel based this conclusion on his “conversations with CMS and the supposed \n“unreasonabl[eness]” of CMS’ contrary interpretation, (Hr’g Tr. 16:24–17:10, Sept. 2, 2015). \n                                                      \n11 The relevant test is discussed later in this opinion. See infra Part V.  \n12 of 59 \n \n\nBecause “qualified” is inherently vague and ambiguous, Section 1396a(a)(23) cannot meet the \nBlessing test’s requirement that a right not be “so vague and amorphous as to be beyond the \ncompetence of the judiciary to enforce.”12 (See id.; see also Doc. 13 at 4, 8.) \nPPGC’s competence to provide the Medicaid services was also discussed. In response to \nthis Court’s question regarding whether DHH had yet “raised any suggestion or made any \nsuggestion that the reason for terminating the contract has anything to do with competency or the \nadequacy of the care that is given” by PPGC “to patients who get their care at those facilities,” \nPlaintiffs’ counsel answered, “No.” (Hr’g Tr. 3:19–24, Sept. 2, 2015.) When this Court posed the \nsame question to Defendant’s counsel—“There is no question . . . about the competency of these \ntwo facilities to provide Medicaid services and adequate care for the patients that they serve?”—\nDefendant’s counsel answered, “At this time, I would agree with that.” (Hr’g Tr. 11:12–16, Sept. \n2, 2015.) Additionally, Defendant’s counsel admitted that DHH’s definition of “qualified” was \n“circular”: PPGC was no longer a “qualified” provider because DHH had made it so by \nterminating their contract, a mechanism never before utilized in quite this manner. (Hr’g Tr. \n21:10–13, 22–25, Sept. 2, 2015.) He also acknowledged that the “current motive” or “the motive \nleading up to it” (the Agreements’ terminations) was CMP’s video tapes. (Hr’g Tr. 12:8–16, \nSept. 2, 2015.)  \nThe Parties finally contested the capacity of this state’s other Medicaid providers to \nabsorb PPGC’s patients. PPGC characterized the list included with the First Kennedy \nDeclaration as containing “numerous examples of[,] on their face[,] providers that would not \nprovide the care that Planned Parenthood provides, including dentists, radiologists, nursing \nhomes, [and other] places that are not going to do breast cancer screening or give out birth \n                                                      \n12 It is unclear whether Defendant was also articulating a Chevron deference argument on her \nown behalf or simply citing to Blessing. Her statements can be read in both ways. \n13 of 59 \n \n\ncontrol.” (Hr’g Tr. 8:18–22, Sept. 2, 2015.) PPGC maintained “that there’s no way that . . . other \nalternative providers have the capacity to absorb our patients.” (Hr’g Tr. 9:2–4, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \nDefendant’s counsel admitted that the Individual Plaintiffs would suffer “disruption of \nsome kind,” newly forced, “to get other doctors” and “seek out other places to get their health \ncare.” (Hr’g Tr. 13:6–12, Sept. 2, 2105.) Defendant’s counsel also explained the origins of the \nlist of providers referenced in the Defendant’s Opposition and the First Kennedy Declaration. \n(Hr’g Tr. 22:21–24:15, Sept. 2, 2015.) It reflected “typical billed” codes, and was the result of “a \ncode run” of providers that “can provide family planning services because they have billed for \nthem” by Defendant. (Hr’g Tr. 25:1–6, Sept. 2, 2015.) \n \n3.  Third Kennedy Declaration  \nAfter the First Hearing, Defendant sought permission to amend its opposition and \nsubstitute new papers “pursuant to . . . [its] duty to provide accurate information to the Court.” \n(Doc. 32 at 1.) Included in Defendant’s proposed amendments was a third declaration by \nKennedy (“Third Kennedy Declaration”). This Third Kennedy Declaration corrects the list of \nproviders included with the First Kennedy Declaration, explaining: “I[, Ms. Kennedy,] ordered a \ncomprehensive review of this exhibit and have since discovered that nursing facilities and \ndentists should not have been included.” (Doc. 34-2 ¶ 8a at 2; see also Doc. 34 at 2.) It adds: \n“The other provider types included in Exhibit 1 are appropriate due to what they are allowed to \ndo under the scope of their license.” (Doc. 34-2 ¶ 8a at 2; see also Doc. 34 at 2.) It gives two \nother examples: “Anesthesiologists can be reimbursed for their role in sterilization procedures \nand radiologists can be reimbursed for reading ultrasounds, etc. related to reproductive/women’s \nhealth issues.” (Id.)  \n14 of 59 \n \n\nThis same “further review of the information in [the First Kennedy Declaration] also \nrevealed a more precise description of Medicaid providers in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge \nareas other than PPGC who are available to patients seeking family planning and related \nservices.” (Doc. 34 at 2.) Defendant’s staff had “gather[ed] information from available Medicaid \nproviders in proximity to the two Planned Parenthood locations in New Orleans and Baton \nRouge, Louisiana.” (Doc. 34-2 ¶ 8b at 2.) As a result of this additional inquiry, Ms. Kennedy had \ndecided to cull the list of relevant providers from over one-thousand (1,000) to less than fifty \n(50), (Compare Doc. 13-2 ¶ 8 at 2, with Doc 34-2 at 5–6). \n \n4.  Abandonment of First Termination Action and Commencement of the Second \nTermination Action \nOn September 9, 2015, Defendant chose to “rescind” the Agreements’ at-will \ntermination.” (Doc. 38 at 2.) On September 14, 2015, Defendant sent four rescission letters, one \nfor each Agreement, to PPGC. (Doc. 38 at 4, 6, 8, 10.) On September 15, 2015, Defendant \nfollowed these rescission letters with four new termination letters (“Second Termination \nLetters”). (Doc. 39 at 1.) While the First Termination Letters had invoked Section \n46:437.11(D)(1), (Doc. 38 at 4, 6, 8, 10), the Second termination Letters rely on Section \n46:437.11(D)(2), (Doc. 39-1 at 2, 5, 8, 11). This subsection of MAPIL allows for “for cause” \ntermination of a provider agreement. LA. R.S. §§ 46:437:11(D)(2). \nThe Second Termination Letters specify several different grounds. The first is a \nsettlement in Reynolds v. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (“Reynolds Settlement”), Case \nNumber 9:09-cv-124-RC, a lawsuit pursuant to the False Claims Act (“FCA”) in the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas between PPGC and an FCA plaintiff. (Doc. 39-1 at 2, 5, 8, 11.) According to \n15 of 59 \n \n\nthe letters, two violations of Title 50 were based on this settlement. First, simply by settling this \naction, PPGC had violated Title 50. (Id.) Second, since DHHS had not been informed “within ten \n(10) working days of when the provider knew or should have known of the violation,” another \nviolation of Title 50 had occurred. (Id.)  \nA second (or third) ground consisted of “provider audits and federal false claims cases \nagainst PPFA . . . affiliates.” (Id.) A second Texas case, Carroll v. Planned Parenthood Gulf \nCoast (“Carroll”), Case Number 4:12-cv-03505, fell within this description. According to the \nletters, in Carroll, “the presiding judge found that the information already provided allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that Planned Parenthood knowingly filed false claims.” \n(Id.; see also Hr’g Tr. 35:1–16, Oct. 16, 2015.)  \nThe third basis for termination was Defendant’s determination that PPGC’s July and \nAugust Letters, see supra Part II.B, contained “misrepresentations” upon Defendant’s further \nreview of CMP’s videos. (Doc. 39-1 at 3, 6, 9, 12.)13 Other grounds are referenced in these \nletters, including audits, noncompliance with various Title 50 conditions, and more. (Id.)  \nAfter receiving these Second Termination Letters, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to \namend the complaint on October 7, 2015, (Doc. 41), a request granted on that same day, (Doc. \n42). Already attached to this motion, (Doc. 41-1), the new amended complaint (“Amended \n                                                      \n13 Other grounds were hinted at in the Second Termination Letters. For example, Defendant \nmaintained that, as Section 46:437.11(D)(2) allows for termination “immediately and without \nnotice if a health care provider is the subject of a sanction or of a criminal, civil, or departmental \nproceeding,” it had determined “that PPGC currently fits within this statute due to the \ninvestigations of PPGC by both DHH and the Louisiana Office of Inspector General.” (Doc. \n39-1 at 3, 6, 9, 12.) And finally, pursuant to Section 46:437.14(A)(l0) and (12), Defendant \nclaimed that it “may move to revoke enrollment if a provider is found in violation of licensing \nor certification conditions or professional standards relating to the licensure or certification of \nhealth care providers or the required quality of goods, services, or supplies provided” as well \nas “for failure to meet any condition of enrollment.” (Id.) PPGC, however, has counted three, \nand Defendant has not yet contradicted this grouping in writing or during the Second Hearing. \n16 of 59 \n \n\nComplaint”) followed on October 7, 2015, (Doc. 43).14 Two days later, Plaintiffs filed the \nRenewed Motion for TRO, (Doc. 45), and the Renewed Memorandum, (Doc. 46). \nSimultaneously, Plaintiffs filed the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Limited Expedited Written Discovery, \n(Doc. 47), and Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Limited Expedited \nDiscovery, (Doc. 48). On October 14, 2015, Plaintiffs docketed the Memorandum Regarding \nAvailability of State Remedy. (Doc. 52 at 1.) Defendant filed the Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 53), \nand Defendant’s Memorandum on October 14, 2015, (Doc. 53-1). On October 16, 2015, this \nCourt held the Second Hearing. The Court orally denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Limited \nExpedited Written Discovery and took the remaining motions under advisement at the Second \nHearing’s conclusion. Late that day, Plaintiffs filed a copy of the Reynolds Settlement. (Doc. 54.)  \n  .   \nD.  PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Arguments \nIn their Motion for TRO and Renewed Motion for TRO, Plaintiffs have made four \nrelevant arguments to why they are entitled to a temporary restraining order.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs first contend that they will likely prove that Defendant’s efforts violate \nfederal statutory and constitutional law. They begin by arguing that Defendant’s latest \ntermination, like the first, is prohibited by the plain meaning of Section 1396a(a)(23) and are \nthus in violation of controlling federal law. (Doc. 46 at 17–22; see also Doc. 4-1 at 16.) This \nFreedom-of-Choice Provision bars Defendant from excluding PPGC from Medicaid for a reason \n                                                      \n14 While many paragraphs in the Amended Complaint mirror exactly those in the First \nComplaint, (Doc. 4 ¶¶ 1, 2, 3, 4, 9–14, 18–33, 35, 37–49, with Doc. 43 ¶¶ 1, 2, 3, 5, 10–15, 19–\n33, 41, 43–55), or underwent slight alteration (i.e. dates), (Doc. 4 ¶ 5, with Doc. 43 ¶ 6), \nPlaintiffs refined others so as to reflect this case’s latest posture and developments, (Doc. 43 ¶¶  \n4, 6, 35–36), and class action claims, (Doc. 43 ¶¶ 16–19, 56–61, 68). \n17 of 59 \n \n\nunrelated to its fitness to provide medical services. (Doc. 46 at 18, 21, 22; Doc. 4-1 at 11.) \nBecause “Defendant has nowhere suggested that PPGC is not ‘qualified to perform’ the \nMedicaid services it provides,” its action cannot be cohered with this subsection’s language and \npurpose. (Doc. 4-1 at 15, 16.)  \nPlaintiffs concurrently maintain that this particular subsection, in contrast with \n1396a(a)(30), which was the focus in Armstrong, does afford Plaintiffs with a right enforceable \nvia Section 1983. (Doc. 46; Doc. 4-1.) Throughout their discussion, Plaintiffs rely on many of \nthe same cases, including Planned Parenthood Ariz. Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(“Betlach”); Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 699 F.3d \n962 (7th Cir. 2012) (“Indiana”); and Women’s Hospital Foundation v. Townsend, No. 07-711-\nJJB-DLD, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52549, 2008 WL 2743284 (M.D. La. July 10, 2008).  \nIn the Renewed Memorandum, Plaintiffs do abandon their procedural due process claim, \n(Hr’g Tr. 14:17–24, Oct. 16, 2015; compare Doc. 43 ¶¶ 62–67, with Doc. 1 ¶¶ 56–57), but \nreiterate their two constitutional ones, (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 52–55 at 14; Doc. 43 ¶¶ 64–67 at 20). Now, \nPlaintiffs maintain that Defendant, without sufficient justification, is singling them out for \nunfavorable treatment, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution’s Fourteenth \nAmendment, U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 2, and is attempting to penalize them for freely \nassociating with other related Planned Parenthood entities, thereby contravening the freedom of \nassociation guaranteed by the First Amendment, see U.S. CONST. amends. I, IX, § 2; NAACP v. \nAla. ex. rel Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460, 78 S. Ct. 1163, 1498, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1488 (1958). (See, \ne.g., Doc. 46 at 22.) \nSecond, Plaintiffs insist that the harm to both PPGC and the Individual Plaintiffs will be \nirreparable if the termination comes to pass. The Individual Plaintiffs will be deprived of their \n18 of 59 \n \n\nability to exercise their federal statutory rights, and will suffer a disruption of their relationship \nwith a preferred (and competent) provider and a reduction of their access to family planning \nservices. (Doc. 46 at 26; see also Doc. 4-1 at 8–9, 17.) PPGC, in turn, will find its budget sharply \ncurtailed, possibly forcing it to close down BRHC permanently, and will never be able to recover \nany monetary damages from DHH. (Doc. 46 at 27 & n.19; see also Doc. 4-1 at 17–18, 18 n.13.) \nThird, Plaintiffs argue that the balance of harms favors them. “While PPGC and its \npatients will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, the state will suffer no injury \nat all.” (Doc. 46 at 27; see also Doc. 4-1 at 18.) The reason, Plaintiffs contend, is because an \ninjunction will do no more than “require the state to maintain the funding [it] ha[s] provided to \nPlaintiff[] for years.” (Doc. 46 at 27 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original); \nsee also Doc. 4-1 at 18.) \nFinally, Plaintiffs assert that the public interest favors their injunctive request. The public \nhas a “strong” interest “in ensuring continued public access to crucial health services, especially \nfor the many underserved and low-income patients PPGC serves.” (Doc. 46 at 28; see also Doc. \n4-1 at 18.) Such an interest is especially “acute with respect to the neediest . . . who depend on \npublicly funded programs.” (Doc. 46 at 28; see also Doc. 4-1 at 19.) \nAs to Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs’ failure to pursue a state administrative appeal \nof the termination renders the controversy not ripe and Plaintiffs without standing, Plaintiffs \nargue that PPGC is not required to pursue the state administrative appeal but can instead pursue \nits rights under Section 1983. (Doc. 52 at 2–3; see also Hr’g Tr. 6:6–10, Sept. 2, 2015.) The \nIndividual Plaintiffs argue they have no right to administratively appeal and couldn’t do so if \nthey wanted to. (Doc. 52 at 3; see also Hr’g Tr. 10:9–10, Sept. 2, 2015.) \n \n19 of 59 \n \n\n2.  Defendant’s Arguments \nInvoking Rule 12(b)(1) and (6), Defendant makes essentially three arguments.  \nFirst, Defendant contends that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this \ndispute because this case is not ripe and Plaintiffs lack prudential and constitutional standing. \n(Doc. 53-1 at 6–9.) Defendant insists on this case’s unripe state for three reasons: (1) “Plaintiffs \nhave suffered no injury”; (2) “further procedural and factual development is required”; and (3) \nno hardship can be shown. (Id. at 6, 8.) As support for his first and second reason, Defendant \nargues that because PPGC may appeal this termination, during which the Agreements will \nremain enforce in accordance with Defendant’s wishes, this “suspensive” review process leaves \nall Plaintiffs without a cognizable injury. (Id. at 6–7 (injury), 8 (hardship), 9 (injury for standing \npurposes).) Defendant’s Memorandum further explains the reasons for a lack of ripeness and \nstanding as such: “In the instant matter, PPGC is asserting a due process violation while \nsimultaneously hinting that it may voluntarily elect not to participate in the process about which \nit complains.” (Id. at 8.) \nSecond, Defendant argues for abstention, emphasizing these doctrines’ purpose of \n“preserv[ing] the balance between state and federal sovereignty.”  (Id. at 10.) Defendant cites to \nfour abstention doctrine—Pullman, Younger, Burford, and Colorado River—and foregoes one—\nThibodaux. (Id. at 10–12.) When cumulatively considered, these doctrine’s “animating” \nprinciples have a “clear application” to this proceeding: “Plaintiffs should not be indulged in \ntheir attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court in the absence of State agency action against \nthem that would delineate . . . [Defendant’s] interpretation of the challenged provision, and in the \npresence of adequate state administrative and judicial procedures if that eventuality were to \noccur.” (Id. at 12.) \n20 of 59 \n \n\nThird, Defendant insists Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits for four reasons. First, \n“Plaintiffs have no property interest in the Medicaid provider contracts.” (Id. at 13; see also Doc \n13 at 14–18.) Second, even if Plaintiffs have a property interest, Louisiana’s administrative \nappellate process “complies with the mandates of due process” and federal regulation, for “the \nessence of due process is notice plus an opportunity to be heard.” (Doc. 53-1 at 17.) Third, \nDefendant insists that Section 1396a(a)(23) does not afford the Individual Plaintiffs any private \ncause of action, (Compare Doc. 53-1 at 18–22, with Doc. 13 at 4–9), and is sufficiently \nambiguous to permit Defendant to exercise her discretion to define “qualified” in accordance \nwith her construction of state law, (Doc. 53-1 at 21; see also Doc. 4 at 8). Defendant thus insists \nthat her authority under Section 45:437.11(D)(2) is not limited “to determining whether a \nprovider is competent to provide . . . services.” (Doc. 53-1 at 22.) She can, instead, invoke any \nground derived from state law to determine whether a provider is “competent” or not. (Doc. 53-1 \nat 23–24.)  \n \nIV.  RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY ISSUES: JURISDICTION AND \nABSTENTION  \nA.   RIPENESS \n1.  Defendant’s Arguments  \nDefendant provides the correct standard by which to measure its argument that this case \nis not ripe: for the purposes of this doctrine, “a court must evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues \nfor judicial resolution, and (2) the potential hardship to the parties by declining court \nconsideration,” (Doc. 53-1 at 6 (quoting Lopez v. City of Houston, 617 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir. \n2010)). Defendant maintains the case is not ripe for three reasons: (1) “Plaintiffs have suffered \n21 of 59 \n \n\nno injury”; (2) “[F]urther procedural and factual development is required, as demonstrated by \nPlaintiffs’ due process claim . . .and their request to conduct expedited discovery in this \nproceeding”; and (3) no hardship exists because “the review process is suspensive,” a third point \nsubstantively identical to its first (Doc. 53-1 at 6, 8). At the Second Hearing, her counsel stressed \none aspect of the Constitution’s ripeness requirement: “There is absolutely no injury”; “[T]here \nis absolutely no harm to them at all”; “[T]hey have no injury”; and, “There’s no concrete injury \nto any of the Planned Parenthood or to any of the Jane Doe Plaintiffs because, again, there \nsimply is no injury.” (Hr’g Tr. 3:21–23, 4:18–22, 7:24–8:1, Oct. 16, 2015.)  \n \n2.  Analysis   \nMostly, albeit not entirely, drawn from Article III, U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2; Reno v. \nCatholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 57 n. 18, 113 S. Ct. 2485, 2495 n.18, 125 L. Ed. 2d 38 \n(1993), ripeness is “a justiciability doctrine designed ‘to prevent the courts, through avoidance of \npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over \nadministrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an \nadministrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the \nchallenging parties,” Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 807–08, \n123 S. Ct. 2026, 2030, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (2003). It generally incorporates, as Defendant rightly \nnotes, (Doc. 53-1 at 6), consideration of two discrete elements: “(1) the fitness of the issues for \njudicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.” Nat’l \nPark Hospitality Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808 (citing to Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149, \n87 S. Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967) (“Abbott Labs.”)). For five reasons, Defendant’s \nargument that no ripeness exists fails. \n22 of 59 \n \n\nThe primary reason is well-rooted in ripeness jurisprudence:  “In evaluating ripeness, the \ncentral focus is on whether the case involves uncertain or contingent future events that may not \noccur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” Tarrant Reg’l Water Dist. v. Herrmann, \n656 F.3d 1222, 1250 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d \n1082, 1097 (10th Cir. 2006)). However, an injury need not be actual in a physical sense for a \nplaintiff’s case to cross the ripeness threshold. Rather, if a plaintiff is “immediately in danger of \nsustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged official conduct,” ripeness will often \nbe found. Pearson v. Holder, 624 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 2010); see also Whole Woman’s Health \nv. Cole, 790 F.3d 563, 582 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting id.). It is enough that “an injury that has not \nyet occurred is sufficiently likely to happen to justify judicial intervention” or “when the court \nwould be in no better position to adjudicate the issues in the future than it is now.” Pearson, 624 \nF.3d at 684.  \nThus, “ripeness is seldom an obstacle to a pre-enforcement challenge . . .  where the \nplaintiff faces a credible threat of enforcement”; in such cases, the plaintiff is typically “not . . . \nrequired to await and undergo [enforcement] as the sole means of seeking relief.” Consumer \nData Indus. Ass’n v. King, 678 F.3d 898, 907 (10th Cir. 2012); see also, e.g., Barrick Goldstrike \nMines, Inc. v. Browner, 215 F.3d 45, 49 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding that declaratory judgment \naction was ripe for judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act where plaintiff’s \n“only alternative to obtaining judicial review now is to violate EPA’s directives . . . and then \ndefend an enforcement proceeding on the grounds it raises here”). Indeed, as the Court has \nrecently written, an agency’s prospective, not yet consummated, action will be found ripe for \nreview if “the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions . . .  by \nsome concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant’s situation in a fashion that harms \n23 of 59 \n \n\nor threatens to harm him.” Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808.  \nUnder this precedent, Defendant’s Second Termination Letters amount to certain threats, \nclassifiable as “concrete action[s]” that “threaten to harm” Plaintiffs. Here, the existing record \namply supports this determination: Defendant has made it clear she intends to terminate the \nMedicaid provider agreements, the only thing changing since the initial termination letters being \nthe reason. In effect, by her own actions, she has triggered the application of a general rule, \nfederal courts having “consistently found a case or controversy in suits between state officials \ncharged with enforcing a law and private parties potentially subject to enforcement,” Consumer \nData Indus. Ass’n, 678 F.3d at 905. A case’s ripeness simply does not depend on whether the \ninjury has already been inflicted, and “specific threat[s] of enforcement” like those the Defendant \nhas already made are more than enough to satisfy this constitutional minimum. Reynolds v. City \nof Valley Park, No. 4:06CV01487 ERW, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83210, at *25, 2006 WL \n3331082, at *6 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 15, 2006); see also, e.g., Cass Cnty. v. United States, 570 F.2d \n737 (8th Cir. 1978) (“Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all \nthe circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse \nlegal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory \njudgment.”). In so holding, then, this Court does no more than adhere to a higher tribunal’s \nadvisement: “One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain \npreventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending that is enough.” Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. \nState Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 201, 103 S. Ct. 1713, 1721, 75 \nL. Ed. 2d 752 (1983) (quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553, 593, 43 S. Ct. 658, \n663, 67 L. Ed. 1117 (1923)). The Agreements’ termination has been threatened repeatedly since \nAugust 2015, and Defendant has now only swapped no reason for three. (Compare Doc. 13, with \n24 of 59 \n \n\nDoc. 39-1.) Based on these circumstances and well-settled law, Plaintiffs’ threatened injury is \nclear. \nTwo admissions by Defendant’s counsel at the Second Hearing strengthen this \nconclusion. First, though only indirectly, he himself conceded that a kind of “harm” may have \nalready come to pass: in arguing why no cognizable injury had yet transpired, he emphasized \npossible contingencies: “I think that one of the contingencies that could happen is their rights \ncould be restored . . . . [The] suspension could be lifted.” (Hr’g Tr. 16:19–23, Oct. 16, 2015 \n(emphasis added).) This highlighted language implies that Plaintiffs’ rights have already been \ncurtailed and a suspension already imposed;15 either would be a sufficiently credible threat to \nrender this case ripe. Indeed, Defendant’s counsel later confirmed these statements’ implication. \nTo the Court’s question—“the Secretary has terminated the contract, but . . . has said that \ntermination is suspended pending appeal?”—he answered: “That’s correct.” (Hr’g Tr. 18:13–16, \nOct. 16, 2015; see also Doc. 53-1 at 9–10.) Thus, even if the termination is suspended, it will \noccur automatically but for this Court’s intervention. That its practical enforcement may be \nstayed does not change the key fact: using Pearson’s terms, Plaintiffs are in “danger of \nsustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged official conduct,” Pearson, 624 F.3d \nat 684. A final exchange cinches this conclusion. When Plaintiffs’ counsel revealed PPGC’s \nintent “to proceed in federal court” and not “to pursue the administrative remedy,” and the Court \nobserved, “Well, then it seems to me you’ve got a very, very ripe situation,” and asked \nDefendant’s counsel, “Am I missing something on that?” he answered, “No.” (Hr’g Tr. 19:6–20, \nOct. 16, 2015.)  \nEqually worthy of note, Defendant quotes but dismisses the import of a principle \n                                                      \n15 For something to be “restored” it must first have been taken, and for something to be “lifted” it \nmust first have been imposed. \n25 of 59 \n \n\nembedded in ripeness case law: “[A] case is generally ripe if any remaining questions are purely \nlegal ones,” Lopez, 617 F.3d at 341. As any fair reading of the complaint and motions filed in \nthis case indicates, the issue involves at least one, if not three, “purely . . . legal question[s]”; the \nprecise meaning of Section 1396a(a)(23) and the applicability of two constitutional clauses. (See, \ne.g., Doc. 1 at 1; Doc. 43 at 1.) In Abbott Labs., the seminal case in ripeness jurisprudence, the \nCourt concluded that the issues presented were appropriate for judicial resolution because the \nfacial challenge to the regulation involved the purely legal question of whether the regulation at \nissue exceeded the scope permitted by the underlying statute. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149. \nThis kind of challenge, found ripe in Abbott Labs., resembles the challenge that PPGC now \nmakes, with “consideration of the underlying legal issues” not “necessarily be[ing] facilitated if \nthey were raised in the context of a specific attempt to [apply and/or] enforce the regulations,” \nGardner v. Toilet Goods Ass’n, 387 U.S. 158, 171, 87 S. Ct. 1526, 1528, 18 L. Ed. 2d 704 \n(1967). “Predominantly legal questions” like a statute’s plain meaning are nearly always ripe. \nFla. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1164 (11th Cir. 2008); see also, e.g., \nLeClerc v. Webb, 419 F.3d 405, 414 (5th Cir. 2005); Digital Props., Inc. v. City of Plantation, \n121 F.3d 586, 589 (11th Cir. 1997). Plaintiffs’ present action presents precisely such questions.  \nThird, this Court finds Defendant’s application of the ripeness doctrine to be predicated \non a fundamental misunderstanding of these claims. In its final paragraph, Defendant’s \nMemorandum summarizes her view of Plaintiffs’ case: “In the instant matter, PPGC is asserting \na due process violation while simultaneously hinting that it may voluntarily elect not to \nparticipate in the process about which it complains.” (Doc. 53-1 at 8 (emphasis in original).) At \nthe Second Hearing, Defendant again reduces all of Plaintiffs’ claims to “a disguised due process \nchallenge.” (Hr’g Tr. 7:2–3, Oct. 16, 2015.) This assertion, however, ignores the explicit \n26 of 59 \n \n\nconstitutional and federal statutory bases of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, (see, e.g., Doc. 1 at \n1; Doc. 43 at 1), as Plaintiffs’ counsel expressly declared at the Second Hearing, (Hr’g Tr. \n14:17–24, Oct. 16, 2015). Consequently, the fact that Defendant dismisses the Individual \nPlaintiffs’ claims as “derivative” of PPGC’s, (Hr’g Tr. 8:4–10, Oct. 16, 2015) based wholly on \ncases explicating the requirements of procedural due process, (Doc. 53-1 at 13 (citing Plaza \nHealth Labs., Inc. v. Perales, 878 F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1989); Kelly Kare, Ltd. v. O’Rourke, 930 \nF.2d 170, 177 (2d Cir. 1991); and Senape v. Constantino, 936 F.2d 687 (2d Cir. 1991)); see also \nDoc. 13 at 16–17), cannot be ignored. When statutes like Section 1396a(a)(23) provide the case’s \ngravamen and no procedural due process claim is made, Defendant’s cases cannot be deemed \nlegally relevant. See Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc., 699 F.3d at 977 (rejecting the relevance \nof Kelly Kare and similar cases because “[t]his is not a due-process case”). Indeed, this \nconclusion seems especially appropriate when at least one of the cases cited by Defendant \nconceded that “there may be a property interest in a provider’s status as a qualified health-care \nprovider,”16 Kelly Kare, 930 F.2d at 176. (See Doc. 53-1 at 14–15.) \nFourth, the jurisprudence construing the hardship requirement is clear. The Fifth Circuit \n“has found hardship to inhere in legal harms, such as the harmful creation of legal rights or \nobligations; practical harms on the interests advanced by the party seeking relief; and the harm of \nbeing force[d] . . . to modify [one’s] behavior in order to avoid future adverse consequence.” \nChoice Inc. v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 715 (5th Cir. 2012) (alteration in original) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Discrete formulations, a plaintiff can meet the ripeness doctrine’s \nhardship prong by satisfying just one. Id. As the Court’s own decisions clarify, the first test has \n                                                      \n16 In Kelly Kare, moreover, the Second Circuit actually noted that its case law was not \nnecessarily consistent, contrasting Plaza Health, upon which Defendant relies, with a second \ncase, which seemingly holds the opposite. Kelly Kare, 930 F.2d at 175. \n27 of 59 \n \n\nbeen met when an agency proposes to “grant, withhold, or modify any formal legal license, \npower or authority,” Ohio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733, 118 S. Ct. 1665, \n1670, 140 L. Ed. 2d 921 (1988), and the second is fulfilled when “the impact of the \nadministrative action could be said to be felt immediately by those subject to it in conducting \ntheir day-to-day affairs,” Gardner, 387 U.S. at 164. Quite simply, Defendant’s conduct here \ncannot be described in any different terms, while Defendant has effectively swapped the familiar \nripeness test (“imminent injury”) with administrative law’s exhaustion one (“final decision”). See \nLegacy Community Health Servs., Inc. v. Janek, No. 4:15-CV-25, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8610, \nat *12–13, 2015 WL 4064270, at *5 (S.D Tex. July 2, 2015) (finding case ripe even when a party \ndid not allege any actual instance of enforcement). Since a threat suffices, to conclude differently \nwould be to find no case ripe when an administrative option remains for one of many plaintiffs \nand a statutory right and remedy exists for all, a result contrary to the many opinions that have \nconfronted claims under Section 1396a(a)(23). See infra Part V;  see also, e.g., Sabree v. \nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 193 & n.29 (3d Cir. 2004) (“A] plaintiff's ability to invoke § 1983 \ncannot be defeated simply by the availability of administrative mechanisms to protect the \nplaintiff's interests.”); cf. Cathedral Rock of N. Coll. Hill, Inc. v. Shalala, 223 F.3d 354, 366 (6th \nCir. 2000) (noting that “the Medicaid Act does not have a provision . . . incorporating § 405(h) \nand its exclusive jurisdiction limitation to channel legal challenges through the administrative \nprocedures set forth”). \nFinally, Defendant oversells the significance of the Plaintiffs’ own motion to expedite \ndiscovery, (Doc. 47). According to Defendant, this request attests to the need for factual \ndevelopment that proves ripeness’ absence, (Doc. 53-1 at 6); Plaintiff disagrees, (Hr’g Tr. 41:8–\n19, Oct. 16, 2015). While the motion makes clear that such discovery is being sought for \n28 of 59 \n \n\npurposes of strengthening Plaintiffs’ animus allegations, (Doc. 48 at 2), the ripeness doctrine \ndemands no more than a threatened injury to the plaintiff, not a complete evidentiary record. \nIndeed, Defendant’s logic would render any federal case unripe if discovery remains essential, \nwithout any regard for the reason, a position sufficiently farcical to underscore the weakness of \nthis argument. Even if Plaintiffs’ first amendment claims require, like almost all claims often do, \nmore discovery, that possibility says nothing about the ripeness of their two other claims. In the \nvast majority of cases in which ripeness is not found, “additional factual development” is \nabsolutely “necessary,” a feature wholly absent from a proceeding focused on the outer \nparameters of a statute’s meaning. See, e.g., Baldwin v. Daniels, 250 F.3d 943, 946 (5th Cir. \n2001); John Corp. v. City of Houston, 214 F.3d 573, 586 (5th Cir. 2000).17  \nFor all these reasons, this Court finds this case ripe for its review, joining the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas in Planned Parenthood Ark. & E. Okla. v. Selig, No. 15-cv-00566-KGB \n(“Selig”), (Doc. 46-9), and the District of Utah in Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. \nHerbert, No. 15-cv-693-CW (“Herbert”), (Doc. 46-10). In concurring with these courts, this \nCourt finds it significant that Defendant has yet to adequately address either case. Rather, in \nattempting to distinguish only the former, Defendant offered one reason: “It’s my understanding \nthat [the right to an administrative appeal] was not a suspensive process,” while “[t]his is a fully \nsuspensive process,” (Hr’g Tr. 9:6–7, Oct. 16, 2015). This lone purported difference, however, is \nincorrect, as Arkansas law, like Louisiana law, suspends a termination’s enforcement upon a \nprovider’s proper appeal. See ARKANSAS MEDICAID PROVIDER MANUAL 161.500.  \n \n                                                      \n17 Even in procedural due process cases, ripeness is not an issue when a facial attack is made. \nSee, e.g., Cornell Cos. v. Borough of New Morgan, 512 F. Supp. 2d 238, 256 (E.D. Pa. 2007).  \n29 of 59 \n \n\nB.   STANDING \n1.  Defendant’s Arguments  \nIn contesting standing, Defendant insists PPGC lacks it in full. In her words, “Plaintiffs \nhave not suffered nor are they about to suffer ‘an injury in fact’ which is concrete and \nparticularized, or actual or imminent.” (Doc. 53-1 at 9.) At the Second Hearing, this point was \nemphasized in the following terms: “There’s no concrete injury to . . . Planned Parenthood or to \nany of the Jane Doe Plaintiffs because, again, there simply is no injury.” (Hr’g Tr. 16:14–18, \nOct. 16, 2015.)  \n \n2.  Analysis   \nClosely related to the ripeness inquiry, Choice Inc. v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 715 (5th \nCir. 2012), standing implicates a slightly different series of concerns. Generally, ripeness is \nconcerned with “when an action may be brought,” but “standing focuses on who may bring a ripe \naction.” Jt. Stock Soc’y v. UDV N. Am., Inc., 266 F.3d 164, 174 (3d Cir. 2001) (emphasis added). \nThe “irreducible [constitutional] minimum” of standing contains three elements”: “(1) an injury-\nin-fact,” defined as “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized” and “(b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” that is (2) fairly \ntraceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct” and that is (3) likely to be redressed by \nthe requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136, \n119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). Notably “[s]tanding and ripeness are closely related doctrines that \noverlap most notably in the shared requirement that the plaintiff’s injury be imminent rather than \nconjectural or hypothetical.” New York Civil Liberties Union v. Grandeau, 528 F.3d 122, 130 n.8 \n(2d Cir. 2008).  \n30 of 59 \n \n\nIndeed, “in measuring whether the litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete \nrather than speculative and hypothetical, the ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with \nstanding.” Jt. Stock Soc’y, 266 F.3d at 174. The injury need not be inflicted already; imminence \nwill do. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975). Naturally, \ntherefore, as more than one court has asserted, the threat of future harm is sufficiently immediate \nto constitute a cognizable injury-in-fact for purposes of both the standing and the ripeness \ndoctrines. E.g., Comsat Corp. v. FCC, 250 F.3d 931, 936 (5th Cir. 2001) (“A threatened injury \nsatisfies the injury in fact requirement so long as that threat is real[.]”); Prestage Farms, Inc. v. \nBd. of Supervisors of Noxubee Cnty., MS, 205 F.3d 265, 268 (5th Cir. 2000) (“[T]he risk of \ninjury may be founded on a likely and credible chain of events.”); see also, e.g., Baur v. \nVeneman, 352 F.3d 625, 633 (2d Cir. 2003) (collecting cases standing for the proposition that \n“threatened harm in the form of an increased risk of future injury may serve as injury-in-fact for \nArticle III standing purposes”); Employers Ass’n of New Jersey v. State of New Jersey, 601 F. \nSupp. 232, 238 (D.N.J. 1985) (“[T]hreatened injury is sufficient for standing . . .without \ncompelling litigants to await the consummation of threatened injury.”) (quoting Pac. Gas & \nElec. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm’n, 461 U.S. 190, 200, 103 S. Ct. 1713, \n1721, 75 L. Ed. 2d 752,  (1983)). While a truly “uncertain potentiality” may deprive a plaintiff of \nstanding, Prestage, 205 F.3d at 268, a decent probability will confer it, see Walters v. Edgar, 163 \nF.3d 430, 434 (7th Cir. 1998) (collecting cases standing for the proposition that “[a] probabilistic \nharm, if nontrivial, can support standing”); cf. Loa-Herrera v. Trominski, 231 F.3d 984, 988 (5th \nCir. 2000) (“Mere threatened injury is sufficient” if “the threat . . . is real.”).  \nPer this law, as with this Court’s ripeness inquiry, Defendant’s threat of harm is \nsufficiently clear to establish Plaintiff’s standing. In her motions, as at the First Hearing, \n31 of 59 \n \n\nDefendant has insisted that she can terminate the Medicaid provider agreement with PPGC for \nany reason, and she has repeatedly made clear that she intends and hopes to do so. There is thus \nno question that she has made a cognizable threat to Plaintiff’s interest, having already attempted \nto do via Section 46:437.11(D)(1) what she now seeks to do via Section 46:437.11(D)(2). (Doc. \n38 at 2; Doc. 39-1 at 2 –13.) That she may not succeed concerns the precariousness of her own \nposition, but has no bearing on whether the threat she poses is not real and the harm her action \nportends is not imminent. Precisely because it is, Plaintiffs’ standing is established.18 See, e.g., \nSusan J. v. Riley, 254 F.R.D. 439 (M.D. Ala. 2008) (rejecting a defendant’s standing challenge to \na plaintiff proceeding under Section 1396a(a)(8)). \n \nC.   ABSTENTION  \n1.  Defendant’s Arguments  \nDefendant urges this Court to abstain. (Doc. 53-1 at 10–12.) She argues for the \napplicability of the four main abstention doctrines—Pullman, Younger, Burford, and Colorado \nRiver. (Id. at 10–12.) Rather than applying the discrete elements of these varied doctrines, \nDefendant refers to their occasional “overlap to some degree in . . . scope and application” and \nreduces all four to a single formulation: (1) “where state administrative proceedings and judicial \nreview afford claimants adequate opportunity to test the constitutionality of state law,”  and (2) \n“the exercise of federal jurisdiction would jeopardize state efforts to establish state policy on \nmatters of public concern,” abstention “should” follow. (Id. at 12.) \n \n                                                      \n18 PPGC’s third-party standing may be a more complicated issue. Defendant, however, has raised \nno such objection, instead focusing on the doctrine’s “injury” prong, and PPGC and the \nIndividual Plaintiffs allege discrete, albeit related, harms. (Doc. 1; Doc. 43.)  \n32 of 59 \n \n\n2.  Analysis  \n  When one examines the requirements of each of these doctrines, it is clear that none of \nthem applies.  \nNamed after its founding decision, R.R. Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, \n61 S. Ct. 643, 85 L. Ed. 971 (1941), Pullman abstention is proper only when there is (1) a federal \nconstitutional challenge to a state action and (2) an unclear issue of state law that if resolved \nwould make it unnecessary to rule on the constitutional question. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. \nUnauth. Prac. of L. Comm.,  State Bar of Tex., 283 F.3d 650, 653 (5th Cir. 2002). The Fifth \nCircuit has also taken the stance that this doctrine should be invoked in only narrow and limited \nspecial circumstances and applied where the state court decision could avoid a federal question \nand would also avoid a possible strain of the federal and state relationship. Moore v. Tangipahoa \nParish Sch. Bd., 507 F. App’x 389, 396 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, \n86–87, 90 S. Ct. 788, 25 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1970)).  \nIn essence, for Pullman to govern, an uncertain state law must be central to the federal \nproceeding. Here, however, there is no state statute central to this controversy. Rather, the \nDefendant’s interpretation of a federal statute and the extent to which her termination, regardless \nof its state law basis, violates the United States Constitution are the only issues. In addition, as \nPullman requires that state law be confused and uncertain, Defendant’s failure to bring to this \nCourt’s attention even one Louisiana case evidencing a persistent discord regarding the meaning \nof either Section 46:437.11(D)(1) or Section 46:437.11(D)(2) counsels against its invocation. On \nthese bare facts, Pullman abstention is inappropriate. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Idaho, \nInc. v. Wasden, 376 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1021 (D. Idaho 2005); Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. \nv. Wasden, 376 F.3d 908, 932 (9th Cir. 2004). \n33 of 59 \n \n\nArticulated in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1971), the \nFifth Circuit has conceived of Younger abstention as a three-prong test: (1) there must be an \nongoing state proceeding that is judicial in its nature, (2) the state must have an important \ninterest in regulating the subject matter of that claim, and (3) there must be adequate opportunity \nin the state proceeding to raise constitutional challenge. Rickhoff v. Willing, 457 F. App’x 355, \n358 (5th Cir. 2012) (citing Wightman v. Tex. Supreme Court, 84 F.3d 188, 189 (5th Cir. 1996)). \nThus, Younger requires an ongoing state proceeding “judicial in nature.” Ohio Civil Rights \nComm’n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 627–28, 106 S. Ct. 2718, 2722–23, 91 L. \nEd. 2d 512 (1986). But, as Defendant’s counsel has conceded, no administrative proceeding \ncommences until or unless PPGC appeals, (Doc. 53-1 at 22; see also Hr’g Tr. 16:8–17:9, Oct. 16, \n2015), and PPGC has foresworn that option, (Hr’g Tr. 19:6–10, Oct. 15, 2015). Meanwhile, the \nIndividual Plaintiffs cannot possibly initiate such a proceeding as a matter of state law, as \nDefendant’s two lawyers have admitted and Plaintiffs contend. (Hr’g Tr. 8:7–10, Oct. 16, 2015; \nHr’g Tr. 9:11–19, 14:22–25, Sept. 2, 2015; Doc. 22 at 2–5; Doc. 46 at 18 n.13.) Regardless, no \nevidence has been adduced that any state quasi-judicial action predated the First Complaint’s \nfiling; Younger requires as much. Indeed, having rescinded the First Termination Letters, \nDefendant’s prospective agency action by definition will post-date the commencement of this \nfederal proceeding. These facts render Younger inapplicable to this proceeding.19 \nColorado River abstention, derived from Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. U. \nS., 424 U.S. 800, 96 S. Ct. 1236, 47 L. Ed. 2d 483 (1976), is exceptionally narrow. In this \nCircuit, six elements must be satisfied:  \n \n                                                      \n19 Younger is also subject to three exceptions, at least two of which arguably apply. Bice v. \nLouisiana Pub. Defender Bd., 677 F.3d 712, 716 n.3 (5th Cir. 2012). \n34 of 59 \n \n\n1) assumption by either court of jurisdiction over a res, 2) relative inconvenience \nof  the  forums,  3)  avoidance  of  piecemeal  litigation,  4)  the  order  in  which \njurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums, 5) to what extent federal law \nprovides the rules of decision on the merits, and 6) the adequacy of the state \nproceedings in protecting the rights of the party invoking federal jurisdiction. \n \nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church v. Lucien, 756 F.3d 788, 798 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Stewart \nv. W. Heritage Ins. Co., 438 F.3d 488, 491 (5th Cir. 2006)). In the case cited therein, the Fifth \nCircuit has found it applicable when there is a parallel suit in the state court at the time of the \nfederal suit also being brought with the same parties and the same issues. Stewart, 438 F.3d at \n491. As such, as with Younger, the absence of any parallel proceeding in a state agency or a state \ncourt initiated before this federal suit’s filing must foreclose Colorado River’s application to the \ninstant matter. \nTraceable to Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S. Ct. 1098, 87 L. Ed. 1424 (1943), \nthis final doctrine contemplates the presence of a state-created avenue of relief put where the \nstate has a degree of specialized competence to hear such cases is present. See Romano, 721 F.3d \nat 380 (listing five factors). Put another way, Burford abstention is only appropriate when there \nis a danger that federal court review will “disrupt the [s]tate’s attempt to ensure uniformity in the \ntreatment of an essentially local problem.” New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of \nNew Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 364 (1989). \nSuch is not the case here. It is the meaning of Section 1396a(a)(23), a federal statute, and \ntwo constructional provisions which constitute the central controversies. In fact, in interpreting \nSection 1396a(a)(8), whose language perfectly mirrors Section 1396a(a)(23), the Fifth Circuit \n35 of 59 \n \n\nrejected this same Defendant’s request for Burford abstention in no uncertain terms:  \n \nNone of these factors weighs in favor of abstention in this case. The cause of \naction arises under federal law, there are no apparent issues of state law or local \nfacts, the interest in proper application of federal Medicaid law is paramount, and \nthere is no special state forum for judicial review. \n \nRomano, 721 F.3d at 380. As with Colorado River, Younger, and Pullman, the prerequisites for \nBurford’s invocation are absent from this case. It is too inapposite. \n \nD.   CONCLUSION  \n  Based on well-settled law, this Court therefore rejects Defendant’s jurisdictional \nchallenges and declines to abstain. As to both ripeness and standing, there is an imminent threat \nof harm. Applying the appropriate abstention factors to the facts of this case, abstention is \ninappropriate. Instead, it is the Court’s “strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon . . . \n[it] by Congress.” Quakenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 716, 116 S. Ct. 1712, 1720, \n135 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1996).  \n \nV.  DISCUSSION: TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \nA.  APPLICABLE STANDARDS  \nA plaintiff must establish four elements to secure a temporary restraining order (“TRO”): \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury \n36 of 59 \n \n\nif the injunction is not issued, (3) that the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs \nany harm that will result if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an injunction will \nnot disserve the public interest. E.g., Janvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 595 (5th Cir. 2011); \nWomen’s Med. Center of Nw. Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419, n. 15 (5th Cir. 2001).20 Long \ndeemed “an extraordinary remedy,” Anderson v. Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir. 2009); see \nalso Douthit v. Dean, 568 F. App’x 336, 337 (5th Cir. 2014) (similarly characterizing a \npreliminary injunction), a temporary restraining order aims “to preserve the status quo and \nprevent irreparable harm just so long as is necessary to hold a hearing, and no longer,” Granny \nGoose Foods v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers, 415 U.S. 423, 439, 94 S. Ct. 1113, \n1124, 39 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1974); see also, e.g., Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe \nLine Co., 760 F.2d 618, 627 (5th Cir. 1985). By circumstance and necessity, in considering \nwhether either a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order should issue, a court is \n“almost always” forced to rely upon “[an] abbreviated set of facts.” Klitzman, Klitzman & \nGallagher v. Krut, 744 F.2d 955, 958 (3d Cir. 1984) (discussing preliminary injunctions). \n \nB.  FIRST ELEMENT: LIKELY SUCCESS ON THE MERITS \nPlaintiffs bring this civil action pursuant to Section 1983 based on Defendant’s alleged \nviolation of rights secured by the Medicaid Act and the United States Constitution. Specifically, \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendant’s attempt to terminate the Agreements violates the rights of the \nIndividual Plaintiffs under Section 1396a(a)(23)(A) (“Free-Choice-of-Provider Provision”) and \nPPGC’s rights under both the Equal Protection Clause and the Freedom of Speech Clause of the \n                                                      \n20 The standard for granting a preliminary injunction is identical. See Byrum v. Landreth, 566 \nF.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir. 2009); accord, e.g., Wilson v. Office of Violent Sex Offender Mgmt., 584 \nF. App’x 210, 212 (5th Cir. 2014). Their distinction lies in timing. FED. R. CIV. P. 65. \n37 of 59 \n \n\nUnited States Constitution. (Doc. 43 ¶¶ 62–67 at 19–20.) In relevant part,21 Defendant contends \nthat Section 1396a(a)(23) does not create a private cause of action for either PPGC or the \nIndividual Plaintiffs and relies primarily on Armstrong. (Doc. 53-1 at 18–24; see also Doc. 13 at \n3–13.) If the Plaintiffs were to prevail on their Section 1396a(a)(23) claim and/or PPGC was to \nprevail on either its constitutional claims, the same remedy—a permanent injunction—would be \ndue, and any potential action by Defendant would be similarly affected. Accordingly, this Court \nneed not conclude that Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of prevailing on all claims \nadvanced in the Amended Complaint for a temporary restraining order to issue at this time. In \nother words, if Plaintiffs satisfy the elements needed to show a substantial likelihood of success \non the Individual Plaintiffs’ Section 1396a(a)(23) claim only, so long as the other factors are \nmet, a temporary restraining order is appropriate.  \n \n1.  Mandate of 1396a(a)(23) \n(a)  Existence of a Private Right of Action under Section 1396a(a)(23)   \nSection 1396a(a)(23), the section under which the Individual Plaintiffs now sue, reads: \n“A [s]tate plan for medical assistance must . . . provide . . . any individual eligible for medical \nassistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community \npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required . . .who undertakes to \nprovide him such services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23) (emphasis added). Even now, the seminal \nholdings of three Court cases—Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S. Ct. \n2510, 110 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1990); Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 117 S. Ct. 1353, 137 L. Ed. \n                                                      \n21 Defendant’s argument s regarding Plaintiffs’ property interest and procedural due process, \n(Doc. 13 at 14–19; Doc. 53-1 at 13–18), are no longer viable in light of the Amended Complaint, \n(Doc. 43).  \n38 of 59 \n \n\n2d 569 (1997); and Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S. Ct. 2268, 153 L. Ed. 309 \n(2002)—remain binding and undisturbed. This fact has been recognized by multiple courts, see, \ne.g., Doc. 45 at 12, Planned Parenthood Ark. & E. Okla. v. Selig, No. 15-cv-00566-KGB \n(“Selig”); see also Emma C. v. Eastin, No. 96-cv-04179-TEH, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113355, at \n*17, 2015 WL 5029283, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2015) (distinguishing Armstrong as “a \nMedicaid case wherein the Court considered whether there was an implied right of action under \nthe Supremacy Clause”); cf. Tohono O’odham Nation v. Ducey, No. CV-15-01135-PHX-DGC, \n2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124979, at *30 –31 (D. Ariz. Sept. 17, 2015) (distinguishing Armstrong \nin a case not involving the Medicaid Act); J.E. v. Wong, No. 14-00399 HG-BMK, 2015 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 114094, at *21 –22 (D. Haw. Aug. 27, 2015) (same), and acknowledged by \nDefendant’s counsel, (Hr’g Tr. 15:9–14, Sept. 2, 2015).  \nThese precedents thus supply the three-part test that this Court must employ to determine \nwhether § 1396a(a)(23) awards the Individual Plaintiff with a right enforceable under § 1983. \nEqual Access for El Paso, Inc. v. Hawkins, 509 F.3d 697, 702 (5th Cir. 2007). Thus, if Congress \n“intended” that § 1396a(a)(23) “benefit the [individual] plaintiff[s],” “the right assertedly \nprotected by th[is] statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain \njudicial competence,” and it “unambiguously impose[s] a binding obligation on the [s]tates,” \nPlaintiffs may proceed to sue Defendant for violating Section 1396a(a)(23) pursuant to § 1983, \nhaving “advanc[ed] a violation of a ‘federal law.’” Hood, 235 F.3d at 924–25 (quoting Blessing, \n520 U.S. at 340–41), rev’d on other grounds; as observed in Hawkins, 509 F.3d at 701 n.4. Not \nvoidable by one decision’s dicta or a plurality’s construal of a different subsection, this Gonzaga \nand Blessing standard for unearthing congressional intent to create a private cause of action \ngoverns still.  \n39 of 59 \n \n\nRead plainly, § 1396a(a)(23) easily satisfies each prong. It contains rights-creating and \nmandatory language, and it has an unmistakable individual focus. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). \nIndeed, with its terms so comprehensive and clear, court after court forced to peruse this \nprovision has reached the same conclusion: “[W]e hold that the Medicaid Act's free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement confers a private right of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Betlach, 727 \nF.3d at 963; accord, e.g., Doc. 45 at 12, Selig;  Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of \nInd. State Dep’t of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 968 (7th Cir. 2012) (“Indiana”); Harris v. Olszewski, \n442 F.3d 456, 459 (6th Cir. 2006). True, as Defendant notes, some of these courts applied § \n1396a(a)(23) pre-Armstrong. Yet, their distinctive factual predicates do not affect the more \nuniform applicability (and cogency) of these courts’ interpretation of the unchanged statute at \nissue here in accordance with the standard laid out in Wilder and its progeny. Presented with the \nsame exact subsection, they discerned a private cause of action within it. In following Betlach, \nIndiana, Harris, and Selig, this Court simply endorses a statutory construction predicated on \nvenerable canons and binding precedent.  \nCrucially, this reading of § 1396a(a)(23) finds ample support in this section’s other \nprovisions as construed by other courts, a fact that this Court cannot ignore pursuant to familiar \ncanons of interpretation. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S. Ct. 441, 449, 151 L. \nEd. 2d 339 (2001) (“[A] statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be \nprevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). Containing the same words prominent in § 1396a(a)(23)—\n“individual” and “must,” most obviously—the Medicaid Act’s Reasonable Promptness Provision \nrequires that a state plan for medical assistance “provide that all individuals wishing to make \napplication for medical assistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such \n40 of 59 \n \n\nassistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.” 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(8) (emphasis added). In Romano, the Fifth Circuit applied Blessing’s three-part test as \nmodified by Gonzaga and found that this section, linguistically identical to Section 1396a(a)(23), \ncreates a private cause of action enforceable under § 1983. 721 F.3d at 375, 378–80. Similar in \ntone, Section § 1396a(a)(3) reads: “A [s]tate plan for medical assistance must . . . provide for \ngranting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim \nfor medical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.” \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) (emphasis added). As Romano described Section 1396a(a)(8), this court \ndescribed the similarly worded Section 1396a(a)(3): “[The] language is mandatory, the provision \ncontains rights-creating language, and there is an individual focus.” Detgen v. Janek, 945 F. \nSupp. 2d 746, 754 (N.D. Tex. 2013). \nAnother section states: “In the case of services furnished by a [FQHC] . . . pursuant to a \ncontract between the center or clinic and a managed care entity . . ., the State plan shall provide \nfor payment to the center or clinic by the State.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(5) (emphasis added). \nThis subparagraph too, the First Circuit observed, speaks in “individualistic terms, rather than at \nthe aggregate level of institutional policy or practice,” refers to “specific, discrete beneficiary \ngroup,” and contains mandatory and “highly specific terms,” and therefore creates a right subject \nto enforcement under § 1983. Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc., 397 F.3d at 74, 75. In sum, an \noverwhelming majority of courts confronted with language in the Medicaid Act identical to that \nbefore the Court now have found it to impart a right of action cognizable under  § 1983.   \n \n(b)  Defendant’s Misplaced Emphasis on Armstrong  \nWhile Defendant urges this Court to discard this consensus on the basis of the more \n41 of 59 \n \n\nrecent Armstrong, (Hr’g Tr. 19:19–24, Sept. 2, 2015; Hr’g Tr. 7:4–5, Oct. 16, 2015), this \ndecision cannot bear the weight placed upon it by Defendant. The Selig court said it well: \nArmstrong “does not overrule, or even significantly undermine, the precedent that informed the \nreasoning of the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in recognizing a private right of action under \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23).” Doc. 45 at 12, Selig. Armstrong cannot do this for three reasons. \nFirst, Armstrong is narrower than Defendant says. The Armstrong plurality did not dissect \n§ 1396a(a)(23); it did not even delve into the meaning of a similarly worded provision like § \n1396a(a)(3) or (a)(8). Instead, Armstrong focused on § 1396a(a)(30), which compels a state plan \nto “provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care \nand services available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary \nutilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, \neconomy, and quality of care.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30). Armstrong limited its analysis to the \nimport of this Equal Access Provision, no more and no less, which lacks the right-creating and \nindividual-focused language so prominent in Section 1396a(a)(23). To quote Justice Scalia’s \nplurality, even if the former does not, as a purely lexicographical matter, the latter does, \npeppered with “rights-creating language.” Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 482 (Scalia, J., plurality). For \nDefendant to claim that § 1396a(a)(23) and (a)(30) contain “the same rights creating type of \nlanguage,” as she did before this Court, (Hr’g Tr. 16:17–21, Sept. 2, 2015; Hr’g Tr. 7:4–5, Oct. \n16, 2015), based purely on the introductory words of the overall section—“a [s]tate plan must . . \n.”—is to ignore any reference to “individual” and the use of “must” in Section 1396a(a)(23). \nUsing Armstrong, Defendant then urges this Court to rewrite a plain statute, a task plainly at \nodds with its judicial duty “to ascertain — neither to add nor to subtract, neither to delete nor to \ndistort” a statute’s enacted terms. Ariz. State Bd. for Charter Sch. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 464 \n42 of 59 \n \n\nF.3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 2006). \nSecond, Defendant has extended Armstrong’s “rationale” far beyond its own stated \nlimits. True, four justices went farther, specifically dismissing respondents’ arguments for “a \ncause of action” predicated on “the Medicaid Act itself,” but no majority coalesced around this \nproposition. Id. (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment.) As such, in \naccordance with the Fifth Circuit’s binding command that a “joint opinion is . . . considered the \nholding of the Court . . . [only] as [to] the narrowest position supporting the judgment,” Cole, \n790 F.3d at 571, this Court refuses to take Armstrong beyond the confines of § 1396a(a)(30), the \nonly provision upon whose interpretation a majority could agree. In fact, as Defendant conceded \nat the First Hearing, (Hr’g Tr. 15:9–14, Sept. 2, 2015), Armstrong did not overrule Gonzaga or \nWilder, and it was Gonzaga that formed the basis of the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation of § \n1396a(a)(8) in Romano, 721 F.3d at 378–80.  \nThird, just because § 1396a(a)(30) and (a)(23) are subparts of one act does not make \nthem identical in form and effect, as Defendant impliedly contends by seeking to expand \nArmstrong beyond its narrow ambit. Rather, “[t]he mere fact that all the Medicaid laws are \nembedded within the requirements for a state plan does not, by itself, make all of the Medicaid \nprovisions into ones stating a mere institutional policy or practice rather than creating an \nindividual right.” Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 74, 74 (1st Cir. \n2006). This command, in fact, is implicit in a whole other subsection: “In an action brought to \nenforce a provision of this chapter [which includes the Medicaid statutes], such provision is not \nto be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of this chapter requiring a State \nplan or specifying the required contents of a State plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2. \n \n43 of 59 \n \n\n(c)  Defendant’s Misplaced Deference Argument  \n  Defendant argues that, even if the Individual Plaintiffs have the right to choose a \nqualified provider and enforce that right via Section 1983, PPGC is not “qualified” under Section \n1396a(a)(23) because DHH can deem it so by exercising Section 46:437.11(D)(2). (Hr’g Tr. \n9:18–10:5, Oct. 16, 2015; Doc. 53-1 at 21.) In clear and persuasive terms, the court in Selig \nrightly rejected that argument.  \n \nHere, the dispute is whether the Government, either through the Governor or \nthrough [Arkansas Department of Human Services’ (“ARDS”)] actions, \nimpermissibly interfered with the Jane Does’ choice of a qualified provider when \nit terminated PHH as a provider in the manner and for the reason it articulates. If \nthis right found in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23) and conferred on Medicaid recipients \nis to have the meaning ascribed to it by the Court in O’Bannon [v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773, 787 (1980], ADHS cannot be permitted to declare \na provider unqualified and then to use that declaration  to put out of reach any \nfuture challenges to its conduct by Medicaid recipients.”  \n \nDoc. 45 at 19, Selig. Indeed, counsel for Defendant conceded this argument is “circular.” (Hr’g \nTr. 20:12-13, Sept. 2, 2015.) If so, then it cannot stand, for no statute can be interpreted so as to \nrender its specific terms superfluous or divorced from “the phrase in which it is embedded.” \nBetlach, 727 F.3d at 960. This Court’s duty “to give effect, if possible, to every . . . word of a \nstatute” compels rejecting an interpretation that Defendant herself concedes makes Section \n1396a(a)(23) either absurd or illogical. United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538, 75 S. Ct. \n44 of 59 \n \n\n513, 520, 99 L. Ed. 615 (1955). \nUnderlying Defendant’s argument that its interpretation of “qualified,” which would \nleave Section 1396a(a)(23) as too “vague” and “amorphous” to satisfy the second Blessing \nprong, must be respected is a plea for deference under either Chevron or Skidmore. However, in \ncases of statutory interpretation, no deference is owed where the term in question is clear on its \nface. In determining the meaning of a statutory term, the rules of interpretation and construction \nare clear: a court must begin with the relevant language. Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, 471 \nU.S. 681, 685, 105 S. Ct. 2297, 2301, 85 L. Ed. 2d 692 (1985); see also Temp. Emp’t Servs. v. \nTrinity Marine Grp., 261 F.3d 456, 462 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing id.). If the meaning is plain and \nunambiguous and the statutory scheme is both “coherent and consistent,” Robinson v. Shell Oil \nCo., 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S. Ct. 843, 846, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997); see also Salazar v. \nMaimon, 750 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing id.), “the sole function of the courts is to \nenforce it according to its terms,” Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S. Ct. 192, \n194, 61 L. Ed. 442 (1917); see also, e.g., Meredith v. Time Ins. Co., 980 F.2d 352, 356 & n.18 \n(9th Cir. 1993) (quoting id.); In re McCarthy, 391 B.R. 372, 375 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 2008) \n(same).  \nUnder these rules, Section 1396a(a)(23) is no quandary. Linguistically, “qualified” means \n“[p]ossessing the necessary qualifications; capable and competent.” Qualified, BLACK’S LAW \nDICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Inputting this definition of “qualified” into § 1396a(a)(23), it is \nclear that a “qualified” provider is one who is “capable and competent” of “perform[ing]” the \n“service or services required” by the Medicaid eligible individual seeking “medical assistance.” \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). To discern that Section 1396a(a)(23) requires that a state’s \ndetermination of a provider’s “qualified” be related to that provider’s ability to “perform the \n45 of 59 \n \n\nservice or services required” thus requires no specialized expertise, but follows naturally from \nthis provision’s plain meaning, as illuminated by the surrounding text. To the extent that \n“qualified” is truly ambiguous, its context, both “specific” and “general,” clarifies its outer \nparameters, the Medicaid Act’s statutory scheme making clear that any analysis of “qualified” \nmust relate to the relevant provider’s actual competence to undertake the services for which it \nhas been contracted. See Betlach, 727 F.3d at 965. And, “if the intent of Congress is clear,” as \nevidenced by the use of an unambiguous word, “that is the end of the matter; for the court, as \nwell as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” \nChevron, 467 U.S. at 842–43. Accordingly, in asserting, as Defendant does, that “qualified” can \nbe redefined at the agency’s discretion without regard to the whole of Section 1396a(a)(23), she \nhas forfeited any right to a court’s deference. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842–43 (“If the intent of \nCongress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give \neffect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”) Accordingly, in conceding that \nPPGC is qualified to provide the services required by the Agreements and by the Medicaid Act, \n(Hr’g Tr. 11:10–16, Sept. 2, 2015), Defendant has admitted that PPGC is “qualified” within the \nstatute’s most minimal meaning. In concluding that Plaintiffs will likely show that Defendant has \ncontravened Section 1396a(a)(23), this Court echoes the Ninth Circuit: “Nowhere in the \nMedicaid Act has Congress . . .  indicated that each state is free to define . . . [‘qualified’] for \npurposes of its own Medicaid program however it sees fit.” Betlach, 727 F.3d at 970.  \nEven if this Court were to regard “qualified” as ambiguous, however, DHH’s \ninterpretation would deserve no Chevron deference. As noted above, for Chevron to apply, an \nagency interpretation must concern an ambiguous statute, be imbued with precedential effect, \nand be reasonable. See supra Part V.A. Defendant contends that “qualified” is an ineradicably \n46 of 59 \n \n\nambiguous term, so unfettered in content that no outer bounds but her own opinion can be set, \n(Doc. 13 at 8; Doc. 53-1 at 21), so that this one word has become “an interpretive wormhole, \nwhose supposed ambiguity leads to a galaxy of unfettered agency discretion,” Wheaton v. \nMcCarthy, 800 F.3d 282, 288 (6th Cir. 2015). Not the product of considered rulemaking, DHH \nhas yet to provide even one bit of evidence that it has ever so construed “qualified” to exclude a \nprovider whose competence is not at issue. Her present position has not even “embodied in \nopinion letters, policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines,” which though \n“lack the force of law,” but deserve some respect. Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, \n587, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000). Even in citing the various meanings that \n“qualified” may have, she gives no source to credit her unique interpretation. (Doc. 13 at 8; Doc. \n53-1 at 21.) In fact, her lawyer called her denotation of “qualified” “circular,” (Hr’g Tr. 21:12–\n13, Sept. 2, 2015), thereby rendering it unpersuasive. White v. Black, 190 F.3d 366, 368-69 (5th \nCir. 1999); see also FAA v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1441, 1449, 182 L. Ed. 2d 497 (2012) (rejecting \nthe use of a “a general (and notably circular) definition). This decision to adopt such a definition, \nthen, bears none of the marks of considered rulemaking or an exercise of some agency particular \nexpertise, as the most minimal deference doctrines require. See Vigil v. Leavitt, 381 F.3d 826, \n835 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nFinally, as a factual matter, this Court finds no merit in Defendant’s factual contentions \nregarding the recent nature of CMS’ interpretation. Before this Court, Defendant has claimed \nthat CMS’ counsel provided her “with some contending views as to what qualified mean[s].” \n(Hr’g Tr. 19:2–7, Sept. 2, 2015.) In Defendant’s Reply, she accused CMS of advancing an \ninterpretation of “qualified” in the Statement of Interest never before evidenced or proclaimed. \n(Doc. 31 at 4.) Both these statements, however, reek of disingenuousness, presumably \n47 of 59 \n \n\nunintended. The first assertion appears to be based on the First (and Second and Third) Kennedy \nDeclarations, yet in none did Ms. Kennedy so describe her conversation with CMS. Rather, per \nthe First Kennedy Declaration, CMS did no more than “advise[]” DHH that it “has the authority \nto withhold federal Medicaid dollars from Louisiana or seek injunctive relief for failure to \ncomply with the Medicaid Act.” Such language, even if it is most generously construed in \nDefendant’s favor, simply does not imply that CMS acceded to Defendant’s premise—that \n“qualified” as sufficiently “ambiguous” as to be indefinable—or acknowledged DHH’s authority \nto define it in a manner inconsistent with CMS’ understanding of § 1396a(a)(23).  \nMeanwhile, DHH has seemingly overlooked an Informational Bulletin, dated June 1, \n2011, sent by CMS to every state Medicaid agency. In this short bulletin, a matter of public \nrecord, CMS addressed “some inquiries as to whether States may exclude certain providers from \nparticipating in Medicaid based on their scope of practice,” offering a cogent “review of \nlongstanding federal law.” CMS, CMCS INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN 1 (June 1, 2011). As this \nbulletin continues, “[s]tates are not . . . permitted to exclude providers from the program solely \non the basis of the range of medical services they provide”; a determination of the extent to \nwhich a Medicaid provider is “qualified” for purposes of § 1396a(a)(23), it explains, must be \nrelated to the actual “scope of services” offered by the relevant provider. Id. at 1–2. In other \nwords, more than four years before DHH attempted to terminate the Agreements, CMS endorsed \nthe interpretation of § 1396a(a)(23) that it has repeated in the Statement of Interest: \n“[T]erminating PPGC from . . . [Louisiana’s] Medicaid program without providing any \njustification related to PPGC’s qualifications to provide medical services would violate . . . §  \n1396a(a)(23),” (Doc. 24 at 2). \n \n48 of 59 \n \n\n(d)  Considering Defendants’ Reasons for Claiming PPGC is Unqualified \nLike the Selig and Herbert courts, this Court finds it likely that Plaintiffs will prevail on \ntheir Section 1396a(a)(23) claim. This subsection awards a private cause of action, and \nDefendant has already conceded that PPGC is “qualified” as that term must be naturally (and \nplainly) defined, as the Seventh and Ninth Circuits concluded in Indiana and Betlach. For the \npurposes of a preliminary injunction, their likelihood of success has been established. They have \nprovided more than enough precedent, evidence and argument to lead this Court to believe they \nhave “a reasonable probability of success.” See 11A CHARLES A. WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL \nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2948.3; see also Dine Citizens Against Ruining Our Env’t v. Jewell, \nNo. CIV 15-0209 JB/SCY, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109986, at *57 n.10, 2015 WL 4997207, at \n*21 n.10 (D.N.M. Aug. 14, 2015) (“It is not entirely clear what a preliminary-injunction \nmovant’s burden of proof is vis-à-vis the case's merits, as [t]he courts use a bewildering variety \nof formulations of the need for showing some likelihood of success—the most common being \nthat plaintiff must demonstrate a reasonable probability of success.” (alteration in original) \n(internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nNonetheless, given Defendant’s recent invocation of Section 46:437.11(D)(2) and not \nSection 46:437.11(D)(1), this Court feels compelled to address the facial credibility of \nDefendant’s new grounds for termination. In the Second Termination Letters, Defendant gives \nthree “violations” justifying its terminations: first, PPGC’s settlement of an FCA suit in Texas \nwhich it did not report to DHH; second, the involvement of a PPGC affiliate in a pending Texas \ncase which survived a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal and third, PPGC’s alleged misrepresentations in a \nletter responding to inquiries about the video tapes. (Doc. 39-1.) Having subjected these reasons \nto scrutiny, this Court concludes that, even if Defendant’s definition of “qualified” prevails, \n49 of 59 \n \n\nDHH’s reasons for disqualifying PPGC likely will not. \nThe first of Defendant’s reasons, the Reynolds Settlement, is likely to fail. The claim was \nbrought by an FCA plaintiff, not the government.22 The settlement expressly disavows PPGC’s \nliability. (Doc. 54-1 at 5.) It therefore falls into the exception set forth in Title 50 for certain FCA \nactions: “If a False Claims Act action or other similar civil action is brought by a Qui-Tam \nplaintiff, no violation of this provision has occurred until the defendant has been found liable in \nthe action.” LA. ADMIN. CODE tit. 50, § 4147(12)(c) (emphasis added). Title 50 plainly and \nunambiguously requires that liability either be “found,” whether by admission or by some fact-\nfinder. Since Reynolds involved no such finding, Defendant’s first stated reason contradicts \nDHH’s own code. With no citation to authority, Defendant’s counsel asks the Court to reject the \n“literal” language, (Hr’g Tr. 36:7–8, Oct. 16, 2015), in defiance of every well-known rule of \ninterpretation. Urging the Court to adopt what he “think[s] that means,” he asks this Court to \nrewrite a plain provision, a task far beyond a judge’s proper province and the Secretary’s actor’s \nprescribed powers. Beyond that fact, Plaintiffs have credibly shown that DHH was aware of the \nReynolds Settlement long before October 14, 2015, with Defendant’s own emails suggesting that \nit did not find it sufficient to provide “credible evidence” of Medicaid fraud. (Doc. 46-3 at 2.) On \nthese facts, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on proving the irrelevance of the Reynolds Settlement.  \nDefendant’s second ground for alleging fraud—the Carroll case—rests on a quote drawn \nfrom a judge’s ruling on a motion to dismiss, as revealed by that opinion’s full text: per Rule \n12(b), “[t]he court concludes that Carroll has adequately pleaded factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that Planned Parenthood knowingly filed false claims.” \n                                                      \n22 That the government had to sign off on the agreement is a statutory requirement. It does not \nmean that the government was a proper party. See United States ex rel. Carter v. Bridgepoint \nEduc., Inc., 305 F.R.D. 225, 230–31 (S.D. Cal. 2014) (explaining the complex subtleties \ninvolved in the FCA). \n50 of 59 \n \n\nDoc. 31 at 17, No. 12-cv-03505 (S.D. Tex. May 14, 2014.) Contrary to Defendant’s allegation \nthat the court in Carroll found, “that the information already provided ‘allow the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference” that fraud took place, (Doc. 39-1 at 2). Rather, as counsel for \nDefendant conceded in oral argument, for purposes of the motion before that court, the plaintiff’s \nallegations were only assumed to be true, as Rule 12(b) requires. (Hr’g Tr. 35:2–11, Oct. 16, \n2015.) That court never made a factual finding of fraud. (Hr’g Tr. 35:8–11, Oct. 16, 2015.) \nInstead, it ruled only that the plaintiff had plead his case “adequate[ly].” Doc. 31 at 17, No. 12-\ncv-03505. In fact, the Carroll case appears to still be in discovery. (Hr’g Tr. 26:5–8, Oct. 16, \n2015.) In other words, the second ground in the Second Termination letters cannot satisfy the \nlanguage of Title 50.  \nFinally, Defendant’s third asserted ground consists merely of untold and unspecified \nmisrepresentations. Not one is substantiated in her letter or by her attorneys, and each, on the \nrecord now before the Court, has been credibly contradicted in PPGC’s August Letter. In this \nCourt’s opinion, it is telling that the letter cites no “found” violation of licensure or certification \nrequirements and any specific failure to meet any condition of enrollment. (Doc. 39-1 at 3.) It is \ntoo revealing that Defendant cites to the final clause of Section 46:437.11(D)(2), which allows \nfor termination if a provider is “the subject of a sanction or of a criminal, civil, or departmental \nproceeding,” and deems an allusion to investigations by DHH and the Louisiana Office of \nInspector General sufficient, (Doc. 39-1), a position rejected once before, New Orleans Home for \nIncurables, Inc. v. Greenstein, 911 F. Supp. 2d 410, 411–12 (E.D. La. 2012). When this Court \nasked him to substantiate these alleged misrepresentations, Defendant’s counsel could not. (Hr’g \nTr. 33:3–8, Oct. 16, 2015.) In sum, Plaintiffs will likely be able to show that Defendant’s actions \nviolated Louisiana’s Administrative Code. \n51 of 59 \n \n\nIn fact, the apparent fragility of the Second Termination Letters’ stated reasons raises \nanother specter, for not one appears to be a supported factual allegation of the kind of fraud and \nill-practice with which MAPIL is concerned. See Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys. v. Bynum, 879 \nSo. 2d 807, 811 (La. Ct. App. 2004). Here, the facts matter, for as the Supreme Court of \nLouisiana explained in the spring of 2015, “[a]n agency exercising delegated authority is not free \nto pursue any and all ends, but can assert authority only over those ends which are connected \nwith the task delegated by the legislative body.” Dep’t of Children & Family Servs. ex rel. A. L. \nv. Lowrie, 167 So. 3d 573, 587–88 (La. 2015); see also State v. Alfonso, 753 So. 2d 156, 161 (La. \n1999) (“When the legislative body, in delegating powers, clearly expresses its policy and \nprovides sufficient standards, judicial review of the exercise of the means chosen by the agency \nin exercising its delegated power provides a safeguard against abuse by the agency.”) \nAxiomatically, “[t]he open-ended discretion to choose ends is the essence of legislative power; it \nis this power that the legislative body possesses, but its agents lack.” Lowrie, 167 So.3d at 587. \nSection 46:437.11(D)(2) is but one part of a law directed towards narrow ills, and that the \nlegislature logically expected the powers awarded by this provision to be employed so as “to \ncombat and prevent fraud and abuse” and to secure the “fiscal and programmatic integrity” of a \nprogram otherwise endangered by “persons who engage in fraud, misrepresentation, abuse, or \nother ill practices” as expressly defined in MAPIL alone. See LA. R.S. § 46:437.2. Based on the \nevidence it has so far presented and if no actual evidence of a MAPIL-worthy-misdeed is \nadduced, Defendant has likely run afoul of this state’s statutory law.  \n \nC.  SECOND ELEMENT: IRREPARABLE HARM \nIn this regard, both the standard—“Irreparable in the injunction context means not \n52 of 59 \n \n\nrectifiable by the entry of a final judgment,” Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Property Co., 966 F.2d \n273, 275 (7th Cir. 1992)—and the record are clear.  \nBased on their uncontroverted affidavits, the Individual Plaintiffs greatly depend on \nPPGC, and if the Agreements are terminated, they will be unable to visit their Medicaid provider \nof choice. (Doc. 4-2, 4-3, 4-4.) Approximately, 5,200 other women visit BRHC and NOHC and \nlikely depend upon it equally. (Doc. 41-1 ¶¶ 12 –18 at 4–5.) At this stage of the proceeding, the \nCourt is persuaded that, absent this termination, the patients of PPGC in Louisiana will have \ntheir healthcare disrupted. Counsel for Defendant has already conceded this to be the case. (Hr’g \nTr. 12:6–12.) Presented with similar facts, other courts have found irreparable harm. See, e.g., \nDoc. 45 at 22, Selig; Doc. 21 at 1–2, No. 15-cv-693; Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc., 497 F. \nSupp. 2d at 912; Camacho, 325 F. Supp. 2d 794 at 802. \nBased on its own unquestioned assertions, PPGC will also likely suffer irreparable harm. \nRegardless of the precise dollars in revenue it may receive from the state, PPGC has made clear \nthat it may have to close BRHC upon the Agreements’ termination. (Doc. 46 at 27.) Often, such \nresults have been considered irreparable. Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc., 794 F. Supp 2d at \n912; see also Canterbury Career School, Inc. v. Riley, 833 F. Supp. 1097, 1105 (D.N.J. 1993) \n(“Where the result of denying injunctive relief would be the destruction of an on-going business, \nsuch a result generally constitutes irreparable injury.”). The fact that the Eleventh Amendment \nforbids PPGC from ever collecting monetary damages, even if Defendant’s conduct is later \nfound illegal, also militates in favor of deeming its likely harm to be irreparable, Green, 474 U.S. \nat 68, an allegation made by Plaintiffs, (Doc. 46 at 27 n.19), and never denied by Defendant. In \naddition, “potential reputational harm is present,” Doc. 12 at 1, No. 15-cv-693-CW, as \nDefendant’s termination may lead others to believe PPGC is not a competent provider despite \n53 of 59 \n \n\nher own stated contrary belief, (Hr’g Tr. 11:12–16, Sept. 2, 2015). Cumulatively, these harms are \nirreparable. See, e.g., United Healthcare Ins. Co. v. Advance PCS, 316 F.3d 737, 741 (8th Cir. \n2002); Glenwood Bridge, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 940 F.2d 367, 371 (8th Cir. 1991). \nDefendant has sought to allay these concerns with the First, Second, and Third Kennedy \nDeclarations. See supra Part II. Yet, these declarations’ manifold oversights and constant \ntinkering leave this Court with the decided impression that not even DHH can ensure that \nPPGC’s current patients will have some ready and convenient outlet. Indeed, even the most \nrecent version contains a number of specialized providers who do not accept patients like \nPPGC’s own. See supra Part II.   \n \nD.  THIRD ELEMENT: BALANCE OF HARMS \nAlthough the harms to Plaintiffs appear many, in her papers, Defendant gives the Court \nonly two: (1) “The granting of a TRO would prevent the LDHH from their ability to govern the \nMedicaid program under the authority granted by the Medicaid Act,” and, (2) “It would also \ncontravene the Louisiana Legislature’s intent to give the LDHH a right to terminate a Medicaid \nprovider agreement at-will when she chooses to do so.”  (Doc. 13 at 20.) The second obviously \nbears no more relevance, as Section 46:436.11(D)(1) no longer applies. An injunction will have \nno financial effect, as DHH will still need to pay the Medicaid benefits of every PPGC \nMedicaid-eligible patient. See Doc. 12 at 1, No. 15-cv-693-CW, Marlo M. ex rel. Parris v. \nCansler, 679 F. Supp. 2d 635, 638 (E.D.N.C. 2010). In dollars and cents, maintaining this status \nquo costs DHH nothing.  \nFurthermore, in terms of her ability to “govern the Medicaid program,” an injunction will \nnot strip DHH of its statutory powers. It will not suddenly deprive of the ability to pursue \n54 of 59 \n \n\nlegitimate claims of Medicaid fraud or ensure that Louisiana citizens are obtaining “competent” \nmedical care; she will still be able “to govern the Medical program.” At worst, it will halt its \nexercise of a particular power as to a single provider as to whose medical competency it has \nadmitted. Indeed, at worst, such an injunction will do no more than convince DHH to invoke its \npowers under MAPIL more clearly and consistently in the future. New Orleans Home for \nIncurables, Inc., 911 F. Supp. 2d at 411–12. It would, in other words, force DHH to act as the \nstatute implicitly demands. Other cases have so ruled. See, e.g., Doc. 45 at 30, No. 15-cv-00566-\nKGB. With them, this Court agrees. \nNor is this Court persuaded by Defendant’s efforts to distinguish Plaintiffs’ cases. One \ncase that Defendant had previously attempted to distinguish as being predicated on Section \n46:437.11(D)(2), (Doc. 13 at 21), the very section she has now invoked, did so. New Orleans \nHome for Incurables, Inc., 911 F. Supp. 2d at 410–11. Taking her at her word, Defendant’s latest \ntermination has now made this case particularly relevant. True, the second—Giovanni \nCarandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507 (4th Cir. 2002)—“involved a State that enforced \nrestrictions likely to be found unconstitutional,” (Doc. 13 at 21.) Yet, the same can be said about \nan injunction intended to foreclose application of restrictions likely to be found contrary to \npreeminent federal statutory law designed to help the neediest of this state’s citizens.   \nIn sum, even if Defendant’s criticism is given weight, the balance of harms would still \nfavor Plaintiffs.  \n \nE.  FINAL ELEMENT: PUBLIC INTEREST \nIn light of Plaintiffs’ likely irreparable harm and the balanced equities, this final factor \nfavors an injunctive relief too. For decades, PPGC has served numerous at-risk individuals and \n55 of 59 \n \n\nhelped DHH combat a host of diseases, and, in the process, become the regular provider of over \n5,000 women, including the Individual Plaintiff. Like its brethren, this Court “believes that . . . \nvulnerable population[s] should only be uprooted if practically necessary and legally warranted.” \nGreenstein, 911 F. Supp. 2d at 412. As the Ninth Circuit stated in considering this same factor in \na Medicaid case, the public interest is most acute in regards to “ensuring access to health care” \nabsent any misdeed’s demonstration. Indep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal, Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly, 572 F.3d \n644, 659 (9th Cir. 2002), vacated and remanded on other grounds 132 S. Ct. 1204 (2012). \nDefendant herself has urged this Court to employ this factor: “[I]t is certainly true that the public \nhas an interest in the neediest of its members having access to healthcare.” (Doc. 13 at 21.) Like \nSelig and Herbert, this Court adopts this reasoning and finds the public interest favors Plaintiffs.  \nIn contesting Plaintiffs’ public interest arguments, Defendant has offered up only the \nfollowing statement of purported fact: “[T]here has been no evidence presented that shows \nMedicaid recipients in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge areas will not have access to family \nplanning and related services.” (Doc. 13 at 21.) As support, she asked this Court to rely upon the \nFirst Kennedy Declaration. (Id.) As noted above, the Kennedy Declarations have been advanced, \nretracted, and again proposed, leaving this Court wary of relying on Defendant’s protean \nassertions of fact. It instead turns to the uncontested and unquestioned facts—PPGC serves 5,200 \npoor and needy women, and PPGC has repeatedly been deemed a “competent” provider by \nDHH—and honors the public interest in affording these women access to their provider of \nchoice.  \n \nF.   CONCLUSION  \nFour elements are necessary before a court may issue an injunction. Every element has \n56 of 59 \n \n\nbeen shown by Plaintiffs in this proceeding in regards to their Section 1396a(a)(23) claim. A \nTRO will therefore issue. \n \nVI.  FINAL ISSUES   \nA.  UNNECESSITY OF ANY SECURITY \nRule 65 allows a court to “issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order \nonly if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs \nand damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” FED. \nR. CIV. P. 65(c). This requirement, however, may be waived where the gravity of interest is great \nand no proper showing of a harm’s likelihood or a probable loss is made. See, e.g., Kaepa, Inc. v. \nAchilles Corp., 76 F.3d 624, 628 (5th Cir. 1996); City of Atlanta v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit \nAuth., 636 F.2d 1084, 1094 (5th Cir. Feb. 1981). Here, as in Selig, Defendant has neither \nrequested a security were this Court to issue an injunction nor presented any evidence that it \nwould be financially harmed if it were wrongfully enjoined. In addition, as Plaintiffs note, \n“[w]hether these individuals obtain these services at PPGC (their provider of choice) or \nelsewhere will have no effect on Louisiana’s budget.” (Doc. 46 at 28.) Based on these facts and \non Defendant’s failure to ask for a bond or plead an economic harm, this Court sees no credible \nreason to force a bond’s execution. \n \nB.  CLASS INJUNCTION \nPlaintiffs argue that they have been singled out because of the alleged (but disputed) \nconduct of a separate but connected company that appeared in one of CMP’s videos and that \nPlaintiffs played no role in that conduct. (Doc. 45-1 at 2–3.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendant has \n57 of 59 \n \n\nattempted to terminate its contracts because of the personal animus against it. This animus, they \ncontend, is unrelated to the admittedly competent services that it renders in Louisiana which are, \nin turn, unrelated to the conduct in the videos. In fact, the uncontradicted evidence in the record \nat this time is that PPGC does not perform abortions in Louisiana, is not involved in the sale of \nfetal tissue and none of the conduct in question occurred at the PPGC’s two Louisiana facilities. \nBased on the record before it, it appears likely that Plaintiff will be able to prove that the \nattempted terminations against it are motivated and driven, at least in large part, by reasons \nunrelated to its competence and unique to it. However, the Court finds it is not necessary and \ntherefore it need not at this time rule on Plaintiffs’ equal protection argument. See, e.g., Lyng v. \nNw. Indian Cemetry Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S. Ct. 1319, 1323, 1323, 99 L. Ed. \n2d 534 (1988) (“A fundamental and long-standing principle of judicial restraint requires that \ncourts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.”); cf. \nBRYAN A. GARNER & ANTONINA SCALIA, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS \n249–51 (2012) (discussing this rule’s bases). \nNonetheless, the uncontradicted evidence in the record is that BRHC relies to a \nsignificant degree on Medicaid reimbursements. The Court finds that if the Agreements are \nterminated, this facility would suffer significant financial loss and might have no choice but to \nclose. In order to insure that meaningful relief is given to the Jane Doe Plaintiffs and that these \nIndividual Plaintiffs have their free choice of provider, which claim they have established (at \nleast at this preliminary stage), the Court’s temporary restraining order will extend to all DHH-\nPPGC provider agreements applicable to all Medicaid-enrolled patients. The Court therefore \ndefers action at this time on Plaintiffs’ alternative request for class certification to a more \nappropriate date and time.  \n58 of 59 \n \n\n \nVII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, PPGC and the Individual Plaintiffs have met their burden, \ndemonstrating every element necessary for the issuance of a temporary restraining order with \ncredible evidence and persuasive precedent. Accordingly,  \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 53) is DENIED. \nPlaintiffs; Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and for Preliminary \nInjunction (Doc. 46) is GRANTED IN PART. Effective October 18, 2015, at 11:59 p.m., CST, \nDefendant is ENJOINED from terminating any of its Medicaid provider agreements with PPGC, \nincluding, but not limited to, Provider Numbers 91338, 133689, 45802, and 133673. The \ntemporary restraining order will remain in force for fourteen (14) days from the date of its entry \nunless, pursuant to Rule 65(b)(2), the Court, for good cause shown or with the agreement of the \nParties, extends it. \nA telephone status conference is set for Monday, October 19, 2015, at 2:30 p.m., for the \npurpose of discussing the extension of this order during discovery, setting a scheduling order for \ndiscovery, a hearing date for the preliminary injunction, and setting other appropriate cut-offs. \nThe Plaintiffs will arrange for the conference call and circulate the number to the Court and \ncounsel by 1:00 p.m., Central Standard Time, on October 19, 2015. \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction will be DEFERRED but remain pending \nand will be set for a date that will allow the parties adequate time for discovery.  \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on October 18, 2015 \n \n   S \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n59 of 59 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n  Before the Court is the Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction filed by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (“PPGC” or “Planned \nParenthood”), appearing on behalf of both itself and three patients—Jane Does #1, 2, and 3 \n(“Individual Plaintiffs”)1 (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)—and based on Section 1396a(a)(23)(A) of \nthe United States Code’s Forty-Second Title (“Medicaid Act”)2  and the First and Fourteenth \n                                                      \n1 The Individual Plaintiffs “appear pseudonymously because of the private and personal nature of \nthe medical care that they receive at PPGC, and their desire not to have that information become \npublic in order for them to assert their legal rights.” (Doc. 1 at 5.) Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion \nseeking permission to use these pseudonyms was filed on August 25, 2015, (Doc. 5), and granted \non August 26, 2015, (Doc. 11). \n2 In this opinion, any reference to “Section 1396a(a)” or “§ 1396a(a)” is to this section of the \nMedicaid Act unless otherwise noted. Section 1396a(a)(23) will thus be referred to as “Section \n1396a(a)(23)” or “§ 1396a(a)(23)” or by its oft-used title, “free-choice-of-provider” provision. \n1 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 2 of 80\nAmendments of the United States Constitution. (Doc. 46 at 17–26; Doc. 53 ¶¶ 62–67 at 19–20; \nDoc. 45 at 1–2.) The arguments made in support of this motion appear in the Memorandum of \nLaw in Support of Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary \nInjunction (“Plaintiffs’ Renewed Memorandum”), (Doc. 46), and Memorandum Regarding \nAvailability of State Remedy (“Plaintiffs’ Remedy Memorandum”), (Doc. 52). Plaintiffs’ request \nis opposed by Louisiana’s Department of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”), whose head, Secretary \nKathy H. Kliebert, is being sued in her official capacity and is therefore this matter’s named \ndefendant (“Kliebert” or “Defendant”).3  Defendant’s arguments are put forth in the Motion to \nDismiss Complaint for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim (“Motion \nto Dismiss”), (Doc. 53), supported by the attached Memorandum in Support of Motion to \nDismiss Complaint for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim \n(“Defendant’s Memorandum”), (Doc. 53-1). Although no evidentiary hearing was held, the \nmatter was thoroughly briefed and argued. The Court has carefully considered the pleadings and \nbriefings to date, which are discussed in more detail below.4 The Court also thoroughly \nconsidered the oral arguments and representations of counsel at hearings held on September 2, \n                                                      \n3 As permitted by precedent, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 152, 28 S. Ct. 441, 451, 52 L. Ed. \n714 (1908); accord Guillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-Gomez, 585 F.3d 508, 530 n.24 (1st Cir. \n2009), Plaintiffs sue for injunctive relief against Ms. Kliebert in her official capacity, (Doc. 1 at \n5). To wit, the true defendant here is Louisiana, not Ms. Kliebert or even DHH. See Will v. Mich. \nDep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989). In light of this \nduality, this Court will therefore alternate between feminine and third person pronouns \nthroughout this opinion.   \n4 These motions include the first Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction (“Motion for TRO”), (Doc. 4); Memorandum of Law in Support of \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (“Plaintiffs’ \nMemorandum”), (Doc. 4-1); Defendant’s Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary \nRestraining Order (“Defendant’s Opposition”), (Doc. 13); Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum of \nLaw in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (“Plaintiffs’ Reply \nMemorandum”), (Doc. 22); the Statement of Interest of the United States (“Statement of \nInterest”), (Doc. 24); and Defendant’s Reply to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Statement of \nInterest (“Defendant’s Reply”), (Doc. 31). \n2 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 3 of 80\n2015 (“First Hearing”), and on October 16, 2015 (“Second Hearing”).  \nOn Sunday, October 18, this Court issued an order denying Defendant’s motion to  \ndismiss and granting Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, (Doc. 55). It set a \nstatus conference for the following day.  At that status conference, all parties agreed that no \nfurther discovery and no further argument was necessary for this Court to make its determination \non whether to issue a preliminary injunction, (Doc. 58). Both parties expressed “no objection to \nconverting the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction.” (Id.) This agreement was \nreaffirmed in a telephone status conference on October 28, 2015. (Doc. 62.) By the Parties’ \nexpress consent, the evidentiary record has therefore been finalized, and any factual allegations \nleft uncontroverted must be accepted as true.  \nOn October 28, 2015, by way of Notice of Supplemental Authority, Plaintiffs brought to \nthe Court’s attention a case decided the same day which addresses the identical issue confronting  \nthis Court, in which the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the Governor of \nAlabama and others from suspending Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. \nand from failing to reinstate the State’s provider agreement with that entity. (Doc. 61 (attaching \nDoc. 63, Planned Parenthood Se., Inc. v. Bentley, No. 2:15-cv-620-MHT-TFM (M.D. Ala. \nOctober 28, 2015) (Opinion) (“Bentley”)).)5 \nFor the reasons first set out in the Order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction, (Doc. 55), and more fully set forth below, the Court \ndetermines that Plaintiffs have met their burden for a preliminary injunction to maintain the \nstatus quo. The Court therefore enjoins from suspending Medicaid payments to PPGC for \n                                                      \n5 In referencing these recent cases, this Court cites to the original decision and docket rather than \nits number, as an attachment, in this case’s docket. For example, the relevant decision in Bentley \nbears Docket Number 63 in its own docket, but it appears in this proceeding as Document \nNumber 61. Both document numbers will be given when the decision is first cited. \n3 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 4 of 80\nservices rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries, including but not limited to the Individual Plaintiffs \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2).6 The preliminary injunction will remain in \neffect until it is revised, if at all, by this Court’s own further order or by a decision of the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (“Fifth Circuit”). For the reasons set forth \nhereinafter, the Court declines to require security under Rule 65(c) from PPGC or the Individual \nPlaintiffs. \n \nII.  FACTUAL AND STATUTORY BACKGROUND \nA.  PARTIES \nDefendant is sued in her official capacity, as she is the head of DHH, (Doc. 1 ¶ 19 at 4; \nDoc 43 ¶ 20 at 6; Doc. 53-1 at 1). DHH administers this state’s Medicaid Program, a dual state-\nfederal assistance program for families and individuals with low income and limited resources \nencoded in 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.7 (See also, e.g., Doc. 1 ¶ 20 at 5; Doc. 13-1 ¶¶ 1–4 at 1–2; \nDoc. 43 ¶ 20 at 6; Doc. 53-1 at 1–4.) DHH does so by monitoring the allocation of federal-state \nfunds in Louisiana and submitting a state plan for medical assistance for review and approval to \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), operating under a delegation of \n                                                      \n6 Any and all references to “Rule” or “Rules” in this order are to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure unless otherwise noted. \n7 Created by the addition of Title XIX to the Social Security Act, Social Security Amendments of \n1965, Pub. L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.), \nMedicaid “furnishes . . . medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of \naged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services,” 42 U.S.C. § 1396-1; see also John V. Jacobi, Multiple \nMedicaid Missions: Targeting, Universalism, or Both?, 15 YALE J. HEALTH POL’Y L. & ETHICS \n89, 89, 91–92, 98 (2015) (discussing the Act’s manifold purposes). Medicaid offers the “States a \nbargain: Congress provides federal funds in exchange for the States’ agreement to spend them in \naccordance with congressionally imposed conditions” and the statute’s implementing \nregulations. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1382, 191 L. Ed. 2d 471 \n(2015); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a; 42 C.F.R. § 430.15.   \n4 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 5 of 80\nauthority from the Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”). LA. \nR.S. §§ 46:437:2(B), 46:437.13;8 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a); 42 C.F.R. 431.10. In accordance with the \nLouisiana Medical Assistance Programs Integrity Law (“MAPIL”), Medicaid providers must \nsign a contract with DHH and satisfy several requirements. LA. R.S. §§ 46:437:11, 46:437.13. \n(See also Doc. 13-1 ¶¶ 1–4 at 1–2.) DHH’s powers are circumscribed by statute while many of \nits relevant regulations appear in Title 50 of the Louisiana Administrative Code.9 (Doc. 53-1 at \n2–4; see also Doc. 13-1 ¶ 3 at 1.) In this case, DHH initially invoked Section 46:437.11(D)(1), \n(Doc. 13 at 1–2, 13, 18; Doc. 53-1 at 1; Hr’g Tr. 11:25–12:8, Sept. 2, 2015), and presently relies \nupon Sections 46.437(D)(2) and 46:437.14(A) and Title 50, (Doc. 39-1 at 1–2, 5–6, 8–9, 11–12; \nDoc. 53-1 at 3–4, 24). \nPPGC is a charitable organization, so classified under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(1), U.S. DEP’T OF THE TREASURY, INTERNAL REVENUE SERV., \nFORM 990 at 1 (2012). (Doc. 43 ¶ 10 at 4; see also Doc. 4-2 ¶ 5 at 2.) Headquartered in Houston, \nTexas, it maintains its legal domicile in the Lone Star State, FORM 990 at 1, but is licensed to do \nbusiness in Louisiana, (Doc. 43 ¶ 10 at 4; see also, e.g., Doc. 1 ¶ 9 at 3; Doc. 4-2 ¶ 5 at 2.) PPGC \noperates family planning centers and clinics in the Houston area of Texas and in Louisiana. \n(Doc. 43 ¶¶ 10–11 at 4; see also Doc. 1 ¶ 10 at 3–4.) Its first center founded in 1984, PPGC’s \ntwo Louisiana clinics—the Baton Rouge Health Center (“BRHC”) and the New Orleans Health \nCenter (“NOHC”)—participate in Louisiana’s Medicaid Program, “providing medical services to \nlow-income enrollees in both underserved communities.” (Doc. 1 ¶ 10 at 3–4; Doc. 43 ¶ 11 at 4; \nsee also Hr’g Tr. 10:25–11:6, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \n                                                      \n8 In this opinion, any reference to “Section 46:437” or “§ 46:437” is to this statutory section \nunless otherwise noted. \n9 In this opinion, any reference to “Title 50” is to this part of Louisiana’s administrative code. \n5 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 6 of 80\nIn fiscal year 2014, the two facilities in Louisiana served over 5,200 Medicaid patients \nand were visited by over 10,000 women. (See, e.g., Doc. 43 ¶ 13 at 4; Doc. 1 ¶ 40 at 11; Hr’g Tr. \n8:23–24, Sept. 2, 2015.)  “Nearly 75%” of the visits to BRHC were by patients enrolled in \nMedicaid; “[n]early 40%” of appointments at NOHC were with similarly classified individuals. \n(Doc. 3 ¶¶ 9–10 at 3–4; Doc. 43 ¶ 11 at 4.) “[C]urrently, over 60% of PPGC’s Louisiana visits \nare for patients enrolled in the Medicaid program.” (Doc. ¶ 13 at 4.) The services offered by \nthese two centers include “physical exams, contraception and contraceptive counseling, \nscreening for breast cancer, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, testing and treating for \ncertain sexually transmitted diseases . . ., pregnancy testing and counseling, and certain \nprocedures[,] including colposcopy.” (Doc. 1 ¶ 10 at 3–4; Doc. 4-2 ¶ 8 at 3; Doc. 43 ¶ 11 at 4; \nHr’g Tr. 7:24–8:7, 8:16–9:9, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \nNeither BRHC nor NOHC performs abortions. (Doc. 1 ¶ 11 at 4; Doc. 43 ¶ 12 at 4; Doc. \n46-1 ¶ 5 at 2; Hr’g Tr. 21:22–25:3, Oct. 16, 2015.) Neither currently has or has ever had a fetal \ntissue donation program. (Doc. 46 at 11; Doc. 46-1 ¶ 21 at 6.)  \n  The Individual Plaintiffs rely upon Medicaid and receive their medical care from one of \nPPGC’s two facilities. (Doc. 4-3, 4-4, 4-5.) They wish to continue to obtain their reproductive \ncare from PPGC and do not know where they could elsewhere get the same kind of care. (Doc. \n4-3 ¶¶ 6–7 at 2; Doc. 4-4 ¶ 8 at 2; Doc. 4-5 ¶ 6 at 2; Hr’g Tr. 8:23–9:9, Sept. 2, 2015.) Jane Doe \n#2 became a patient at NOHC after her former doctor refused to accept Medicaid, (Doc. 4-4 ¶ 3 \nat 1), and Jane Doe #2 has found it “very difficult to find doctors in Baton Rouge who will \naccept Medicaid,” (Doc. 4-5 ¶ 3 at 1). In this proceeding, they are intended to represent the \ninterests of many of PPGC’s other Medicaid patients throughout the state of Louisiana. (See, \ne.g., Doc. 46 at 29–30; Doc. 49-1 at 10.) \n6 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 7 of 80\n \nB.  PRECIPITATING EVENTS \nOn February 19, 2014, pursuant to the concurrent resolutions of Louisiana’s House of \nRepresentatives and Senate, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor (“Auditor”) reviewed “a sample \nof Medicaid payments DHH during calendar year 2012 to determine if they were appropriate and \nsupported.” (Doc. 46-1 at 14 (LOUISIANA LEGISLATIVE AUDITOR, RESPONSE TO SENATE \nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 57 AND HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 105, 2013 REGULAR SESSION 1 \n(Feb. 19, 2014)).10 “Overall,” the resulting report (“Legislative Audit”) “found that DHH [only] \nmade payments to Planned Parenthood for allowable family planning procedure codes under \nMedicaid” and unearthed no “indication that Planned Parenthood recommended an abortion or \nperformed an abortion for th[ose] patients.”11 (Id.) More specifically, having “extracted and \nanalyzed claims data for all 25,936 claims DHH paid to Planned Parenthood for Medicaid \nreimbursements during calendar year 2012,” the Legislative Auditor “did not find any evidence \nthat Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood were not made . . . for allowable Family Planning \nprocedure codes.” (Id. at 15 (emphasis added).) From these 25,936 claims, the Auditor \n“identified 22 patients that subsequently suffered a miscarriage” and failed to find “any \nindication that Planned Parenthood recommended an abortion or performed an abortion for these \npatients.” (Id.)12 Under Louisiana law, the Legislative Audit is “a public document” and was \n“distributed to appropriate public officials.” (Id.) \n                                                      \n10 The Audit Report also appears as an attachment to the Motion for TRO. (Doc. 4-2 at 19–22.) \n11 This report would be mentioned during the First Hearing. (Hr’g Tr. 4:21–5:2, Sept. 2, 2015.) \n12 In essence, therefore, the Legislative Audit seems to ratify a statement made by a DHH official \nin an email sent on July 25, 2013: “At this point in time, we do not have credible evidence of \nMedicaid fraud by Planned Parenthood in Louisiana that would permit the Department from \nwithholding or ceasing payment for Medicaid services.” (Doc. 46-3 at 2.)  \n7 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 8 of 80\nIn July 2015, the Center for Medical Progress (“CMP”) released a series of edited videos \nwhich purported to document discussions regarding the acquisition of tissue samples between \nvarious Planned Parenthood affiliates’ officials and disguised actors. See Kevin Litten, Bobby \nJindal Announces Investigation into Planned Parenthood, THE TIMES-PICAYUNE, July 14, 2015; \nPlanned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s \nLargest Abortion Provider: Hearing Before the H. Comm on Judiciary, 114th Cong. 192–201 \n(2015) (Analysis of CMP Video by Fusion GPS). Thereafter, DHH exercised its “oversight over \nall health facilities in the state” and requested that PPGC “answer some simple questions about . . \n. [its] current operations and planned operations in Louisiana.” (Doc. 46-1 at 51–52 (Letter from \nKathy Kliebert, Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & Hosps., State of Louisiana, to Melaney Linton, Pres., \nPlanned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (July 15, 2015)) (“Defendant’s July Letter”). DHH gave \nPPGC until July 24, 2015, to respond. (Id. at 51.) \nOn July 24, 2015, PPGC did so. (Doc. 46-1 at 54–58 (Letter from Melaney A. Linton, \nPres. & CEO, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc., to Kathy Kliebert, Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & \nHosps., State of Louisiana (July 24, 2015)) (“PPGC’s July Letter”). This letter recaps PPGC’s \nhistory in Louisiana and denies the accusations made by CMP. (Id. at 54–55.) In it, Ms. Melaney \nA. Linton, PPGC’s President and Chief Executive Officer and this letter’s author (“Ms. Linton”), \nclarifies that PPGC “does not offer abortion services” in Louisiana. (Id. at 55.) PPGC \nacknowledged its link to Planned Parenthood Center for Choice, Inc. (“PPCFC”), a “standalone \ncorporation” and a department of PPGC until 2005, and described itself as an “affiliate” of \nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America (“PPFA”). (Id.) PPGC then responded to each of \nDefendant’s questions, emphasizing that neither PPGC nor PPCFC provide abortion services in \nLouisiana. (Id. at 55, 57.) To the question of whether any PPGC “facilities, or any affiliates, \n8 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 9 of 80\nsubsidiaries, or associates thereof, sell or donate any unborn baby organs or body parts,”13 PPGC \nanswered, “No.” (Id. at 56.) To another—“How many clinics operated by Planned Parenthood \nGulf Coast, or any affiliates, subsidiaries, or associates thereof, do business with . . . any . . . \norganizations in the business of selling or donating the remains of unborn babies?”—PPGC \nanswered, “None”. (Id.) \nOn August 4, 2015, Defendant sent a second letter to PPGC. (Id. at 60–61 (Letter from \nKathy Kliebert, Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & Hosps., State of Louisiana, to Melaney Linton, Pres., \nPlanned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. (Aug. 4, 2015)) (“Defendant’s August Letter”). It zeroes in \non three statements in PPGC’s July Letter: “PPCFC does not have a fetal tissue donation \nprogram in Texas currently”; “PPCFC disposes of Pathological Waste through an entity that is \nlicensed for disposal of Special Waste from Health Care-Related Facilities”; and its “No” \nresponse to the question of whether “any Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast facilities, or any \naffiliates, subsidiaries, or associates thereof, sell or donate any unborn baby organs or body \nparts.” (Id. at 60.) Defendant characterized these answers as being “directly contradict[ed]” by \nanother “recently released video made on April 9, 2015 at the Planned Parenthood facility in \nHouston, Texas, in which Melissa Farrell, Director of Research at Planned Parenthood Gulf \nCoast (PPGC), discusses existing contracts for fetal tissue donation for the purpose of research.” \n(Id.)  \nOn August 14, 2015, PPGC responded. (Doc. 46-1 at 63 (Letter from Melaney A. Linton, \nPres. & CEO, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc., to Kathy Kliebert, Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & \nHosps., State of Louisiana (Aug. 14, 2015) (“PPGC’s August Letter”)) (“PPGC’s August \n                                                      \n13 Texas law apparently allows for the donation of the “products of spontaneous or induced \nhuman abortions, regardless of the period of gestation” to certain types of organizations and for \nparticular purposes. 25 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 1.132(40)(B), 1.133(a)(2)(B). In PPGC’s July \nLetter, it admitted that PPCFC disposes of such products in accordance with this law.  \n9 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 10 of 80\nLetter”) On behalf of both PPGC and PPCFC, Ms. Linton denied the existence of any \ncontradiction, as “neither PPCFC nor PPGC currently has a fetal tissue donation program in \nTexas, and neither sells nor donates fetal tissue.” (Id. at 63.) The letter proceeds to address each \nnew question posed in Defendant’s August Letter. (Id. at 64–65.) \n \nC.  OVERVIEW OF THE FIRST AND SECOND TERMINATION ACTIONS \n1.  First Termination Letters, Kennedy Declarations, and CMS’ Statement of Interest \nOn August 3, 2015, Defendant notified PPGC of its intent to terminate the Agreements \npursuant to § 46:137.11(D)(1) via four letters (“First Termination Letters”). (Doc. 1 ¶ 30 at 8; \nDoc. 13 at 1.) As this statute required, DHH gave PPGC 30-days’ notice from the relevant \nletters’ receipt. (Doc. 13 at 1–2.) The letters gave no reason for DHH’s decision. (Doc. 1 ¶ 32 at \n8; see also Doc. 13 at 18, 20; Hr’g Tr. 14:6–8, Sept. 2, 2015.) In response, Plaintiffs filed their \nfirst complaint. (Doc. 1.)  \nOn that day, the Honorable Piyush “Bobby” Jindal, governor of Louisiana (“Jindal” or \n“Governor”), published a press release announcing the Agreements’ looming terminations. Press \nRelease, Hon. Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, Governor Jindal Announces the \nTermination of Medicaid Contract with Planned Parenthood (Aug. 3, 2015).14  This document \nstates: “Governor Jindal and DHH decided to give the required 30-day notice to terminate the \nPlanned Parenthood Medicaid provider contract because Planned Parenthood does not represent \nthe values of the State of Louisiana in regards to respecting human life.” Id. It continues: \n“Planned Parenthood does not represent the values of the people of Louisiana and shows a \nfundamental disrespect for human life,” and, “It has become clear that this is not an organization \n                                                      \n14 While never submitted as an exhibit, the press release was incorporated by reference in \nPlaintiffs’ first complaint. (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 32–33 at 8.) \n10 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 11 of 80\nthat is worthy of receiving public assistance from the state.” Id. It refers to the possibility that \nPPGC “could be acting in violation of Louisiana law that states no person or group contracting \nwith the state or receiving governmental assistance shall require or recommend that any women \nhave an abortion.” Id. It concludes: “Pending the ongoing investigation, DHH reserves the right \nto amend the cancellation notice and terminate the provider agreement immediately should cause \nbe determined.” Id.  \nDuring the First Termination Action, among the many documents docketed by the \nParties, Defendant submitted a declaration by Ms. J. Ruth Kennedy (“Ms. Kennedy”), the \nMedicaid Director of DHH (“First Kennedy Declaration”), (Doc. 13-2 ¶¶ 1–5 at 1). (Doc. 13 at \n21–22.) The First Kennedy Declaration’s sixth paragraph states: “There are no Medicaid services \nthat only family planning clinics provide that could not be[ ]provided by other enrolled Medicaid \nproviders in the State of Louisiana, including in New Orleans and Baton Rouge.” (Doc. 13-2 ¶ 6 \nat 2.) Its seventh further explains: “Any physician/physician extender and appropriately certified \nlab can provide family planning and related services as long as it is within their license and \nscope.” (Id. ¶ 7, at 2.) Per the next paragraph, “[t]here are 1,146 actively enrolled Medicaid \nproviders in Region 1, covering the Greater New Orleans area, and 864 actively enrolled \nMedicaid providers in Region 2, covering the Greater Baton Rouge area, that can provide family \nplanning and related services.” (Id. ¶ 8 at 2; see also Doc. 13 at 21.) A sorted provider list is \nattached; it includes dermatologists, dentists, audiologists, cosmetic surgeons, and orthopedic \nsurgeons. (Doc. 13-2 at 5–41; see also Hr’g Tr. 23:18–25:2, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \nThis First Kennedy Declaration also describes two telephonic conferences between CMS \nand DHH officials. According to Ms. Kennedy, on August 6, 2015, CMS advised DHH that the \nlatter “has the authority to withhold federal Medicaid dollars from Louisiana or seek injunctive \n11 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 12 of 80\nrelief for the failure to comply with the Medicaid Act.” (Doc. 13-2 ¶ 10 at 2.) CMS and DHH \nheld a second conference call on August 21, 2015, in which CMS “advised” DHH “it would be \nsending a letter . . . confirming what CMS and HHS counsel had verbally conveyed to the \nDepartment during the August 6, 2015 conference call.” (Id. ¶ 11 at 2.) 15 \nOn August 31, 2015, the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of CMS and \nDHHS, filed a Statement of Interest. (Doc. 24.) The United States did so due to “its strong \ninterests in the proper operation of the Medicaid program . . . and in ensuring that the [s]tates \nadminister their federally-subsidized Medicaid programs in a manner that is consistent with the \nMedicaid statute.” (Id. at 2.) Basically, the Statement of Interest makes three broad points.  \nFirst, because DHH has sought to terminate the Agreements “without providing any \njustification related to PPGC’s qualifications to provide medical services,” DHH’s proposed \ntermination will run afoul of § 1396a(a)(23). (Id.; see also Doc. 22 at 2, 5, 6.) To read Section \n1396a(a)(23) differently would both “strip the Medicaid Act’s free choice of provider provision \nof all meaning.” (Doc. 24 at 3.) It would simultaneously “contravene clear congressional intent \nto give Medicaid beneficiaries the right to receive covered services from any qualified and \nwilling provider.” (Id.)  \nSecond, the Statement of Interest declares that DHH’s interpretation is “inconsistent” \nwith “the overwhelming weight of authority” and with DHHS’ own “considered and \n                                                      \n15 A second declaration submitted by Ms. Kennedy (“Second Kennedy Declaration”) gives a \nsomewhat different description of this call with CMS, offering up far more detail about the \ncontent of these conversations: “On the August 6, 2015, conference call . . . CMS and HHS told \nthe Department that the any willing provider provisions under § 1396a(a)(23) was not all \ninclusive, but illustrative and that the Department could have other reasons to remove a provider \nfrom its program that were unrelated to the provider’s ability to perform the Medicaid-covered \nservices or properly bill for those services.” (Doc. 31-1 ¶ 6 at 2.) The Second Kennedy \nDeclaration continues: “CMS and HHS advised the Department that the validity of a state’s \nreasons for terminating a provider are made on a case by case basis.” (Id.) \n12 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 13 of 80\nlongstanding views.” (Id. at 3, 4, 19–22.) It describes DHH’s interpretation of Section \n1396a(a)(23) as “not even a plausible reading of the statute,” “certainly not compelled by the text \nof the provision,” and likely to “undermine[] the provision’s intent.” (Id. at 20.) Meanwhile, \nDHHS “has repeatedly and consistently interpreted the ‘qualified’ language in § 1396a(a)(23) to \nprohibit a State from denying access to a provider for reasons unrelated to the ability of that \nprovider to perform Medicaid-covered services or to properly bill for those services.” (Id. at 3–\n4.) Its view “is eminently reasonable,” verified by a dictionary, and recognizes “[a] role for \nStates to set reasonable restrictions related to a provider’s ability to provide competent and \nskilled services” without “read[ing]” Section 1396a(a)(23) “out of the statute altogether, as \nLouisiana desires.” (Id. at 21.) It contends that this interpretation, made by CMS “under authority \ndelegated to it by Congress,” merits deference. (Id.)  \nFinally, the Statement of Interest affirms CMS’ view that “Medicaid beneficiaries” like \nthe Individual Plaintiffs “may enforce their statutory rights under § 1396a(a)(23) to their choice \nof a qualified provider through a private action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983” even after Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1382, 191 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2015) (“Armstrong”). \n(Doc. 24 at 2, 21; see also Doc. 22 at 2–5.)  \n \n2.  First Hearing  \nOn September 2, 2015, the First Hearing was held. (Doc. 30.) \nDuring its course, the Parties’ positions on Section 1396a(a)(23) were clarified. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel explained: “We’re here because the termination violates the Jane Doe \nPlaintiffs’ . . . right to free choice of provider under Section [1396]a(a)(23) of the Medicaid Act.” \n(Hr’g Tr. 4:10–12, Sept. 2, 2015.) Because PPGC is “competent to provide services,” it argued \n13 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 14 of 80\nthat it was “qualified” within this subsection’s meaning. (Hr’g Tr. 4:16–5:12, Sept. 2, 2015.) The \nclaim before the Court in the Motion for TRO was the Individual Plaintiffs’ claims under this \nprovision of the “federal Medicaid act,” Plaintiffs’ counsel emphasized. (Hr’g Tr. 10:17–19, \nSept. 2, 2015.) In Plaintiffs’’ view, whether or not PPGC held some administrative right was \nirrelevant, as the Individual Plaintiffs always lacked such prerogatives. (Hr’g Tr. 10:15–19, Sept. \n2, 2015.) On the Individual Plaintiffs’ behalves, PPGC contested Defendant’s claim that Section \n1396a(a)(23) creates no private cause of action. (Hr’g Tr. 4:10–15, 6:23–7:15, Sept. 2, 2015.) \nSpecifically, it argued that it “clearly fulfills the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in \nBlessing [v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 117 S. Ct. 1353, 137 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1997) (“Blessing”),] \nand then in the Gonzaga [University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 153 L. Ed. 2d 309, 122 S. Ct. 2268 \n(2002) (“Gonzaga”),] . . . cases.”16 (Hr’g Tr. 6:13–19, Sept. 2, 2015.) In other words, this \nsubsection uses “rights creating language that unambiguously confers a right on Medicaid \npatients” and is not “so vague and amorphous that . . . [it would] strain[] judicial competence to \nenforce.” (Hr’g Tr. 6:15–19, Sept. 2, 2015.) Plaintiffs sought to distinguish the more recent \nArmstrong from the body of law spawned by these cases by maintaining that it not only dealt \nwith “a completely different section of the Medicaid Act,” one “without the same kind of rights \ncreating language,” but also lacked any Section 1983 claim. (Hr’g Tr. 6:24–7:4, 7:7–15, Sept. 2, \n2015.)  \nDefendant’s counsel countered that Section 1396a(a)(30) was substantially identical to \nSection 1396a(a)(23). These two subsections have “the exact same rights creating type of \nlanguage”; both “say what the state plan should provide.” (Hr’g Tr. 16:17–22, Sept. 2, 2015.) He \nthus urged the Court to adopt the reasoning of the plurality in Armstrong. (Hr’g Tr. 14:10–15:8, \n                                                      \n16 The relevant test is discussed later in this opinion. See infra Part V.  \n14 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 15 of 80\n16:4–10, 16:13–14, 19:21–24, 22:24, 23:13 14, Sept. 2, 2015.) Defendant’s counsel also insisted \nthat Section 1396a(a)(23)’s “qualified” requirement was “a very vague standard.” (Hr’g Tr. \n18:1–2, Sept. 2, 2015.) Having proposed a number of denotations, (Doc. 13 at 8), Defendant’s \ncounsel based this conclusion on his “conversations” with CMS and the supposed \n“[un]reasonabl[eness]” of CMS’ contrary interpretation, (Hr’g Tr. 16:24–17:10, 17:24–18:9, \nSept. 2, 2015). Because “qualified” is inherently vague and ambiguous, Section 1396a(a)(23) \ncannot meet the Blessing test’s requirement that a right not be “so vague and amorphous as to be \nbeyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.”17 (Doc. 13 at 4, 8.) Defendant promised to \n“flesh out” her position in a response to the Statement of Interest. (Hr’g Tr. 17:1–2, Sept. 2, \n2015.) \nPPGC’s competence to provide the Medicaid services was also discussed. In response to \nthis Court’s question regarding whether DHH had yet “raised any suggestion or made any \nsuggestion that the reason for terminating the contract has anything to do with competency or the \nadequacy of the care that is given” by PPGC “to the patients who get their care at those \nfacilities,” Plaintiffs’ counsel answered, “No.” (Hr’g Tr. 3:19–24, Sept. 2, 2015.) When this \nCourt posed the same question to Defendant’s counsel—“There is no question . . . about the \ncompetency of these two facilities to provide Medicaid services and adequate care for the \npatients that they serve, would you agree with that?”—Defendant’s counsel answered, “At this \ntime, I would agree with that.” (Hr’g Tr. 11:11–16, Sept. 2, 2015.) Additionally, when asked, \n“They’re not qualified because you’re terminating their contract?” Defendant’s counsel \n                                                      \n17 It is unclear whether Defendant was also articulating a deference argument on her own behalf \nor simply trying to meet the second Blessing prong. Her statements can be read in both ways, as \narguing that “qualified” is either so ambiguous as to confer interpretive discretion on DHH or so \nvague as to not satisfy Blessing. Either approach, however, fails to account for the statute’s plain \nlanguage and much precedent. See infra Part V.B.1. \n15 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 16 of 80\nanswered, “Exactly,” and admitted that DHH’s definition of “qualified” was “circular”: PPGC \nwas no longer a “qualified” provider because DHH had made it so by terminating their contract, \na mechanism he then stated had never before been utilized in quite this manner. (Hr’g Tr. 21:10–\n13, 22–25, 22:10–13, Sept. 2, 2015.) He also acknowledged that the “current motive” or “the \nmotive leading up to” the Agreements’ termination was CMP’s video tapes. (Hr’g Tr. 12:8–16, \nSept. 2, 2015; see also Hr’g Tr. 35:12–19, Oct. 16, 2015.) \nThe Parties finally contested the capacity of this state’s other Medicaid providers to \nabsorb PPGC’s patients. PPGC characterized the list included with the First Kennedy \nDeclaration as containing “numerous examples of[,] on their face[,] providers that would not \nprovide the care that Planned Parenthood provides, including dentists, radiologists, nursing \nhomes, [and other] places that are not going to do breast cancer screening or give out birth \ncontrol.” (Hr’g Tr. 8:18–22, Sept. 2, 2015.) PPGC maintained that “there’s no way that . . . other \nalternative providers have the capacity to absorb our patients.” (Hr’g Tr. 9:2–4, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \nDefendant’s counsel admitted that the Individual Plaintiffs would suffer “disruption of \nsome kind,” being forced, “to get other doctors” and “seek out other places to get their health \ncare.” (Hr’g Tr. 13:6–12, Sept. 2, 2105.) Defendant’s counsel also clarified the origins of the list \nof providers referenced in the Defendant’s Opposition and the First Kennedy Declaration. (Hr’g \nTr. 23:18–25:9, Sept. 2, 2015.) It reflected “typically billed” codes, and was the result of “a code \nrun” of providers that “can provide family planning services because they have billed for them” \nby Defendant. (Hr’g Tr. 24:4–6, 25:1–6, Sept. 2, 2015.) \n \n3.  Third Kennedy Declaration  \nAfter the First Hearing, Defendant sought permission to amend its opposition and \n16 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 17 of 80\nsubstitute new papers “pursuant to . . . [its] duty to provide accurate information to the Court.” \n(Doc. 32 at 1.) Included in Defendant’s proposed amendments was a third declaration by Ms. \nKennedy (“Third Kennedy Declaration”). This Third Kennedy Declaration corrects Defendant’s \nfirst list of providers, explaining: “I[, Ms. Kennedy,] ordered a comprehensive review of this \nexhibit and have since discovered that nursing facilities and dentists should not have been \nincluded.” (Doc. 34-2 ¶ 8a at 2; see also Doc. 34 at 2.) It adds: “The other provider types \nincluded in Exhibit 1 are appropriate due to what they are allowed to do under the scope of their \nlicense.” (Doc. 34-2 ¶ 8a at 2; see also Doc. 34 at 2.) It gives two other examples: \n“[A]nesthesiologists, who can be reimbursed for their role in sterilization procedures[,] and \nradiologists, who can be reimbursed for reading ultrasounds, etc. related to \nreproductive/women’s health issues.” (Id.)  \nThis “review of the information in [the First Kennedy Declaration] also revealed a more \nprecise description of Medicaid providers in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge areas other than \nPPGC who are available to patients seeking family planning and related services.” (Doc. 34 at 2.) \nDefendant’s staff had “gather[ed] information from available Medicaid providers in proximity to \nthe two Planned Parenthood locations in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.” (Doc. 34-2 \n¶ 8b at 2.)  \nAs a result of this additional inquiry, Ms. Kennedy had decided to cull the list of relevant \nproviders from over one-thousand (2,000) to twenty-nine (29), (Compare Doc. 13-2 ¶ 8 at 2, with \nDoc 34-2 at 5–6). This amended document includes two entries for the City of New Orleans \nHealth Department, whose titles suggest one primarily serves and another mostly the homeless. \n(Id. at 5.) The Court also notes that the name of some of the other entities listed suggest that their \npatent base is similarly limited, e.g. “NO/Aids Task Force,” “New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic”. \n17 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 18 of 80\n(Id.) \nWhile five providers in the Baton Rouge area are identified in the corrected Declaration, \n“LSU Health-OLOL” appears twice. (Id.) One location’s medical doctors do not accept new \npatients, and neither clinic provides contraception of any kind. (Id.) Finally, only one Baton \nRouge center has an approximate wait time of less than one week (“1-3 days, same day for est. \npt.”). (Id.) \n \n4.  Abandonment of First Termination Action and Commencement of the Second \nTermination Action \nOn September 9, 2015, Defendant chose to “rescind” her earlier at-will terminations. \n(Doc. 38 at 2.) On September 14, 2015, Defendant sent the First Termination Letters, one for \neach Agreement, to PPGC. (Doc. 38 at 4, 6, 8, 10; Doc. 46-1 at 18–36.) On September 15, 2015, \nDefendant followed these rescission letters with four new termination letters (“Second \nTermination Letters”). (Doc. 39 at 1; Doc. 46-1 at 37–49.) While the First Termination Letters \nhad invoked Section 46:437.11(D)(1), (Doc. 38 at 4, 6, 8, 10), the Second Termination Letters \nrely on Sections 46:437.11(D)(2) and 46:437.14 and Title 50. (Doc. 39-1 at 2–3, 5–6, 8–9, 11–\n12; Doc. 46-1 at 37–49). Both MAPIL sub-provisions, Section 46:436.11(D)(2) allows for “for \ncause” termination of a provider agreement, and Section 46:437.14 identifies a number of \nviolations, LA. R.S. §§ 46:437:11(D)(2), 46:437.14. The Second Termination Letters specify \nseveral different grounds.  \nThe first is a settlement in Reynolds v. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc., Case \nNumber 9:09-cv-124-RC (E.D. Tex.) (“Reynolds Settlement”), a lawsuit pursuant to the False \nClaims Act (“FCA”) in the Eastern District of Texas between PPGC and an FCA plaintiff. (Doc. \n18 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 19 of 80\n39-1 at 2, 5, 8, 11.) According to the letters, two violations of Title 50 were based on this \nsettlement. First, simply by settling this action, PPGC had violated Title 50. (Id.) Second, since \nDHHS had not been informed “within ten (10) working days of when the provider knew or \nshould have known of the violation,” another violation of Title 50 had occurred. (Id.)  \nA second (or third) ground consisted of “provider audits and federal false claims cases \nagainst PPFA . . . affiliates.” (Id.) Another Texas case, Carroll v. Planned Parenthood Gulf \nCoast, Case Number 4:12-cv-03505 (S.D. Tex.) (“Carroll”), fell within this description. \nAccording to the letters, in Carroll, “the presiding judge found that the information already \nprovided allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that Planned Parenthood knowingly \nfiled false claims.” (Doc. 39-1 at 2, 5, 8, 11; see also Hr’g Tr. 36:2–22, Oct. 16, 2015.) Relying \non this interpretation of Carroll, the Second Terminations Letters cite Louisiana law—\n“Providers and providers-in-fact are required to ensure that all their agents and affiliates are in \ncompliance with all federal and state laws as well as rules, policies and procedures of the \nMedicaid program”—and concluded: “PPGC and its parent organization PPFA has failed to do \nso and has failed to notify DHH of violations and misconduct by affiliates and providers-in-\nfact[,] . . .  violations of . . . Title 50.” (Doc. 39-1 at 2, 5, 8, 11.) \nThe third basis for termination was Defendant’s determination that PPGC’s July and \nAugust Letters, see supra Part II.B, contained “misrepresentations” upon Defendant’s further \nreview of CMP’s videos. (Doc. 39-1 at 3, 6, 9, 12.) These alleged misrepresentations were \ndescribed as violations of Sections 46:437.11(D)(2) and 46:437.14(A)(1). (Id.) Although other \ngrounds are referenced in these letters, including audits, noncompliance with various Title 50 \nconditions, and more, unidentified misrepresentations constitute the third effective category.18 \n                                                      \n18 For example, Defendant maintained that, as Section 46:437.11(D)(2) allows for termination \n“immediately and without notice if a health care provider is the subject of a sanction or of a \n19 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 20 of 80\n(Id.) \nAfter receiving these Second Termination Letters, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to \namend the complaint on October 7, 2015, (Doc. 41), a request granted on that same day, (Doc. \n42). Already attached to the motion to amend, (Doc. 41-1), a new amended complaint \n(“Amended Complaint”) followed on October 7, 2015, (Doc. 43).19 Two days later, Plaintiffs \nfiled the Renewed Motion for TRO, (Doc. 45), and the Renewed Memorandum, (Doc. 46). \nSimultaneously, Plaintiffs filed the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Limited Expedited Written Discovery, \n(Doc. 47), and Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Limited Expedited \nDiscovery, (Doc. 48). On October 14, 2015, Plaintiffs docketed the Memorandum Regarding \nAvailability of State Remedy. (Doc. 52 at 1.) Defendant filed the Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 53), \nand Defendant’s Memorandum on October 14, 2015, (Doc. 53-1). On October 16, 2015, this \nCourt held the Second Hearing. The Court orally denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Limited \nExpedited Written Discovery and took the remaining motions under advisement at the Second \nHearing’s conclusion. Late that day, Plaintiffs filed a copy of the Reynolds Settlement. (Doc. 54.)  \nOn Sunday, October 18, 2015, this Court issued an order denying Defendant’s motion to \ndismiss and granting Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order. (Doc. 55.) It set a \n                                                                                                                                                                           \ncriminal, civil, or departmental proceeding,” it had determined “that PPGC currently fits within \nthis statute due to the investigations of PPGC by both DHH and the Louisiana Office of \nInspector General.” (Doc. 39-1 at 3, 6, 9, 12.) And finally, pursuant to Section \n46:437.14(A)(l0) and (12), Defendant claimed that it “may move to revoke enrollment if a \nprovider is found in violation of licensing or certification conditions or professional standards \nrelating to the licensure or certification of health care providers or the required quality of \ngoods, services, or supplies provided” as well as “for failure to meet any condition of \nenrollment.” (Id.) PPGC, however, has counted three, and Defendant has not yet contradicted \nthis grouping in writing or during the Second Hearing. (Hr’g Tr. 25:16–29:10, Oct. 16, 2015.) \n19 While many paragraphs in the Amended Complaint mirror exactly those in the First \nComplaint, (Doc. 4 ¶¶ 1, 2, 3, 4, 9–14, 18–33, 35, 37–49, with Doc. 43 ¶¶ 1, 2, 3, 5, 10–15, 19–\n33, 41, 43–55), or underwent slight alteration (i.e. dates), (Doc. 4 ¶ 5, with Doc. 43 ¶ 6), \nPlaintiffs refined others so as to reflect this case’s latest posture and developments, (Doc. 43 ¶¶  \n4, 6, 35–36), and class action claims, (Doc. 43 ¶¶ 16–19, 56–61, 68). \n20 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 21 of 80\nstatus conference for the following day. (Id. at 59.)  At that status conference, all parties agreed \nthat no further discovery and no further argument was necessary for this Court to make its \ndetermination on whether to issue a preliminary injunction. (Doc. 58.) The Parties expressed “no \nobjection to converting the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction.” (Id.)  \nOn October 28, 2015, Plaintiffs filed the Notice of Supplemental Authority. (Doc. 61.) \nThe Notice includes as an attachment a copy of “a preliminary injunction,” issued by the Middle \nDistrict of Alabama, “in a case substantially similar to the instant action.” (Id. at 1.) Later that \nsame day, at Defendant’s request, this Court held a second telephonic status conference. (Doc. \n62.) Once more, the Parties affirmed that they regarded the record as complete and sufficient for \nthe issuance of a preliminary injunction. (Id.)  \n  .   \nD.  OVERVIEW OF PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Arguments \nIn their Motion for TRO and Renewed Motion for TRO, Plaintiffs have made four \nrelevant arguments to why they are entitled to a temporary restraining order.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs contend that they will likely prove that Defendant’s efforts violate federal \nstatutory and constitutional law. They begin by arguing that Defendant’s latest termination, like \nthe first, is prohibited by the plain meaning of Section 1396a(a)(23) and are thus in violation of \ncontrolling federal law. (Doc. 46 at 17–22; see also Doc. 4-1 at 16.) This Free-Choice-of-\nProvider Provision bars Defendant from excluding PPGC from Medicaid for a reason unrelated \nto its fitness to provide medical services. (Doc. 46 at 18, 21, 22; Doc. 4-1 at 11.) Because \n“Defendant has nowhere suggested that PPGC is not ‘qualified to perform’ the Medicaid services \nit provides,” its action cannot be cohered with this subsection’s language and purpose. (Doc. 4-1 \n21 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 22 of 80\nat 15, 16; see also Doc. 46 at 17.)  \nPlaintiffs concurrently maintain that this particular subsection, in contrast with Section \n1396a(a)(30), which was the focus in Armstrong, does afford the Individual Plaintiffs with a \nright enforceable via Section 1983. (Doc. 46 at 18–19 & n.9; Doc. 4-1 at 12–13 & n.9; see also \nHr’g Tr. 6:23–7:4, Sept. 2, 2015.) Throughout their discussion in the Renewed Memorandum, \nPlaintiffs rely on many of the same cases, including Planned Parenthood Ariz. Inc. v. Betlach, \n727 F.3d 960 (9th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1283, 188 L. Ed. 2d 300 (2014) \n(“Betlach”); Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 699 F.3d \n962 (7th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2738, 186 L. Ed. 2d 193 (2013), 133 S. Ct. 2736, \n186 L. Ed. 2d 193 (2013 (“Indiana”); and Women’s Hospital Foundation v. Townsend, No. 07-\n711-JJB-DLD, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52549, 2008 WL 2743284 (M.D. La. July 10, 2008) \n(“Townsend”). (See, e.g., Doc. 46 at 17, 18 & 18 n.13.) Repeatedly, Plaintiffs emphasize that \neven if PPGC’s action would be barred by Armstrong the Individual Plaintiffs retain a viable \ncause of action under Section 1983. \nIn the Renewed Memorandum, Plaintiffs do abandon their procedural due process claim, \n(Hr’g Tr. 15:19–16:1, Oct. 16, 2015; compare Doc. 43 ¶¶ 62–67 at 19–20, with Doc. 1 ¶¶ 56–57 \nat 14), but do reiterate their two constitutional ones, (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 52–55 at 14; Doc. 43 ¶¶ 64–67 at \n20). Now, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant, without sufficient justification, is singling them out \nfor unfavorable treatment, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution’s Fourteenth \nAmendment, U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 2, and is attempting to penalize them for freely \nassociating with other related Planned Parenthood entities, thereby contravening the freedom of \nassociation guaranteed by the First Amendment, see U.S. CONST. amends. I, IX, § 2; Nat’l Ass’n \nfor Advancement of Colored People v. Ala. ex. rel Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460, 78 S. Ct. 1163, \n22 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 23 of 80\n1498, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1488 (1958); Arnaud v. Odom, 870 F.2d 304, 311 (5th Cir. 1989). (See, e.g., \nDoc. 46 at 22.) \nSecond, Plaintiffs insist that the harm to PPGC and the Individual Plaintiffs will be \nirreparable if the termination comes to pass. The Individual Plaintiffs will be deprived of their \nability to exercise their federal statutory rights, and will suffer a disruption of their relationship \nwith a preferred (and competent) provider and a reduction of their access to family planning \nservices. (Doc. 46 at 26; see also Doc. 4-1 at 8–9, 17.) PPGC, in turn, will find its budget sharply \ncurtailed, possibly forcing it to close down BRHC permanently, and will never be able to recover \nany monetary damages from DHH. (Doc. 46 at 27 & n.19; see also Doc. 4-1 at 17–18, 18 n.13.) \nThird, Plaintiffs argue that the balance of harms favors them. “While PPGC and its \npatients will suffer serious irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, the state will suffer \nno injury at all.” (Doc. 46 at 27; see also Doc. 4-1 at 18.) The reason, Plaintiffs contend, is \nbecause an injunction will do no more than “require the state to maintain the funding [it] ha[s] \nprovided to . . . [PPGC] for years.” (Doc. 46 at 27 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations \nin original); see also Doc. 4-1 at 18.) \nFinally, Plaintiffs assert that the public interest favors their injunctive request. The public \nhas a “strong” interest “in ensuring continued public access to crucial health services, especially \nfor the many underserved and low-income patients PPGC serves.” (Doc. 46 at 28; see also Doc. \n4-1 at 18.) Such an interest is especially “acute with respect to the neediest . . . who depend on \npublicly funded programs.” (Doc. 46 at 28; see also Doc. 4-1 at 19.) \nAs to Defendant’s argument that PPGC’s failure to pursue a state administrative appeal \nof the termination renders the controversy not ripe and deprives all Plaintiffs of standing, \nPlaintiffs argue that PPGC is not required to pursue the state administrative appeal but can \n23 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 24 of 80\ninstead pursue its rights under Section 1983. (Doc. 52 at 2–3; see also Hr’g Tr. 6:6–10, Sept. 2, \n2015.) The Individual Plaintiffs argue that they have no right to administratively appeal the \nAgreements’ termination and thus could not do so if they wanted to. (Doc. 52 at 3; see also Hr’g \nTr. 10:15–17, Sept. 2, 2015.) As such, regardless of whether or not PPGC’s claims are ripe, their \nclaims are clearly so, and their standing just as much. (See Doc. 52 at 1.)  \n \n2.  Defendant’s Arguments \nInvoking Rule 12(b)(1) and (6), Defendant makes essentially three arguments.  \nFirst, Defendant contends that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this \ndispute because this case is not ripe and Plaintiffs lack prudential and constitutional standing. \n(Doc. 53-1 at 5–9.) Defendant insists on this case’s unripe state for three reasons: (1) “Plaintiffs \nhave suffered no injury”; (2) “further procedural and factual development is required”; and (3) \nno hardship can be shown. (Id. at 6, 8.) As support for his first and second reason, Defendant \nargues that because PPGC may appeal this termination, during which the Agreements will \nremain enforce in accordance with Defendant’s wishes, this “suspensive” review process leaves \nall Plaintiffs without a cognizable injury. (Id. at 6–7 (injury), 8 (hardship), 9 (injury for standing \npurposes).) Defendant’s Memorandum further explains the reasons for a lack of ripeness and \nstanding as such: “In the instant matter, PPGC is asserting a due process violation while \nsimultaneously hinting that it may voluntarily elect not to participate in the process about which \nit complains.” (Id. at 8 (emphasis in original).) \nSecond, Defendant argues for abstention, emphasizing these doctrines’ purpose of \n“preserv[ing] the balance between state and federal sovereignty.”  (Id. at 10.) Defendant cites to \nfour abstention doctrine—Pullman, Younger, Burford, and Colorado River—and foregoes one—\n24 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 25 of 80\nThibodaux. (Id. at 10–12.) When cumulatively considered, these doctrine’s “animating” \nprinciples have a “clear . . . application” to this proceeding: “Plaintiffs should not be indulged in \ntheir attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court in the absence of State agency action against \nthem that would delineate . . . [Defendant’s] interpretation of the challenged provision, and in the \npresence of adequate state administrative and judicial procedures if that eventuality were to \noccur.” (Id. at 12.) \nThird, Defendant insists Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits for four reasons. First, \n“Plaintiffs have no property interest in the Medicaid provider contracts.” (Id. at 13; see also Doc \n13 at 14–18.) Second, even if Plaintiffs have a property interest, Louisiana’s administrative \nappellate process “complies with the mandates of due process” and federal regulation, for “the \nessence of due process is notice plus an opportunity to be heard.” (Doc. 53-1 at 17.) Third, \nDefendant insists that Section 1396a(a)(23) does not afford the Individual Plaintiffs any private \ncause of action, (Compare Doc. 53-1 at 18–22, with Doc. 13 at 4–9), and is sufficiently \nambiguous to permit Defendant to exercise her discretion to define “qualified” in accordance \nwith her construction of state law, (Doc. 53-1 at 21; see also Doc. 4 at 8). Defendant thus insists \nthat her authority under Section 46:437.11(D)(2) is not limited “to determining whether a \nprovider is competent to provide . . . services.” (Doc. 53-1 at 22.) She can, instead, invoke any \nground derived from state law, including, but not limited, the bases set forth in Section 46:437.12 \nand Title 50, to determine whether a provider is “competent” or not. (Doc. 53-1 at 23–24.)  \n \n25 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 26 of 80\nIV.  PRELIMINARY ISSUES: JURISDICTION AND ABSTENTION  \nA.   RIPENESS \n1.  Defendant’s Arguments  \nDefendant provides the correct standard by which to measure its argument that this case \nis not ripe: for the purposes of this doctrine, “a court must evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues \nfor judicial resolution, and (2) the potential hardship to the parties by declining court \nconsideration,” (Doc. 53-1 at 6 (quoting Lopez v. City of Houston, 617 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir. \n2010)). Defendant maintains the case is not ripe for three reasons: (1) “Plaintiffs have suffered \nno injury”; (2) “[F]urther procedural and factual development is required, as demonstrated by \nPlaintiffs’ due process claim . . . and their request to conduct expedited discovery in this \nproceeding”; and (3) no hardship exists because “the review process is suspensive,” a third point \nsubstantively identical to its first (Doc. 53-1 at 6, 8). At the Second Hearing, her counsel stressed \none aspect of the Constitution’s ripeness requirement: “There is absolutely no injury”; “[T]here \nis absolutely no harm to them at all”; “[T]hey have no injury”; and, “There’s no concrete injury \nto any of the Planned Parenthood or to any of the Jane Doe Plaintiffs because, again, there \nsimply is no injury.” (Hr’g Tr. 4:21–23, 9:2, 17:18–21, Oct. 16, 2015.)  \n \n2.  Analysis   \n(a)  Existence of Credible Threat of Concrete Harm \nDrawn from Article III but incorporating various prudential elements, U.S. CONST. art. \nIII, § 2; Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 57 n. 18, 113 S. Ct. 2485, 2495 n.18, 125 \nL. Ed. 2d 38 (1993), ripeness is “a justiciability doctrine designed to prevent the courts, through \navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over \n26 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 27 of 80\nadministrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an \nadministrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the \nchallenging parties,” Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 807–08, \n123 S. Ct. 2026, 2030, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). It generally \nincorporates, as Defendant rightly notes, (Doc. 53-1 at 6), consideration of two elements: “(1) the \nfitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court \nconsideration.” Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808 (citing to Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, \n387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967) (“Abbott Labs.”), overruled on \nother grounds, Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105, 97 S. Ct. 980, 984, 51 L. Ed. 2d 192 \n(1977))).20  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff has suffered no injury sufficient for ripeness’ purposes. \nThis argument fails for two reasons. The primary reason is well-rooted in ripeness jurisprudence: \n“In evaluating ripeness, the central focus is on whether the case involves uncertain or contingent \nfuture events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” Tarrant Reg’l \nWater Dist. v. Herrmann, 656 F.3d 1222, 1250 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Initiative & \nReferendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1097 (10th Cir. 2006)). However, an injury need not \nbe actual in a physical sense for a plaintiff’s case to cross the ripeness threshold. Rather, if a \nplaintiff is “immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged \nofficial conduct,” ripeness will often be found. Pearson v. Holder, 624 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. \n2010); see also Whole Woman’s Health v. Cole, 790 F.3d 563, 582 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting id.). \nIt is enough that “an injury that has not yet occurred is sufficiently likely to happen to justify \njudicial intervention” or “when the court would be in no better position to adjudicate the issues in \n                                                      \n20 Abbott Labs.’ conclusion as to the Administrative Procedures Act was abrogated. It remains \nvalid as to its ripeness’ analysis and continues to be cited in that limited regard.  \n27 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 28 of 80\nthe future than it is now.” Pearson, 624 F.3d at 684 (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 \nU.S. 95, 101–02, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 1665, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983)). A “future injury” will be \ndeemed ripe (and establish standing) if either “the injury is certainly impending” or “there is \nsubstantial risk that the harm will occur.” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, \n2341, 189 L. Ed. 2d 246 (2014) (emphasis added); see also Caprock Plains Fed. Bank Ass’n v. \nFarm Credit Admin., 843 F.2d 840, 845 (5th Cir. 1988) (concluding that “too many ifs” that \nrender an injury a “mere potential[ity],” not just one or two that may render such a result into a \nsubstantial possibility or even a probability, will make a case unripe). \nThus, “ripeness is seldom an obstacle to a pre-enforcement challenge . . . where the \nplaintiff faces a credible threat of enforcement.” Consumer Data Indus. Ass’n v. King, 678 F.3d \n898, 907 (10th Cir. 2012); cf. Babbitt v. UFW Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 99 S. Ct. \n2301,2308, 60 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1979) (finding standing where “a realistic danger of sustaining a \ndirect injury as a result of a statute’s operation or enforcement” existed (emphasis added)). In \nsuch cases, the plaintiff is typically “not . . . required to await and undergo [enforcement] as the \nsole means of seeking relief.” Consumer Data Indus. Ass’n, 678 F.3d at 907; see also, e.g., \nBarrick Goldstrike Mines, Inc. v. Browner, 215 F.3d 45, 49 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding that \ndeclaratory judgment action was ripe for judicial review under the Administrative Procedures \nAct where plaintiff’s “only alternative to obtaining judicial review now is to violate EPA’s \ndirectives . . . and then defend an enforcement proceeding on the grounds it raises here”). As the \nSupreme Court has recently written, an agency’s prospective, not yet consummated, action will \nbe found ripe for review if “the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable \nproportions . . .  by some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant’s situation in a \nfashion that harms or threatens to harm him.” Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808 \n28 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 29 of 80\n(emphasis added).  \nUnder this precedent, Defendant’s Second Termination Letters represent certain threats, \nclassifiable as “concrete action[s]” that “threaten to harm” Plaintiffs, id.; see also Alabama-\nCoushatta Tribe of Tex. v. United States, 757 F.3d 484, 491 (5th Cir. 2014). Here, the existing \nrecord amply supports this determination: Defendant has made it clear she intends to terminate \nthe Agreements, the only thing changing since the initial termination letters being the reason. In \neffect, by her own actions, she has triggered the application of a general rule, federal courts \nhaving “consistently found a case or controversy in suits between state officials charged with \nenforcing a law and private parties potentially subject to enforcement,” Consumer Data Indus. \nAss’n, 678 F.3d at 905. A case’s ripeness simply does not depend on whether the injury has \nalready been inflicted; “specific threat[s] of enforcement” like those the Defendant has already \nmade are typically more than enough to satisfy the constitutional minimum. Reynolds v. City of \nValley Park, No. 4:06CV01487 ERW, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83210, at *25, 2006 WL 3331082, \nat *6 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 15, 2006); see also, e.g., Cass Cnty. v. United States, 570 F.2d 737, 740 \n(8th Cir. 1978) (“Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the \ncircumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal \ninterests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” \n(quoting Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S. Ct. 510, 512, 85 L. \nEd. 826 (1941)).  \nIn this analysis, Defendant’s own description of her actions is pivotal and telling. She has \nnot proposed a new regulation or initiated a new round of rulemaking. (See, e.g., Hr’g Tr. 33:11–\n14, Oct. 16, 2015; Doc. 53-1 at 1–2.) Instead, per her Second Terminations Letters, she intends \nto enforce what she perceives to be state law in accordance with her construction of federal \n29 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 30 of 80\nstatutory law. (Doc. 39-1 at 2–3, 5–6, 8–9, 11–12.) In fact, as the First Termination Letters attest, \nthe Agreements’ termination pursuant to a MAPIL section has been threatened since at least \nAugust 2015, and Defendant has now only swapped no reason for three. (Compare Doc. 13, with \nDoc. 39-1.) As such, in the Tenth Circuit’s words, “enforcement” has been “credib[ly] \nthreat[ened],” her actions having made Plaintiffs’ case ripe by lending substance to their pre-\nOctober 18, 2015, allegations. Consumer Data Indus. Ass’n v. King, 678 F.3d at 907. In such a \nsituation, “[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain \npreventive relief,” for “the injury is certainly impending”—and “that is enough.” Pac. Gas & \nElec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm’n, 461 U.S. 190, 201, 103 S. Ct. \n1713, 1721, 75 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1983) (quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553, 593, \n43 S. Ct. 658, 663, 67 L. Ed. 1117 (1923)). Based on these circumstances and the overwhelming \nweight of precedent, Plaintiffs’ threatened and certain injury is clear. \nTwo general admissions by Defendant’s counsel at the Second Hearing strengthen this \nconclusion. First, though only indirectly, he himself conceded that a kind of “harm” may have \nalready come to pass: in arguing why no cognizable injury had yet transpired, he emphasized \npossible contingencies: “I think that one of the contingencies that could happen is their rights \ncould be restored . . . . [The] suspension could be lifted.” (Hr’g Tr. 17:23–25, Oct. 16, 2015 \n(emphases added).) He characterized Defendant’s actions as, prior to October 18, 2015, being \n“suspensive” if PPGC chose to appeal, and “the final action” as “suspended.” (Hr’g Tr. 10:4–12, \n6:1–6, Oct. 16, 2015.) Both the First and Second Termination Letters imply the same. (Doc. 38 at \n4, 6, 8, 10 (informing PPGC that DHH “will be notifying you by separate communication of an \nexclusion/termination/revocation from the Louisiana Medicaid program for cause” and \ndescribing PPGC as possessing “rights to a suspensive appeal” of this \n30 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 31 of 80\n“exclusion/revocation/termination” (emphasis added)); Doc. 46-1 at 41, 44, 47, 51 (“[Y]ou are \nhereby notified that the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) is hereby terminating I \nrevoking the PPGC provider agreement referenced above. This action will take effect . . . .” \n(emphases added)).)  \nThis highlighted language implies that Plaintiffs’ rights have already been curtailed, a \nsuspension already imposed, and the relevant action, i.e. the Agreements’ termination, already \nundertaken, its “effect” alone delayed.21 Any one of these imputations would constitute a \nsufficiently credible threat to render this case ripe. Later, moreover, Defendant’s counsel \nunambiguously confirmed these statements’ implications. To the Court’s question—“the \nSecretary has terminated the contract, but . . . has said that termination is suspended pending \nappeal?”—he answered: “That’s correct.” (Hr’g Tr. 19:16–19, Oct. 16, 2015; see also Doc. 53-1 \nat 9–10.) Thus, even if the termination is suspended, it will occur automatically but for this \nCourt’s intervention. That its practical enforcement may be stayed does not change the key fact: \nusing Pearson’s terms, Plaintiffs are in “danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of \nthe challenged official conduct,” Pearson, 624 F.3d at 684. A final exchange cinches this \nconclusion. When Plaintiffs’ counsel revealed PPGC’s intent “to proceed in federal court” and \nnot “to pursue the administrative remedy,” and the Court observed, “Well, then it seems to me \nyou’ve got a very, very ripe situation,” and asked Defendant’s counsel, “Am I missing something \non that?” he answered, “No.” (Hr’g Tr. 20:18–23, Oct. 16, 2015.)  \nEqually worthy of note, Defendant quotes but dismisses the import of a principle \nembedded in ripeness case law: “[A] case is generally ripe if any remaining questions are purely \n                                                      \n21 For something to be “restored” it must first have been taken, for something to be “lifted” it \nmust first have been imposed, and for something to be “suspended” it must first have been \ndetermined.   \n31 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 32 of 80\nlegal ones,” Lopez, 617 F.3d at 341. This principle holds even if “the application of the disputed \nrule [or the ultimate decision] remains within the agency’s discretion.” Nat’l Ass’n of Home \nBuilders v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 417 F.3d 1272, 1282 (D.C. Cir. 2005); see also Nat’l \nTreasury Emps. Union v. Chertoff, 452 F.3d 839, 854 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing id. and finding \nripeness when “waiting to observe” an agency’s final “actions would only exacerbate the . . .  \nasserted injury while doing nothing to enable judicial review”). In this context, a truly non-legal \nquestion, notably, is often one whose resolution is necessarily “reliant on” and demands “agency \nexpertise.” Marcum v . Salazar, 694 F.3d 123, 129 (D.C. Cir. 2012). As any fair reading of the \ncomplaint and motions filed in this case indicates, the issue involves at least one, if not three, \n“purely . . . legal question[s]”: the precise meaning of Section 1396a(a)(23) and the applicability \nof two constitutional clauses. (See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 1; Doc. 43 at 1.) In Abbott Labs., the seminal \ncase in ripeness jurisprudence, the Court concluded that the issues presented were appropriate for \njudicial resolution because the facial challenge to the regulation involved the purely legal \nquestion of whether the regulation at issue exceeded the scope permitted by the underlying \nstatute. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149. This kind of challenge, found ripe in Abbott Labs., \nresembles the challenge that PPGC now makes, with “consideration of the underlying legal \nissues” not “necessarily be[ing] facilitated if they were raised in the context of a specific attempt \nto [apply and/or] enforce the regulations,” Gardner v. Toilet Goods Ass’n, 387 U.S. 167, 171, 87 \nS. Ct. 1526, 1528, 18 L. Ed. 2d 704 (1967). “Predominantly legal questions” like a statute’s plain \nmeaning and whether a person’s conduct contravenes its unambiguous command are nearly \nalways ripe. See, e.g., Fla. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1164 (11th \nCir. 2008) (“The Supreme Court has long since held that where the enforcement of a statute is \ncertain, a preenforcement challenge will not be rejected on ripeness grounds.”); Nat’l Ass’n of \n32 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 33 of 80\nHome Builders, 417 F.3d aat 1282 (“Claims that an agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious or \ncontrary to law present purely legal issues.”); cf. LeClerc v. Webb, 419 F.3d 405, 414 (5th Cir. \n2005) (noting that “actions for declaratory relief . . . by design permit pre-enforcement review” \nand applying two exceptions). Plaintiffs’ present action presents precisely such questions.   \n \n(b)   Existence of Requisite Hardship \nThe jurisprudence construing the hardship requirement is just as clear. The Fifth Circuit \n“has found hardship to inhere in legal harms, such as the harmful creation of legal rights or \nobligations; practical harms on the interests advanced by the party seeking relief; and the harm of \nbeing force[d] . . . to modify [one’s] behavior in order to avoid future adverse consequence.” \nChoice Inc. v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 715 (5th Cir. 2012) (alteration in original) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Discrete formulations, a plaintiff can meet the ripeness doctrine’s \nhardship prong by satisfying just one. Id. As the Court’s decisions clarify, the first test has been \nmet when an agency proposes to “grant, withhold, or modify any formal legal license, power or \nauthority,” Ohio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733, 118 S. Ct. 1665, 1670, 140 L. \nEd. 2d 921 (1988), and the second is fulfilled when “the impact of the administrative action \ncould be said to be felt immediately by those subject to it in conducting their day-to-day affairs,” \nToilet Goods Ass’n v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158, 164, 87 S. Ct. 1520, 1524, 18 L. Ed. 2d 697 \n(1967).  \nQuite simply, Defendant’s conduct here cannot be described in any different terms. Since \na threat suffices to satisfy ripeness’ hardship requirement, to conclude differently would be to \nfind no case ripe when an administrative option remains for one of many plaintiffs and a \nstatutory right and remedy exists for all, a result contrary to the many opinions that have \n33 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 34 of 80\nconfronted claims under Section 1396a(a)(23). See infra Part V; see also, e.g., Sabree v. \nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 193 & n.29 (3d Cir. 2004) (“A] plaintiff’s ability to invoke § 1983 \ncannot be defeated simply by the availability of administrative mechanisms to protect the \nplaintiff’s interests.”); cf. Cathedral Rock of N. Coll. Hill, Inc. v. Shalala, 223 F.3d 354, 366 (6th \nCir. 2000) (noting that “the Medicaid Act does not have a provision . . . incorporating § 405(h) \nand its exclusive jurisdiction limitation to channel legal challenges through the administrative \nprocedures set forth”).  \nDefendant maintains that the mere suspensive quality of her decision somehow unripens \na case in which an injury is reasonably foreseeable and certain. Considering ripeness \njurisprudence, this Court disagrees. See, e.g., Legacy Cmty. Health Servs., Inc. v. Janek, No. \n4:15-CV-25, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8610, at *12–13, 2015 WL 4064270, at *5 (S.D Tex. July 2, \n2015) (finding case ripe even when a party did not allege any actual instance of enforcement); \nsee also Doc. 63 at 18–20, Bentley (finding that the fact of state administrative appeals process \ndoes not affect the right of the aggrieved individual party to pursue a Section 1983 claim). \n \n(c)  Insufficiency of Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Ripeness \nWhile a simple application of longstanding law leaves little doubt about this case’s \nripened state, Defendant’s arguments merit some comment. Having examined her reasoning, this \nCourt finds her construction and extension of the ripeness doctrine to be predicated on a \nfundamental misunderstanding of Plaintiffs’ three claims. In its final paragraph, Defendant’s \nMemorandum summarizes DHH’s view of Plaintiffs’ case: “In the instant matter, PPGC is \nasserting a due process violation while simultaneously hinting that it may voluntarily elect not to \nparticipate in the process about which it complains.” (Doc. 53-1 at 8 (emphasis in original).) At \n34 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 35 of 80\nthe Second Hearing, Defendant again reduces all of Plaintiffs’ claims to “a disguised due process \nchallenge.” (Hr’g Tr. 8:3–4, Oct. 16, 2015.) This focus on procedural due process obscures at \nleast three logical oversights. \nFirst, this assertion ignores Plaintiffs’ withdrawal of their due process claim in their \nAmended Complaint. (See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 1; Doc. 43 at 1.) In fact, Plaintiffs’ counsel expressly \nconfirmed this at the Second Hearing. (Hr’g Tr. 15:19–16:1, Oct. 16, 2015.) Despite this clear \nabandonment, however, Defendant argues that the claims of the Individual Plaintiffs are \n“derivative” of PPGC’s, (Hr’g Tr. 9:10–11, Oct. 16, 2015), based wholly on cases explicating the \nrequirements of procedural due process. (Doc. 53-1 at 13 (citing Plaza Health Labs., Inc. v. \nPerales, 878 F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1989); Kelly Kare, Ltd. v. O’Rourke, 930 F.2d 170, 177 (2d Cir. \n1991); and Senape v. Constantino, 936 F.2d 687 (2d Cir. 1991)); see also Doc. 13 at 16–17). But \nwhen statutes like Section 1396a(a)(23) provide the case’s gravamen and no procedural due \nprocess claim is made, Defendant’s cases cannot be legally relevant. See Indiana, 699 F.3d at \n977 (rejecting the relevance of Kelly Kare and similar cases because “[t]his is not a due-process \ncase”). In other words, Defendant has reduced Plaintiffs’ complaint to one claim already \nabandoned and relied on case law thereby rendered irrelevant.   \nSecond, Defendant’s emphasis on the existence of a “plan process” ignores an equally \nwell-settled axiom when Section 1983 forms the basis of a party’s claims. Defendant argues that \nthe administrative appellate process, having been accepted as generally valid by CMS, \nessentially forecloses both PPGC’s and the Individual Plaintiffs’ resort to this (and any other) \ncourt. (Hr’g Tr. 7:23–8:6, Oct. 16, 2015; see also Doc. 53-1 at 3.) The process offered to PPGC \n(but not to the Individual Plaintiffs) must not be disturbed, she maintains, as it “is a legitimate \nprocess that has been approved,” the states “required” under the Medicaid Act to “provide[]a \n35 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 36 of 80\nprocess for reviewing grievances by providers.” (Hr’g Tr. 8:7–17, Oct. 16, 2015; see also, e.g., \nDoc. 53-1 at 3–4.) Yet, as one court has observed, “[b]ecause § 1983 is intended to provide a \nfederal forum, however, there will almost always be some sort of administrative or judicial \navenue of relief at state law - whether compelled by federal statute or simply available under \ngeneral state court jurisdiction.” Roach v. Morse, 440 F.3d 53, 57 (2d Cir. 2006), cited with \napproval in Romano v. Greenstein, 721 F.3d 373, 376 n.8 (5th Cir. 2013) (as to exhaustion only). \nThus, a congressional requirement that states establish administrative review procedures, as \nexists here, rarely, if ever, implies that either § 1983 plaintiffs need exhaust them or a case is \nunripe when the process has not been invoked but an injury plainly looms. See Roach, 440 F.3d \nat 57; Doc. 63 at 18–19, Bentley. \nThird, Defendant’s two “instructive” cases—Rush v. Barham, No. 14-30872, 2015 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 12886, 2015 WL 4467848 (5th Cir. July 22, 2015), and Monk v. Huston, 340 F.3d \n279 (5th Cir. 2003) (Doc. 53-1 at 7–8)—do not support her ripeness argument.  \nRush, for one, can be distinguished on both the facts and on the law. As a reading of the \ndistrict court opinion there affirmed shows, “[t]he existence of parallel [‘pending’] state \nproceedings to render[ed] Plaintiffs’ cause of action unfit at each step of the fitness inquiry.” \nRush v. Barham, No. 13-cv-00723-BAJ-RLB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97521, at *11 (M.D. La. \nJuly 17, 2014). Here, no state proceeding predated the initiation of this federal action, so that any \nstate action would not post-date and thus cannot parallel this proceeding from its genesis.22  \nIn addition, at issue in Rush was the propriety of a “administrative actions” within an \nagency’s state-based “authority—specifically, the agency’s enforcement of the Louisiana Scenic \nRivers[] Act”; “a challenge to administrative regulations” was the one before that court. Rush, \n                                                      \n22 This issue is also relevant to this Court’s abstention analysis. See infra Part IV.C.2.  \n36 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 37 of 80\n2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97521, at *11. The basis of the Individual Plaintiffs’ claim is the \ninterpretation of Section 1396a(a)(23), a federal statute. More specifically, it is whether, \nindependently of the state law basis of Defendant’s present actions, Section 1396a(a)(23)’s plain \nmeaning establishes the outer parameters of Defendant’s discretion under state law to render a \nprovider “unqualified.” (See Doc. 43 ¶¶ 62–63 at 19.) PPGC’s allegations, meanwhile, rest on \nfederal constitutional provisions. (See id. ¶¶ 64–67 at 20.) This case is not a “challenge” to an \n“administrative regulation” by the one (and unquestioned) agency entitled to enforce it, but a \nchallenge to the propriety of the secretary’s exercise of discretion within and under the \nconstraints imposed by federal statutory law. As a practical and legal matter, it is almost surely \nnot a regulation, cf. 5 U.S.C.§ 551, or a formal rule, LA. R.S. § 49:951(6).  \nIn Rush, moreover, the Fifth Circuit thusly characterized the lower court’s opinion: “The \ncourt held that in the circumstances of this particular case, further factual development will result \nfrom the pending state court proceeding and will necessarily affect the claims in this suit.” Rush, \n2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 12886, at *7, 2015 WL 4467848, at *3. As noted above, no factual \ndevelopment is necessary.23 Rather, the question before this Court is one of “congressional \nintent” as reflected in the text of Section 1396a(a)(23). Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149. On the \nfacts and the law, then, Rush does not fit. \nThe same can be said about Monk. As Monk itself states, “[a] case is generally ripe if any \nremaining questions are purely legal ones,” Monk, 340 F.3d at 282, and this Court, like others, \nsee supra Part IV.A.2, considers the determination of whether a federal statute is unambiguous to \nbe such a question. In addition, Monk discussed ripeness in a narrow context: procedural due \n                                                      \n23 Had exhaustion been the issue, which Defendant explicitly denies, this factor may have some \nforce. Defendant, however, has stipulated that no additional discovery is needed. (Doc. 58; Doc. \n62.) \n37 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 38 of 80\nprocess. Thus, the opinion specifically found the case not ripe because “[t]he constitutional right \nto due process is not . . . an abstract right to hearings conducted according to fair procedural \nrules” but is “the right not to be deprived of life, liberty, or property without such procedural \nprotection.” Id. at 282–83 (emphasis added). Because any such claims have been decidedly and \nclearly abandoned by Plaintiffs, Monk will not do. \nAs a final note, Defendant oversells the significance of the Plaintiffs’ own motion to \nexpedite discovery, (Doc. 47). According to Defendant, this request attests to the need for factual \ndevelopment that proves ripeness’ absence, (Doc. 53-1 at 6); Plaintiffs disagree, (See Hr’g Tr. \n41:8–19, Oct. 16, 2015). While the motion makes clear that such discovery is being sought for \npurposes of strengthening Plaintiffs’ animus allegations, (Doc. 48 at 2), the ripeness doctrine \ndemands no more than a threatened injury to the plaintiff, not a complete evidentiary record. \nIndeed, Defendant’s logic would render any federal case unripe where discovery is requested, \nwithout any regard for the reason such discovery is needed. Even if Plaintiffs’ first amendment \nclaims require, like almost all claims often do, more discovery, that possibility says nothing \nabout the ripeness of their two other claims. In the vast majority of cases in which ripeness is not \nfound, “additional factual development” is absolutely “necessary,” a feature wholly absent from \na proceeding focused on the outer parameters of a statute’s meaning. See, e.g., John Corp. v. City \nof Houston, 214 F.3d 573, 586 (5th Cir. 2000).24  \n \n(d)  Conclusion \nFor all these reasons, this Court finds this case ripe for its review, joining the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas in Planned Parenthood Ark. & E. Okla. v. Selig, Doc. 45 (Amended and \n                                                      \n24 Even in procedural due process cases, ripeness is not an issue when a facial attack is made. \nSee, e.g., Cornell Cos. v. Borough of New Morgan, 512 F. Supp. 2d 238, 256 (E.D. Pa. 2007).  \n38 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 39 of 80\nSubstituted Preliminary Injunction Order), No. 15-cv-00566-KGB (“Selig”), (Doc. 46-9), and the \nDistrict of Utah in Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert, Doc. 12 (Temporary \nRestraining Order), No. 15-cv-693-CW (“Herbert”), (Doc. 46-10).25  \n \nB.   STANDING \n1.  Defendant’s Arguments  \nIn contesting standing, Defendant insists PPGC lacks it in full. In her words, “Plaintiffs \nhave not suffered nor are they about to suffer ‘an injury in fact’ which is concrete and \nparticularized, or actual or imminent.” (Doc. 53-1 at 9.) The reason given was that “[t]he \ntermination of PPGC’s provider contracts ha[d] not gone into effect” prior to October 19, 2015. \n(Id.) At the Second Hearing, this point was emphasized: “There’s no concrete injury to . . . \nPlanned Parenthood or to any of the . . . [Individual] Plaintiffs because, again, there simply is no \ninjury.” (Hr’g Tr. 17:18–21, Oct. 16, 2015.)  \n \n2.  Analysis   \nClosely related to the ripeness inquiry, Choice Inc. v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 715 (5th \nCir. 2012), standing implicates a slightly different series of concerns. Ripeness is concerned with \n“when an action may be brought,” but “standing focuses on who may bring a ripe action.” Jt. \nStock Soc’y v. UDV N. Am., Inc., 266 F.3d 164, 174 (3d Cir. 2001) (emphasis added); see also \n                                                      \n25 In concurring with these courts, this Court finds it significant that Defendant has yet to \ncomprehensively address either case. In attempting to distinguish only the former, Defendant \noffered one reason: “It’s my understanding that [the right to an administrative appeal] was not a \nsuspensive process,” while “[t]his is a fully suspensive process,” (Hr’g Tr. 9:6–7, Oct. 16, 2015). \nThis lone purported difference, however, is incorrect, as Arkansas law, like Louisiana law, \napparently suspends a termination’s enforcement upon a provider’s proper appeal. See \nARKANSAS MEDICAID PROVIDER MANUAL 161.500.   \n39 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 40 of 80\nInd. Right to Life, Inc. v. Shepard, 507 F.3d 545, 549 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing id.). The “irreducible \n[constitutional] minimum” of standing contains three elements”: “(1) an injury-in-fact,” defined \nas “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized” and “(b) \nactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” that is (2) fairly traceable to the defendant’s \nallegedly unlawful conduct” and that is (3) likely to be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). \nHaving both evolved from Article III, “[s]tanding and ripeness are closely related doctrines that \noverlap most notably in the shared requirement that the plaintiff’s injury be imminent rather than \nconjectural or hypothetical.” New York Civil Liberties Union v. Grandeau, 528 F.3d 122, 130 n.8 \n(2d Cir. 2008).  \nIndeed, “in measuring whether the litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete \nrather than speculative and hypothetical, the ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with \nstanding.” Jt. Stock Soc’y, 266 F.3d at 174. The injury need not be inflicted already; imminence \nwill do. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975). Naturally, \ntherefore, as more than one court has found, the threat of future harm is sufficiently immediate to \nconstitute a cognizable injury-in-fact for purposes of both the standing and the ripeness \ndoctrines. E.g., Comsat Corp. v. FCC, 250 F.3d 931, 936 (5th Cir. 2001) (“A threatened injury \nsatisfies the injury in fact requirement so long as that threat is real[.]”); Prestage Farms, Inc. v. \nBd. of Supervisors of Noxubee Cnty., MS, 205 F.3d 265, 268 (5th Cir. 2000) (“[T]he risk of \ninjury may be founded on a likely and credible chain of events.”); see also, e.g., Baur v. \nVeneman, 352 F.3d 625, 633 (2d Cir. 2003) (collecting cases standing for the proposition that \n“threatened harm in the form of an increased risk of future injury may serve as injury-in-fact for \nArticle III standing purposes”); Employers Ass’n of New Jersey v. State of New Jersey, 601 F. \n40 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 41 of 80\nSupp. 232, 238 (D.N.J. 1985) (“[T]hreatened injury is sufficient for standing . . .without \ncompelling litigants to await the consummation of threatened injury.”) (quoting Pac. Gas & \nElec., 461 U.S. at 200))). While a truly “uncertain potentiality” may deprive a plaintiff of \nstanding, Prestage, 205 F.3d at 268, a decent probability will confer it, see Walters v. Edgar, 163 \nF.3d 430, 434 (7th Cir. 1998) (collecting cases standing for the proposition that “[a] probabilistic \nharm, if nontrivial, can support standing”); cf. Loa-Herrera v. Trominski, 231 F.3d 984, 988 (5th \nCir. 2000) (“Mere threatened injury is sufficient” if “the threat . . . is real.”).  \nPer this law, as with this Court’s ripeness inquiry, see supra Part IV.A.2, Defendant’s \nthreat of harm is sufficiently clear to establish Plaintiff’s standing. In her motions, as at the First \nHearing, Defendant has insisted that she can terminate the Medicaid provider agreement with \nPPGC for any reason, and she has repeatedly made clear that she intends and hopes to void every \nAgreement. There is thus no question that she has made a cognizable threat to Plaintiff’s interest, \nhaving already attempted to do via Section 46:437.11(D)(1) what she now seeks to do via \nSection 46:437.11(D)(2). (Doc. 38 at 2; Doc. 39-1 at 2 –13.) That she may not succeed concerns \nthe precariousness of her own position, but has no bearing on whether the threat she poses is not \nreal and the harm her action portends is not imminent. Precisely because it is, Plaintiffs’ minimal \nstanding has been established.26 See, e.g., Susan J. v. Riley, 254 F.R.D. 439 (M.D. Ala. 2008) \n(rejecting a defendant’s standing challenge to a plaintiff proceeding under Section 1396a(a)(8)). \n \n                                                      \n26 PPGC’s third-party standing may be a more complicated issue. Defendant, however, has raised \nno such objection, instead focusing on the doctrine’s “injury” prong, and PPGC and the \nIndividual Plaintiffs allege discrete, albeit related, harms. (Doc. 1; Doc. 43.)  \n41 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 42 of 80\nC.   ABSTENTION  \n1.  Defendant’s Arguments  \nDefendant urges this Court to abstain. (Doc. 53-1 at 10–12.) She argues for the \napplicability of the four main abstention doctrines—Pullman, Younger, Burford, and Colorado \nRiver. (Id.) Rather than applying the discrete elements of these varied doctrines, Defendant refers \nto their occasional “overlap to some degree in . . . scope and application” and reduces all four to \na single formulation: (1) “where state administrative proceedings and judicial review afford \nclaimants adequate opportunity to test the constitutionality of state law,”  and (2) “the exercise of \nfederal jurisdiction would jeopardize state efforts to establish state policy on matters of public \nconcern,” abstention “should” follow. (Id. at 12.) \n \n2.  Analysis  \n  In general, “the circumstances in which federal courts should decline to exercise their \njurisdiction” and abstain “are carefully defined and remain the exception, not the rule.” Hoye v. \nCity of Oakland, 653 F.3d 835, 844 (9th Cir. 2011) (Younger); see also, e.g., Colorado River \nWater Conservation Dist. v. U. S., 424 U.S. 800, 96 S. Ct. 1236, 47 L. Ed. 2d 483 (1976) \n(Colorado River); Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728, 116 S. Ct. 1712, 135 L. \nEd. 2d 1 (1996) (Burford). Due to this principle, each abstention doctrine must be carefully \nassessed, and every relevant element must be shown. Cf. Wilson v. Valley Elec. Membership \nCorp., 8 F.3d 311, 314 (5th Cir. 1993) (commenting that “[m]ultiple factor tests are difficult to \napply”). In this case, when one examines the requirements of each of these doctrines, none \nclearly apply. \n \n42 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 43 of 80\n(a)  Pullman Abstention  \nNamed after its founding decision, R.R. Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, \n61 S. Ct. 643, 85 L. Ed. 971 (1941), Pullman abstention is proper only when there is (1) a federal \nconstitutional challenge to a state action and (2) an unclear issue of state law that if resolved \nwould make it unnecessary to rule on the constitutional question. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. \nUnauth. Prac. of L. Comm.,  State Bar of Tex., 283 F.3d 650, 653 (5th Cir. 2002). The Fifth \nCircuit has also taken the stance that this doctrine should be invoked in only narrow and limited \nspecial circumstances and applied where the state court decision could avoid a federal question \nand would also avoid a possible strain of the federal and state relationship. Moore v. Tangipahoa \nParish Sch. Bd., 507 F. App’x 389, 396 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, \n86–87, 90 S. Ct. 788, 25 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1970)).  \nIn essence, then, for Pullman to govern, an uncertain state law must be central to the \nfederal proceeding. Here, however, there is no state statute central to this controversy. Rather, \nthe Defendant’s interpretation of a federal statute and the extent to which her termination, \nregardless of its state law basis, violates the United States Constitution are the only issues. In \naddition, as Pullman requires that state law be confused and uncertain, Defendant’s failure to \nbring to this Court’s attention even one Louisiana case evidencing a persistent discord regarding \nthe meaning of either Section 46:437.11(D)(1) or Section 46:437.11(D)(2) counsels against its \ninvocation. On these bare facts, with no clarification of state law needed for this Court to \ndetermine whether Defendant’s “final action,” (Hr’g Tr. 6:2, Oct. 16, 2015), contravenes federal \nstatutory and constitutional law, Pullman abstention is inappropriate. See, e.g., Planned \nParenthood of Idaho, Inc. v. Wasden, 376 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1021 (D. Idaho 2005); Planned \nParenthood of Idaho, Inc. v. Wasden, 376 F.3d 908, 932 (9th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. \n43 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 44 of 80\n948, 125 S. Ct. 1694, 161 L. Ed. 2d 524 (2005). \n \n(b)  Younger Abstention  \nArticulated in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1971), \nYounger abstention applies if three circumstances arise: (1) there must be an ongoing state \nproceeding that is judicial in its nature, (2) the state must have an important interest in regulating \nthe subject matter of that claim, and (3) there must be adequate opportunity in the state \nproceeding to raise constitutional challenge. Rickhoff v. Willing, 457 F. App’x 355, 358 (5th Cir. \n2012) (citing Wightman v. Tex. Supreme Court, 84 F.3d 188, 189 (5th Cir. 1996)). First and \nforemost, Younger requires an ongoing state proceeding “judicial in nature.” Ohio Civil Rights \nComm’n, 477 U.S. at 627–28.  \nIn light of this key requirement and the suit’s present posture, Defendant’s own \nrepresentations render Younger inapposite. As Defendant’s counsel has conceded, no \nadministrative proceeding commences until or unless PPGC appeals, (Doc. 53-1 at 22; see also \nHr’g Tr. 16:8–17:9, Oct. 16, 2015), and PPGC has foresworn that option, (Hr’g Tr. 19:6–10, Oct. \n16, 2015). Meanwhile, the Individual Plaintiffs cannot possibly initiate such a proceeding as a \nmatter of state law, as Defendant’s two lawyers have admitted. (Hr’g Tr. 8:10–9:1, Oct. 16, \n2015; Hr’g Tr. 15:22–25, Sept. 2, 2015; Doc. 22 at 2–5; see also Doc. 46 at 18 n.13.) Regardless, \nno evidence has been adduced that any state quasi-judicial action predated the First Complaint’s \nfiling; Younger requires as much. Indeed, as she has rescinded the First Termination Letters, \nDefendant’s prospective agency action will necessarily post-date the commencement of this \nfederal proceeding. These facts alone render Younger inapplicable to this proceeding.27  \n                                                      \n27 Younger is also subject to three exceptions, at least two of which arguably apply. Bice v. \nLouisiana Pub. Defender Bd., 677 F.3d 712, 716 n.3 (5th Cir. 2012). \n44 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 45 of 80\n \n(c)  Colorado River Abstention  \nColorado River abstention, derived from Colorado River Water Conservation Dist., 424 \nU.S. 800, is exceptionally narrow, Jackson-Platts v. GE Capital Corp., 727 F.3d 1127, 1140 \n(11th Cir. 2013). In the Fifth Circuit, six elements must be satisfied:  \n1) assumption by either court of jurisdiction over a res, 2) relative inconvenience \nof  the  forums,  3)  avoidance  of  piecemeal  litigation,  4)  the  order  in  which \njurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums, 5) to what extent federal law \nprovides the rules of decision on the merits, and 6) the adequacy of the state \nproceedings in protecting the rights of the party invoking federal jurisdiction. \n \nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church v. Lucien, 756 F.3d 788, 798 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Stewart \nv. W. Heritage Ins. Co., 438 F.3d 488, 491 (5th Cir. 2006)). In general, the Fifth Circuit has \nfound Colorado River abstention applicable when there is a parallel suit in the state court at the \ntime of the federal suit also being brought with the same parties and the same issues. Stewart, \n438 F.3d at 491.  \nAs such, as with Younger, the absence of any parallel proceeding in a state agency or a \nstate court initiated before this federal suit’s filing must foreclose Colorado River’s application \nto the instant matter, with any modicum of doubt favoring the exercise of the federal jurisdiction \nconferred by Section 1396a(a)(23) and the Constitution. AAR Int’l, Inc. v. Nimelias Enters. S.A., \n250 F.3d 510, 520 (7th Cir. 2001) (“[A]ny doubt regarding the parallel nature of the foreign suit \nshould be resolved in favor of exercising jurisdiction[.]”); see also Moses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. \nv. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 28, 103 S. Ct. 927, 943, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1983) (holding \nthat “[i]f there is any substantial doubt” as to whether “the parallel state-court litigation will be \nan adequate vehicle for the complete and prompt resolution of the issues between the parties” it \nwould “be a serious abuse of discretion to grant the stay or dismissal at all” pursuant to Colorado \n45 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 46 of 80\nRiver). \n \n(d)  Burford Abstention  \nTraceable to Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S. Ct. 1098, 87 L. Ed. 1424 (1943), \nthis final doctrine contemplates the presence of a state-created avenue of relief put where the \nstate has a degree of specialized competence to hear such cases is present. See Romano, 721 F.3d \nat 380 (listing five factors). Put another way, Burford abstention is only appropriate when there \nis a danger that federal court review will “disrupt the [s]tate’s attempt to ensure uniformity in the \ntreatment of an essentially local problem.” New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of \nNew Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 362, 109 S. Ct. 2506, 2515, 105 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1989). Abstention is \nthus “not warranted, however, when a claim requires the federal court to decide predominating \nfederal issues that do not require resolution of doubtful questions of local law and policy.” \nVaqueria Tres Monjitas, Inc. v. Irizarry, 587 F.3d 464, 474 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nSuch is not the case here. It is the meaning of Section 1396a(a)(23), a federal statute, and \ntwo constructional provisions which constitute the central controversies. In fact, in interpreting \nSection 1396a(a)(8), whose language perfectly mirrors Section 1396a(a)(23), the Fifth Circuit \nrejected this same Defendant’s request for Burford abstention in no uncertain terms:  \nNone of these factors weighs in favor of abstention in this case. The cause of \naction arises under federal law, there are no apparent issues of state law or local \nfacts, the interest in proper application of federal Medicaid law is paramount, and \nthere is no special state forum for judicial review. \n \nRomano, 721 F.3d at 380; see also, e.g., Pub. Serv. Co. v. Patch, 167 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir. 1998) \n(“Burford abstention does not bar federal court injunctions against state administrative orders \nwhere there are predominating federal issues that do not require resolution of doubtful questions \n46 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 47 of 80\nof local law and policy.”) As with Colorado River, Younger, and Pullman, the prerequisites for \nBurford’s invocation are absent from this case. See New Orleans Pub. Serv., 491 U.S. at 361 \n(refusing to abstain under this doctrine when the federal claims were not “in any way entangled \nin a skein of state law that must be untangled before the federal case can proceed” (citing \nMcNeese v. Bd. of Educ. for Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. 187, Cahokia, 373 U.S. 668, 674, 83 S. Ct. \n1433, 1437, 10 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1963))). It too is thus inapposite. \n \nD.   CONCLUSION  \n  Based on well-settled law, this Court therefore rejects Defendant’s jurisdictional \nchallenges and declines to abstain. For purposes of both ripeness and standing, there is an \nimminent threat of harm. In addition, applying the appropriate abstention factors to the facts of \nthis case one-by-one, as the Fifth Circuit has long required, shows the impropriety of any one’s \napplication. Instead, it is the Court’s “strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon . . . \n[it] by Congress” via the Medicaid Act and, if later necessary, by the Constitution. Quakenbush, \n517 U.S. at 716; see also Indep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal., Inc. v. Shewry, 543 F.3d 1050, 1056–57 \n(9th Cir. 2008) (“It is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin \nstate officials from interfering with federal rights.”).  \n \nV.  DISCUSSION: PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nA.  APPLICABLE STANDARDS  \nA plaintiff must establish four elements to secure a preliminary injunction: (1) a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the \ninjunction is not issued, (3) that the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any \n47 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 48 of 80\nharm that will result if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an injunction will not \ndisserve the public interest.

Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir. 2009) (similarly characterizing a temporary \nrestraining order), a preliminary injunction aims “to prevent irreparable injury so as to preserve . \n. .

Ed. 2d 435 (1974) (“Ex parte temporary restraining orders . . . under \nfederal law . . . should be restricted to serving their underlying purpose of preserving the status \nquo and preventing irreparable harm just so long as is necessary to hold a hearing, and no \nlonger.”). By circumstance and necessity, in considering whether either a preliminary injunction \nor a temporary restraining order should issue, a court is “almost always” forced to rely upon \n“[an] abbreviated set of facts.” Klitzman, Klitzman & Gallagher v. Krut, 744 F.2d 955, 958 (3d \nCir. 1984); accord Texas v. Seatrain Int’l, S.

See, e.g., Janvey v. \nAlguire, 647 F.3d 585, 595 (5th Cir. 2011); Women’s Med. Ctr. of Nw. Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d \n411, 419, n. 15 (5th Cir. 2001).  \n48 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 49 of 80\nACLU of Fla., Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cnty. Sch. Bd., 557 F.3d 1177, 1231 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nid.).  \nIn applying the four factor test, “none of the four prerequisites has a fixed quantitative \nvalue. Rather, a sliding scale is utilized, which takes into account the intensity of each in a given \ncalculus.” Seatrain Int’l, S.A., 518 F.2d at 180. This often “requir[es] delicate balancing of the \nprobabilities of ultimate success at final hearing with the consequences of immediate irreparable \ninjury.” Klitzman, 744 F.3d at 958;  \n \nB.  FIRST ELEMENT: LIKELY SUCCESS ON THE MERITS \nPlaintiffs bring this civil action pursuant to Section 1983 based on Defendant’s alleged \nviolation of rights secured by the Medicaid Act and the United States Constitution. Specifically, \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendant’s attempt to terminate the Agreements violates the rights of the \nIndividual Plaintiffs under Section 1396a(a)(23)(A) and PPGC’s rights under both the Equal \nProtection Clause and the Freedom of Speech Clause of the United States Constitution. (Doc. 43 \n¶¶ 62–67 at 19–20.) In relevant part,29 Defendant contends that Section 1396a(a)(23) does not \ncreate a private cause of action for either PPGC or the Individual Plaintiffs and relies primarily \non Armstrong. (Doc. 53-1 at 18–24; see also Doc. 13 at 3–13.) \nIn this first element’s analysis, two overarching principles matter. First, if the Plaintiffs \nwere to prevail on their Section 1396a(a)(23) claim and/or PPGC was to prevail on either of its \ntwo constitutional claims, the same remedy—a permanent injunction—would be due, and any \npotential action by Defendant would be similarly affected. Accordingly, this Court need not \n                                                      \n29 Defendant’s argument s regarding Plaintiffs’ property interest and procedural due process, \n(Doc. 13 at 14–19; Doc. 53-1 at 13–18), are no longer viable in light of the Amended Complaint, \n(Doc. 43 ¶¶ 62–67 at 20–21).  \n49 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 50 of 80\nconclude that all Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of prevailing on all claims advanced in \nthe Amended Complaint for a preliminary injunction to issue at this time. If Plaintiffs satisfy the \nelements needed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the Individual Plaintiffs’ Section \n1396a(a)(23) claim only, so long as the other factors are met, a preliminary injunction is \nappropriate. Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v Girl Scouts of United States of America, 549 \nF.3d 1079, 1096 (7th Cir. 2008) (holding that plaintiff needed to show no more than “[a] chance \nof success on the merits of at least one of its claims” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see \nalso, e.g., Jackson v. N’Genuity Enters. Co., No. 09 C 6010, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113511, at \n*23, 2011 WL 4628683, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 3, 2011) (citing id.). Accordingly, because the \nCourt finds that the Individual Plaintiffs have a private right of action, see infra Part V.B.1, it \nneed (and will) not decide whether PPGC also has such a right, either on its own behalf or on \nbehalf of its recipient patients. See also Doc. 63 at 12 n.3, Bentley. \n  Second, the Plaintiffs must establish a “substantial likelihood of success.” This phrase has \nbeen defined in different ways. Compare 11A CHARLES A. WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRAC. & \nPROC. § 2948.3 (3d ed.) (“reasonable probability of success”), with Terex Corp. v. Cubex, Ltd., \nNo. 3:06-CV-1649-G ECF, 2006 U.S. Dist.

Unger Meat Co., \n779 F. Supp. 2d 840, 843 (N.D.

Mandate of 1396a(a)(23) \n(a)  Existence of a Private Right of Action under Section 1396a(a)(23)  \n51 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 52 of 80\n  Section 1396a(a)(23)30 reads: “A [s]tate plan for medical assistance must . . . provide . . . \n[that] any individual eligible for medical assistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or \nservices required . . .who undertakes to provide him such services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23) \n(emphasis added). Plaintiffs pursue their claim as a private right of action under § 1396a(a)(23). \nDefendant argues that this provision is not enforceable under §1983 because, she argues, § \n1396a(a)(23) does not provide a private cause of action. For the reasons which follow, the Court \nfinds that this provision does create a private right of action which can be pursued via §1983 by \nthe Individual Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Doc. 63 at 12 –13, Bentley; Doc. 45 at 12–15, Selig; Betlach, \n727 F.3d at 965–68; Indiana, 699 F.3d at 972–77; Harris v. Olszewski, 442 F.3d 456, 459 (6th \nCir. 2006). \nThe seminal holdings which support the holding of these courts—Wilder v. Virginia \nHospital Association, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S. Ct. 2510, 110 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1990); Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329, 117 S. Ct. 1353, 137 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1997); and Gonzaga University v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S. Ct. 2268, 153 L. Ed. 309 (2002)31—remain binding and undisturbed. \nThis fact too has been recognized by multiple courts. See, e.g., Doc. 45 at 12, Selig (“The Court \ndetermines that the Jane Does are likely to succeed in arguing that . . . [Section 1396a(a)(23)] \n                                                      \n30 Thus, in analyzing the Plaintiffs’ success on the merits on this claim, PPGC’s right to any \nadministrative remedy cannot be relevant. As Defendant has twice conceded, the Individual \nPlaintiffs actually have no such remedy. (Hr’g Tr. 8:18–9:12, Oct. 16, 2015; Hr’g Tr. 15:22 –25, \nSept. 2, 2015.) Whatever procedural due process rights afforded to PPGC under the state’s \napproved Medicaid plan, therefore, the Individual Plaintiffs demonstrably have none, as \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have emphasized, (Hr’g Tr. 14:17–24, Oct. 16, 2015; Hr’g Tr. 10:16–19, Sept. \n2, 2015.) \n31 Leaving Blessing unreversed, Gonzaga “clarified the application of the first ‘benefit’ factor [in \nBlessing] and underscored the central focus of this factor should be on whether the statutory \nprovision creates ‘rights-creating’ language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent \nto create new rights.” Johnson v. City of Detroit, 446 F.3d 614, 621 (6th Cir. 2006). \n52 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 53 of 80\nsatisfies the factors set forth in Gonzaga . . . and Blessing[.]”); see also Briggs v.

Aug. 27, 2015) \n(reaching the same conclusion and adding that “[t]he Armstrong Court’s discussion regarding the \nlack of a private cause of action to enforce Section 1396a(a)(30) was not a departure from \nexisting precedent”). Equally importantly, it has also been acknowledged by Defendant’s \ncounsel. (Hr’g Tr. 14:21–15:14, Sept. 2, 2015.)  \nThese precedents thus supply the three-part test that this Court must employ to determine \nwhether Section 1396a(a)(23) awards the Individual Plaintiff with a right enforceable under § \n1983. Equal Access for El Paso, Inc. v. Hawkins, 509 F.3d 697, 702 (5th Cir. 2007). Thus, if (1) \nCongress “intended” that Section 1396a(a)(23) “benefit the [individual] plaintiff[s],” (2) “the \nright assertedly protected by th[is] statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement \nwould strain judicial competence,” and (3) Section 1396a(a)(23) “unambiguously impose[s] a \nbinding obligation on the [s]tates,” the Individual Plaintiffs, here represented by all Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, may proceed to sue Defendant for violating Section 1396a(a)(23) pursuant to § 1983, \nhaving “advanc[ed] a violation of a ‘federal law.’” Hood, 235 F.3d at 924–25 (quoting Blessing, \n520 U.S. at 340–41), rev’d on other grounds, as observed in Hawkins, 509 F.3d at 701 n.4. Not \n53 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 54 of 80\nvoidable by one decision’s dicta or a plurality’s construal of a different subsection, this Gonzaga \nand Blessing standard for unearthing congressional intent to create a private cause of action \ngoverns still.  \nRead plainly, § 1396a(a)(23) easily satisfies each prong. It contains rights-creating and \nmandatory language, and it has an unmistakable individual focus. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). \nIndeed, with its terms so comprehensive and clear, court after court forced to peruse this \nprovision has reached the same conclusion: “[W]e hold that the Medicaid Act's free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement confers a private right of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Betlach, 727 \nF.3d at 963; accord, e.g., Doc. 63 at 12–19, Bentley; Doc. 45 at 12, Selig; Indiana, 699 F.3d at \n968; Harris, 442 F.3d at 459. True, as Defendant notes, some of these courts applied § \n1396a(a)(23) pre-Armstrong. Yet, their distinctive factual predicates do not affect the more \nuniform applicability (and cogency) of these courts’ interpretation of the unchanged statute at \nissue here in accordance with the standard laid out in Wilder and its progeny. Presented with the \nsame exact subsection, they discerned a private cause of action within it. In following Betlach, \nIndiana, Harris, and Selig, this Court simply endorses a statutory construction predicated on \nvenerable canons and jurisprudence founded on binding Supreme Court precedent, see Nicole \nHuberfeld, Where There is a Right, There Must be a Remedy (Even in Medicaid), 102 KY. L.J. \n327, 343 (2013–14) (“When states agree to participate in the Medicaid program, they know that \nfailure to comply with the terms of the Medicaid Act will result in either the Secretary [of \nDHHS] taking action to bring the state into alignment with the Act or private enforcement of the \nlaw . . . . [T]he private enforcement of the Medicaid Act is [therefore] not a surprise to the states, \nand it has not been for decades.”). \nCrucially, this reading of § 1396a(a)(23) is consistent with the construction given to other \n54 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 55 of 80\nsimilar provisions of the Medicaid Act, a fact that triggers the application of another familiar \ncanon of interpretation, see TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S. Ct. 441, 449, 151 L. \nEd. 2d 339 (2001) (“[A] statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be \nprevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)).  \nFor instance, the Medicaid Act’s Reasonable Promptness Provision requires that a state \nplan for medical assistance “provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical \nassistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be \nfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) \n(emphasis added). In the persuasive (and decisive) Romano, the Fifth Circuit itself applied \nBlessing’s three-part test as modified by Gonzaga and found that this section, linguistically \nidentical to Section 1396a(a)(23), creates a private cause of action enforceable under § 1983. 721 \nF.3d at 375, 378–80; accord, e.g., Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d 180, 192 (3d Cir. 2003) \n(reaching the same conclusion as to Section 1396a(a)(10) and (a)(15)).  \nSimilar in tone to Section 1396a(a)(8) and (a)(23), Section § 1396a(a)(3) reads: “A [s]tate \nplan for medical assistance must . . . provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before \nthe State agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied or \nis not acted upon with reasonable promptness.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) (emphasis added); \nMcCarthy v. Hawkins, 381 F.3d 407, 411 n.3 (5th Cir. 2004) (quoting id.). This section self-\nevidently contains the same words prominent in § 1396a(a)(23), including “individual” and \n“must.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). Logically, therefore, another court similarly construed it: \n“[The] language is mandatory, the provision contains rights-creating language, and there is an \nindividual focus.” Detgen v. Janek, 945 F. Supp. 2d 746, 754 (N.D. Tex. 2013); see also, e.g., \n55 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 56 of 80\nShakhnes v. Berlin, 689 F.3d 244, 247, 254, 256-57 (2d Cir. 2012) (concluding that private \nplaintiffs can sue under § 1983 to enforce Section 1396a(a)(3)).  \nIn a final example, Section 1396a(bb)(5) states: “In the case of services furnished by a \n[FQHC] . . . pursuant to a contract between the center or clinic and a managed care entity . . ., the \nState plan shall provide for payment to the center or clinic by the State.” 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(bb)(5) (emphasis added). This subparagraph too, the First Circuit has observed, speaks in \n“individualistic terms, rather than at the aggregate level of institutional policy or practice,” refers \nto “specific, discrete beneficiary group,” and contains mandatory and “highly specific terms,” \nand therefore creates a right subject to enforcement under § 1983. Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., \nInc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 74, 75 (1st Cir. 2005). \nIn sum, an overwhelming majority of courts confronted with language in the Medicaid \nAct identical to that before the Court now have found it to impart a right of action cognizable \nunder § 1983. To read these identical terms differently, as Defendant now proposes, is \ninsupportable pursuant to one “well established principle[] of statutory construction,” RadLAX \nGateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 132 S. Ct. 2065, 2073, 182 L. Ed. 2d 967 (2012). To \nwit, “[t]he normal rule of statutory construction assumes that identical words used in different \nparts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.” Sorenson v. Sec’y of Treasury, 475 \nU.S. 851, 860, 106 S. Ct. 1600, 1606, 89 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1986); see also, e.g., United States v. \nMarshall, 798 F.3d 296, 309 (5th Cir. 2015) (applying this canon). While this rule “readily yields \nto context,” Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2441, 189 L. Ed. 2d 372 (2014), \nnothing in the language of Section 1396a(a)(23) compels its abandonment.32  \n                                                      \n32 Crucially, Defendant has given no reason reflecting “distinct statutory objects calling for \ndifferent implementation strategies” that would justify construing Section 1396a(a)(23) \ndifferently than 1396a(a)(8). She has pointed the Court to Armstrong alone, which, as shown \nbelow, will not do. See infra Part V.B.1.b. \n56 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 57 of 80\n \n(b)  Defendant’s Misplaced Emphasis on Armstrong  \nDefendant urges this Court to discard this consensus on the basis of the recent Armstrong \ndecision, (Hr’g Tr. 19:19–24, Sept. 2, 2015; Hr’g Tr. 8:4–5, Oct. 16, 2015). However, this \ndecision cannot bear the weight placed upon it by Defendant. The Selig court said it well: \nArmstrong “does not overrule, or even significantly undermine, the precedent that informed the \nreasoning of the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in recognizing a private right of action under \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23).” Doc. 45 at 12, Selig. This Court agrees: by its own terms, Armstrong \ncannot control for four different reasons. \nFirst, Armstrong is narrower than Defendant says. The Armstrong plurality did not dissect \n§ 1396a(a)(23); it did not even delve into the meaning of a similarly worded provision like § \n1396a(a)(3) or (a)(8). Instead, Armstrong focused on § 1396a(a)(30), which compels a state plan \nto “provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care \nand services available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary \nutilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, \neconomy, and quality of care.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30). Armstrong stressed that this \nsubparagraph, not every paragraph in Section 1396a(a), lacked the “rights-creating” language \nprominent in statutes in which a private right of action could be discerned. 135 S. Ct. at 1387 \n(Scalia, J., plurality). Further, the Court noted that it was not focused on the rights of an \nindividual; instead, “[i]t is phrased as a directive to the federal agency charged with approving \nstate Medicaid plans.” Id. Unlike Section 1396a(a)(30), whose precise text was examined so \ndiligently in Armstrong, both “rights-creating” and individual-focused language are prominent in \n(a)(23). See supra Part V.B.1.a.  \n57 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 58 of 80\nAs a counter, Defendant claims that § 1396a(a)(23) and (a)(30) contain “the exact same \nrights creating type of language.” (Hr’g Tr. 16:17–22, Sept. 2, 2015; see also Doc. 53-1 at 20.) \nThis contention is based purely and incorrectly on the introductory words of the overall section \n(“a [s]tate plan must . . .”), not the precise language of the controlling paragraph, i.e. Sections \n1396a(a)(30). It thus ignores the specific reference to “individual” and the use of the word “may” \nin Section 1396a(a)(23): “[A]ny individual . . . may obtain from any institution . . . qualified to \nperform the service or services required . . . who undertakes to provide him [or her] such \nservices.” 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23). True, the state “must” provide a plan so permitting, but \nSection 1396a(a)(23) quite clearly empowers a Medicaid eligible “individual” to choose amongst \na set of providers competent in their selected medical field. In essence, Defendant is urging this \nCourt to rewrite a plain statute, a task at odds with its judicial duty “to ascertain — neither to add \nnor to subtract, neither to delete nor to distort” an enactment’s final terms. Ariz. State Bd. for \nCharter Sch. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 464 F.3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 2006). \nSecond, Defendant has extended Armstrong’s “rationale” far beyond its own stated \nlimits. True, four justices went further, specifically dismissing respondents’ arguments for “a \ncause of action” predicated on “the Medicaid Act itself.” Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1387 (Scalia, \nJ., plurality). However, Armstrong’s next two paragraphs narrowly define the reference to “the \nMedicaid Act” to Section 1396a(a)(30) alone, and no majority coalesced around the broader \nproposition embraced by Justice Scalia, id. at 1387–88 (Scalia, J., plurality). Instead, Justice \nBreyer’s concurrence, the fifth vote in Armstrong, specifically concentrated on the unique text of \nSection 1396a(a)(30), describing it as “set[ting] forth a federal mandate that is broad and \nnonspecific” and “appl[ying] its broad standards to the setting of rates.” Id. at 1388 (Breyer, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Continuing, Justice Breyer emphasized that “the \n58 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 59 of 80\nhistory of ratemaking demonstrates that administrative agencies are far better suited to this task \nthan judges.” Id. As such, in accordance with the Fifth Circuit’s binding command that a “joint \nopinion is . . . considered the holding of the Court . . . [only] as [to] the narrowest position \nsupporting the judgment,” Cole, 790 F.3d at 571, this Court refuses to take Armstrong beyond \nthe confines of § 1396a(a)(30), the only provision upon whose interpretation a majority could \nagree. In fact, as Defendant conceded at the First Hearing, (Hr’g Tr. 15:9–14, Sept. 2, 2015), \nArmstrong did not overrule Gonzaga or Wilder, and it was Gonzaga that formed the basis of the \nFifth Circuit’s interpretation of § 1396a(a)(8) in Romano, 721 F.3d at 378–80. Based on the \nactual majority’s “rationale,” (Hr’g Tr. 16:18, Sept. 2, 2015), Armstrong can be read as definitive \nas to the breadth of Section 1396a(a)(30) but of no other section, including the Free-Choice-of-\nProvider now before this Court.  \nThird, just because § 1396a(a)(30) and (a)(23) are subparts of one act does not make \nthem identical in form and effect, as Defendant contends in seeking to expand Armstrong beyond \nits express ambit. (See, e.g., Doc. 53-1 at 18–20; Hr’g Tr. 16:17–22, Sept. 2, 2015.) Rather, \n“[t]he mere fact that all the Medicaid laws are embedded within the requirements for a state plan \ndoes not, by itself, make all of the Medicaid provisions into ones stating a mere institutional \npolicy or practice rather than creating an individual right.” Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc., \n397 F.3d at 74. This command, in fact, is rooted in a whole other subsection: “In an action \nbrought to enforce a provision of this chapter [which includes the Medicaid statutes], such \nprovision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of this chapter \nrequiring a State plan or specifying the required contents of a State plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2; \nBK v. N.H. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 814 F. Supp. 2d 59, 68 (D.N.H. 2011) (citing id.); \nWatson v. Weeks, 436 F.3d 1152, 1158 (9th Cir. 2006) (“Congress responded to . . . [Wilder] by \n59 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 60 of 80\nenacting . . . 32 U.S.C. 1320a-2 which blocks any Medicaid Act provision from being deemed \nunenforceable by an individual merely because the provision contains state plan requirements.”) \nBased on this subsection’s implication, the fact that Section 1396a(a)(23), like Section \n1396a(a)(30), commences with the same introductory phrase (“A State plan for medical \nassistance must . . . .”), 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a), should not be dispositive here, as Defendant \nmaintains, (Hr’g Tr. 16:17–22, Sept. 2, 2016; see also Hr’g Tr. 8:10–17, Oct. 16, 2015). Instead, \nthe entire language of the former, consistently construed to award a private cause of action to \nMedicaid beneficiaries, see, e.g., supra Part V.B.1.a; see also Doc. 63 at 18, Bentley (finding \nitself persuaded by “these remarkably consistent holdings”), must be honored.  \nOne final fact weighs against Armstrong’s extension. Neither revolutionary nor \nanomalous, Armstrong actually aligned with a majority of federal courts in its construction of \nSection 1396a(a)(30) as to Medicaid providers in Gonzaga’s aftermath. See, e.g., Equal Access \nfor El Paso, 509 F.3d at 704; Mandy v. Owens, 464 F.3d 1139, 1148 (10th Cir. 2006); Westside \nMothers v. Olszeqski, 454 F.3d 532, 542–43 (6th Cir. 2006); Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, \n1059 (9th Cir. 2005); Long Term Pharmacy Alliance v. Ferguson, 362 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. \n2004); Bradley J. Sayles, Preemption or Bust: A Review of the Recent Trends in Medicaid \nPreemption Actions, 27 J. CONTEMP. HEALTH L. & POL’Y 120, 130 & nn. 66–67 (2010) (making \nthis point); Nicole Huberfeld, Bizarre Life Triangle: The Spending Clause, Section 1983, and \nMedicaid Entitlements, 42 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 413, 447–48 (2008) (same). In contrast, \nDefendant is now asking this Court to expand Armstrong not just beyond its limits but as \ncontrary to precedent’s overwhelming weight. In its circumstances, not just its legal reasoning, \nArmstrong can therefore be distinguished from the case at bar. See , e.g., Townsend, 2008 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 52549, at *23–24, 2008 WL 2743284, at *12 (dismissing some claims under the \n60 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 61 of 80\nMedicaid Act but not plaintiffs’ Section 1396a(a)(23) one, among others).  \n \n(c)  Defendant’s Misplaced Argument on Section 1396a(a)(23)’s Ambiguity and for \nDeference \n  Defendant argues that, even if the Individual Plaintiffs have the right to choose a \nqualified provider and enforce that right via Section 1983, PPGC is not “qualified” under Section \n1396a(a)(23) because DHH can deem it so by exercising Section 46:437.11(D)(2). (Hr’g Tr. \n11:3–7, Oct. 16, 2015; Doc. 53-1 at 21; Hr’g Tr. 9:18–10:5, Sept. 2, 2015.) In clear and \npersuasive terms, the court in Selig rightly rejected that argument.  \nHere, the dispute is whether the Government, either through the Governor or \nthrough [Arkansas Department of Human Services’ (“ARDS”)] actions, \nimpermissibly interfered with the Jane Does’ choice of a qualified provider when \nit terminated PHH as a provider in the manner and for the reason it articulates. If \nthis right found in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23) and conferred on Medicaid recipients \nis to have the meaning, and if it is to have the meaning ascribed to it by the Court \nin O’Bannon [v. Town Ct. Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 787 (1980)], ADHS cannot \nbe permitted to declare a provider unqualified and then to use that declaration  to \nput out of reach any future challenges to its conduct by Medicaid recipients.  \n \nDoc. 45 at 19, Selig.33 Based on the filings made, Defendant’s defense relies on one of two \nassumptions: either “qualified” is so vague as to fail the Blessing test or so ambiguous as to \neffectively award it discretion to define “qualified” according to a standard of competence \ncircumscribed by her own whims. Her success on this ground depends on showing first that \n“qualified to perform the service or services required” in Section 1396a(a)(23) is inherently \n                                                      \n33 Indeed, when she first relied on Section 46:437.11(D)(1), counsel for Defendant conceded her \nreading of Section 1396a(a)(23) is “circular.” (Hr’g Tr. 21:12-13, Sept. 2, 2015.) If so, then it \ncannot stand, for no statute can be interpreted so as to render its specific terms superfluous or \ndivorced from “the phrase in which it is embedded.” Betlach, 727 F.3d at 960. This Court’s duty \n“to give effect, if possible, to every . . . word of a statute” compels rejecting an interpretation that \nDefendant herself concedes makes Section 1396a(a)(23) either absurd or illogical. United States \nv. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538, 75 S. Ct. 513, 520, 99 L.

Both her first premise and second inference, however, fall before the plain import of \nSection 1396a(a)(23). \nIn cases of statutory interpretation, no deference is owed where the term in question is \nclear on its face. In determining the meaning of a statutory term, the rules of interpretation and \nconstruction are clear: a court must begin with the relevant language. Landreth Timber Co. v. \nLandreth, 471 U.S. 681, 685, 105 S. Ct. 2297, 2301, 85 L. Ed. 2d 692 (1985); see also Temp. \nEmp’t Servs. v. Trinity Marine Grp., 261 F.3d 456, 462 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing id.). If the \nmeaning is plain and unambiguous and the statutory scheme is both “coherent and consistent,” \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S. Ct. 843, 846, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997); see \nalso Salazar v. Maimon, 750 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing id.), “the sole function of the \ncourts is to enforce it according to its terms,” Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 \nS. Ct. 192, 194, 61 L. Ed. 442 (1917); see also, e.g., Meredith v. Time Ins. Co., 980 F.2d 352, \n356 & n.18 (9th Cir. 1993) (quoting id.); In re McCarthy, 391 B.R. 372, 375 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. \n2008) (same).  \nUnder these rules, Section 1396a(a)(23) is no quandary. Linguistically, “qualified” means \n“[p]ossessing the necessary qualifications; capable and competent.” Qualified, BLACK’S LAW \nDICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Inputting this definition of “qualified” into § 1396a(a)(23), it is \nclear that a provider  “qualified to perform the service or services required” is one who is \n“capable and competent” of “perform[ing]” the “service or services” for which he, she, or it has \nbeen contracted by the Medicaid eligible individual seeking “medical assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(23). If it is competent to offer those services, an individual “may” choose them without \na state intruding, and if a state attempts to render it unqualified based on activities that it does not \n62 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 63 of 80\nundertake, it has stripped “qualified” of its natural meaning and effectively removed the phrase \n“to perform the service or services required” from the explicit text of Section 1396a(a)(23). It \nrequires no specialized agency expertise to reach this conclusion; no factual development is \nnecessary for this language to be so understood. Rather, it follows naturally from this provision’s \nplain meaning, as illuminated by the surrounding text. See Betlach, 727 F.3d at 965. “[I]f the \nintent of Congress is clear,” as evidenced by the use of an unambiguous word so clarified, “that \nis the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the \nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. \n837, 842–43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). \nWith this law in mind, one fact matters greatly. On September 2, 2015, Defendant \nconceded that PPGC is competent to provide the services required by the Agreements and by the \nMedicaid Act. (Hr’g Tr. 12:17–20, Sept. 2, 2015.) Thereafter, this concession was never \nretracted. (Hr’g Tr. 22:4–23:5, Oct. 2, 2016.) In so doing, Defendant has admitted that PPGC is \n“qualified” within the statute’s most minimal and straightforward meaning. In concluding that \nPlaintiffs will likely show that Defendant has contravened Section 1396a(a)(23), this Court \nechoes the Ninth Circuit: “Nowhere in the Medicaid Act has Congress . . .  indicated that each \nstate is free to define . . . [‘qualified’] for purposes of its own Medicaid program however it sees \nfit.” Betlach, 727 F.3d at 970.  \nEven if this Court were to regard “qualified” as ambiguous, however, DHH’s \ninterpretation would deserve no deference. In essence, Defendant contends that “qualified” is an \nineradicably ambiguous term, so unfettered in content that no outer bounds but her own opinion \ncan be set, (Doc. 13 at 8; Doc. 53-1 at 21), so that this one word has become “an interpretive \nwormhole, whose supposed ambiguity leads to a galaxy of unfettered agency discretion,” \n63 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 64 of 80\nWheaton v. McCarthy, 800 F.3d 282, 288 (6th Cir. 2015). But, for deference to be extended \nunder well-settled jurisprudence, certain prerequisites must be satisfied. Thus, “[a] precondition \nto deference under Chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority” to the \nparticular agency. Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 649, 110 S. Ct. 1384, 1391, 108 L. \nEd. 2d 585 (1990), cited in, e.g., Alaska Wilderness League v. Jewell, 788 F.3d 1212, 1219 (9th \nCir. 2015). In addition, that same interpretation must be precedential, carrying “the force of law.” \nDhuka v. Holder, 716 F.3d 149, 155 (5th Cir. 2013). If not precedential, a lower form of \ndeference applies, with the weight of an agency’s judgment “in a particular case” dependent \n“upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency \nwith earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if \nlacking power to control.” Id. at 154 (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S. \nCt. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944)); accord Rubio v. Lynch, 787 F.3d 288, 291 (5th Cir. 2015). Even \nif these requirements are satisfied, deference is only accorded if the statute is truly “ambiguous” \nregarding the precise “question at issue” and if the agency’s interpretation is a “reasonable” and \nhence “permissible construction of the statute” at hand. Orellana-Monson v. Holder, 685 F.3d \n511, 517 (5th Cir. 2012); see also, e.g., Siew v. Holder, 742 F.3d 603, 607 n.27 (5th Cir. 2014) \n(citing id.); United States v. Baptiste, 34 F. Supp. 3d 662, 670 (W.D. Tex. 2014) (same); cf. Carl \nSunstein, Law and Administration after Chevron, 90 COLUM. L. REV. 2071, 2087 (1990) \n(elaborating upon the reasons for deference to administrative agencies). \nAssuming “qualified” is truly “ambiguous,” DHH’s interpretation does not meet these \nestablished predicates. Not the product of considered rulemaking or reflected in a history of \nenforcement, DHH has yet to provide even one bit of evidence that it has ever so construed \n“qualified” to exclude a provider whose competence is not at issue. For example, while Section \n64 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 65 of 80\n46:437(D)(1) had been used on “three prior distinguishable occasions,” (Doc. 34 at 3), all three \ninvolved overpayment that DHH allowed the offender to correct pre-termination, (Doc. 34-1 at 2, \n4, 6). The limited case law available to this Court, meanwhile, suggests that Section \n46:437.11(D)(2) has been limited to instances where criminal infractions have been credibly \nalleged and/or financial malfeasance has been plausibly evidenced. See, e.g., Midtown Med. v. \nDep’t of Health & Hosps., 2012 La. App. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 1889 (La. Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2012) \n(termination predicated on DHH’s attempted “monetary recoupment” and assessment of a \n“monetary penalty”); Cmty. Care-Bossier, Inc. v. Foti, No. 5:06CV181, 2006 WL 811944 (W.D. \nLa. Feb. 7, 2006) (“On or about January 24, 2006, DHH was notified that several employees \nand/or owners of CCB had been arrested, that bank accounts in the names of CCB and the \narrested employees/owners had been frozen, and that medical records in the possession of CCB \nhad been seized by agents of the Louisiana Department of Justice.”).  \nAdditionally, Defendant’s present position is not even “embodied in opinion letters, \npolicy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines,” which though “lack[ing] the \nforce of law,” elicit some judicial respect. Christensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S. \nCt. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000). Indeed, in citing the various meanings that “qualified” may \nhave, she gives no source to credit her unique interpretation, (Doc. 13 at 8; Doc. 53-1 at 21), and \nher own lawyer admitted that at least her original denotation of “qualified” was “circular,” (Hr’g \nTr. 21:12–13, Sept. 2, 2015), thereby rendering it unpersuasive and raising doubt about her \npresent reasoning’s thoroughness. White v. Black, 190 F.3d 366, 368-69 (5th Cir. 1999); see also \nFAA v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1441, 1449, 182 L. Ed. 2d 497 (2012) (rejecting the use of “a general \n(and notably circular) definition”). This decision to adopt a definition of “qualified” divorced \nfrom a provider’s “competence,” then, bears none of the marks of considered rulemaking or \n65 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 66 of 80\nevidence the exercise of some agency particular expertise, as the most minimal deference \ndoctrines require. See Vigil v. Leavitt, 381 F.3d 826, 835 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nLastly, this Court finds no merit in Defendant’s factual contentions regarding the recent \nnature of CMS’ interpretation. Before this Court, Defendant has claimed that her counsel’s \nconversation with CMS provided “some contending views . . . as to what qualified mean[s].” \n(Hr’g Tr. 19:2–7, Sept. 2, 2015.) In Defendant’s Reply, she adds an additional accusation, \nclaiming that CMS has propounded an interpretation of “qualified” in the Statement of Interest \nnever before evidenced or proclaimed. (Doc. 31 at 4.) Both these statements, however, are \ndisingenuous. \nThe first assertion appears to be based on the First (and Second and Third) Kennedy \nDeclarations, yet in none did Ms. Kennedy so describe her conversation with CMS. Rather, per \nthe First Kennedy Declaration, CMS did no more than “advise[]” DHH that it “has the authority \nto withhold federal Medicaid dollars from Louisiana or seek injunctive relief for failure to \ncomply with the Medicaid Act.” Such language, even if it is most generously construed in \nDefendant’s favor, simply does not imply that CMS acceded to Defendant’s premise (that \n“qualified” as sufficiently “ambiguous” as to be indefinable) or that CMS acknowledged DHH’s \nauthority to define it in a manner inconsistent with CMS’ understanding of § 1396a(a)(23).  \nMeanwhile, DHH has seemingly overlooked an Informational Bulletin, dated June 1, \n2011, sent by CMS to every state Medicaid agency.34 In this short bulletin, a matter of public \n                                                      \n34 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), this Court may take judicial notice of \n“publically-available documents and transcripts” produced by a state or federal agency “which \nwere matters of public record directly relevant to the issue at hand.” Funk v. Stryker Corp., 631 \nF.3d 777, 783 (5th Cir. 2011); see also, e.g., Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 454, 461 n.9 (5th \nCir. 2007) (“[I]t is clearly proper in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to take judicial notice of matters \nof public record.”); Benak v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P., 435 F.3d 396, 401 n.15 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(noting that a court can take judicial notice of newspaper articles to “indicate what was in the \npublic realm at the time”); Denius v. Dunlap, 330 F.3d 919, 926–27 (7th Cir. 2003) (taking \n66 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 67 of 80\nrecord, CENTER FOR MEDICAID, CHIP AND SURVEY & CERTIFICATIONS, CMS INFORMATIONAL \nBULLETIN (June 1, 2011), available at http://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-\nGuidance/downloads/6-1-11-Info-Bulletin.pdf (last visited on Oct. 28, 2015), CMS addressed \n“some inquiries as to whether States may exclude certain providers from participating in \nMedicaid based on their scope of practice,” offering a cogent “review of longstanding federal \nlaw.” CMS, CMCS INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN 1 (June 1, 2011). As this bulletin continues, \n“[s]tates are not . . . permitted to exclude providers from the program solely on the basis of the \nrange of medical services they provide”; a determination of the extent to which a Medicaid \nprovider is “qualified” for purposes of § 1396a(a)(23), it explains, must be related to the actual \n“scope of services” offered by the relevant provider. Id. at 1–2. In other words, more than four \nyears before DHH attempted to terminate the Agreements, CMS endorsed the interpretation of § \n1396a(a)(23) substantially echoed in the Statement of Interest: “[T]erminating PPGC from . . . \n[Louisiana’s] Medicaid program without providing any justification related to PPGC’s \nqualifications to provide medical services would violate . . . § 1396a(a)(23),” (Doc. 24 at 2). \nBecause CMS, not DHH, is the agency charged with the Medicaid Act’s management and thus \nthe implementation of, among many, Section 1396a(a)(23), any deference owed would more \nrightly given to CMS’ construction, not DHH’s newfangled one, assuming the existence of even \nminor statutory ambiguity.35 See Hood, 391 F.3d at 590–91 (citing to CMS’ interpretation of the \nMedicaid Act and rejecting a construction advanced by DHH); see, e.g., St. Mary’s Hosp. of \n                                                                                                                                                                           \njudicial notice of information on official government website); Cali v. E. Coast Aviation Servs., \nLtd., 178 F. Supp. 2d 276, 287 n. 6 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (taking judicial notice of documents from \nPennsylvania state agencies and the Federal Aviation Administration). CMS’ own informational \nbulletins surely qualify.  \n35 It is worth noting that Congress’ delegation to CMS does not necessarily and automatically \nimply a concurrent delegation to a state actor of the unfettered prerogative to promulgate official \nand binding interpretations of a federal statute superior to any advanced by the actual federal \nagency assigned this interpretive power. Defendant has offered no support for such a proposition.  \n67 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 68 of 80\nRochester v. Leavitt, 416 F.3d 906, 914 (8th Cir. 2005) (holding that CMS’ interpretation of the \nMedicaid Act respect, but not deference); Ctr. for Special Needs Trust Admin., Inc. v. Olson, 676 \nF.3d 688, 700–01 (8th Cir. 2012) (emphasizing that even if a CMS letter has persuasive power it \ncannot override the Medicaid Act’s plain language).  \n \n(d)  Considering Defendants’ Reasons for Claiming PPGC is Unqualified \nLike the Selig, Herbert and Bentley courts, this Court finds it likely that Plaintiffs will \nprevail on their Section 1396a(a)(23) claim. This subsection allows a private cause of action, and \nDefendant has already conceded that PPGC is competent to provide the services it renders in \nLouisiana. Thus, PPGC is “qualified” as that term must be naturally (and plainly) defined, as the \nSeventh and Ninth Circuits concluded in Indiana and Betlach. For the purposes of a preliminary \ninjunction, their likelihood of success has been established. Plaintiffs have provided more than \nenough precedent, evidence and argument to lead this Court to believe they have a reasonable \nprobability of success.  \nNonetheless, given Defendant’s recent invocation of Section 46:437.11(D)(2) and not \nSection 46:437.11(D)(1), this Court feels compelled to address the facial credibility of \nDefendant’s new grounds for termination. In the Second Termination Letters, Defendant gives \nthree “violations” justifying its terminations: first, PPGC’s settlement of an FCA suit in Texas \nwhich it did not report to DHH; second, the involvement of a PPGC affiliate in a pending Texas \ncase which survived a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal and third, PPGC’s alleged misrepresentations in a \nletter responding to inquiries about the video tapes. (Doc. 39-1.) Having subjected these reasons \nto scrutiny, this Court concludes that, even if Defendant’s definition of “qualified” prevails, \nDHH’s reasons for disqualifying PPGC likely will not. \n68 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 69 of 80\nThe first of Defendant’s reasons, the Reynolds Settlement, is likely to fail. The claim was \nbrought by an FCA plaintiff, not the government, which choose not to intervene.36 The \nsettlement expressly disavows PPGC’s liability. (Doc. 54-1 at 5.) It therefore falls into the \nexception set forth in Title 50 for certain FCA actions: “If a False Claims Act action or other \nsimilar civil action is brought by a Qui-Tam plaintiff, no violation of this provision has occurred \nuntil the defendant has been found liable in the action.” LA. ADMIN. CODE tit. 50, § 4147(12)(c) \n(emphasis added). Title 50 plainly and unambiguously requires that liability be “found,” whether \nby admission or by some fact-finder. Since Reynolds involved no such finding, Defendant’s first \nstated reason contradicts DHH’s own code. With no citation to authority, Defendant’s counsel \nasks the Court to reject the “literal” language of § 4147(12)(c) , (Hr’g Tr. 37:12–14, Oct. 16, \n2015), in defiance of every well-known rule of interpretation. Urging the Court to adopt what he \n“think[s] that means,” he asks this Court to revise a plain provision, a task far beyond a judge’s \nproper province and the Secretary’s prescribed powers.  \nOne other fact undercuts the Reynolds Settlement’s significance. Plaintiffs have credibly \nshown that DHH was aware of the Reynolds Settlement long before October 14, 2015, with \nDefendant’s own emails suggesting that it did not find it sufficient to provide “credible \nevidence” of Medicaid fraud. (Doc. 46-3 at 2.) Thus, in spite of the Second Termination Letters’ \nimplications to the contrary, (Doc. 39-1 at 2, 5, 8, 11), DHH knew, having been “notified,” of \nthis settlement, (Doc. 46-3 at 2; Hr’g Tr. 41:23–42:11, Oct. 16, 2015). Based on Title 50’s \nsimple terms and Defendant’s own words from 2013, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on proving \nthe irrelevance of the Reynolds Settlement.    \n                                                      \n36 That the government had to sign off on an agreement and the case’s dismissal is a statutory \nrequirement. 31 USCS § 3730(b)(1). It does not mean that the government was an active party or \nlitigant. See United States ex rel. Carter v. Bridgepoint Educ., Inc., 305 F.R.D. 225, 230–31 \n(S.D. Cal. 2014) (explaining the complex subtleties involved in the FCA).  \n69 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 70 of 80\nDefendant’s second ground for alleging fraud—the Carroll case—rests on a quote drawn \nfrom a judge’s ruling on a motion to dismiss. As revealed by that opinion’s full text, per Rule \n12(b), “[t]he court concludes that Carroll has adequately pleaded factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that Planned Parenthood knowingly filed false claims.” \nDoc. 31 at 17, Carroll. Defendant’s allegation that the court in Carroll found “that the \ninformation already provided allows the court to draw the reasonable inference” that fraud took \nplace, (Doc. 39-1 at 2) is clearly wrong. Rather, as counsel for Defendant conceded in oral \nargument, for purposes of the motion before that court, the plaintiff’s allegations were only \nassumed to be true, as Rule 12(b) requires. (Hr’g Tr. 36:2–11, Oct. 16, 2015.) That court never \nmade a factual finding of fraud, as the Second Termination Letters imply by citing to this \nopinion as proof of “violations and misconduct by affiliates and providers-in-fact” of PPGC, \n(Doc. 39-1 at 2, 5, 8, 11). Instead, this court ruled only that the plaintiff had plead his case \n“adequate[ly].” Doc. 31 at 17, Carroll. Even today, Carroll appears either to still be in discovery \nor to have not yet been tried, (Hr’g Tr. 27:15–20, Oct. 16, 2015), so that no liability—and no \nfraud or a violation of the Medicaid Act or relevant regulations—has actually been “found” by a \nsingle factfinder. In other words, the second ground in the Second Termination letters cannot \nsatisfy the language of Title 50.  \nDefendant’s third asserted ground is that PPGC made unspecified misrepresentations in \nviolation of Section 46:437.14(A)(1), in response to her letter inquiries. MAPIL defines \n“misrepresentation” with precision as “the knowing failure to truthfully or fully disclose any and \nall information required, or the concealment of any and all information required on a claim or a \nprovider agreement or the making of a false or misleading statement to the department relative to \nthe medical assistance programs.” LA. R.S. § 46:437.3(15); see also Caldwell ex rel. State v. \n70 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 71 of 80\nJanssen Pharmaceutica, Inc., 144 So. 3d 898, 910 (La. 2014) (citing id.). Not one \nmisrepresentation is specified or substantiated in her letter or by her attorneys, and each, on the \nrecord now before the Court, has been credibly contradicted in PPGC’s August Letter, (Doc. 39-\n1 at 3, 6, 9, 12; Doc. 46-1 at 63–66.) If this plain statutory law, as interpreted by this state’s \nhighest court, is to be respected, it impliedly demands that a misrepresentation be plausibly \nalleged. None has been so, Defendant merely asserting the existence of “clear violations” \nwithout either detail or substantiation. As the evidence is currently constituted, therefore, \nDefendant’s third ground will not likely stand. \nIn this Court’s opinion, two other facts are telling. First, the Second Termination Letters \ncite no “found” violation of licensure or certification requirements or any specific failure to meet \nany condition of enrollment. (Doc. 39-1 at 3, 6, 9, 12.) Second, Defendant cites to the final \nclause of Section 46:437.11(D)(2), which allows for termination if a provider is “the subject of a \nsanction or of a criminal, civil, or departmental proceeding,” and deems sufficient an allusion to \ninvestigations by DHH and the Louisiana Office of Inspector General. (Hr’g Tr. 34:8–15, Oct. \n16, 2015; see also Doc. 39-1 at 3.) That an investigation by DHH can suffice under Section \n46:436(D)(2) has been rejected once before. See New Orleans Home for Incurables, Inc. v. \nGreenstein, 911 F. Supp. 2d 410, 411–12 (E.D. La. 2012). As for the second, when this Court \nasked Defendant’s counsel to offer some detail regarding these alleged misrepresentations, he \ncould not. (Hr’g Tr. 38:23–39:10, Oct. 16, 2015.) Considering her failure to articulate one \nrelevant misrepresentation within MAPIL’s meaning, and on the record as it now stands, \nPlaintiffs will likely succeed on this issue. \nIn fact, the apparent fragility of the Second Termination Letters’ stated reasons raises \nanother specter, for not one appears to be a supported factual allegation of the kind of fraud and \n71 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 72 of 80\nill-practice with which MAPIL is concerned. See Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys. v. Bynum, 879 \nSo. 2d 807, 811 (La. Ct. App. 2004). Here, this apparent vacuum cannot be ignored, for as the \nSupreme Court of Louisiana explained in the spring of 2015, “[a]n agency exercising delegated \nauthority is not free to pursue any and all ends, but can assert authority only over those ends \nwhich are connected with the task delegated by the legislative body.” Dep’t of Children & \nFamily Servs. ex rel. A. L. v. Lowrie, 167 So. 3d 573, 587–88 (La. 2015); see also State v. \nAlfonso, 753 So. 2d 156, 161 (La. 1999) (“When the legislative body, in delegating powers, \nclearly expresses its policy and provides sufficient standards, judicial review of the exercise of \nthe means chosen by the agency in exercising its delegated power provides a safeguard against \nabuse by the agency.”) “The open-ended discretion to choose ends is the essence of legislative \npower; it is this power that the legislative body possesses, but its agents lack.” Lowrie, 167 So. \n3d at 587.  \nSection 46:437.11(D)(2) is but one part of a law directed towards specific ills. It is \nreasonable to conclude that the legislature logically expected the powers awarded by this \nprovision to be employed so as “to combat and prevent fraud and abuse” and to secure the “fiscal \nand programmatic integrity” of a program otherwise endangered by “persons who engage in \nfraud, misrepresentation, abuse, or other ill practices” as expressly defined in MAPIL alone. See \nLA. R.S. § 46:437.2.  \nBut, based on the evidence so far presented, no actual evidence of a MAPIL-worthy-\nmisdeed has been presented. Indeed, no misconduct of any kind has been alleged, let alone \nshown, as it pertains to PPGC’s operations in Louisiana. The Parties have stipulated that, for \npurposes of the Court’s consideration of a preliminary injunction, no additional evidence need be \noffered and no additional argument need be made; consequently, evidentiary support for a single \n72 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 73 of 80\none of Defendant’s contentions is absent by Defendant’s own volition. By highlighting the \nsuspect underpinning the Second Termination Letters, Plaintiffs have therefore met their burden \nof showing a likely success on this issue, regardless and apart from the Individual Plaintiffs’ \nlikely success on the other issues previously discussed. See supra Part V.B.1.a–c.  \n \nC.  SECOND ELEMENT: IRREPARABLE HARM \n“‘Irreparable’ in the injunction context means not rectifiable by the entry of a final \njudgment.” Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Prop. Co., 966 F.2d 273, 275 (7th Cir. 1992). On the \nrecord before the Court, Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing irreparable harm.  \nBased on their uncontroverted affidavits, the Individual Plaintiffs depend on PPGC. (Doc. \n4-3, 4-4, 4-5.) And if the Agreements are terminated, they (and Jane Doe #3’s daughter) will be \nunable to visit their Medicaid provider of choice. (Doc. 4-3 ¶¶ 6–7 at 2; Doc. 4-4 ¶¶ 7–8 at 2; \nDoc. 4-5 ¶¶ 5–6 at 2.) Approximately, 5,200 other women visit BRHC and NOHC and likely \ndepend upon to some degree. (Doc. 41-1 ¶¶ 12–18 at 4–5.) At this stage of the proceeding, the \nCourt is persuaded that, absent this termination, the patients of PPGC in Louisiana will have \ntheir healthcare disrupted. Counsel for Defendant has already conceded this to be the case. (Hr’g \nTr. 13:1–12, Sept. 2, 2015.) Like the court in Selig, this Court credits these women’s “statements \nin the form submitted.” Doc. 45 at 20, Selig. Presented with similar facts, other courts have \nfound irreparable harm. See, e.g., Doc. 63 at 51–54, Bentley; Doc. 45 at 22, Selig; Doc. 12 at 1–\n2, Herbert; Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 794 F. \nSupp. 2d 892, 912–13 (S.D. Ind. 2012), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, 699 \nF.3d 962; Camacho, 325 F. Supp. 2d 794 at 802. \nBased on its own unquestioned assertions, PPGC will also likely suffer irreparable harm. \n73 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 74 of 80\nRegardless of the precise dollars in revenue it may receive from the state, PPGC has made clear \nthat it may have to close BRHC upon the Agreements’ termination. (Doc. 46 at 27.) Often, such \nresults have been considered irreparable. Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc., 794 F. Supp. 2d at \n912; see also Canterbury Career Sch., Inc. v. Riley, 833 F. Supp. 1097, 1105 (D.N.J. 1993) \n(“Where the result of denying injunctive relief would be the destruction of an on-going business, \nsuch a result generally constitutes irreparable injury.”). The fact that the Eleventh Amendment \nforbids PPGC from ever collecting monetary damages, even if Defendant’s conduct is later \nfound illegal, also militates in favor of deeming its likely harm to be irreparable, Green, 474 U.S. \nat 68. In addition, “potential reputational harm is present,” Doc. 12 at 1, Herbert, as Defendant’s \ntermination may lead others to believe PPGC is not a competent provider despite her own failure \nto offer up relevant and specific evidence to the contrary, (Hr’g Tr. 11:12–16, Sept. 2, 2015). \nCumulatively, these harms are irreparable. See, e.g., United Healthcare Ins. Co. v. AdvancePCS, \n316 F.3d 737, 741 (8th Cir. 2002); Pappan Enters., Inc. v. Hardee’s Food Sys., Inc., 143 F.3d \n800, 805 (3d Cir. 1998). This conclusion is especially true when, as here, (Doc. 43 ¶¶ 64–67 at \n20), a plaintiff asserts constitutional claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., \nDoc. 12 at 2, Herbert.  \nDefendant has sought to allay these concerns with the First, Second, and Third Kennedy \nDeclarations. (Doc. 13-2 at 1–41; Doc. 31-1 at 1–2; Doc. 34 at 1–2; Doc. 34-2 ¶¶ 8a–8b at 2.) \nYet, these declarations’ manifold oversights and constant tinkering leave this Court with the \ndecided impression that not even DHH can ensure that PPGC’s current patients will have some \nready and convenient outlet. Indeed, even the most recent version contains a number of \nspecialized providers who do not accept patients like PPGC’s own. See supra Part II.C.3.   \nFurthermore, even if Individual Plaintiffs could get family planning and other comparable \n74 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 75 of 80\ncare elsewhere (and that has not been convincingly shown), “this does not diminish the injury \nthat will result from [their] inability to see the provider of their choice.” Doc. 63 at 54, Bentley \n(citing Doc. 45 at 22, Selig (“[D]enial of . . . freedom of choice is more likely than not exactly \nthe injury Congress sought to provide when it enacted [the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision].”)). On the record before it, the Court finds the second element for a preliminary \ninjunction to have been sufficiently shown.  \n \nD.  THIRD ELEMENT: BALANCE OF HARMS \nBy contrast  to the Plaintiffs’ enumerated harms, Defendant points the Court to only two \nthat it maintains it will suffer if the motion is granted: (1) “The granting of a TRO would prevent \nthe []DHH from their ability to govern the Medicaid program under the authority granted by the \nMedicaid Act,” and, (2) “It would also contravene the Louisiana Legislature’s intent to give the \n[]DHH a right to terminate a Medicaid provider agreement at-will when she chooses to do so.”  \n(Doc. 13 at 20.) The second obviously bears no more relevance since Defendant has rescinded \nher letters of termination under Section 46:436.11(D)(1). An injunction will have no financial \neffect, as DHH will still need to pay the Medicaid benefits of every PPGC Medicaid-eligible \npatient. See Doc. 12 at 1, Herbert; Marlo M. ex rel. Parris v. Cansler, 679 F. Supp. 2d 635, 638 \n(E.D.N.C. 2010). In dollars and cents, maintaining this status quo costs DHH nothing.  \nFurthermore, in terms of her ability to “govern the Medicaid program,” an injunction will \nnot strip DHH of its statutory powers. It will not suddenly deprive her of the ability to pursue \nlegitimate claims of Medicaid fraud or ensure that Louisiana citizens are obtaining “competent” \nmedical care; she will still be able “to govern the Medical program.” At worst, it will halt its \nexercise of a particular power as to a single provider as to whose medical competency it has \n75 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 76 of 80\nadmitted. Indeed, at worst, such an injunction will do no more than convince DHH to invoke its \npowers under MAPIL more clearly and consistently in the future. See New Orleans Home for \nIncurables, Inc., 911 F. Supp. 2d at 411–12. It would, in other words, force DHH to act as the \nstatute implicitly demands. Other cases have so ruled. See, e.g., Doc. 45 at 30, Selig. With them, \nthis Court agrees. \nAt the same time, this Court is not persuaded by Defendant’s efforts to distinguish \nPlaintiffs’ cases. One case that Defendant previously attempted to distinguish as being predicated \non Section 46:437.11(D)(2), (Doc. 13 at 21), involved the very section she has now invoked. \nNew Orleans Home for Incurables, Inc., 911 F. Supp. 2d at 410–11. By now relying on this very \nsection, Defendant’s latest termination has now made this case particularly relevant. It is true that \nPlaintiffs’ second cited case—Giovanni Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507 (4th Cir. \n2002)—“involved a State that enforced restrictions likely to be found unconstitutional.” (Doc. 13 \nat 21.) But the balance still favors Plaintiffs where, as here, the injunction is intended to \nforeclose application of restrictions likely to be found contrary to preeminent federal statutory \nlaw designed to help the neediest of this state’s citizens.   \nIn sum, even if Defendant’s criticism is given weight, the balance of harms would still \nfavor Plaintiffs.  \n \nE.  FINAL ELEMENT: PUBLIC INTEREST \nIn light of Plaintiffs’ likely irreparable harm and the balanced equities, this final factor \nfavors an injunctive relief too. For decades, PPGC has served numerous at-risk individuals and \nhelped DHH combat a host of diseases, and, in the process, become the regular provider of over \n5,000 women, including the Individual Plaintiff. Like its brethren, this Court “believes that . . . \n76 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 77 of 80\nvulnerable population[s] should only be uprooted if practically necessary and legally warranted.” \nGreenstein, 911 F. Supp. 2d at 412. As the Ninth Circuit stated in considering this same factor in \na Medicaid case, the public interest is most acute in regards to “ensuring access to health care” \nabsent any misdeed’s demonstration. Indep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal, Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly, 572 F.3d \n644, 659 (9th Cir. 2002), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 132 S. Ct. 1204, 182 L. Ed. \n2d 101 (2012). Defendant herself has urged this Court to employ this factor: “[I]t is certainly true \nthat the public has an interest in the neediest of its members having access to healthcare.” (Doc. \n13 at 21.) Like Selig and Herbert, this Court adopts this reasoning and finds the public interest \nfavors Plaintiffs.  \nIn contesting Plaintiffs’ public interest arguments, Defendant has offered up only the \nfollowing statement of purported fact: “[T]here has been no evidence presented that shows \nMedicaid recipients in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge areas will not have access to family \nplanning and related services.” (Doc. 13 at 21.) As support, she asked this Court to rely upon the \nFirst Kennedy Declaration. (Id. at 21–22.) As noted above, see supra Parts II.C.3, V.C, a \nKennedy Declaration has been tendered, retracted, and again proposed, leaving this Court wary \nof relying on Defendant’s protean assertions of fact. It instead turns to the uncontested and \nunquestioned facts—PPGC serves 5,200 poor and needy women, and PPGC has repeatedly been \ndeemed a “competent” provider by DHH—and honors the public interest in affording these \nwomen access to their provider of choice.  \n \nF.   CONCLUSION  \nFour elements are necessary before a court may issue an injunction. Every element has \nbeen shown by Plaintiffs in this proceeding in regards to their Section 1396a(a)(23) claim. A \n77 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 78 of 80\npreliminary injunction will therefore issue. \n \nVI.  FINAL ISSUES   \nA.  NO NEED FOR SECURITY \nRule 65 allows a court to “issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order \nonly if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs \nand damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” FED. \nR. CIV. P. 65(c). This requirement, however, may be waived where the gravity of interest is great \nand no proper showing of a harm’s likelihood or a probable loss is made. See, e.g., Kaepa, Inc. v. \nAchilles Corp., 76 F.3d 624, 628 (5th Cir. 1996) (“In holding that the amount of security \nrequired pursuant to Rule 65(c) is a matter for the discretion of the trial court, we have ruled that \nthe court may elect to require no security at all.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); City of \nAtlanta v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 636 F.2d 1084, 1094 (5th Cir. 1981) (same). Here, \nas in other courts, see, e.g., Doc. 45 at 31, Selig, Defendant has neither requested a security were \nthis Court to issue an injunction nor presented any evidence that it would be financially harmed \nif it were wrongfully enjoined. In addition, as Plaintiffs note, “[w]hether these individuals obtain \nthese services at PPGC (their provider of choice) or elsewhere will have no effect on Louisiana’s \nbudget.” (Doc. 46 at 28.) Based on these facts and on Defendant’s failure to ask for a bond or \nplead an economic harm, this Court sees no credible reason to force a bond’s execution. \n \nB.  CLASS INJUNCTION \nPlaintiffs argue that they have been singled out because of the alleged (but disputed) \nconduct of a separate but connected company that appeared in one of CMP’s videos and that \n78 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 79 of 80\nPlaintiffs played no role in that conduct. (Doc. 46 at 1–3.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendant has \nattempted to terminate its contracts because of the personal animus against it. This animus, they \ncontend, is unrelated to the admittedly competent services that it renders in Louisiana which are, \nin turn, unrelated to the conduct in the videos. It is, moreover, being punished for being \nassociated with various other Planned Parenthood entities, though it itself has not been \ndemonstrated to have engaged in a single proscribed or illegal action. In fact, the uncontradicted \nevidence in the record at this time is that PPGC does not perform abortions in Louisiana and is \nnot involved in the sale of fetal tissue and that none of the conduct in question occurred at \nPPGC’s two Louisiana facilities. As such, based on this existing record, it appears likely that \nPlaintiff will be able to prove that the attempted terminations against it are motivated and driven, \nat least in large part, by reasons unrelated to its competence and unique to it. However, the Court \nfinds it is not necessary and therefore it need not at this time rule on Plaintiffs’ equal protection \nargument. See, e.g., Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S. Ct. \n1319, 1323, 1323, 99 L. Ed. 2d 534 (1988) (“A fundamental and longstanding principle of \njudicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the \nnecessity of deciding them.”); cf. BRYAN A. GARNER & ANTONINA SCALIA, READING LAW: THE \nINTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 249–51 (2012) (discussing this rule’s bases). \nNonetheless, the uncontradicted evidence in the record is that BRHC relies to a \nsignificant degree on Medicaid reimbursements. (See, e.g., Doc. 4-1 at 10; Doc. 46 at 2.) The \nCourt therefore finds that if the Agreements are terminated, this facility would suffer significant \nfinancial loss and might have no choice but to close. In order to insure that meaningful relief is \ngiven to the Jane Doe Plaintiffs and that these Individual Plaintiffs have their free choice of \nprovider, which claim they have established (at least at this preliminary stage), the Court’s \n79 of 80 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR   Document 63    10/29/15   Page 80 of 80\npreliminary injunction will extend to all DHH-PPGC provider agreements applicable to all \nMedicaid-enrolled patients. In addition, the Court will defer action on Plaintiffs’ alternative \nrequest for class certification to a more appropriate date and time.  \n \nVII.  CONCLUSION \n  The Parties have agreed that no additional evidence or argument is necessary and that \nthere is no objection to converting the Court’s previous temporary restraining order to a \npreliminary objection. (Docs. 58, 62.) For the foregoing reasons, as corrected, supplemented and \nclarified herein, PPGC and the Individual Plaintiffs have met their burden, demonstrating every \nelement necessary for the issuance of a preliminary injunction with credible evidence and \npersuasive precedent. Accordingly,  \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction and \nFailure to State a Claim (Doc. 53) is DENIED. \nPlaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and for Preliminary \nInjunction (Doc. 45) is GRANTED.  \nDefendant, and all those acting in concert with her, are PRELIMINARILY ENJOINED \nfrom terminating any of its Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast \nInc., including, but not limited to, Provider Numbers 91338, 133689, 45802, and 133673. The \npreliminary injunction will remain in force until notified by this Court.   \n  Signed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on October 29, 2015 \n \n \n   S \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n80 of 80 \n ",
