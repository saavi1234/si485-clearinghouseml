    "summary": "<p>On March 13, 2017, the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity Council (\"EHOC\") filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court Eastern District of Missouri. The plaintiff sued the City of Maplewood, Missouri, under the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq. and Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"), Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 213.040 et seq. for discriminatory treatment and disparate impact. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, sought a declaratory judgement that the defendant’s actions violate the FHA and the MHRA; a permanent injunction restraining Maplewood from enforcing the nuisance ordinance; compensatory damages; punitive damages; and attorneys’ fees and costs. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the nuisance ordinance issued by the city of Maplewood, Missouri discriminates against and disproportionately impacts nonwhite residents, women (especially those who are survivors of domestic violence), and people with disabilities. Specifically, they challenged the city of Maplewood \"chronic nuisance ordinance\" pursuant to which the city revoked the occupancy permits of residents (it’s a crime to live in the city without it) whom it deems to be \"chronic nuisances.\" They claimed that Maplewood designated certain residents to be nuisances simply because they had been the subject of multiple police calls, regardless of whether they did anything wrong. </p><p>The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on May 11, 2017. They alleged that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 and Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 213.040 for which relief could be granted. </p><p>On December 8, 2017, District Judge Ronnie L. White granted the motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint for failure to state a claim. He found that the facts did not create an inference that the defendant enforced its nuisance ordinance for the purpose of adversely affecting African American residents, women, and/or disabled residents and failed to identify specific instances where the defendant had a discriminatory intent or motive in providing favorable treatment to white and/or non-disabled residents over other residents based on race, gender, disability, or any other improper criteria when enforcing its nuisance ordinance. He also found that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently plead a causal connection between the alleged discriminatory policy, Maplewood's nuisance ordinance, and the alleged discriminatory disparate impact on African Americans, women, and disabled residents. The Judge also dismiss the state law claim without prejudice, stating that because the federal claim had been dismissed, he did not have jurisdiction to hear the state claim. 2017 WL 6278882.</p><p>On January 8, 2018, the plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment alleging that claims regarding EHOC’s sex and disability discrimination were conceptually distinct from the race discrimination claim, and the Court erred in dismissing them for the same reasons. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff could not relitigate the merits of its case and that the court fully addressed all of plaintiff’s claims as pleaded.</p><p>On May 8, 2018, Judge White denied the plaintiff’s Motion for Relief from Judgment as an attempt to “re-litigate the issues which the Court thoroughly addressed.” The case is now closed. 2018 WL 10396918.</p>",

LOUIS EQUAL  ) \nHOUSING AND OPPORTUNITY COUNCIL,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n) \nv.  )  No. 4:17CV886 RLW \n) \nCITY OF MAPLEWOOD, MISSOURI,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant City of Maplewood, Missouri's Motion to \nDismiss Plaintiffs Complaint for Failure to State a Claim (ECF No. 19).  The motion is fully \nbriefed and ready for disposition.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant \nDefendant's motion. \nI. Background \nDefendant City of Maplewood, Missouri (\"Maplewood\") is a municipality located in St. \nLouis County which has enacted a comprehensive Code of Ordinances (\"City Code\").1 \nMaplewood requires renters to obtain an occupancy permit for $15, and without such occupancy \npermit, a person is not allowed to rent a dwelling or reside at another renter's dwelling.  (Compl. \n1 Courts \"may consider materials that necessarily are embraced by the pleadings or that are part \nof the public record and do not contradict the complaint.\"  Mickelson v. Cty. ofR  amsey, 823 F.3d \n918, 923 (8th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  \"For example, courts may consider 'matters of \npublic record, orders, items appearing in the record of the case, and exhibits attached to the \ncomplaint.\"'  Greenman v. Jessen, 787 F.3d 882, 887 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Porous Media \nCorp. v. Pall Corp.,  186 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.1999) (internal quotation omitted)).  Here, \nPlaintiffs Complaint references the nuisance ordinance and related provisions enacted by \nMaplewood such that the Court will consider the relevant portions of the City Code.  (Def.' s Exs. \nA & B, ECF Nos. 20-1, 20-2) \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 2 of 12 PageID #: 157\niii! 18-19, ECF No. 1)  In 2006, Maplewood enacted a nuisance ordinance that permits occupancy \nto be revoked where the person is deemed a \"nuisance.\" (Id. at iii! 17, 19)  Plaintiff \nMetropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity Council (\"EHOC\") contends that the \nnuisance ordinance is drafted so broadly that the city has enormous discretion to decide which \npeople the city will \"exile.\"  (Id.  at iii! 19-24)  Specifically, the nuisance ordinance provides in \nrelevant part: \nIn addition to any other act declared to be a nuisance by this Code or other \nordinances of the city, nuisances are hereby defined and declared to be as follows: \n(1)  Any act done or committed, permitted or allowed to be done or \ncommitted, by any person, or any substance or thing kept, \nmaintained, placed or found in or upon any public or private place \nwhich is injurious or dangerous to public health; \n(2)  Any pursuit followed or act done by any person to the hurt, injury, \nannoyance, inconvenience or damage of the public; \n(17)  Any premises upon which any of the following acts or conditions \nhave occurred or continue to occur, whether by the owner, \noccupants or persons frequenting or congregating about the \nproperty: \nf.  More than two instances within a 180-day period of \nincidents of peace disturbance or domestic violence \nresulting in calls to calls to the police; \n(Id. at iii! 21-22; Def.'s Ex. A, City Code§ 34-240, ECF No. 20-1)  When a nuisance has been \nidentified, the city manager or designee holds a hearing, and if a nuisance exists, the nuisance \nmay be abated by revoking the occupancy permit for a period not to exceed six months.  (Def. \nEx. A, City Code § 34-242, ECF No. 20-1) \n2 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 3 of 12 PageID #: 158\nOn March 13, 2017, PlaintiffEHOC filed a Complaint alleging violations of the Fair \nHousing Act (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, et seq., and the Missouri Human Rights Act \n(\"MHRA\"), Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 213.040, et seq.  Plaintiff alleges that the nuisance ordinance \ndiscriminates against and disproportionately impacts non-white residents, women, and people \nwith disabilities.  Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that Maplewood disproportionately enforces the \nordinance against its small African-American population to perpetuate Maplewood's status as a \n\"white\" community. (Compl. iii! 2, 3, 16)  Plaintiff further avers that enforcement of the nuisance \nordinance punishes victims of domestic violence, African-American women in particular, and \nexiles them from Maplewood.  (Id. at iii! 22-23, 28-33)  Plaintiff also contends that the nuisance \nordinance is enforced against individuals with disabilities, including those with mental illnesses. \n(Id. at iii! 34-39) \nPlaintiff EHOC claims that Maplewood does not enforce its ordinance evenhandedly but \ninstead knowingly and intentionally enforces the ordinance in a selective manner that \ndiscriminates against and has a disproportionate impact based on race, sex, and disability.2  (Id. \nat iii! 41-44)  Plaintiff contends that Maplewood's discriminatory enforcement of its nuisance \nordinance has frustrated and continues to frustrate the EHOC's mission of ensuring all people \nhave equal access to housing.  (Id. at if 57)  Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment that Defendant's \nactions violate the FHA and the MHRA; a permanent injunction restraining Defendant \n2 Plaintiff alleges that it investigated 4 3 enforcement hearings between March 2010 and August \n2015.  (Comp l. if 25)  Plaintiff ascertained the race of the household in 34 of the hearings, and 19 \nof those enforcement actions were against African-Americans, even though African-Americans \nconstitute only 17 percent of the City's population.  (Id. at if 26)  Six of the 43 enforcement \nactions involved domestic disturbances where a female African American resident was \n\"attacked\" by a male.  (Id.  at if 29)  Finally, 11 of the actions involved incidents that allegedly \nresulted from the \"manifestation of mental illness or other disabilities.\"  (Id. at if 3 5) \n3 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 4 of 12 PageID #: 159\nMaplewood from enforcing the nuisance ordinance; compensatory damages; punitive damages; \nand attorneys' fees and costs. \nII. Legal Standard \nWith regard to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b )( 6), a complaint must be dismissed if it fails to plead \"enough facts to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007) (abrogating the \"no set of facts\" standard set forth in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-\n46 (1957)). While the Court cautioned that the holding does not require a heightened fact \npleading of specifics, \"a plaintiffs obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to \nrelief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action will not do.\"  Id. at 555.  In other words, \"[fJactual allegations must be enough to \nraise a right to relief above the speculative level ....\"   Id.  This standard simply calls for enough \nfacts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the claim.  Id. at \n556. \nCourts must liberally construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff \nand accept the factual allegations as true.  See Id. at 555; see also Schaaf v. Residential Funding \nCorp., 517 F.3d 544, 549 (8th Cir. 2008) (stating that in a motion to dismiss, courts accept as \ntrue all factual allegations in the complaint); Eckert v.  Titan Tire Corp., 514 F.3d 801, 806 (8th \nCir. 2008) (explaining that courts should liberally construe the complaint in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff).  Further a court should not dismiss the complaint simply because the \ncourt is doubtful that the plaintiff will be able to prove all of the necessary factual allegations. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556.  However, \"[w]here the allegations show on the face of the complaint \n4 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 5 of 12 PageID #: 160\nthere is some insuperable bar to relief, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate.\"  Benton v. \nMerrill Lynch & Co., 524 F .3d 866, 870 (8th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  Courts '\"are not \nbound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.'\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  When considering a motion to \ndismiss, a court can \"begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than \nconclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\"  Id. at 679.  Legal conclusions must be \nsupported by factual allegations to survive a motion to dismiss.  Id. \nIII. Discussion \nThe Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to \"refuse to sell or rent ... or otherwise make \nunavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial \nstatus, or national origin.\"  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Further, it is unlawful to \"discriminate against \nany person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the \nprovision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race, color, religion, sex, \nfamilial status, or national origin.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(b).  The FHA also makes it unlawful to \ndiscriminate in the sale or rental, or in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a \ndwelling because of a handicap.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(l)-(2).  The Missouri Human Rights Act \nsimilarly makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale or rental of a dwelling based on race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § \n213.040.1. \nIn its motion to dismiss, Defendant Maplewood argues that Plaintiffs Complaint should \nbe dismissed because it contains no factual support for the claim of disparate treatment.  Further, \nDefendant contends that Plaintiff is unable to demonstrate a prima facie case of disparate impact \ndiscrimination.  Finally, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs cause of action under the MHRA in \n5 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 6 of 12 PageID #: 161\nCount II should be dismissed as duplicative of Count I under the FHA.  The Court will discuss \neach argument in tum. \nA. Disparate Treatment \nDefendant first argues that Plaintiffs disparate treatment claims lack the required factual \nsupport such that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is warranted.  '\"Disparate-treatment claims \nunder the FHA are tested under the same framework as Title VII disparate-treatment claims,' the \nquestion being whether Defendant treated Plaintiffs 'less favorably than other based on their \nrace, color, religion, sex or national origin.\"' Folger v. City ofM  inneapolis, 43 F. Supp. 3d 922, \n931 (D. Minn. 2014) (quoting Gallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d 823, 831 (8th Cir. 2010)).  '\"Proof \nof discriminatory purpose is crucial for a disparate treatment claim.'\" Id  Discriminatory \npurpose implies that the decision maker selected a course of action because of its adverse effects \non an identifiable group.  Spirit Lake Tribe ofI ndians ex rel. Comm. of Understanding and \nRespect v. Nat'! Coll. Athletic Ass'n, 715 F.3d 1089, 1092 (8th Cir. 2013) (quotations and \ncitations omitted). \nHere, Plaintiff alleges that \"Maplewood intentionally targets its African-American \nresidents for enforcement actions - then banishes them from the City - based on conduct that \nwould not result in such enforcement against white residents.\"  (Compl. ~ 2)  Likewise, Plaintiff \ncontends that \"a large percentage of Maplewood' s enforcement actions have been taken against \nwomen who are survivors of domestic violence and/or people with disabilities.\"  (Id.)  Plaintiff \nasserts that the nuisance ordinance discriminates against African-American residents, women, \nand individuals with disabilities in that \"Maplewood does not enforce its ordinance \nevenhandedly against all residents who could be eligible for such enforcement, but instead \n6 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 7 of 12 PageID #: 162\nenforces the ordinance selectively against those residents whom it deems undesirable for other \nreasons.\"  (Id. at iii! 27-28, 34, 40) \nPlaintiffs Complaint merely sets forth conclusory allegations that do not give an \ninference of discrimination.  As stated above, \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\"  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 \n(internal quotation omitted). \"A claim is facially plausible 'where the plaintiff pleads factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.\"'  Wilson v. Ark. Dep 't ofH  uman Servs., 850 F.3d 368, 371 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(quoting Blomker v. Jewell, 831 F .3d 1051, 1055 (8th Cir. 2016) (quotation omitted)).  While a \nplaintiff need not plead facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the \nelements of a prima facie case '\"are part of the background against which a plausibility \ndetermination should be made.'\" Blomker, 831 F .3d at 1056 (quoting Rodriguez-Reyes v. \nMolina-Rodriguez, 711 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2013)). \nThe Court finds that the facts contained in Plaintiffs Complaint do not create an \ninference that Maplewood enforces its nuisance ordinance for the purpose of adversely affecting \nAfrican American residents, women, and/or disabled residents.  While Plaintiff purports to cite \nstatistics and percentages, nothing on the face of the pleading sets forth facts or examples of \nwhite residents receiving more favorable treatment than African-American residents, or of non \ndisabled residents receiving better treatment because of an intent or motive to discriminate \nagainst these groups.  Plaintiff baldly claims that the statement on Maplewood's website that \n\"[o  ]ver the past decade, Maplewood' s central location and housing values have brought many \nyoung professionals and their families to our community\" demonstrates a discriminatory purpose \nof enforcing the ordinance to exile African-American residents, people with disabilities, and \n7 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 8 of 12 PageID #: 163\nwomen facing domestic violence.  (Compl. iii! 16, 24)  Other than conclusory assertions and \nconjecture upon information and belief, Plaintiffs Complaint fails to assert any facts which \nwould infer that Maplewood ignores similar conduct by other residents and only enforces its \nnuisance ordinance against African-American, female, and disabled residents.  See Pope v. Fed. \nHome Loan Mortg. Corp., 561 Fed. App'x 569, 573 (8th Cir. 2014) (finding that a pleading \nbased on information and belief with no facts that would lead to an inference of a plausible claim \nis insufficient under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 12). \nIn short, Plaintiffs Complaint fails to identify specific instances where Defendant \nMaplewood had a discriminatory intent or motive in providing favorable treatment to white \nand/or non-disabled residents over other residents based on race, gender, disability, or any other \nimproper criteria when enforcing its nuisance ordinance.  See Folger, 43 F. Supp. 3d at 931-37 \n(D. Minn. 2014) (granting judgment on the pleadings with respect to plaintiffs disparate \ntreatment claim under the FHA where the \"Complaint consist[ ed] of nothing more than \nconclusory allegations devoid of any plausible basis that the City enforced its housing code with \nthe motive of intent to discriminate against any protected class ....\" ).  Therefore, the Court finds \nthat Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of disparate treatment that \"nudge[s] [its] claims across \nthe line from conceivable to plausible\" such that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is warranted. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570. \nB. Disparate Impact \nPlaintiff also claims that Defendant Maplewood' s overbroad definition of nuisance \nactivity has an unlawful disparate impact on African-American, female, and disabled residents. \nDefendant Maplewood contends that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim because the allegations \n8 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 9 of 12 PageID #: 164\nare not supported by the necessary causal connection between a Maplewood policy and the \nalleged disparity required to adequately plead disparate impact. \n\"The Eighth Circuit has long recognized disparate-impact claims are cognizable under \nthe FHA.\"  Ellis v. City ofM  inneapolis, 860 F.3d 1106, 1110 (8th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). \n'\"In contrast to a disparate-treatment case, where a plaintiff must establish that the defendant had \na discriminatory intent or motive, a plaintiff bringing a disparate-impact claim challenges \npractices that have a disproportionately adverse effect on minorities and are otherwise unjustified \nby a legitimate rationale.\"'  Id. (quoting Tex. Dep 't ofH  ousing and Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive \nCommunities Project,_ U.S._, 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2513 (2009) (internal quotation omitted)). \n\"But disparate-impact liability has always been properly limited in key respects that avoid the \nserious constitutional questions that might arise under the FHA, for instance, if such liability \nwere imposed based solely on a showing of statistical disparity.\"  Inclusive Communities, 135 S. \nCt. at 2522.  The Supreme Court has emphasized, \"'prompt resolution of these cases is \nimportant.  A plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage ... demonstrating a causal \nconnection [between a defendant's policy and a disparity] cannot make out a prima facie case of \ndisparate impact.\"' Ellis, 860 F.3d at 1111 (quoting Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523). \nSuch \"robust causality requirement ensures that '[r]acial imbalance ... does not, without more, \nestablish a prima facie case of disparate impact' and thus protects defendants from being held \nliable for racial disparities they did not create.\"  Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523 \n(quoting Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 653 (1989)).  The Supreme Court \nheld that limitations on disparate-impact liability are \"necessary to protect potential defendants \nagainst abusive disparate-impact claims.\"  Id. at 2524.  For example, governmental entities \"must \n9 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 10 of 12 PageID #: 165\nnot be prevented from achieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compliance with health \nand safety codes.\"  Id. \nHere, Plaintiff contests Maplewood' s definition of nuisance in the ordinance has a \ndisparate impact on African Americans, women, and people with disabilities, asserting that the \nenforcement results in exiling these groups from the City.  (Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss pp. 9-\n10, ECF No. 23)  In support, Plaintiff presents statistical data allegedly demonstrating that the \nordinance has a causal connection to disparate outcomes and a larger discriminatory pattern. \nDefendant contends that Plaintiff's statistical analysis fails to meet the causal connection \nstandard required by Inclusive Communities. \nThe Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead a causal connection between \nthe alleged discriminatory policy, Maplewood's nuisance ordinance, and the alleged \ndiscriminatory disparate impact on African Americans, women, and disabled residents.  As \npreviously stated, at the motion to dismiss stage, Plaintiff must plead a prima facie case of \ndisparate impact under the FHA.  Ellis, 860 F.3d at 1111.  \"[A] plaintiff must, at the very least, \npoint to an 'artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary' policy causing the problematic disparity.\"  Id. \nat 1114.  In addition, Plaintiff must \"allege facts at the pleading stage or produce statistical \nevidence demonstrating a causal connection\" to make a prima facie case of disparate impact. \nInclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523. \nHere, the policy complained of is a nuisance ordinance enacted to promote public health, \nsafety, and welfare.  While Plaintiff has identified a policy, at best the statistical evidence merely \nshows an imbalance resulting from enforcement of the ordinance.  Plaintiff fails to plausibly \nallege that the ordinance causes the disparity.  See Id. (\"A robust causality requirement ensures \nthat racial imbalance ... does not, without more, establish a prima facie case of disparate impact \n10 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 11 of 12 PageID #: 166\nand thus protects defendants from being held liable for racial disparities they did not create.\") \n(internal quotation omitted); see also TBS Grp., LLC v. City ofZ ion, Ill., No. 16-cv-5855, at *9 \n(N.D. Ill. Nov. 6, 2017) (dismissing the complaint where plaintiff failed to \"lay out a chain of \ninferences explaining how the Ordinance will cause a racially disparate impact, as distinct from \njust resulting in disparate impact\"). \nInstead, Plaintiff points to only 43 selected enforcement hearings over the course of \nnearly 5 years that Plaintiff contends are evidence of a causal connection between the definitions \nin the nuisance ordinance and a disparate impact on African-Americans, women, and people with \ndisabilities.  The Court finds that this data is insufficient to state a plausible prima facie case \n\"demonstrating that the [nuisance ordinance] complained of [is] arbitrary and unnecessary under \nthe FHA.\"  Ellis, 860 F.3d at 1112.  As stated by the Supreme Court, \"[w]ere standards for \nproceeding with disparate-impact suits not to incorporate at least the safeguards discussed here, \nthen disparate-impact liability might displace valid governmental and private priorities, rather \nthan solely 'remov[ing] ... artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.\"'  Inclusive \nCommunities, 135 S. Ct. at 2524 (quoting Griggs v. Duke Power Co, 401U.S.424, 431 (1971)). \nThus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs Complaint fails to set forth factual allegations sufficient to \nmove its disparate impact claim over the plausibility threshold, and dismissal under Rule \n12(b )( 6) is warranted. \nBecause the Court will dismiss Plaintiffs federal FHA claims against Defendant \nMaplewood pursuant to Rule 12(b) ( 6), the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over Plaintiffs state law claims under the MHRA. \nAccordingly, \n11 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  33   Filed: 12/08/17   Page: 12 of 12 PageID #: 167\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant City of Maplewood, Missouri's Motion to \nDismiss Plaintiffs Complaint for Failure to State a Claim (ECF No. 19) is GRANTED.  A \nseparate Order of Dismissal will accompany this Memorandum and Order. \n&h \nDated this  day of December, 2017. \n~~ \nRONNIE L. WHITE \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n12 ",

LOUIS EQUAL \nHOUSING AND OPPORTUNITY \nCOUNCIL, \n17 886 \nPlaintiff,  Civ. Action No.  -cv-\nv.  COMPLAINT \nCITY OF MAPLEWOOD, MISSOURI,  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nDefendant. \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This is a challenge to the City of Maplewood's \"chronic nuisance ordinance,\" \npursuant to which the city revokes the occupancy penni ts of residents whom it deems to be \n\"chronic nuisances.\" Maplewood designates certain residents to be nuisances simply because \nthey have been the subject of multiple police calls, regardless of whether they did anything \nwrong or are, instead, the victims of domestic violence or otherwise in legitimate need of \nmunicipal services. The effect of the city's revocation of occupancy pennits is to exile those \nresidents from the City, since without an occupancy pennit it is a crime to live in Maplewood. \n2.  Maplewood has employed this draconian remedy in discriminatory fashion. \nMaplewood was almost entirely white as recently as 1970, and even now African-American \nresidents account for only 17 percent of Maplewood's population. Nonetheless, Plaintiff \nMetropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity Council's (\"EHOC\") analysis of \nMaplewood's enforcement of its nuisance ordinance reveals that a majority of enforcement \nactions have been taken against African-American households. Maplewood intentionally targets \nits African-American residents for enforcement actions- and then banishes them from the \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 2 of 21 PageID #: 2\nCity- based on conduct that would not result in such enforcement against white residents. \nMoreover, a large percentage of Maplewood's enforcement actions have been taken against \nwomen who are survivors of domestic violence and/or people with disabilities; these actions \nserve no legitimate purpose and effectively punish these vulnerable populations for requiring \npolice protection. To end this discrimination based on race, sex, and disability, EHOC, which is \ndevoted to furthering fair housing and combating discriminatory practices such as the one \ndescribed in this complaint, brings this suit pursuant to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as \namended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., and the Missouri Human Rights Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§§ 213.010 et seq., for injunctive, monetary and declarative relief. \n3.  EHOC acquired and extensively analyzed records pertaining to Maplewood's \nenforcement of its nuisance ordinance over a 5-year period. These records make clear that \nMaplewood does not enforce its law even-handedly against any person eligible for such \nenforcement under the law's terms. Rather, Maplewood enforces its nuisance ordinance \nselectively, and in doing so it disproportionately enforces the ordinance against African \nAmerican residents while ignoring similar conduct by other residents. This discriminatory \nenforcement has the purpose and effect of perpetuating Maplewood's status as a \"white\" \ncommunity in the starkly segregated St. Louis metropolitan area. \n4.  An alarmingly high number of enforcement actions have been taken against \nwomen who are the victims of domestic violence and/or against people with disabilities in \nMaplewood. Many of these people either called the police themselves for assistance or had \nsomeone else call on their behalf. Rather than protect its most vulnerable residents, Maplewood \nchooses to blame these victims for needing assistance and either immediately exiles them from \n2 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 3 of 21 PageID #: 3\nthe city or puts them on probation such that they will be exiled should they again need police \nassistance. \n5.  Maplewood is just one of many jurisdictions that have enacted some form of \nchronic nuisance ordinance in recent years. In response, the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development has issued guidance warning that discriminatory enforcement of nuisance \nlaws can violate the Fair Housing Act. This guidance makes clear that municipalities such as \nMaplewood must ensure that chronic nuisance laws are enforced even-handedly. It also makes \nclear that municipalities such as Maplewood will have difficulty demonstrating the necessity of \npunishing residents simply because of a certain number of police calls. \n6.  Maplewood's chronic nuisance ordinance has the purpose and effect of making \nhousing unavailable based on race, sex, and disability, and it fails to further any legitimate \npurpose. In particular, rather than making communities safer, it makes them less safe by \ndiscouraging crime victims and other residents from contacting the police or availing themselves \nof other emergency services such as ambulances. \n7.  Maplewood's discriminatory conduct has harmed EHOC by frustrating its \nmission to further fair housing in the region that includes Maplewood and forcing EHOC to \ndivert resources to counteract Maplewood's discrimination. EHOC brings this action to address \nMaplewood's discriminatory and unlawful enforcement of its chronic nuisance ordinance and to \nredress the harm it has suffered and will continue to suffer as a direct result of Maplewood's \ndiscriminatory practices absent relief. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity Council is a \nprivate, non-profit corporation founded in 1992. It is dedicated to ensuring equal access to \n3 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 4 of 21 PageID #: 4\nhousing and places of public accommodation for all people through education, counseling, \ninvestigation, and enforcement. EHOC serves the greater St. Louis area, where it is the only \nprivate, non-profit corporation working to end illegal housing discrimination. \n9.  Defendant City of Maplewood, Missouri is a municipal corporation located in St. \nLouis County, Missouri.  The City is organized under and operates by virtue of the rules of the \nState of Missouri as a home rule unit of local government.  The City is governed by a Mayor and \na six-member City Council. It acts through its agents and employees and is responsible for the \nactions described below, which were taken by agents and employees acting within the scope of \ntheir authority. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 42 U .S.C. § 3613, which \nauthorizes claims brought under the Fair Housing Act. This Court also has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and 1343(a)(3), because the Fair Housing Act claim alleged herein arises under \nthe laws of the United States. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the Missouri Human \nRights Act claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \nII.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because the claims \narose in the District, Defendant is incorporated in and/or resides in this District, Plaintiff does \nbusiness in this District, and a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred in \nthe District. \n4 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 5 of 21 PageID #: 5\nFACTS \nMaplewood's History of Racial Division \n12.  Maplewood adopted its nuisance ordinance against a background of municipal \ndecline and changing demographics. Once prosperous and virtually all white, Maplewood in \nrecent years has seen increasing racial diversity and a falling population. \n13.  Maplewood was incorporated in 1908 as one of St. Louis's early, \"inner-ring\" \nsuburbs. Located directly to the west of St. Louis, it was designed to be a \"bedroom community\" \nfor people who worked in St. Louis but wanted to live outside the city. By the 1950 Census, \nMaplewood's population had increased to more than 13,000. Virtually all of those residents- all \nbut about 1% ofthem- were white. \n14.  The population of Maplewood- like that of other inner-ring St. Louis suburbs-\ndwindled. Beginning in the 1960s, Maplewood's population has been in a steady decline. By the \n1990 Census, the City's population had fallen to under 10,000. By the 2010 Census, the City's \npopulation barely exceeded 8,000. \n15.  Although Maplewood remains a majority-white municipality, its population has \nbecome increasingly racially diverse. As of 1970, Maplewood still had just 252 African \nAmerican residents, less than 2% of its population. By 1990, Maplewood had 1,425 African \nAmerican residents, comprising more than 14% of Maplewood's population. In the next two \ndecades, Maplewood's African-American population remained steady, but became a larger share \nof the city's diminishing population. In 2010, Maplewood had an African-American population \nof 1, 384, more than 17 percent of its population. \n16.  In recent years, Maplewood has taken steps to arrest and roll back these \ndemographic changes. It has explicitly sought to lure more upscale, white residents to replace \n5 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 6 of 21 PageID #: 6\nthose who have been lost, highlighting its historic downtown and rising property values. The \nCity's website states: \"Over the past decade, Maplewood's central location and housing values \nhave brought many young professionals and their families to our community.\"' \nMaplewood's Adoption and Enforcement of Its Nuisance Ordinance \n17.  Against that background of years of declining population and demographic \nchange, and amidst hopes for revitalization, Maplewood in 2006 instituted one of the country's \nmost onerous nuisance ordinances. \n18.  Maplewood requires each renter to obtain an \"occupancy permit\" for every \napartment rented. Applying for an occupancy permit costs $15. Applicants must allow city \nofficials to inspect a photo identification. An applicant must specify every proposed resident of \nthe dwelling and certify his or her understanding that no one else is permitted to reside there. \nMaplewood Code of Ordinances§ 12-25. \n19.  In 2006, Maplewood enacted an ordinance that permits occupancy permits to be \nrevoked for a variety of actions that lead a person to be deemed a \"nuisance.\" The effect of such \nrevocation is to exile the person in question from the City, since without an occupancy permit \nthat person is neither allowed to rent a dwelling nor reside at anyone else's dwelling. \n20.  Maplewood Code§ 34-240 defines eligible \"nuisances\" so broadly as to \npotentially include virtually any act that city officials do not like. \n21.  For example, a nuisance can be: \n1 City of Maplewood, Demographics, available at http://mo \nmaplewood.civicplus.com/1 04/Demographics. \n6 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 7 of 21 PageID #: 7\n•  \"Any act done or committed or allowed to be done and committed ... \nwhich is injurious or dangerous to public health.\" Maplewood Code§ 34-\n240(1). \n•  \"Any pursuit followed or act done ... to the hurt, injury, annoyance, \ninconvenience or damage of the public.\" Maplewood Code§ 34-240(2). \n22.  More specifically, Maplewood defines a nuisance to include, among many other \nthings, more than two instances within a 180-day period of \"peace disturbance or domestic \nviolence resulting in calls to the police.\" Maplewood Code§ 34-240(17)(f). Thus, on its face, \nMaplewood's ordinance specifically provides that a woman who suffers an incident of domestic \nviolence that results in a call to the police is a proper target of enforcement. \n23.  Once a nuisance has been identified, Maplewood's ordinance calls for a hearing \nbefore the city manager or a designee. The hearing officer then must issue an order that will \n\"effect the abatement of the nuisance by any means necessary.\" Maplewood Code§ 34-\n242(2)(e ). The ordinance, however, specifies only one means of abating such a \"nuisance\": \nrevoking a resident's occupancy permit for a period of up to six months.Jd. Such revocation \namounts to an effective exile from the City for that period. \nMaplewood's Discriminatory Enforcement of Its Nuisance Ordinance \n24.  As described above, Maplewood's nuisance ordinance is drafted so as to give the \ncity enormous discretion in deciding which people it will exile from the City. In practice, \nMaplewood has invoked this harsh remedy primarily against African Americans; people with \ndisabilities; and women who are facing domestic violence. \n7 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 8 of 21 PageID #: 8\n25.  EHOC's investigation, which included multiple requests for public records, \nuncovered details about 43 enforcement hearings Maplewood held between March 2010 and \nAugust 2015. \n26.  In 34 of the hearings, the race of the household could be ascertained. In 19 of \nthose- more than 55 percent- the household was African-American. The African-American \nshare of nuisance enforcement actions thus is three times as high as the African-American share \nofthe city's population (17 percent). \n27.  No relevant difference between African-American and white residents that is \nunrelated to race can explain this disparity. Neither can any legitimate enforcement policy. \nRather, Maplewood enforces its ordinance so as to punish- and often drive out of the City \naltogether- African-American residents for reasons that would not lead to enforcement action \nagainst white residents. \n28.  In particular, Maplewood has chosen to bring multiple enforcement actions \nagainst African-American women who are the victims of domestic violence. Such enforcement \nwould be unlawful and unreasonable against any woman. Maplewood's decision to do so only \nagainst African-American women demonstrates the discriminatory nature of its ordinance \nenforcement. \n29.  Sixteen of the 43 enforcement actions- more than 37 percent- arose at least in \npart out of incidents of domestic disturbance. In six of them- almost one-seventh of all \nenforcement actions studied- the \"nuisance\" involved a female resident being attacked by a \nmale partner, former partner, or rebuffed suitor. Rather than protecting these survivors, \nMaplewood instituted enforcement actions against them. \n8 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 9 of 21 PageID #: 9\n30.  All six of those female residents punished for being survivors of domestic \nviolence were African-American. \n31.  In all six of those incidents, Maplewood deemed the survivor of domestic \nviolence to be a nuisance subject to occupancy permit revocation. In two of them, it Hsuspended\" \nthe revocation, essentially putting the survivor on probation. These orders still constitute a \nsignificant infringement ofliberty, because they effectively forbid these women from reporting \nincidents of domestic violence or calling for police assistance during the specified time, on pain \nof being exiled from town. \n32.  For example, one order revoked a woman's occupancy permit after she was \nabused repeatedly by her husband, who no longer lived with her. The order suspended that \nrevocation for twelve months, conditioned on no further \"incidents of peace disturbance or \ndomestic violence\" occurring at her property during that period. \n33.  Similarly, Maplewood held an enforcement hearing against another woman based \non three incidents in which a male acquaintance, whose romantic advances she had rebuffed, \nbecame intoxicated in and around her home and threatened violence against her. That \nenforcement action led the pastor at the woman's church and a fellow churchgoer to submit \nletters supporting her and criticizing the threatened revocation of her occupancy permit. \nMaplewood conditionally suspended enforcement of that order for twelve months. One of the \nconditions it imposed was that the woman immediately obtain and vigorously enforce a \nrestraining order against the acquaintance. Maplewood's order did not explain how the woman \ncould vigorously enforce the restraining order without calling the police and thereby risking \nrevocation of her occupancy permit. \n9 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 10 of 21 PageID #: 10\n34.  Maplewood's enforcement of its nuisance ordinance similarly discriminates \nagainst individuals with disabilities. \n35.  Eleven of the enforcement actions- more than a quarter- involved residents \nwhose \"misconduct\" was the manifestation of mental illness or other disabilities. Rather than \nmaking any accommodations for these disabilities, or providing any other assistance, \nMaplewood used these behaviors as a reason to exile the resident in question. \n36.  For example, one suicidal man had his occupancy pennit revoked for making too \nmany calls for medical assistance. Another resident suffering from depression had his occupancy \npennit revoked for a \"peace disturbance\" after his girlfriend made a police call to report that he \nwas considering committing suicide. \n37.  In a particularly troubling incident, Maplewood took enforcement action against a \nsuicidal woman suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of a rape. \nMaplewood cited her for generating too many calls for police services. The woman did not even \nmake the last of the police calls for which Maplewood cited her; rather, the call was made by a \nvolunteer at a suicide hotline who was concerned for her safety. \n38.  Maplewood's discriminatory enforcement of its nuisance ordinance has caused \nresidents to be afraid to call for ambulance or police assistance, for fear of having their \noccupancy permits revoked. Residents- particularly those who already have been subject to \nnuisance ordinance enforcement- understand that each such call generates a record that can \neventually be used against them, no matter how justified the call may be. \n39.  For example, shortly after Maplewood entered an order revoking the occupancy \npermit of one family of five because both parents had experienced mental-illness-related \nincidents that required police calls, one parent had an episode that required her hospitalization. \nlO \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 11 of 21 PageID #: 11\nBecause the family was afraid to call an ambulance, they instead were forced to pay $35 for a \ncab ride. As one parent told the city in a voicemail: \"We had to call a cab because apparently the \nambulance is a crime for us.\" \n40.  Upon information and belief, Maplewood does not enforce its ordinance even-\nhandedly against all residents who could be eligible for such enforcement, but instead enforces \nthe ordinance selectively against those residents whom it deems undesirable for other reasons. \n41.  This process was illustrated by an e-mail sent by one city official to another \nregarding a woman whom a social services agency was trying to help find a home in \nMaplewood. The agency had told city officials it understood there could be a problem if the \nwoman's occupancy permit previously had been revoked. The city official checked records and \nfound that no nuisance hearing had occurred regarding that woman. However, she said in the e \nmail to the other city official that before calling the agency back she would \"see if we have \nenough to hold a nuisance hearing on her.\" \n42.  On information and belief, other residents have engaged in conduct that would \npermit Maplewood to revoke their occupancy licenses, but Maplewood has not acted against \nthem. Instead, Maplewood has chosen to selectively enforce its ordinance in a manner that has a \ndisproportionate impact based on race, sex, and disability. It has done so knowingly and \nintentionally. \n43.  Maplewood is aware of the chilling effects of its enforcement choices, but it \nnonetheless continues to enforce its ordinance in a manner that discourages crime victims from \ncontacting the police. \n11 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 12 of 21 PageID #: 12\nMaplewood's Enforcement of Its Ordinance Serves No Legitimate Purpose and \nContradicts Federal Law and Guidance \n44.  Maplewood's discriminatory enforcement of its nuisance ordinance serves no \nlegitimate purpose. There is no legitimate reason for Maplewood to exile people from the City \nbased on number of police calls. And even if it were ever proper for Maplewood to do so, there \nis no legitimate reason to target African-American residents for selective enforcement; punish \nwomen for being survivors of domestic violence; or banish individuals with disabilities rather \nthan providing them with appropriate and reasonable accommodations. \n45.  In particular, Maplewood's enforcement of its nuisance ordinance does not further \nthe legitimate interest in tenant safety. Instead, it makes housing less safe by discouraging \nresidents, neighbors, and landlords from contacting law enforcement. \n46.  Even if Maplewood's enforcement of its nuisance ordinance did make housing \nsafer or otherwise further some legitimate interest, such a goal could be achieved in a manner \nthat does not result in such a disproportionate and severe harm on African-American and female \nresidents as well as residents with disabilities. \n47.  Maplewood's enforcement practices are inconsistent with various federal laws \nand guidance, further demonstrating that they are not the least discriminatory means of \naccomplishing any legitimate end. \n48.  For example, in 2005, Congress recognized that it is improper to evict survivors \nof domestic violence because of their abusers' activities. Accordingly, Congress amended the \nViolence Against Women Act to provide that, for federally funded housing, intimate partner \nviolence \"shall not be good cause for tenninating the assistance, tenancy, or occupancy rights of \nthe victim of such violence.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(9)(B); see also 42 U.S.C. § 14043e-ll(b) \n(covered housing programs may not deny occupancy based on the applicant or tenant being a \n12 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 13 of 21 PageID #: 13\nvictim of domestic violence). While those provisions do not directly regulate private housing or \nthe municipal nuisance ordinance at issue here, they express a clear federal policy that is \ninconsistent with the notion that Maplewood's policy of revoking the occupancy permits of \nsurvivors of domestic violence is ever appropriate, let alone could be the least discriminatory \nmeans of furthering any legitimate safety interests. \n49.  Most survivors of domestic violence are women. In specifically targeting \nsurvivors of domestic violence for nuisance law enforcement, Maplewood thus discriminates on \nthe basis of sex. \n50.  Punishing those who need police or other emergency services for seeking them \nmay also infringe on their First Amendment right to petition the government for assistance. \nThere is no legitimate reason for violating the constitutional rights of survivors of domestic \nviolence and individuals with disabilities who need assistance, nor can doing so be the least \ndiscriminatory means of achieving a legitimate end. \n51.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issued guidance in \n2016 confirming that nuisance ordinances that function like Maplewood's are not the least \ndiscriminatory means of accomplishing a legitimate purpose.2 \n52.  HUD observed that many such ordinances, like Maplewood's, result in tenants' \neviction because of police contacts regardless of whether the tenants did anything wrongful. \nUnder such circumstances, it stated, a municipality will have a \"difficult burden\" to prove that it \nis necessary to \"cut[] off access to emergency services for those in grave need of such services, \n2 See HUD, Office of General Counsel, Guidance on Application ofF air Housing Act Standards \nto the Enforcement ofL ocal Nuisance and Crime-Free Housing Ordinances Against Victims of \nDomestic Violence, Other Crime Victims, and Others Who Require Police or Emergency \nServices (Sept. 13, 20 16). \n13 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 14 of 21 PageID #: 14\nincluding victims of domestic violence or other crimes, thereby potentially endangering their \nlives, safety and security.\" \n53.  Accordingly, as HUD's guidance makes clear, a nuisance ordinance that has a \ndisparate impact based on race, sex and/or disability-as Maplewood's does- is likely to violate \nthe Fair Housing Act, because there is no legitimate reason for enforcing such an ordinance in \nthe manner that Maplewood does. \nInjury to EHOC \n54.  Maplewood's enactment and enforcement of its nuisance ordinance has injured \nand is continuing to injure Plaintiff Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity \nCouncil. EHOC has devoted significant resources to identifying and counteracting Maplewood's \nunlawful practices, and the injuries described below are fairly traceable to those practices. \n55.  As described above, Maplewood's nuisance ordinance has the purpose and effect \nof making housing opportunities unavailable, and making the terms and conditions of housing \nless favorable, based on race, sex, and disability. It also has the purpose and effect of \nperpetuating Maplewood's status as a white enclave in the deeply segregated St. Louis area. \n56.  EHOC's broad mission is to eliminate housing discrimination and racial \nsegregation in housing in the St. Louis metropolitan area. It has only very limited resources, and \nthus discriminatory practices that require it to divert those resources from other worthy projects \nfrustrate the full achievement ofEHOC's mission. \n57.  Maplewood's discriminatory enforcement of its nuisance ordinance has frustrated \nand continues to frustrate EHOC's mission of ensuring that all people have equal access to \nhousing opportunities, in Maplewood and elsewhere in the region that EHOC serves. \n14 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 15 of 21 PageID #: 15\n58.  In response, EHOC has diverted scarce resources and staff to investigating and \nremedying Maplewood's discriminatory enforcement. Those resources and staff would have \nbeen devoted to other projects if not for the discriminatory actions described in this complaint. \n59.  For example, when it becomes aware of occupancy permit revocation \nproceedings, EHOC has expended staff time and other resources representing some of those \ntargeted in order to ensure that fair housing rights are protected. Maplewood's ordinance thus has \ndirectly depleted EHOC's resources. \n60.  Maplewood does not inform EHOC or anyone else on a regular basis when permit \nrevocation proceedings have been initiated. In order to preserve its ability to combat \nMaplewood's discriminatory enforcement, EHOC has had to expend staff time and other \nresources monitoring city functions to detect permit revocation proceedings. \n61.  EHOC has had to expend resources acquiring public information about \nMaplewood's enforcement practices in order to confirm and document the extent of \nMaplewood's discrimination. In particular, Maplewood has charged EHOC thousands of dollars \nto obtain the public records that permitted the analysis necessary to assess the nature and scope \nof Maplewood's discriminatory enforcement practices. \n62.  EHOC has devoted considerable staff time and other resources to analyzing this \nevidence and evaluating Maplewood's conduct in order to counteract the discrimination \ndescribed in this complaint. \n63.  EHOC has had to expend resources doing outreach to the community about \nMaplewood's discriminatory enforcement, educating community members. and otherwise \ncounteracting the effects of Maplewood's discrimination. These activities, too, have required the \ndiversion and expenditure of financial resources and staff time. Maplewood would not have \n15 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 16 of 21 PageID #: 16\nengaged in these activities and expended such resources if not for Maplewood's discriminatory \nconduct. \n64.  For example, in reaction to Maplewood's discriminatory conduct, EHOC has \ngiven presentations at numerous area events to educate community members, advocates, \norganizations, and municipal employees regarding discriminatory nuisance ordinance \nenforcement in general and Maplewood's ordinance in particular. These events include, but are \nnot limited to: \n•  Multiple sessions about nuisance ordinances and their discriminatory effects \nat EHOC's annual regional fair housing training conference on April 10, \n20 15- a conference that Maplewood officials attended; \n•  An October 2015 training for social workers and domestic violence advocates \nat Washington University regarding nuisance ordinance enforcement; \n•  An October 2015 training for local government officials about fair housing \nissues affecting the area, including nuisance ordinance enforcement; \n•  A June 2016 presentation to the St. Louis Ending Violence Against Women \nNetwork regarding nuisance ordinance enforcement; \n65.  In reaction to Maplewood's discriminatory ordinance enforcement, EHOC also \nconducted a fair housing training session in July 2015 at the Maplewood Library in order to \nensure that Maplewood residents understand their rights. Organizing this event required \nsignificant time spent finding a venue; distributing flyers and posters throughout Maplewood; \nand inviting local organizations. \n16 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 17 of 21 PageID #: 17\n66.  As a result of this diversion of resources to addressing Maplewood's \ndiscriminatory conduct, EHOC has had to put on hold or shelve entirely other projects that would \nfurther its mission. \n67.  For example, EHOC had planned to prepare an extensive report regarding \nresidential segregation in the greater St. Louis metropolitan area. This report, tentatively entitled \n\"A Tale of Two Cities,\" would have documented in detail the disparities between predominantly \nwhite and predominantly African-American communities in the region. Because of the time \nspent on Maplewood's ordinance, EHOC has not been able to prepare this report. \n68.  EHOC also has had to postpone an investigation into discriminatory practices by \nan East St. Louis landlord because of resources devoted to Maplewood's ordinance. \n69.  EHOC is continuing to suffer similar injury from Maplewood's ongoing \nenforcement of its nuisance ordinance. \n70.  Through its actions described above, Maplewood has acted negligently, \nintentionally, maliciously, and with willful, malicious, wanton, and reckless disregard for federal \nand state fair housing and non-discrimination laws. It is by now clear that the conduct described \nin this complaint violates the Fair Housing Act and other laws- and EHOC has told Maplewood \nas much- yet Maplewood persists in discriminatory and illegal conduct. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), (b), (f) \n71.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 70 as fully set forth herein. \n72.  The federal Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny housing or make housing \nunavailable to any person \"because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national \n17 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 18 of 21 PageID #: 18\norigin,\" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), or because of a disability, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(t)(l). The Act also \nmakes it unlawful to discriminate in the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a \ndwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith\" for the same \nreasons. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b), (t)(2). \n73.  Both Supreme Court precedent and regulations of the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development provide that a defendant can violate the Fair Housing Act \neither by committing intentional discrimination or through conduct that has an unnecessary \ndisparate impact based on one or more protected classifications such as race, sex, or disability. \nSee Tex. Dep 't ofH  ous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 135 S. Ct. 2507 (2015); 24 \n§ C.F.R. 100.500, et seq. \n74.  Maplewood's enforcement of its nuisance ordinance disproportionately impacts \nnon-white residents, women, and people with disabilities, and it hinders the racial integration of \na still-predominantly-white city in a region that is marked by long-standing residential \nsegregation. These effects are not accidental, but rather stem from the intentional decisions to \nenforce the ordinance disproportionately in certain communities based on race, to make abuse \nvictims responsible for the acts of their abusers, and to punish individuals with disabilities for \nneeding city services. There is no legitimate justification for the ordinance or its discriminatory \nenforcement, and any legitimate purpose they serve could be accomplished in a less \ndiscriminatory manner. \n75.  Maplewood's nuisance ordinance makes housing unavailable anywhere in the city \nfor those residents whose occupancy permit has been revoked. It also discriminates against those \nsame tenants in the privileges of renting, as well as in the provision of municipal services related \nto renting. \n18 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 19 of 21 PageID #: 19\n76.  In selectively enforcing its ordinance as it does, Maplewood knowingly and \nintentionally makes housing unavailable, discriminates in the privileges of renting, and \ndiscriminates in the provision of municipal services related to rental housing, because of race, \ncolor, and disability. Additionally, it intentionally discriminates based on disability because \nMaplewood revokes the occupancy pennits of people with disabilities without making \nreasonable accommodations for their needs. \n77.  Maplewood's nuisance ordinance also violates the Fair Housing Act because it \nhas an unnecessary disparate impact on the availability of housing based on race, sex, and \ndisability, and because it perpetuates racial segregation in the greater St. Louis region. \nMaplewood's nuisance ordinance serves no legitimate purpose, and even if it did, such a goal \ncould be achieved in a manner that does not result in such a disproportionate and severe harm on \nAfrican-American and female residents as well as residents with disabilities. \n78.  Defendant, through its actions and the actions of its agents, is liable for the \nviolation of Plaintiffs rights under the federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), (b), (f). \nSecond Cause of Action \nMissouri Human Rights Act, Mo. Rev. Stat.§ 213.040(1), (2). \n79.  Plaintiffrealleges and incorporates the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 70 as fully set forth herein. \n80.  The Missouri Human Rights Act also bars housing practices that make housing \nunavailable or otherwise discriminate based on race, sex, and disability. Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 213.040(1), (2). The Act was \"patterned after the federal Fair Housing Act,\" Green v. Ten \nEyck, 572 F.2d 1233, 1238 (8th Cir. 1978), and so Maplewood's conduct violates it for the same \nreasons described above with respect to the federal Fair Housing Act. \n19 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 03/13/17   Page: 20 of 21 PageID #: 20\n81.  EHOC has filed a complaint against Maplewood with the Missouri Commission \non Human Rights. That complaint has been administratively exhausted, and the Commission has \nissued a right-to-sue letter regarding these allegations. \n82.  Defendant, through its actions and the actions of its agents, is liable for the \nviolation of Plaintiffs rights under the Missouri Human Rights Act, Mo. Rev.

LOUIS EQUAL  ) \nHOUSING AND OPPORTUNITY COUNCIL,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n) \nv.  )  No. 4:17CV886 RLW \n) \nCITY OF MAPLEWOOD, MISSOURI,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nThis matter is before the Court on Plaintiff Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and \nOpportunity Council's (\"EHOC\") Motion for Relief from Judgment, pursuant to Rules 59, 60(b), \nand 60(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (ECF No. 35)  The motion is fully briefed and \nready for disposition.  For the reasons discussed herein, the motion is denied. \nPlaintiffEHOC seeks relief from this Court's final judgment and Memorandum and \nOrder of December 8, 2017, granting Defendant City of Maplewood, Missouri's (\"Maplewood\") \nmotion to dismiss.  (ECF Nos. 33, 34)  Plaintiff claims that the Court overlooked that EHOC's \nsex discrimination and disability discrimination claims are conceptually distinct from the race \ndiscrimination claims, and thus the Court erred in dismissing those claims for the same reasons. \nEHOC requests that the Court further consider the sex and disability claims under a different \nanalysis.  Defendant Maplewood asserts that Plaintiff cannot use Rule 60(b) to re-litigate the \nmerits of its case and that the Court fully addressed all of Plaintiffs claims as pleaded.  Plaintiff \nreplies that it brings the motion, not under Rule 60(b) but under Rule 59( e ), which allows a court \nto correct errors in a final judgment. \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  47   Filed: 05/08/18   Page: 2 of 4 PageID #: 244\nUnder Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party may file a motion to \nalter or amend a judgment within 28 days after the entry of judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  \"A \ndistrict court has broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a motion to alter or \namend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e).\"  United States v. Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 440 \nF.3d 930, 933 (8th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).  \"Rule 59(e) motions serve the limited function \nof correcting 'manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\"' Id. \n(quoting Innovative Home Health Care v. P. T-0. T Assoc. oft he Black Hills,  141 F.3d 1284, \n1286 (8th Cir.1998) (internal quotation omitted)).  Motions under 59(e) '\"cannot be used to \nintroduce new evidence, tender new legal theories, or raise arguments which could have been \noffered or raised prior to entry of judgment.\"' Id. (quoting Innovative Home Health Care, 141 \nF.3d at 1286).  \"Rule 59(e) motion may not be used to relitigate old matters, or to raise \narguments or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\"  § \n2810.l Grounds for Amendment or Alteration of Judgment, 11 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2810.1 \n(3d ed.) (footnotes omitted). \nSimilarly, under Rule 60(b), a court may relieve a party from a court order for several \nreasons including mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, \nfraud, misrepresentation, misconduct by an opposing party, or any other reason that justifies \nrelief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(l)-(3), (6).  '\"Motions for reconsideration serve a limited function: \nto correct manifest errors oflaw or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\"' Arnold v. \nADT Sec. Servs., Inc., 627 F.3d 716, 721 (8th Cir. 2010) (quoting Hagerman, 839 F.2d at 414 \n(quotations and citations omitted)).  \"The district court has wide discretion in ruling on a Rule \n60(b) motion ....\"   Jones v. Swanson, 512 F.3d 1045, 1049 (8th Cir. 2008).  Rule 60(b) \n\"authorizes relief based on certain enumerated circumstances (for example, fraud, changed \n2 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  47   Filed: 05/08/18   Page: 3 of 4 PageID #: 245\nconditions, and the like).  It is not a vehicle for simple reargument of the merits.\"  Broadway v. \nNorris, 193 F.3d 987, 990 (8th Cir. 1999). \nUpon review of Plaintiff's motion and supporting memoranda, the Court finds that \nPlaintiff is not entitled to relief under either Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b), both rules cited by Plaintiff \nas grounds for relief.  Contrary to Plaintiff EHOC's assertion, the present motion is an attempt to \nre-litigate the issues which the Court thoroughly addressed in the Memorandum and Order.  To \nthe extent that EHOC finds the Court's judgment erroneous, a Rule 60(b) motion is not the \nproper vehicle for raising such objections.  The Eighth Circuit \"has maintained consistently that \n'Rule 60(b) was not intended as a substitute for a direct appeal from an erroneous judgment.'\" \nSpinar v. South Dakota Bd. ofR  egents, 796 F .2d 1060, 1062 (8th Cir. 1986) (quoting Hartman v. \nLauchli, 304 F.2d 431, 432 (8th Cir. 1962)).  While Plaintiff now maintains that it is not \nrequesting Rule 60(b) relief, the motion states that the \"Court overlooked that EHOC's sex \ndiscrimination and disability discrimination claims are conceptually distinct from the race \ndiscrimination claims ....\"   (Pl.'s Mot. for Relief p. 1, ECF No. 35)  Plaintiff's motion then \nargues that the Court's legal analysis of its sex and disability discrimination claims is erroneous. \nAs state above, relief for alleged judicial error is not a proper basis for Rule 60(b) relief. 1  See \nDelaterjera v. Bowersox, No. 4:12-CV-1311NAB,2015 WL 300379, at *3 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 22, \n2015) (citation and internal quotation omitted) (finding that an argument that the court \nmisunderstood or misapplied the law is not grounds for relief under Rule 60(b)(l)). \nWith respect to Rule 59(e  ), Plaintiff argues that the Court would commit error by \nrefusing to reconsider the merits of the motion to dismiss and correct factual or legal errors \n1 Nowhere in Plaintiffs initial memorandum does it argue that its request for relief meets the \nrequirements of either Rule 60(b) or Rule 59( e ). Only in the reply memorandum does Plaintiff \nexplicitly rely upon Rule 59( e) as grounds for reconsideration. \n3 \n\nCase: 4:17-cv-00886-RLW   Doc. #:  47   Filed: 05/08/18   Page: 4 of 4 PageID #: 246\nencompassed by the judgment.  (Pl.' s Reply p. 2, ECF No. 40)  However, contrary to Plaintiffs \nassertion, Rule 59(e) does not allow a plaintiff to re-litigate matters previously determined by the \ncourt.  \"It is not appropriate to use a Rule 59( e) motion to repeat arguments or to raise new \narguments that could have been made before judgment.\" In re Gen. Motors Corp. Anti-Lock \nBrake Prod. Liab. Litig!., 174 F.R.D. 444, 446 (E.D. Mo. 1997) (internal quotations omitted). \nInstead, as stated above, Rule 59( e) motions are limited to correcting manifest errors of law. \nMetro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 440 F.3d at 933.  Here, PlaintiffEHOC has not pointed to any \nmanifest error by the Court.  Review of Plaintiffs motion and related memoranda shows the \npresent motion is merely an attempt to re-argue the merits, which the Court previously and \nthoroughly considered.  Therefore, the Court will deny Plaintiffs motion for relief from \njudgment.  See Schoffstall v. Henderson, 223 F .3d 818, 827 (8th Cir. 2000) (affirming district \ncourt's denial of Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider where plaintiff merely restated arguments made \nin her opposition to defendant's summary judgment motion). \nAccordingly, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and \nOpportunity Council's Motion for Relief from Judgment (ECF No. 35) is DENIED. \nDated this 8th day of May, 2018. \n~~~ \nRONNIE L.
