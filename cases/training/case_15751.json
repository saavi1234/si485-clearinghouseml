    "summary": "<p>On April 12, 2017, the ACLUs of Southern California and Nevada filed this suit under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This was one of over a dozen such suits; each aimed to shed light on how U.S. Customs and Border Protection implemented President Trump's January 27 and March 6 Executive Orders (EO) that ban admission to the U.S. of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. </p><p>Specifically, plaintiffs sought information \"concerning CBP’s local implementation of President Trump’s January 27, 2017 Executive Order...as well as any other judicial order or executive directive issued regarding Executive Order No. 1, including President Trump’s March 6, 2017 Executive Order.\" The request concerned implementation at international airports within the purview of CBP's Los Angeles Field Office, including Los Angeles International Airport and McCarran International Airport. The request also concerned the number of individuals who were detained or subjected to secondary screening, extended questioning, enforcement examination, or consideration for a waiver at the aforementioned airports pursuant to the EO. </p><p>In the complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the requested records \"would facilitate the public’s understanding of how Defendants implemented and enforced the Executive Orders in the Los Angeles Field Office\" and that \"[s]uch information is critical to the public’s ability to hold the government accountable.\" </p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell.</p><p>On May 8, the government filed a motion to treat all of these FOIA cases as \"multidistrict litigation\" effectively consolidating them before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  For the transfer motion see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15719\">this case</a>. On May 17, the government moved to stay the proceedings pending the consolidation decision. The ACLU filed their opposition to the motion to transfer on May 30, arguing that \"[g]ranting consolidation and transfer would promote forum-shopping and delay, not justice.\" On Jun. 21, the court ordered proceedings stayed for 60 days.</p><p>On Aug. 3, the U.S. District Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation denied the government's consolidation motion. In its order, the Panel found that, although the thirteen FOIA cases shared \"a limited number of factual issues,\" these issues \"appear[ed] relatively straightforward and unlikely to entail extensive pretrial proceedings.\" Following the Panel's denial, Judge O'Connell lifted the stay and litigation continued. </p><p>On Nov. 3, the case was reassigned to Judge Robert H. Whaley.</p><p>On Dec. 13, 2017, the court set a production schedule ordering the government to review and produce responsive records in monthly batches through February 2018. The government completed its production by March 2018, and after the parties conferred, the ACLU stated in an August 2018 status report that it was satisfied with the production and would not pursue further litigation. Attorneys' fees and costs are the only outstanding issue the parties are currently working to resolve. </p><p>By May 28, 2019, the parties had come to an agreement regarding attorneys' fees and costs. They therefore submitted a stipulation of dismissal on June 19, 2019, which was granted that same day. The case is now closed.</p>",

Plaintiffs \n7 \nspend the bulk of their Opposition arguing against consolidation.  Plaintiffs \n8 \nrepeatedly argue that this case is unrelated to the others, Pls.’ Opp’n at 4, 10-11, \n9 \n13-14 (ECF No. 20)—even though all of them were brought by ACLU affiliates as \n10 \n11  admittedly “coordinated” lawsuits and even though they all concern parallel FOIA \n12 \nrequests for identical or nearly identical categories of records, see Transfer Mot. at \n13 \n4-7 (ECF No. 15-3)—because the plaintiffs are different ACLU affiliates and \n14 \nbecause the requests seek records from different CBP field offices.  Such \n15 \narguments should instead be addressed to the JPML, which is considering whether \n16 \n17  consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings would be appropriate (and which \n18 \nhas previously centralized FOIA actions over similar objections).   \n19 \n  As Defendants have explained, a temporary stay of proceedings until the \n20 \nJPML can decide Defendants’ motion to transfer serves the interests of judicial \n21 \n22  economy and avoids any significant burden to either party.  The JPML is likely to \n23  hear and decide the transfer motion only a few weeks after the first deadline in this \n24 \ncase.  Any stay of this duration would have no effect on the timing of Defendants’ \n25 \nrelease of responsive records, and thus Plaintiffs will suffer no prejudice.  \n26 \nMoreover, the strategic behavior of Plaintiffs and the other ACLU affiliates in \n27 \n28  unnecessarily bringing the related actions as thirteen separate cases obviously \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 1 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 3 of 10   Page ID #:259\n \n1 \nimposes a burden on Defendants from having to engage in parallel proceedings in \n2 \nthirteen courts.  And Plaintiffs have not explained why this Court should now \n3 \nexpend its resources on pretrial proceedings—including status reports, scheduling \n4 \norders, and possible discovery—when those issues would need to be re-litigated \n5 \n6  before the transferee court. \n7 \n  Stays pending a JPML motion, while not automatic, are routine.  See, \n8 \ne.g., Defs.’ Mot. at 2-3 (ECF No. 18) (collecting authorities); see also, e.g., San \n9 \nDiego Unified Port Dist. v. Monsanto Co., No. 15-cv-00578-WQH-JLB, 2016 WL \n10 \n11  4496826, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 1, 2016) (“majority of courts have concluded that it \n12 \nis often appropriate to stay preliminary pretrial proceedings”); Automated \n13 \nTransactions, LLC v. Bath Sav. Inst., No. 2:12-cv-393-JAW, 2013 WL 1346470, at \n14 \n*2 (D. Me. Mar. 14, 2013) (courts grant stays “frequently”); Bonenfant v. R.J. \n15 \nReynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-60301-CIV, 2007 WL 2409980, at *1 (S.D. Fla. \n16 \n17  July 31, 2007) (“common practice” to grant stays).1  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ \n18                                              \n1 Plaintiffs erroneously suggest that “courts frequently deny” stays pending a \n19 \nJPML decision on a motion to transfer.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 12-13.  The cases they cite \n20 \nfor this proposition are easily distinguishable, and, in any event, are against the clear \n21  weight of authority recognizing that stays in this context are routine.  See Sehler v. \nProspect Mortg., LLC, No. 1:13cv473(JCC/TRJ), 2013 WL 5184216, at *3 (E.D. \n22 \nVa. Sept. 16, 2013) (denying stay where defendant agreed to decertification of class \n23  before  moving  for consolidation before  the JPML  and  where  stay  would have \ndelayed case by four to six months, during which time trial would occur); Sullivan \n24 \nv.

Feb. 29, 2012) \n25  (holding that stay was not warranted where motion to remand raised issues regarding \ncourt’s jurisdiction and where court could decide remand motion and motion to \n26 \ndismiss before the JPML heard transfer motion); St. Joe Co. v. Transocean Offshore \n27 \nDeepwater Drilling Inc., 774 F. Supp. 2d 596, 600-02 (D. Del. 2011) (denying stay \n28 \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 2 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 4 of 10   Page ID #:260\n \n1 \ncontention, there is no exception to the typical practice when the government seeks \n2 \ntransfer of FOIA cases.  Indeed, as discussed below, stays pending a decision of \n3 \nthe JPML have been granted in numerous FOIA cases.  In light of the limited \n4 \nduration of any potential stay here, the ACLU affiliates’ strategic approach to the \n5 \n6  litigation, and the burden that a piecemeal approach imposes on the government \n7 \nand the courts, this Court should grant Defendants’ request for a temporary stay. \n8 \nARGUMENT \n9 \n \n10  I.  PLAINTIFFS WILL NOT SUFFER HARDSHIP FROM A \nTEMPORARY STAY \n11 \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that this case is in the early stages of litigation and \n12 \nthat any stay would likely be of a brief duration—likely a matter of weeks, not \n13 \nmonths.  Courts have readily found that plaintiffs suffer no prejudice in similar \n14 \ncircumstances.  See Defs.’ Mot. at 6.   \n15 \n  Instead, Plaintiffs suggest that FOIA is different and that Plaintiffs will \n16 \nsuffer “significant prejudice[]” because a stay would delay the release of \n17 \nresponsive, non-exempt records by Defendants.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 9-10.  Contrary to \n18 \nPlaintiffs’ suggestion, there is no reason that stays in FOIA cases should be treated \n19 \ndifferently in this context.  Defendants are aware of two instances in which the \n20 \ngovernment sought centralization of FOIA actions by the JPML.  See Transfer \n21 \nMot. at 9-10.  In both, transferor courts granted motions to stay the proceedings \n22 \npending the JPML’s decision, and Defendants are not aware of any transferor court \n23 \nin these actions that denied a stay motion.  See, e.g., Freedom Magazine v. IRS, \n24 \n                                            \n25 \nwhere motion to remand was fully briefed by parties and was granted by court in \n26  same opinion as stay motion); Barber v. BP, PLC, No. 10-0263-WS-B, 2010 WL \n2266760, at *2 (S.D. Ala. June 4, 2010) (denying stay motion in putative class action \n27 \nwhere district court had previously denied 23 “substantively identical motions to \n28 \nstay” proceedings).    \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 3 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 5 of 10   Page ID #:261\n \n1  No. 91-cv-6813 (S.D. Fla.) (ECF No. 10); Freedom Magazine v. IRS, No. 91-cv-\n2  2921 (D. Md.) (ECF No. 6); Freedom Magazine v. IRS, No. 91-cv-12598 (D. \n3  Mass.) (ECF entry Feb. 7, 1992); Freedom Magazine v. IRS, No. 91-cv-704 (S.D. \n4  Ohio) (ECF No. 6); Bach v. IRS, No. 91-cv-20184 (N.D. Cal.) (ECF No. \n5  13); Chandler v. IRS, No. 91-cv-20183 (N.D. Cal.) (ECF No. 15); Kimmich v. IRS, \n6  No. 91-cv-20182 (N.D. Cal.) (ECF No. 13); Licciardi v. IRS, No. 91-cv-148 \n7  (D.N.H.) (ECF No. 5).2  Plainly, then, stays pending JPML decisions are equally \n8  justified in FOIA cases. \n9  Moreover, notwithstanding their conclusory assertions of “delay,” Pls.’ \n10  Opp’n at 9, Plaintiffs fail to explain how a temporary stay would have any effect \n11  on the timing of the release of responsive records in this case.  Currently, \n12  Defendants’ response to the complaint is due June 29, 2017.  (ECF No. 17.)  \n13  Briefing on Defendants’ motion to transfer has already been completed, and \n14  Defendants anticipate that their motion will be heard by the JPML on July 27, 2017 \n15  and decided shortly thereafter.  As Defendants explained in their Motion, even if a \n16  stay is imposed, Defendants will continue to compile and review records during the \n17  pendency of the stay.  Defs.’ Mot. at 6.  Indeed, although Plaintiffs falsely state \n18  that “CBP has not notified Plaintiffs of a determination as to whether it will \n19  respond to the Request, nor . . . acknowledge ACLU’s request for an expedited \n20  response,” Pls.’ Opp’n at 4, Defendants in fact have granted Plaintiffs’ request for \n21 \n                                            \n22 \n2 On June 6, 2017, the Western District of Washington denied Defendants’ \n23  motion to stay in one of the related actions.  See Order of June 6, 2017, ACLU of \nWashington v. DHS, No. 17-0562 (RSL) (ECF No. 20).  This Court is not bound by \n24 \nthat  decision  and  should  decline  to  follow  it,  as  it  ignores  many  of  the  key \n25  considerations justifying a stay here.  Contrary to that court’s decision, no delay in \nthe production of documents will result from granting a stay because Defendants’ \n26 \nprocessing of the ACLU affiliates’ FOIA requests is ongoing and will continue with \n27 \nor without a stay.  See infra Pt. I. \n28 \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 4 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 6 of 10   Page ID #:262\n \n1  expedited treatment and have placed the coordinated requests of all the ACLU \n2  affiliates in the expedited processing queue, ahead of all non-expedited requests \n3  and later expedited requests.  Defendants have also released records responsive to \n4  one of the ACLU’s numerous requests and anticipates releasing more shortly, \n5  without any court order.  Thus, Plaintiffs are simply wrong that a temporary pause \n6  in the litigation will delay the release of records, see id. at 7-10, and Defendants’ \n7  response to Plaintiffs’ request will proceed on the same track with or without the \n8  stay.3 \n9    Further, Plaintiffs do not identify anything that will occur in this Court \n10  before the JPML’s decision that would actually hasten the release of responsive \n11  documents.  Though Defendants will process Plaintiffs’ request “as soon as \n12  practicable,” 6 C.F.R. § 5.5(e)(4), there is no reason to believe—particularly in \n13  light of the substantial volume of recent FOIA requests received by Defendants \n14  and the complexity of Plaintiffs’ request—that production of all responsive records \n15  will be complete by the time the JPML decides Defendants’ transfer motion.  \n16  Indeed, Plaintiffs do not claim it would be, as they “have not yet asked the Court to \n17  set a [production] schedule” and believe that only “limited activity [is] likely to \n18  occur in this case before the MDL motion is decided.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 12-13.  It is \n19  difficult to square these assertions with Plaintiffs’ dire warnings of unspecified \n20  “delay.”   \n21   \n   \n22 \n23 \n                                            \n24  3 Plaintiffs grasp at straws when they suggest that “CBP’s concern that the court \nmight ‘set a schedule’” is a “tacit admission” that Defendants have not begun \n25 \nprocessing Plaintiffs’ request.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 13.  As Defendants have already \n26  explained, they have granted Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing, and CBP \nheadquarters is currently in the process of compiling and reviewing records for \n27 \nresponsiveness to the FOIA requests in all of the related actions.  See supra Pt. I; \n28 \nDefs.’ Mot. at 6.   \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 5 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 7 of 10   Page ID #:263\n \nII.  SIMULTANEOUS AND DUPLICATIVE PROCEEDINGS IN \n1 \nTHIRTEEN PARALLEL ACTIONS WILL IMPOSE AN \n2 \nUNNECESSARY BURDEN   \n3  As Defendants explained, proceeding in this case (and the other related \n4  cases) while their motion to transfer is pending forces them to engage in \n5  simultaneous proceedings in thirteen separate cases before thirteen different courts.  \n6  See Defs.’ Mot. at 5-6.  Plaintiffs disregard this burden as not a “real hardship” and \n7  claim that Defendants are only seeking to avoid “having to defend this action on a \n8  normal schedule.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 10.   \n9  Plaintiffs’ attempt to minimize the obvious burden to Defendants requires \n10  looking at this case in isolation from the other related actions.  But, as a direct \n11  result of the ACLU’s coordinated strategy to gerrymander these FOIA requests \n12  into thirteen separate cases, see Transfer Mot. at 4-8, Defendants must \n13  simultaneously answer complaints, appear in status conferences, confer with \n14  opposing counsel, and submit joint status reports in the thirteen related actions.  In \n15  this action in particular, Defendants would, at a minimum, be required to respond \n16  to the complaint, confer with Plaintiffs on initial disclosures and a discovery plan, \n17  and possibly to appear at a scheduling conference.  This work would be duplicated \n18  in the other related actions and in the transferee court, and “litigating essentially \n19  the same claims in courts all over the country is no doubt burdensome.”  Bd. of \n20  Trustees of Teachers’ Retirement Sys. of Illinois v. Worldcom, Inc., 244 F. Supp. \n21  2d 900, 905 (N.D. Ill. 2002); see also Virginia ex rel. Integra Rec LLC v. \n22  Countrywide Sec. Corp., No. 3:14CV706, 2015 WL 222312, at *3 (E.D. Va. Jan. \n23  14, 2015) (noting that defendant would suffer hardship “without a stay, including \n24  their ‘need to monitor and defend cases in multiple jurisdictions, on different \n25  schedules, when the cases may be consolidated to avoid that burden’” \n26  (quoting Wood v. Johnson & Johnson, No. WDQ-12-1572, 2012 WL 3240934, at \n27  *3 (D. Md. Aug. 3, 2012))) \n28  Plaintiffs’ suggestion that “answering the Complaint and conferring on a \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 6 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 8 of 10   Page ID #:264\n \n1  joint discovery plan . . . would not be wasted effort even if this case were \n2  transferred by the JPML,” Pls.’ Opp’n at 14, is plainly wrong.  If the cases are \n3  consolidated, Defendants may not need to answer thirteen individual complaints at \n4  all, because the transferee court would likely require all of the ACLU affiliate \n5  plaintiffs to file a single amended consolidated complaint, which would require \n6  only one answer.  See, e.g., Manual for Complex Litigation § 20.132, at 224 n.668 \n7  (4th ed. 2004).  And if the cases are transferred to Defendants’ proposed forum, \n8  this action would be exempt under the local rules from any requirement to engage \n9  in a Rule 16 conference or confer on a joint discovery plan.  See Transfer Mot. at \n10  15.  Thus, absent a stay, Defendants will be required to undertake time-consuming \n11  work—in as many as thirteen separate cases—that may otherwise prove \n12  unnecessary. \n13    Moreover, Plaintiffs do not disclaim any intent to request either discovery or \n14  a production schedule while Defendants’ transfer motion is pending.  See Pls.’ \n15  Opp’n at 14.  Any decision that this Court may reach on these issues clearly may \n16  conflict with those of other courts and/or the transferee court.  Defs.’ Mot. at 5-6.  \n17  Any such inconsistency would be plainly prejudicial—it would likely place \n18  competing demands on the same agency personnel responsible for processing the \n19  responses to the requests in each of the related cases.  Id.  And, if Defendants’ \n20  motion to transfer is granted, Defendants would be forced to re-litigate these exact \n21  same issues before the transferee court.  Id.  Plaintiffs ignore this fact.  \n22    Courts routinely find that the burden in time and expense from rearguing the \n23  same issues in different courts and the potential for inconsistent rulings justify a \n24  temporary stay pending a decision by the JPML on a motion to transfer.  See id. \n25  (collecting cases); Oregon ex rel. Kroger v. Johnson & Johnson, No. 11-CV-86-\n26  AC, 2011 WL 1347069, at *6 (D. Or. Apr. 8, 2011); Paul v. Aviva Life & Ann. Co., \n27  No. 09-1038, 2009 WL 2244766, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2009); Palmer v. Am. \n28  Honda Motor Co., No. CV 07-1904-PHX-DGC, 2008 WL 54914, at *1 (D. Ariz. \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 7 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 9 of 10   Page ID #:265\n \n1  Jan. 3, 2008).  For those same reasons, a stay is warranted here as well. \n \n2 \nIII.  A STAY WOULD SERVE JUDICIAL ECONOMY BY AVOIDING \n3 \nUNNECESSARY AND DUPLICATIVE PROCEEDINGS \n4  Plaintiffs also try to minimize the waste of judicial resources from \n5  duplicative proceedings in the related cases by arguing essentially that there are no \n6  duplicative proceedings because this action has nothing to do with the other related \n7  actions.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 13-14.  As discussed above, Plaintiffs are simply wrong.  In \n8  any event, Plaintiffs’ argument speaks more to whether transfer is appropriate than \n9  to whether this Court should stay proceedings while the JPML considers the \n10  appropriateness of transfer.  There can be no doubt that, if the case is transferred, \n11  any time this Court has devoted to pretrial proceedings will have been for naught.   \n12  Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that a stay would be “premature” because they \n13  “have not yet asked the Court to set a schedule.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 13.  As discussed, \n14  the imminent deadlines Defendants face in this and the twelve other related cases \n15  make Defendants’ stay motion anything but premature.  In any event, that \n16  Plaintiffs have not “yet” asked the Court to set a schedule does not mean Plaintiffs \n17  will not seek to do so before the JPML decides Defendants’ motion, or that they \n18  will not engage in other unnecessary proceedings.  A stay would make it \n19  unnecessary for the Court to devote its time to resolving any disputes over such \n20  pretrial matters. Cf. Rivers v. Walt Disney Co., 980 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (C.D. Cal. \n21  1997) (granting stay in interests of judicial economy because absent stay “this \n22  Court will have needlessly expended its energies familiarizing itself with the \n23  intricacies of a case that would be heard by another judge”).  \n24  CONCLUSION \n25    For the reasons set forth above and in Defendants’ Motion, this Court should \n26  grant Defendants’ request for a stay of proceedings.  \n27   \n28   \n \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay Proceedings   - 8 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 24   Filed 06/12/17   Page 10 of 10   Page ID #:266\n \n1  Dated: June 12, 2017      Respectfully submitted, \n \n2  CHAD A.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT   \n7  Plaintiffs oppose the motion of DHS and CBP for a blanket stay of   \n8  proceedings pending a decision by the Joint Panel on Multidistrict Litigation   \n9  (“MDL”) to transfer this case to Washington, D.C.  The requested stay is   \n10  unnecessary, overbroad, and prejudicial to the ACLU’s right to obtain a timely   \n11  response to its Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request for records about an   \n \nP\nL\n12  issue of tremendous current importance: the chaotic local implementation of   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  President Trump’s Executive Orders purporting to bar individuals from several   \nI\nA\nM 14  predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.   \nE\nR 15  This Court should exercise its discretion to deny the requested stay, first,   \nT\n \nT\n16  because it will result in needless and prejudicial delay to ACLU’s access to these   \nH\nG\nI 17  important public records.  FOIA’s central purpose of assuring an informed citizenry   \nR\nW\n18  and an accountable government is undermined when federal agencies are permitted   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  to delay responding to requests or adjudicating a requester’s right to records.    \nA\nD\n20  Defendants seek just such a delay here.   \n21  Second, the stay cannot be justified by any harm to DHS and CBP.  Their   \n22  claim of potentially inconsistent adjudications is entirely conjectural and premature.    \n23  Defendants identify no pending or anticipated ruling that pose a meaningful risk of   \n24  inconsistency, and they ignore the factual differences between this case and the   \n25  other FOIA cases they seek to transfer (all of which seek only local records).    \n26  Moreover, the litigation events that are likely to occur before the MDL issue is   \n27  decided – such as answering ACLU’s Complaint and cooperating on a discovery   \n28   \n  1 \n   \nOPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \nCase No. 2:17-cv-2778 BRO (ASx) \n   \n4835-7015-4313v.6 0201195-000002 \n   \n\n    \nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 20   Filed 06/05/17   Page 8 of 22   Page ID #:198\n     \n1  plan – are not onerous, and are activities the government would be required to   \n2  undertake even if its MDL motion is granted.     \n3  Third, Defendants have identified no substantial efficiencies to be gained by a   \n4  stay.  The activities likely to occur before the MDL motion is considered are   \n5  minimal, and would need to occur regardless of any JPML decision.  Moreover, the   \n6  FOIA request in this case sought only records held by the Los Angeles CBP Field   \n7  Office.  Thus, the question of whether Defendants properly searched for and   \n8  provided requested records will have to be addressed on a local basis, even if some   \n9  pretrial activity is consolidated.  A stay will not aid judicial economy on that or any   \n10  other anticipated issue.      \n11  II.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND   \n \nP\nL\n12  A.  Background on Local Implementation of the Executive Orders   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  The ACLU brought this FOIA lawsuit in order to obtain timely access to   \nI\nA\nM 14  information of extreme importance, both in Southern California, Nevada, and   \nE\nR 15  nationally.     \nT\n \nT\n16  On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order entitled   \nH\nG\nI 17  “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.”  See   \nR\nW\n18  Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) at ¶ 2.  Among other things, the order purported to halt   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  refugee admissions and bar entrants from several predominantly Muslim countries   \nA\nD\n20  from entering the United States.  Compl. ¶ 4.  News reports described Defendants’   \n21  implementation of the Executive Order as “chaotic” and “total[ly] lack[ing] . . .   \n22  clarity and direction.”  Id. ¶ 7.1  On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued another,   \n23  identically titled, Executive Order after at least five lawsuits2 resulted in emergency   \n                                                 \n24  1 See, e.g., Ryan Devereaux et al., Homeland Security Inspector General   \nOpens Investigation of Muslim Ban, Orders Document Preservation, THE \n25   \nINTERCEPT, Feb. 1, 2017, available at \nhttps://theintercept.com/2017/02/01/homeland-security-inspector-general-opens-\n26   \ninvestigation-of-muslim-ban-rollout-orders-document-preservation/. \n2 Doe v.

Compl. ¶¶ 2, 6.   \n3  Residents and their families in Southern California and Nevada have been   \n4  personally affected by the orders;3 and when the first order took effect in January   \n5  2017, thousands of people demonstrated at Los Angeles International Airport and   \n6  hundreds did the same at McCarran International Airport.  See Compl. ¶ 11.4    \n7  The immigration policy debate surrounding the order has particular resonance in   \n8  Southern California and Nevada.  Los Angeles, an incredibly diverse major   \n9  international travel hub with a long history of taking in refugees, is home to vibrant   \n10  cultural institutions, research academies, businesses, and industries that are   \n11  invigorated by immigrants and international visitors.5  Likewise, Nevada is home to   \n \nP\nL\n12  many refugees, as well as universities, businesses and a world-renowned tourism   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  and entertainment industry fueled by international visitors and immigrants.6     \nI\nA                                                                                                                                                                 \nM 14   \nDarweesh v.

ACLU’s FOIA Request   \n2  While the Executive Order remains enjoined, the public is still largely in the   \n3  dark about CBP’s actions, including its enforcement of the directive at Los Angeles   \n4  International Airport, the instructions given to officials at the Los Angeles CBP   \n5  Field Office, and the basis for their interpretation of the order.  On February 2, 2017,   \n6  Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request seeking records related to CBP’s local   \n7  interpretation and enforcement of the order.  Compl. ¶¶ 1-3, 22-24 & Ex. A.  The   \n8  Request expressly excluded records held by CBP Headquarters.  Id. ¶ 3, 23 & Ex. A   \n9  at 10.  The FOIA request sought expedited processing, on the ground that there is a   \n10  “compelling need” for these records under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II) because   \n11  the information requested is “urgen[tly]” needed by an organization primarily   \n \nP\nL\n12  engaged in disseminating information “to inform the public concerning actual or   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  alleged Federal Government activity.”  Compl., ¶¶ 25-27 & Ex. A, at p. 11-16.     \nI\nA\nM 14  CBP has not notified Plaintiffs of a determination as to whether it will   \nE\nR 15  respond to the Request, nor has it acknowledged ACLU’s request for an expedited   \nT\n \nT\n16  response.  Id. ¶¶ 30-34.  To date, Defendants have yet to provide a single record   \nH\nG\nI 17  responsive to the request.  Id.  To ACLU’s knowledge, CBP’s Los Angeles Field   \nR\nW\n18  Office has yet to disclose any of the instructions its local officials were provided   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  with respect to the Executive Order or any record explaining its interpretation of the   \nA\nD\n20  order.   \n21  C.  Procedural Background and Pending Proceedings   \n22  ACLU filed its complaint on April 12, 2017.  It alleges Defendants violated   \n23  FOIA by failing to (i) produce responsive records, (ii) state whether it will make   \n24  records available, and (iii) to respond to ACLU’s request for expedited processing.    \n25  Compl. ¶¶ 35-45.  On May 8, Defendants filed a motion with the JPML, seeking to   \n26  transfer this case to the district court for the District of Columbia in order to   \n27   \n                                                                                                                                                                \nRADIO, Feb. 1, 2017, available at https://knpr.org/knpr/2017-02/immigration-moves-\n28   \nworry-refugees-already-resettled-nevada \n  4 \n   \nOPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \nCase No. 2:17-cv-2778 BRO (ASx) \n   \n4835-7015-4313v.6 0201195-000002 \n   \n\n    \nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 20   Filed 06/05/17   Page 11 of 22   Page ID #:201\n     \n1  coordinate pretrial proceedings with 12 other FOIA lawsuits (all filed in other   \n2  districts, seeking different local records from Defendants) (“Motion”).  Motion at   \n3  pp. 1-2.  The 12 other cases were filed by separate ACLU affiliates in other   \n4  jurisdictions.  Each involves different FOIA requests for local records held by   \n5  different regional CBP offices.  None of the other 12 suits involves the records at   \n6  issue in this lawsuit – i.e., records held by the Los Angeles CBP Field Office.   \n7  ACLU did not oppose CBP and DHS’ request to extend time to respond to the   \n8  Complaint, and Defendants’ response is not due until June 29, 2017.  See Dkt. # 16,   \n9  17.  On May 31, 2017, ACLU filed notice of its Opposition to Defendants’ Motion.    \n10  See Dkt. # 19.  No other conferences or hearings are currently on calendar, and no   \n11  discovery has been served.  The only pending motion is the instant Motion.   \n \nP\nL\n12   \nL III.  DEFENDANTS HAVE NOT CARRIED THEIR BURDEN OF \n \nE\nN 13  SHOWING THAT THIS ACTION SHOULD BE STAYED.   \nI\nA\nM 14  A.  The Pending MDL Motion Is Not A Sufficient Ground To Stay These   \nE\nProceedings \nR 15   \nT\n \nT 16  A district court “should not automatically stay discovery, postpone rulings on   \nH\nG\nI 17  pending motions, or generally suspend further rulings upon a [party’s] motion to the   \nR\nW\n18  MDL Panel for transfer and consolidation.”  Rivers v. Walt Disney Co., 980 F. Supp.   \n \nS\nI\nV 19  1358, 1360 (C.D. Cal. 1997); accord, Perry v. Luu, 2013 WL 3354446, at *3 (E.D.   \nA\nD\n20  Cal. July 3, 2013).  Indeed, there is no requirement that a court stay litigation   \n21  pending a JPML decision on a motion to transfer: such a motion “does not affect or   \n22  suspend orders and pretrial proceedings in any pending federal district court action   \n23  and does not limit the pretrial jurisdiction of that court.”  MDL Rule 2.1(d)   \n24  (emphasis added); Litchfield Co., LLC v. BP, P.L.C., 2010 WL 2802498, at *1   \n25  (D.S.C. July 14, 2010) (“A pending transfer motion before the MDL panel does not   \n26  deprive the district court in which the action is then pending of jurisdiction over   \n27  pretrial matters.”); Jozwiak v. Stryker Corp., 2010 WL 147143, *2 (M.D. Fla.   \n28  Jan. 11, 2010).

June 4, 2010).7   \n6  “The decision to grant or deny a temporary stay of proceedings pending a   \n7  ruling by the MDL Panel on a motion to consolidate is discretionary.”  Burns v.   \n8  Gerber Products Co., 2012 WL 8251405, at *4 (E.D. Wash. Sept. 4, 2012), citing   \n9  Conroy v. Fresh Del Monte Produce, Inc., 325 F. Supp. 2d 1049, 1053 (N.D. Cal.   \n10  2004).  That discretion is exercised in light of three factors: (1) the “potential   \n11  prejudice to the non-moving party”; (2) any “hardship and inequity to the moving   \n \nP\nL\n12  party if the action is not stayed”; and (3) “judicial resources that would be saved by   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  avoiding duplicative litigation if the cases are in fact consolidated.”  Burns, 2012   \nI\nA\nM 14  WL 8251405, at *4 (quoting Rivers, 980 F. Supp. at 1360).     \nE\nR 15  Each of these considerations is discussed below.

A Stay Will Prejudice Plaintiffs By Delaying Access To Records Of \n1   \nSignificant Public Interest Amid An Ongoing Controversy. \n2   \nThe government’s requested stay would prejudice Plaintiffs because it would \n3   \nundermine a central purpose of FOIA: ensuring records of public interest are \n4   \nproduced promptly to enable citizens to learn about government conduct and to act \n5   \non it at a time when public engagement would be effective.  This case is a textbook \n6   \nexample of the importance of timely disclosure, given the ongoing controversy and \n7   \ndebate about the Executive Orders.

The Government Will Not Suffer Any Cognizable Hardship Absent A \n7  Stay   \n8  In recognizing a court’s power to stay proceedings, the Supreme Court also   \n9  cautioned that an applicant “for a stay must make out a clear case of hardship or   \n10  inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the   \n11  stay for which he prays will work damage to some one else.”  Landis v. N. Am. Co.,   \n \nP\nL\n12  299 U.S. 248, 255 (1936) (emphasis added).  Applying this limiting principle, the   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  Ninth Circuit will deny a stay where the moving party failed to make a clear   \nI\nA\nM 14  showing of hardship: “To be sure…. if the stay is vacated [moving party] must   \nE\nR 15  proceed toward trial in the suit in the district court, but being required to defend a   \nT\n \nT\n16  suit, without more, does not constitute a ‘clear case of hardship or inequity’ within   \nH\nG\nI 17  the meaning of Landis.”  Lockyer v.

See Motion at 5.  They vaguely speculate “moving forward could also   \n22  result” in conflicting rulings.  Id. (emphasis added).  But Defendants do not identify   \n23  these potential conflicts, or explain why they are likely, let alone imminent absent a   \n24  stay.  They simply claim the agencies are also litigating requests for “identical or   \n25  similar categories of records” from requesters other than Plaintiff.  Id. at 1.  This   \n26  simply ignores that each of those other complaints has been brought by different   \n27  plaintiffs and seeks different records.

Compl. ¶¶ 3, 23; Compl. Ex. A at 10.  Thus, this case involves different   \n3  factual and legal issues than the other pending actions.  The inquiry in this case will   \n4  focus on the factual circumstances surrounding CBP’s local implementation of the   \n5  Orders in the Los Angeles Field Office, and the reasonableness of the searches for   \n6  records held in that office.  The other actions, by contrast, seek records about CBP’s   \n7  implementation of the Orders in other CBP field offices, and as a result will raise the   \n8  reasonableness of searches conducted for different records held in different   \n9  locations.  It is impossible to know whether the lawsuits will raise any of the same   \n10  claimed exemptions because each action seeks different records.    \n11  Courts consistently reject stay requests founded on such mere conjecture.  For   \n \nP\nL\n12  example, in Ramos v. Capital One, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32368 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 7,   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  2017), defendants claimed hardship from litigating related cases at the same time,   \nI\nA\nM 14  but the court noted, “[a]side from conclusory assertions, Defendants have not   \nE\nR 15  provided any detail as to why simultaneous litigation of this case and [another] case   \nT\n \nT\n16  that have substantial overlap in their factual and legal issues would cause a   \nH\nG\nI 17  significant burden.”  Id. at *8-9.  Given the vague showing, the court concluded that   \nR\nW\n18  any such hardships would “weigh only slightly in favor of granting the stay and do   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  not outweigh the possible prejudice to Plaintiff.”  Id. at *12.  See also In re Maxwell   \nA\nD\n20  Techs., Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87955, at *5 (S.D. Cal.

See Wilbanks v. Merck & Co., Inc., 2005 \nWL 2234071, at *1 (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 13, 2005) (stay granted where cases from \n25   \nsame district raising similar jurisdictional issue had already been transferred to \nMDL panel and “hundreds, possibly thousands, of others that have been transferred \n26   \nor are awaiting transfer in other districts”); Freitas, 2012 WL 161211 at *2 (judicial \neconomy justified stay where “[o]ver 100 cases involving allegations of harm \n27   \nresulting from the ingestion of medications containing” the same drug); Namovicz v. \nCooper Tire & Rubber Co., 225 F.

The court found “the only tangible effect of entering a stay   \n5  at this time would be to allow defendants a three-month reprieve after service of   \n6  process before being required to answer the allegations brought by plaintiffs in the   \n7  Complaint. Such a protracted delay appears both unnecessary and unwarranted.”    \n8  Barber, 2010 WL 2266760, at *2.  Just as in this case, “there is no reason in the   \n9  world why defendants cannot file responsive pleadings prior to the MDL’s   \n10  determination on the pending transfer and consolidation issues,” because   \n11  “[r]egardless of whether and where the MDL Panel ultimately transfers this action   \n \nP\nL\n12  for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings, defendants will need to file   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  answers or responsive pleadings.”  Id.  Given the limited activity likely to occur in   \nI\nA\nM 14  this case before the MDL motion is decided, Defendants cannot demonstrate any   \nE\nR 15  real harm justifying their proposed blanket stay.   \nT\n \nT\n16  Because Plaintiffs have demonstrated far more than a “fair possibility” of   \nH\nG\nI 17  prejudice and the government points to no hardship other than simply “being   \nR\nW\n18  required to defend a suit,” its request should be denied.  Lockyer, 398 F.3d at 1112.   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  D.  A Stay Will Not Significantly Promote Judicial Economy   \nA\nD\n20  Defendants’ attempt to justify a blanket stay on grounds of judicial economy   \n21  fail for reasons largely set forth above.  They argue, first, that stays are “typically”   \n22  granted pending motions to transfer to the JPML.  Motion at 2.  This is overstated:   \n23  as noted in Section A, courts frequently deny – and certainly do not automatically   \n24  grant – requests for stays merely because a motion to transfer pretrial proceedings to   \n25   \n                                                                                                                                                                \nre Musha Cay Litigation, 330 F.

Defendants’ pending motion “does not affect” this Court’s   \n2  pretrial jurisdiction.  MDL Rule 2.1(d).   \n3  Next, Defendants argue a stay should be granted because the government “is   \n4  coordinating [CBP’s] search for records responsive to all of the requests” filed by   \n5  ACLU affiliates in this and other FOIA actions around the country.  Motion at 4.    \n6  While Defendants are certainly free to coordinate their efforts from “CBP’s   \n7  headquarters in Washington, DC,” id., doing so will not result in any particular   \n8  judicial efficiencies.  Again, ACLU’s FOIA request in this case seeks records held   \n9  by CBP employees in the Los Angeles Field Office, related to implementation of the   \n10  Executive Order at Los Angeles International Airport, McCarran International   \n11  Airport and the other ports of entry under that field office’s control; records held at   \n \nP\nL\n12  “CBP Headquarters” were expressly excluded from the request at issue in this case.    \nL\n \nE\nN 13  Compl. Ex. A, at p. 10.  Transfer thus will not obviate the need for Defendants to   \nI\nA\nM 14  account in this litigation for the records held (or withheld) by CBP in Los Angeles   \nE\nR 15  or Nevada, or the search for such records conducted in the Los Angeles Field Office.    \nT\n \nT\n16  The requested stay will serve only to delay that accounting, and the public’s access   \nH\nG\nI 17  to these crucial records.   \nR\nW\n18  It is telling that the only specific “inefficiency” Defendants identify is that   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  “[a]bsent a stay, Plaintiffs may ask the Court to set a schedule for Defendants’   \nA\nD\n20  search for, and potential release of, responsive information.”  Motion at 4.  This   \n21  argument is problematic, for several reasons.  First, CBP’s concern that the court   \n22  might “set a schedule” to begin searching for records is a tacit admission that   \n23  Defendants have not yet done so – which would be a violation of their statutory   \n24  obligation to process ACLU’s FOIA request promptly.  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i),   \n25  (E)(i).  A government agency should not be permitted to use a litigation stay to   \n26  justify evasion of its basic FOIA obligations.  Second, Plaintiffs have not yet asked   \n27  the Court to set a schedule; granting a stay on that basis would, at best, be   \n28  premature.  Third, were the Court to set such a schedule, it would not be a waste of   \n  13 \n   \nOPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \nCase No. 2:17-cv-2778 BRO (ASx) \n   \n4835-7015-4313v.6 0201195-000002 \n   \n\n    \nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 20   Filed 06/05/17   Page 20 of 22   Page ID #:210\n     \n1  judicial resources because it would only affect the FOIA request at issue in this case   \n2  – which, again, only applies to local records.   \n3  Similarly, any other litigation activity likely to occur in this case before the   \n4  MDL motion is decided – such as answering the Complaint and conferring on a joint   \n5  discovery plan – would not be wasted effort even if this case were transferred by the   \n6  JPML.  As noted above, these activities likely will impose little burden on the   \n7  parties, and even less (if any) on this Court.  Given that the Court has not been asked   \n8  to decide any motion (other than this one) or intervene in any discovery dispute   \n9  (again, discovery has yet to begin), Defendants’ request for a blanket stay is patently   \n10  overbroad.  In light of the prejudicial delay in public access that would result from a   \n11  stay, and the absence of any meaningful efficiencies to be achieved, the stay sought   \n \nP\nL\n12  by Defendants is unwarranted.   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  IV.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the   \n3  American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada (collectively, “Plaintiffs” or “ACLU”)   \n4  bring this action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552 et   \n5  seq., as amended, to obtain injunctive and other appropriate relief requiring   \n6  Defendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and U.S. Customs and   \n7  Border Protection (“CBP”) (collectively, “Defendants”) to respond to a FOIA   \n8  request sent by Plaintiffs on February 2, 2017 (“Request”), and to promptly disclose   \n9  the requested records.     \n10  2.  The Request seeks records concerning CBP’s local implementation of   \n11  President Trump’s January 27, 2017 Executive Order titled “Protecting the Nation   \n \nP\nL\n12  From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States,” Exec. Order No. 13769, 82   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  Fed. Reg. 8977 (Feb. 1, 2017) (“Executive Order No. 1”), as well as any other   \nI\nA\nM 14  judicial order or executive directive issued regarding Executive Order No.1,   \nE\nR 15  including President Trump’s March 6, 2017 Executive Order, identically titled,   \nT\n \nT\n16  Exec. Order No. 13780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13209 (Mar. 6, 2017) (“Executive Order No.   \nH\nG\nI 17  2”) (collectively, “Executive Orders”).  A true and correct copy of the Request is   \nR\nW\n18  attached as Exhibit A.   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  3.  Specifically, the Request seeks records concerning CBP’s local   \nA\nD\n20  implementation of the Executive Orders at sites within the purview of CBP’s Los   \n21  Angeles Field Office. These include Los Angeles International Airport and   \n22  McCarran International Airport (“Local International Airports”) and the Las Vegas   \n23  and Los Angeles ports of entry (“Local Ports of Entry”).   \n24  4.  Among other things, the Executive Orders purport to halt refugee   \n25  admissions and bar entrants from several predominantly Muslim countries from   \n26  entering the United States.     \n27  5.  Defendants’ implementation of the Executive Orders has been the   \n28  subject of significant public concern, as reflected by mass protests around the   \n   \n  2 \nFOIA COMPLAINT \n   \n4825-3945-4278v.1 0050033-000045 \n   \n\n    \nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 1   Filed 04/12/17   Page 3 of 41   Page ID #:3\n     \n1  country, substantial news coverage, and numerous lawsuits filed following the   \n2  President’s signing of each Executive Order.    \n3  6.  Over the weekend of January 27–29, 2017, at least five lawsuits   \n4  resulted in emergency court orders enjoining implementation of various sections of   \n5  Executive Order No. 1.1 On March 15, 2017, a district court enjoined   \n6  implementation of Sections 2 and 6 of Executive Order No. 2.2    \n7  7.  News reports described Defendants’ implementation of the Executive   \n8  Orders as “chaotic” and “total[ly] lack[ing] . . . clarity and direction.”3   \n9  8.  Official DHS statements reflected this confusion. For example, DHS   \n10  stated on January 28 that Executive Order No. 1 would “bar green card holders.”4   \n11  The next day, however, DHS Secretary John Kelly deemed “the entry of lawful   \n \nP\nL 12  permanent residents to be in the national interest”5 and the government clarified that   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  Executive Order No. 1 did not apply to green card holders.6   \nI\nA\nM 14  9.  Reportedly spurred by this chaos, on January 29, Senators Tammy   \nE\nR 15  Duckworth and Dick Durbin called upon the Office of the Inspector General of the   \nT\n \nT\n16   \nH\nG                                                  \nRI 17  1 Vayeghan v.

In   \n7  response, the Inspector General directed Defendants’ personnel to preserve all   \n8  records “that might reasonably lead to the discovery of relevant information relating   \n9  the implementation of” Executive Order No. 1.8   \n10  10.  Upon information and belief, the January 27, 2017 Executive Order   \n11  resulted in at least dozens of individuals being detained at Los Angeles International   \n \nP\nL\n12  Airport in the days immediately following Executive Order No. 1.  The exact   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  number is unknown.  Upon information and belief, among those detained were (1) a   \nI\nA\nM 14  lawful permanent resident from Iran who was scheduled to be sworn in as a U.S.   \nE\nR 15  citizen in February, and who was traveling with her U.S. citizen infant son; (2) an   \nT\n \nT\n16  Iranian citizen with a valid U.S. student visa, whom CBP removed from the country   \nH\nG\nI 17  nearly two hours after a federal judge had ordered the government to halt all   \nR\nW\n18  removals immediately; and (3) an Iranian citizen with a valid U.S. visa that had been   \n \nS\nI\nV 19  granted as a result of a petition filed by his U.S. citizen son.9  Additionally, upon   \nA\nD\n20  information and belief, an 80-year-old insulin-dependent Iranian diabetic with a   \n21  heart condition was detained with her husband for nearly twenty-four hours after the   \n22   \n                                                 \n7 See Ryan Devereaux et al., Homeland Security Inspector General Opens \n23   \nInvestigation of Muslim Ban, Orders Document Preservation, THE INTERCEPT, Feb. \n1, 2017, available at https://theintercept.com/2017/02/01/homeland-security-\n24   \ninspector-general-opens-investigation-of-muslim-ban-rollout-orders-document-\npreservation/. \n25  8 Id.   \n9 See Kate Mather, California student, who was detained 23 hours at LAX and then \n26   \ndeported, returns to U.S., LOS ANGELES TIMES, Feb. 5, 2017, available at \nhttp://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sara-yarjani-returns-20170205-\n27   \nstory.html; see also Jennifer Medina, He Was Sent Back to Iran.

By  Sunday,  January  29,  2017,  the  peaceful  protestors  gathered  at  Los   \n6  Angeles International Airport numbered in the thousands.11    \n7  12.  Upon  information  and  belief,  several  individuals  were  held  for   \n8  secondary  questioning  for  unreasonable  lengths  of  time  by  CBP  at  McCarran   \n9  International Airport as a result of the January 27, 2017 Executive Order.12 For   \n10  example, on  January  28, 2017, one  elderly  wheel-chair  bound  couple of  Syrian   \n11  descent was held by CBP for several hours, despite the fact that they were both   \n \nP\nL\n12  lawful permanent residents of the United States.    \nL\n \nE\nN 13  13.

On February 2, 2017, Plaintiffs sent the Request to CBP’s Los Angeles   \n5  Field Office and CBP’s FOIA Officer at CBP Headquarters via certified, trackable   \n6  mail.  The Request to CBP Headquarters was sent with USPS tracking number 7016   \n7  0910 0001 4693 3598.  See Exhibit B-1.  The Request to CBP’s Los Angeles Field   \n8  Office was sent with a USPS tracking number of 7016 0910 0001 4693 3581.  See   \n9  Exhibit B-2.     \n10  23.  The Request sought copies of CBP’s local interpretation and   \n11  enforcement of the Executive Order at: 1) certain airports specified in the Request,   \n \nP\nL\n12  including Los Angeles International Airport and McCarran International Airport   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  (“Local International Airports”); and 2) certain Port of Entry offices specified in the   \nI\nA\nM 14  Request, including Los Angeles Port of Entry Office and Las Vegas Port of Entry   \nE\nR 15  Office (“Local Ports of Entry”).  The Request expressly did not seek information   \nT\n \nT\n16  held in the records of CBP Headquarters.     \nH\nG\nI 17  24.  Specifically, the Request sought the following:    \nR\nW\n18  1.  “Records created on or after January 27, 2017 concerning CBP’s   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  interpretation, enforcement, and implementation of the following at   \nA\nD\n20  Local International Airports:    \n21  a.

A at 6–10.   \n3  25.  The Request included an application for expedited processing, on the   \n4  grounds that there is a “compelling need” for these records under 5 U.S.C. §   \n5  552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II) because the information requested is “urgen[tly]” needed by an   \n6  organization primarily engaged in disseminating information “to inform the public   \n7  concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.” Exh. A at 11.   \n8  26.  The Request provided detail showing that the ACLU is primarily   \n9  engaged in disseminating information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. §   \n10  552(a)(6)(E)(v), given that a critical and substantial aspect of the ACLU’s mission is   \n11  to obtain information about government activity, analyze that information, and   \n \nP\nL\n12  publish and disseminate that information widely to the press and public. Exh. A at   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  11–12.   \nI\nA\nM 14  27.  The Request described examples of the ACLU’s information-  \nE\nR 15  dissemination function.  Exh. A at 12–13.   \nT\n \nT\n16  28.  The Request also included an application for a fee waiver or limitation   \nH\nG\nI 17  under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) on the grounds that disclosure of the requested   \nR\nW\n18  records is in the public interest and is “likely to contribute significantly to public   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily   \nA\nD\n20  in the commercial interest of the requester.”  In particular, the ACLU emphasized   \n21  that the Request would significantly contribute to public understanding on a matter   \n22  of profound public importance about which scant specific information had been   \n23  made public, i.e., how local CBP Field Offices had enforced, and continue to   \n24  enforce, the Executive Orders. The Request also made clear that the ACLU plans to   \n25                                                     \n24 The following footnote was included for reference: “Protecting the Nation from \n26  Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER   \nPROTECTION (Jan. 31, 2017), available at https://www.cbp.gov/border-\n27  security/protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states (‘The Executive   \nOrder and the instructions therein were effective at the time of the order’s signing. \n28  Guidance was provided to DHS field personnel shortly thereafter.’) (emphasis   \nadded).” \n   \n  11 \nFOIA COMPLAINT \n   \n4825-3945-4278v.1 0050033-000045 \n   \n\n    \nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 1   Filed 04/12/17   Page 12 of 41   Page ID #:12\n     \n1  disseminate the information disclosed as a result of the Request to the public at no   \n2  cost. Exh. A at 16.   \n3  29.  The Request also applied for a waiver of search fees under 5 U.S.C.   \n4  § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) on the grounds that Plaintiffs qualify as “representatives of the   \n5  news media” and the records are not sought for commercial use, given the ACLU’s   \n6  non-profit mission and substantial activities to publish information for dissemination   \n7  to the public, as discussed in greater detail in ¶ 27 above. Exh. A at 17–18.   \n8  30.  The FOIA Division at CBP Headquarters in Washington, D.C. received   \n9  the Request on February 6, 2017. See Exhibit B-1. CBP’s Los Angeles Field Office   \n10  received the Request on February 7, 2017. See Exhibit B-2.   \n11  31.  To date, CBP has not acknowledged receipt of the Request.   \n \nP\nL\n12  32.  As of April 12, 2017, more than 20 days (excepting Saturdays,   \nL\n \nE\nN 13  Sundays, and legal public holidays) have elapsed since CBP received the Request.   \nI\nA\nM 14  33.  As of the filing date of this Complaint, Defendants have not notified   \nE\nR 15  Plaintiffs of a determination as to whether Defendants will comply with the Request.   \nT\n \nT\n16  34.  Because Defendants failed to comply with the 20-business-day time   \nH\nG\nI 17  limit provision of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i), Plaintiffs are deemed to have   \nR\nW\n18  exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to the Request under 5 U.S.C.   \n \nS\nI\nV\n19  § 552(a)(6)(C)(i).   \nA\nD Violation of FOIA for Failure  \n20   \nto Provide a Determination  \n21  Within 20 Business Days   \n22  35.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in paragraphs 1   \n23  through 34 above, inclusive.   \n24  36.  Defendants have a legal duty under FOIA to determine whether to   \n25  comply with a request within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal   \n26  public holidays) after receiving the request, and also have a legal duty to   \n27  immediately notify a requester of the agency’s determination and the reasons   \n28  therefor.   \n   \n  12 \nFOIA COMPLAINT \n   \n4825-3945-4278v.1 0050033-000045 \n   \n\n    \nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 1   Filed 04/12/17   Page 13 of 41   Page ID #:13\n     \n1  37.

Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in paragraphs 1   \n7  through 34 above, inclusive.   \n8  39.  Plaintiffs have a legal right under FOIA to obtain the specific agency   \n9  records requested on February 2, 2017, and there exists no legal basis for   \n10  Defendants’ failure to promptly make the requested records available to Plaintiffs,   \n11  their members, and the public.    \n \nP\nL 12  40.

Defendants’ failure determine whether to provide expedited processing   \n26  and to provide notice of that determination to Plaintiffs within 10 days after the date   \n27  of the Request violates FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I), and applicable   \n28  regulations promulgated thereunder.   \n   \n  13 \nFOIA COMPLAINT \n   \n4825-3945-4278v.1 0050033-000045 \n   \n\n    \nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 1   Filed 04/12/17   Page 14 of 41   Page ID #:14\n     \n1  45.

Each FOIA request at issue asks CBP to search one of its field offices \n6  (and corresponding airports and/or ports of entry) for identical or similar categories \n7  of records about the implementation of Executive Order 13769, “Protecting the \n8  Nation from Terrorist Entry Into the United States,” 82 Fed. Reg. 8977 (Jan. 27, \n9  2017).   \n10  The cases are ACLU of Northern California, et al. v. DHS, et al., No. 17-cv-\n11  1970 (N.D. Cal. filed Apr. 10, 2017); ACLU of Virginia, et al. v. DHS, et al., No. \n12  17-cv-441 (E.D. Va. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of Georgia, Inc., et al. v. DHS, et \n13  al., No. 17-cv-1309 (N.D. Ga. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of Illinois, et al. v. DHS, \n14  et al., No. 17-cv-2768 (N.D. Ill. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of Florida v. DHS, et \n15  al., No. 17-cv-21382 (S.D. Fla. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of Maine, et al. v. \n16  CBP, et al., No. 17-cv-132 (D. Me. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of Washington, et \n17  al. v. DHS, et al., No. 17-cv-562 (W.D. Wash. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of \n18  Arizona v. DHS, et al., No. 17-cv-1083 (D. Ariz. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of \n19  Southern California, et al. v. DHS, et al., No. 17-cv-2778 (C.D. Cal. filed Apr. 12, \n20  2017); ACLU of Oregon, et al. v. DHS, et al., No. 17-cv-575 (D. Or. filed Apr. 12, \n21  2017); ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Cnties. v. DHS, et al., No. 17-cv-733 (S.D. \n22  Cal. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU Found. of Texas, Inc. v. CBP, et al., No. 17-cv-\n23  1128 (S.D. Tex. filed Apr. 12, 2017); ACLU of Michigan v. DHS, et al., No. 17-cv-\n24  11149 (E.D. Mich. filed Apr. 12, 2017). \n25  On May 8, 2017, Defendants filed a motion with the JPML pursuant to 28 \n26  U.S.C. § 1407 to transfer all of the ACLU affiliates’ pending FOIA cases relating \n27  to Executive Order 13769 to the United States District Court for the District of \n28  Columbia.  Copies of Defendants’ transfer motion, the supporting memorandum, \n \nDefs.’ Mot. to Stay Proceedings     - 1 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 18   Filed 05/17/17   Page 5 of 10   Page ID #:155\n \n1  and the schedule of related actions have been served on the Clerk of this Court and \n2  are attached as exhibits to the Notice filed with this Court by Defendants on May \n3  8, 2017.  As explained more fully in Defendants’ memorandum in support of their \n4  transfer motion, the JPML previously has centralized multidistrict FOIA litigation \n5  in substantially similar circumstances, and transfer is likely here. \n6  Although the JPML has not yet scheduled a hearing on Defendants’ transfer \n7  motion, Defendants anticipate that the JPML will hear argument on the motion on \n8  July 27, 2017, and rule on the motion shortly thereafter.   \n9  Defendants respectfully request that the Court temporarily stay proceedings in \n10  this action while the JPML considers Defendants’ motion to coordinate the \n11  handling of these cases.  This brief stay would relieve the parties and the judiciary \n12  of the burdens associated with duplicative pretrial proceedings in thirteen separate \n13  cases that raise identical or highly related issues, would prevent conflicting pretrial \n14  rulings, and would not prejudice Plaintiffs in this action.  Courts typically impose \n15  stays while motions are pending before the JPML, Rivers v. Walt Disney Co., 980 \n16  F. Supp. 1358, 1362 (C.D. Cal. 1997), and for the reasons set forth, it is \n17  appropriate for this Court to do so here as well.   \n18  ARGUMENT \n19    It is axiomatic that “the power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power \n20  inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with \n21  economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel and for litigants.”  Landis v. N. \n22  Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936).  Courts routinely exercise their power to \n23  stay proceedings pending a decision on a motion before the JPML to transfer cases \n24  for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.  See Rivers, 980 F. Supp. at \n25  1362 (“[A] majority of courts have concluded that it is often appropriate to stay \n26  preliminary pretrial proceedings while a motion to transfer and consolidate is \n27  pending with the [JPML].”); see also Cooper v. Siddighi, No. EDCV 13-00345 \n28  JGB (SPx), 2013 WL 12140988, at *4 (C.D. Cal. May 8, 2013) (collecting \n \nDefs.’ Mot. to Stay Proceedings     - 2 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 18   Filed 05/17/17   Page 6 of 10   Page ID #:156\n \n1  cases); Good v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 5 F. Supp. 2d 804, 809 (N.D. Cal. \n2  1998) (courts “frequently grant stays pending a decision by the [JPML]”); see also \n3  David F. Herr, “Multidistrict Litigation Manual:  Practicing Before the Judicial \n4  Panel on Multidistrict Litigation” § 3:15 at 32 (“District courts . . . readily stay[] \n5  proceedings pending a Panel decision.”). \n6    Courts look to several factors when determining whether to issue a stay of \n7  proceedings pending the JPML’s decision, including whether judicial economy \n8  would be served by avoiding duplicative litigation, the burden on the moving party \n9  if the action is not stayed, and any potential prejudice to the non-moving party.  \n10  See Rivers, 980 F. Supp. at 1360; see also Douglas v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., \n11  No. 13-cv-2331, 2013 WL 4013901, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 5, 2013).  A stay of \n12  proceedings, for the sole purpose and duration necessary for the JPML to decide \n13  Defendants’ motion, satisfies each of these factors. \n \n14 \nA.  Judicial Economy Requires a Stay Pending a Decision by the \n15  JPML \n16  Staying the proceedings in this action would further judicial economy by \n17  avoiding the need for multiple courts to deal with the same or similar pretrial \n18  issues.  Courts typically grant temporary stays pending motions to transfer to the \n19  JPML where, like here, doing so would relieve the parties and the courts from \n20  engaging in simultaneous and duplicative pretrial proceedings.  See Rivers, 980 F. \n21  Supp. at 1360 (stay warranted in interest of judicial economy to ensure court from \n22  “needlessly expend[ing] its energies familiarizing itself with the intricacies of a \n23  case that would be heard by another judge”); Freitas v. McKesson Corp., No. C \n24  11-05967, 2012 WL 161211, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2012) (“[G]ranting a stay in \n25  this case would prevent the Court from needlessly duplicating work that will be \n26  done by the MDL transferee court . . . .”); Naegele v. Albers, 355 F. Supp. 2d 129, \n27  141 (D.D.C. 2005) (stating that “litigating essentially the same issues in two \n28  separate forums is not in the interest of judicial economy or in the parties’ best \n \nDefs.’ Mot. to Stay Proceedings     - 3 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 18   Filed 05/17/17   Page 7 of 10   Page ID #:157\n \n1  interests”). \n2  The thirteen related cases involve parallel FOIA requests, each of which seeks \n3  disclosure of similar or identical categories of records related to the \n4  implementation of Executive Order 13769 from different CBP field offices.  To \n5  ensure consistency in responding to the ACLU affiliates’ FOIA requests, CBP’s \n6  headquarters in Washington, DC is coordinating the agency’s search for records \n7  responsive to all of the requests at issue in the related actions, as well as its \n8  processing of responsive records for potential release.  Absent a stay, Plaintiffs \n9  may ask the Court to set a schedule for Defendants’ search for, and potential \n10  release of, responsive information.  Particularly because the ACLU affiliates have \n11  been coordinating their handling of these lawsuits, any pretrial proceedings \n12  regarding the production schedule would likely duplicate those before other courts \n13  in the related actions, and, if the JPML grants Defendants’ motion to transfer, any \n14  ruling by the Court could ultimately be vitiated by the transferee court. \n15  Given the early stage of the case and the status of Defendants’ processing of \n16  the ACLU affiliates’ FOIA requests, it is unlikely that any issues regarding the \n17  adequacy of CBP’s search, the appropriateness of CBP’s withholding of responsive \n18  information pursuant to the FOIA’s statutory exemptions, or the need for discovery \n19  will ripen for the Court’s consideration before the JMPL rules on Defendants’ \n20  transfer motion.  Nevertheless, were any of these issues to arise, they would \n21  substantially overlap in each of the related actions.  In a typical FOIA action, the \n22  defendant agency establishes its compliance with the requirements of the FOIA \n23  through declarations that set forth the procedures the agency followed in \n24  conducting its search and the basses for withholding responsive records.  See, \n25  e.g., Perry v. Block, 684 F.2d 121, 126 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (per curiam).  And \n26  although discovery is rare in FOIA cases, even when granted, it “is generally \n27  limited to the scope of the agency’s search and its indexing and classification \n28  procedures.”  Heily v. Dep’t of Commerce, 69 F. App’x 171, 174 (4th Cir. 2003) \n \nDefs.’ Mot. to Stay Proceedings     - 4 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 18   Filed 05/17/17   Page 8 of 10   Page ID #:158\n \n1  (per curiam).  Thus, because CBP headquarters is coordinating the responses to the \n2  ACLU affiliates’ FOIA requests, any pretrial proceedings that could arise in this \n3  Court regarding the adequacy of the agency’s searches, the application of the \n4  FOIA’s statutory exemptions, or requests for discovery would be duplicative in \n5  each of the related actions.  A temporary stay would avoid this needless use of \n6  judicial resources. \n7  B.  A Stay Is Necessary to Avoid Hardship to Defendants \n8  Moving forward with the proceedings in this case would not only frustrate \n9  judicial economy, it would also prejudice Defendants.  Defendants would be \n10  required to engage in simultaneous and duplicative pretrial practice, including \n11  responding to thirteen separate complaints that are materially identical.  \n12  See Cooper, 2013 WL 12140988, at *4 (defendant would suffer “significant \n13  hardship” if “various plaintiffs are allowed to proceed against [it] in different \n14  forums” and “force[ defendant] to re-argue the same issues”); Wilbanks v. Merck & \n15  Co., No. 05-1241, 2005 WL 2234071, at *2 (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 13, 2005) (granting \n16  stay and stating that “in absence of a stay, the risk to [defendant] of duplicative \n17  motions and discovery is significant”). \n18  Moreover, moving forward could also result in rulings on pretrial issues that \n19  conflict with those of other districts or of the transferee court if the JPML grants \n20  the transfer motion.  See C.A. ex rel. Allen v. Pfizer, Inc., No. C 13-4087, 2013 WL \n21  6091766, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2013) (recognizing that absent stay, defendants \n22  may be required to relitigate issues decided by transferor court before MDL \n23  panel); Namovicz v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 225 F. Supp. 2d 582, 585 (D. Md. \n24  2001) (staying proceedings pending decision by JPML to consolidate cases \n25  because it is “necessary to ensure that, in the event consolidation of all cases for \n26  pre-trial is ordered, there is consistent treatment of the numerous lawsuits”).

Plaintiffs Would Not Be Prejudiced by the Stay \n7  Plaintiffs would not be prejudiced by the limited stay that Defendants have \n8  requested.  This action is in the early stages of litigation, and Defendants have not \n9  yet responded to the Complaint.  See Davis v. Pfizer, Inc., No. C 14-1204, 2014 \n10  WL 1599005, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2014) (finding no prejudice to plaintiff \n11  where the case was in the “very early procedural stage”).  Defendants anticipate \n12  that the JPML will hold argument on Defendants’ motion on July 27, 2017 and will \n13  rule on it shortly thereafter, and therefore the stay would likely be of limited \n14  duration.

Defendants will continue to \n26  compile and review records during the pendency of any stay.  As a result, a \n27  temporary stay until the JPML renders its decision should not significantly delay \n28  the eventual release of responsive records to the public. \n \nDefs.’ Mot. to Stay Proceedings     - 6 - \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02778-BRO-AS   Document 18   Filed 05/17/17   Page 10 of 10   Page ID #:160\n \n1   \n2  CONCLUSION \n3    For the reasons set forth above, this Court should grant Defendants’ request \n4  for a stay of proceedings.  \n5  Dated: May 17, 2017      Respectfully submitted, \n \n6  CHAD A.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security et al\nORDER DENYING TRANSFER\nBefore the Panel:* Defendants, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S.\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP),1 move to centralize thirteen Freedom of Information Act\n(FOIA) actions in the District of District of Columbia.  The actions, which are pending in thirteen\ndistricts, are listed on the attached Schedule A.\nPlaintiffs, which are various affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union, oppose\ncentralization.  If the Panel grants the Section 1407 motion over their objections, plaintiffs ask that\nthe action in the Eastern District of Michigan be excluded, and that the litigation be centralized in\nthe Eastern District of Virginia or, alternatively, in the District of Maine or the Western District of\nWashington.   \nOn the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we deny Defendants’ motion. \nThe actions arguably share a limited number of factual issues arising out of FOIA requests made by\nplaintiffs for records concerning CBP’s interpretation and implementation – at local international\nairports and, in the Eastern District of Michigan case, U.S./Canada border crossings – of the January\n27, 2017, Executive Order No. 13769, titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry\nInto the United States,” as well as any judicial order or executive directive issued regarding the\nExecutive Order.  But these factual issues, which principally concern the adequacy of CBP’s\nsearches for the requested records, as well as CBP’s coordination of the searches by its Washington,\nD.C., headquarters, appear relatively straightforward and unlikely to entail extensive pretrial\nproceedings. See Riccardi v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 32 F. Supp. 3d 59, 63 (D.D.C. 2014) (“In a FOIA\ncase, where the adequacy of an agency’s search is questioned, the Court may grant summary\njudgment based on information provided in ‘[a] reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the search\nterms and the type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive\nmaterials (if such records exist) were searched.’”) (quoting Valencia–Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard,\n180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C. Cir.1999)).  Indeed, as Defendants acknowledge, these actions probably will\nnot involve any discovery.  See Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. for Transfer, at 16 n.8 (ECF No. 1-1)\n*  Judge Marjorie O. Rendell took no part in the decision of this matter.\n1  CBP is a component of DHS.\n\nCase 2:17-cvC-0a2s7e7 M8-DBLR NOo-A. 2S7  8 D6 o  cDuomceunmt e2n8t   8 F8i l e Fdi l0e8d/ 0038//1072 / 1 P7a  g Pea 2g eo f2 5 o  f  P5age ID #:288\n-2-\n(“In the unlikely event that discovery is authorized in these Related Actions, Defendants anticipate\nthat CBP witnesses would be located in Washington, DC, while Plaintiffs would not have any\nwitnesses of their own.”); see also, e.g., Justice v. I.R.S., 798 F. Supp. 2d 43, 47 (D.D.C. 2011)\n(noting that in FOIA actions, discovery is “disfavored”).2\nDefendants also contend that common factual questions will inform any review of CBP’s\ndeterminations to withhold information from disclosure pursuant to FOIA’s statutory exemptions.\nThis argument is unconvincing, because the application of those exemptions is a legal issue.  See,\ne.g., Trentadue v. Integrity Comm., 501 F.3d 1215, 1226 (10th Cir. 2007) (“Whether a FOIA\nexemption justifies withholding a record is a question of law that we review de novo.”); see also Am.\nMgmt. Servs., LLC v. Dep’t of the Army, 703 F.3d 724, 729 (4th Cir. 2013) (same).\nAlthough defendants heavily rely on the Panel’s 1992 decision in MDL No. 910, In re:\nFreedom Magazine/Internal Revenue Service FOIA Litigation, and its 1991 decision in MDL No.\n892, In re: Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization/Internal Revenue Service FOIA\nLitigation, those decisions are in at least some tension with more recent Panel precedent.  E.g., In\nre: Clean Water Rule: Definition of “Waters of the United States,” 140 F. Supp. 3d 1340, 1341\n(J.P.M.L. 2015) (denying federal government defendants’ motion for centralization of nine actions\npending in seven districts involving challenges to EPA rule, where resolution of the actions would\n“involve only very limited pretrial proceedings,” and discovery, if any, would be “minimal”). \nMoreover, the decisions are distinguishable.  In Freedom Magazine, the eight cases were filed by\na single plaintiff, which specifically sought records located at the IRS’s  Washington, D.C.\nheadquarters.  See Freedom Magazine Transfer Order at 2 (J.P.M.L. Feb. 12, 1992) (unpublished). \nAnd, in Church of Scientology, “every FOIA request in the litigation was made upon the IRS office\nin Jacksonville in [the Middle District of Florida, where the cases were centralized],” and related\nlitigation was pending in that district.  See Church of Scientology Transfer Order at 2 (J.P.M.L.. Sept.\n4, 1991) (unpublished).  Here, the actions are brought by separate plaintiffs (albeit all ACLU\naffiliates), and each FOIA request targets a different CBP field office.\nDefendants also argue that centralization would reduce litigation costs.  They represent,\nwithout contradiction, that it was unnecessary for the ACLU plaintiffs to submit a separate FOIA\nrequest for each CBP field office, and that the national ACLU, or the various affiliates acting\ntogether, simply could have sent CBP headquarters a single FOIA request asking the agency to\nsearch the same field offices for the same records covered by the multiple requests.  But, the\npotential for litigation cost savings, without more, does not warrant centralization, particularly\nwhere, as here, there is little likelihood of complex pretrial proceedings.\n2  In the unlikely event that these cases actually involve a significant amount of duplicative\npretrial discovery, Defendants are free to file another motion for centralization.\n\nCase 2:17-cvC-0a2s7e7 M8-DBLR NOo-A. 2S7  8 D6 o  cDuomceunmt e2n8t   8 F8i l e Fdi l0e8d/ 0038//1072 / 1 P7a  g Pea 3g eo f3 5 o  f  P5age ID #:289\n-3-\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion for centralization of these actions is denied.\n PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION\n                                                                             \n    Sarah S.
