Whether DOJ reviewed the EO before it was issued;</p>\r\n<p>2. Whether the EO was transmitted to DOJ for review, comment, or awareness;</p>\r\n<p>3. Whether there was any decision to seek or not seek input from DOJ on creating or implementing the EO;</p>\r\n<p>4. Whether there was any process to obtain DOJ review of the EO;</p>\r\n<p>5. Whether any other federal agency personnel reviewed the EO before it was issued.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint further alleged that, to date, plaintiff had not received a substantive response from DOJ. Plaintiff sought a disclosure order under FOIA and sought legal fees.</p>\r\n<p>The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and was assigned to Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, plaintiff filed another, similar, FOIA lawsuit against the Office of Management and Budget, described <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. On June 9, DOJ filed an unopposed motion to consolidate the two cases; Judge Howell granted the motion on June 12. The case was re-assigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta on June 15.

This request is submitted in consort with the organization’s mission to \ngather and dissimilate information that is likely to contribute significantly to the public \nunderstanding of executive branch operations and activities. The Protect Democracy \nProject has no commercial interest, and releasing the contents of the requested documents \nfor public consumption is not in the financial interest of the organization. \nIn addition to satisfying requirements for a waiver of fees associated with the \nsearch and processing of records, The Protect Democracy Project is entitled to a waiver \nin duplication costs. Federal law mandates a waiver of document duplication costs for \nrequesters that qualify as a representative of the news media. The Protect Democracy \nProject, a new organization formed in December 2016, emerges in the tradition of \n501(c)(3) good government organizations that qualify under FOIA as “news media \norganizations.” Like these organizations, the purpose of The Protect Democracy Project \nis to “gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, use its editorial \nskills to turn the raw materials into distinct work, and distribute that work to an audience.” \nCf National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. \nPO Box 170521, Brooklyn, New York 11217 \nFOIA.protectdemocracy@gmail.com \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00815-BAH   Document 1-1   Filed 05/02/17   Page 3 of 4\n1989). We intend to give the public access to documents transmitted via FOIA on our \nforthcoming website, www.protectdemocracyproject.org.   \nRESPONSIVE RECORDS \n  We ask that all types of records and all record systems be searched to discover \nrecords responsive to our request. We seek records in all medium and format. This \nincludes, but is not limited to: agendas, manifests, calendars, schedules, notes, and any \nprepared documentation for meetings, calls, tele-conferences, or otherwise discussions \nresponsive to our request; voicemails; e-mails; e-mail attachments; talking points; faxes; \nfacsimiles; training documents and guides; table of contents and content of binders; \ndocuments pertaining to instruction and coordination of couriers; and any other \npreservation of work product. We ask that you search all system of record, including \nelectronic, in use at your agency. The Protect Democracy Project would prefer records in \nelectronic format, saved as PDF documents, and transmitted via email or CD-rom. \n  If you make a determination that any responsive record, or any segment within a \nrecord, is exempt from disclosure, we ask that you provide an index of those records at \nthe time you transmit all other responsive records. In the index, please include a \ndescription of the record and the reason for exclusion with respect to each individual \nexempt record or exempt portion of a record, as provided by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d \n820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). When you deem a portion of a \nrecord exempt, we ask for the remainder of the record to be provided. 5 U.S.C. 552(b). \n  Given the 20-day statutory deadline, we hope to be as helpful as possible in \nclarifying or answering questions about our request. Please contact us at \nFOIA.protectdemocracy@gmail.com or (404) 819-1630 if you require any additional \nPO Box 170521, Brooklyn, New York 11217 \nFOIA.protectdemocracy@gmail.com \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00815-BAH   Document 1-1   Filed 05/02/17   Page 4 of 4\ninformation.
