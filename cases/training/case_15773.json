    "summary": "<p>On July 6, 2016, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York sent a report to the New York City Department of Corrections (DOC) detailing their investigation into the DOC’s compliance with the American Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. A prior investigation in 2004 had led to a Voluntary Compliance Agreement and the designation of an employee responsible for responding to requests from inmates and ensuring ADA-compliant living accommodation and training for staff. This investigation focused on the accessibility of the Rose M. Singer Center (RMSC), which housed female inmates with mobility impairments. The report also detailed DOC’s manner in responding to inmate’s accommodation requests. </p><p>An architect that was an expert in ADA-accessibility inspected RMSC, comparing its layout and infrastructure with the 1991 standards set forth by the ADA. The investigation concluded that the DOC failed to place inmates with mobility and visual impairments in accessible housing, to provide inmates with mobility impairments with appropriate mobility devices, and to ensure that inmates with hearing impairments had access to telecommunication services. The investigation revealed that the DOC did not consistently assess the needs of inmates with disabilities and often failed to place them in the limited accessible housing available. Canes and wheelchairs that were medically prescribed and intended to help alleviate symptoms from degenerative diseases were often confiscated and not returned, despite multiple requests. </p><p>The U.S. Attorney’s office reviewed the DOC’s policies and practices in receiving and responding to accommodation requests. The investigation also established that the DOC failed to respond to accommodation requests in an adequate and timely manner. Contrary to their policy, the investigation found that the DOC maintained no set system for recording or responding to inmate accessibility requests. While inmates had a right to file grievances, the complaints of disability discrimination were considered “non-grievable” there was no clear recourse for an inmate whose accessibility request was denied. </p><p>The investigation concluded that the DOC violated the ADA by denying inmates with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and benefit in the provided services, programs and activities. As a remedy for these violations, the U.S. Attorney General’s office recommended an eight-step plan to meet minimum ADA requirements. These included staff training, the creation and implementation of a tracking system for responding to accessibility requests—which would provide prompt and equitable resolutions for inmates with disabilities—a prompt medical evaluation of each inmate’s needs upon admission, placement of inmates in accessible housing, and provision of support aids and devices for inmates with hearing disabilities to effectively communicate with their family, friends, and counsel.</p><p>On August 20, 2018, the U.S. Attorney’s office reached an out-of-court settlement and a new Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the city of New York and the DOC. In this agreement, the DOC agreed to correct its many violations of the ADA and to submit bi-annual compliance reports to the U.S. Attorney’s office. Correcting these ADA violations included: completing hundreds of modifications to the existing physical infrastructure under the supervision of an independent architect to make RMSC ADA-compliant; the implementation of a new policy regarding how, and when, accommodation requests are received and responded to, including a computerized system that tracks all accommodation requests and their response; and the prompt furnishment of all reasonable support devices to ensure that inmates with disabilities have equal access to facilities, activities, and services available to non-disabled inmates. </p><p>The majority of the provisions of the agreement are set to terminate five years after the effective date, provided that the DOC is in substantial compliance with its provisions. The architectural changes and implementation and enforcement of the policy changes will terminate in seven years.</p>",

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District ofN  ew York \n86 Chambers Street \nNew l\"ork. New l\"ork  10007 \nJuly 6, 2016 \nBY EMAIL AND REGULAR MAIL \nNadene M. Pilmock \nDeputy General Counsel \nNew York City Department of Corrections \n75-20 Astoria Boulevard \nEast Elmhurst, NY 11370 \nRe:  Americans with Disabilities Act Investigation of \nNew York City Department of Conection \nDear Ms. Pinnock: \nAs you are aware, the United States Attomey's Office for the Southem District of \nNew York (the \"SONY\") has been conducting an investigation into whether the New \nYork City Department of CmTection (\"DOC\" or the \"Department\") complies with Title II \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., and \nthe Department of Justice's implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part 35.  We write to \nprovide you with a report setting forth our findings with respect to (i) the accessibility of \nthe area of Rose M. Singer Center (\"RMSC\") where DOC houses female inmates with \nmobility impahments and RMSC common areas used by these inmates; and (ii) the \nmanner in which DOC responds to accommodation requests submitted by or on behalf of \ndisabled inmates. We have previously provided you with reports setting forth our . \nfindings with respect to the accessibility of the North Infim1ary Command (\"NIC\") \nAnnex and the visiting areas of each ofDOC'sjails. \nI.  RMSC Accessibility \nIt is our understanding that the project to expand and renovate RMSC was \ncompleted in 2011, and that this project included the renovation of the area used to house \nfemale inmates with mobility impaim1ents.  Under the ADA, new construction or \nalterations commenced after July 26, 1992, but before September 15, 2010, must comply \nwith either UF AS or the 1991 ADA Standards of Accessible Design (\" 1991 ADA \nStandards\"), 28 C.F.R. Pmi 36, Appendix D.  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(1).  New \nconstruction or alterations commenced on or after September 15,2010, but before March \n15, 2012, must comply with either UF AS, the 1991 ADA Standards, or the 2010 ADA \nStandards for Accessible Design (\"2010 ADA Standards\").  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(2). \n\nNew construction or alterations commenced on or after March 15, 2012, must comply \nwith the 2010 ADA Standards.  28 C.F.R. § 35.15l(c)(3).  Finally, a conectional facility \nmust provide accessibility mobility features in at least 3% of its newly constructed or \naltered cells.  28 C.F.R. § 35.15l(k). \nThe findings with respect to the accessibility ofRMSC are based on the on-site \ninspection conducted by Mark J. Mazz, an architect specializing in ADA accessibility. \nExhibit A to this letter sets fmih the baniers that were identified during the inspection, as \nwell as the minimum steps that DOC must take to meet its legal obligations and remedy \nthe violations the SDNY has identified.  The 1991 ADA Standards were used to \ndetermine the accessibility ofRMSC.  Elements that are identified as not complying with \nthe requirements of the 1991 ADA Standards shallbe modified to comply with the \nconesponding provision of the 2010 ADA Standards, which are also included in \nExhibit A.  All ofthe standards and regulations are available at www.ada.gov. \nIf you have difficulty identifying the location of a specific batTier referenced, \nplease let us know and we can provide the conesponding photograph taken by Mr. Mazz. \nII.  Requests for Accommodations and Access to Services, Programs, and \nActivities \nTitle II ofthe ADA and its regulations impose a broad nondiscrimination mandate \nthat no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by a public entity. \n42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a).  The Title II regulations specifically prohibit \npublic entities that operate or manage jails from discriminating against individuals with \ndisabilities.  28 C.F .R. § 3 5 .152.  Public entities are required to afford individuals with \ndisabilities equal access to benefits and services provided, including at jails and \ncon·ectional facilities.  28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(l)(i), 35.152(b).  The Supreme Couti has \nexpressly held that the ADA's broad requirements apply to prisons and jails. \nPennsylvania Dep 't of Corrections v.  Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998).  The ADA imposes \nan affinnative obligation on public entities to \"make reasonable modifications in policies, \npractices, or procedures when modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the \nbasis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modification \nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\"  28 C.F.R. § \n35.1530(b)(7).  Public entities must \"furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services \nwhere necessary to afford individuals with disabilities  ... an equal opportunity to \npatiicipate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity of a public entity.\" \n28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(l).  In addition, public entities must \"adopt and publish grievance \nprocedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution\" of complaints alleging \nviolations of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations.  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.107(b). \nIn August 2004, DOC and the SDNY entered into a three-year Voluntary \nCompliance Agreement (\"VCA\") to resolve the SDNY's prior investigation into the \n2 \n\nagency's compliance with the ADA.  The VCA required DOC to designate an employee \nwho would be responsible for, among other things, processing, investigating, and \npromptly acting upon inmate requests for accommodations, ensuring that staff are \nadequately trained on ADA issues, and ensuring that imnates with disabilities are housed \nin facilities that are ADA-compliant and accommodate their disabilities.  VCA at § 1.2. \nThis individual is refened to as the Department's Disability Rights Coordinator for \nImnates (\"DRCI\").  The VCA also required DOC to adopt procedures for the prompt and \nequitable resolution of requests for accommodations and ADA-related complaints.  Id. at \n§ III.8.  Notwithstanding the VCA and resulting policy and procedure changes, our \nongoing investigation has revealed that the Department still fails to consistently ensure \nthat qualifying inmates ai·e not subject to unlawful discrimination on account of their \ndisability. \nAs pmi of our investigation, we reviewed the Depmiment's current policies and \ntraining concerning the ADA, as well as records relating to requests for accommodations1 \nsubmitted by or on behalf of imnates during the period 2012 through 2015.  We also \ninterviewed the DRCI, and reviewed infonnation conceming the availability of programs \nand services at different Depmiment facilities. \nSet forth below are the SONY's findings of fact and conclusions of law under \nTitle II of the ADA, as well as the minimum steps that DOC must take to meet its legal \nobligations and remedy the violations the SONY has identified.  In sum, we found that \nDOC fails to consistently:  (a) timely and adequately respond to accommodation requests; \n(b) place inmates with mobility and visual impairments in accessible housing areas; \n(c) provide imnates with mobility impailments with access to appropriate mobility \ndevices; and (d) ensure that hearing impaired inmates have equal access to \ntelecommunications services. \nA.  DOC Fails to Timely and Adequately Respond to Accommodation \nRequests. \nDOC frequently fails to timely and adequately respond to requests for \naccommodation submitted by or on behalf of inmates with disabilities, and does not \nconsistently comply with the requirements set forth in its own policies and procedures for \nevaluating and responding to ADA-related complaints.  Pursuant to DOC Directive 3802, \nimnates may submit requests for accommodation by completing Imnate Reasonable \nAccommodation Request (\"IRAR\") forms, which are to be made available in counseling \nservice units and law libraries.  Directive 3802, § V.C.l.  DOC is required to respond to \nsuch requests within five business days by either granting, denying, or modifying the \n1 Throughout this Letter of Findings, the tenn \"accommodations\" includes modifications \nto policies, practices, or procedures that are necessary \"to avoid discrimination on the \nbasis of disability,\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7),  as well as the provision of\"auxiliary aids \nand services where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities ... an equal \nopportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program or activity,\" \n28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(l). \n3 \n\nrequest.  !d.  § V. C.6.  If the determination is delayed, DOC must notify the inmate ofthe \ndelay and the reason for it.  !d.  § V.C.6.  In the event that a request is denied or modified, \nDOC is required to notify the inmate ofthe decision in writing, and such written response \nmust advise the inmate of his or her right to grieve the decision.  DOC is also obligated to \nmaintain a \"copy of all requests for accommodations, detenninations and \nacknowledgments of such determinations.\"  !d. § V.D. \nDOC does not respond to inmate requests for accommodation in a prompt \nmaimer, and certainly not within the 5-business day timeframe set forth in Directive \n3802.  We identified numerous instances where the DRCI repeatedly forwarded \ndisability-related complaints and inquiries to Deputy Wardens and other conections staff \nwithout receiving any response.  During her interview with our Office, the DRCI \nacknowledged that facility managers are sometimes unresponsive to her inquiries and that \nit can be challenging to ensure that appropriate accommodations are provided because \nshe does not have the authority to direct unformed staff to take specific actions.  Inmates \nand their representatives also have complained about the Department's unresponsiveness. \nFurthermore, the Department consistently fails to notify inmates or their representatives \nof the reasons for the delays, as is required by Directive 3802. \nThe Department also lacks an adequate system for recording and tracking \naccommodation requests, its responses to such requests, and the bases for its responses. \nWe asked the Department to produce all IRAR forms and any \"documentation \nconcerning how each IRAR was addressed and/or resolved by DOC.\"  However, many of \nthe tiles we received were sparse and contained no documentation reflecting the \nDepartment's detennination with respect to the inmate's request.  In addition, the \nDepmiment's production did not include any records whatsoever related to several \nrequests that The Legal Aid Society had submitted on behalf of inmates, further \ndemonstrating the Depa1iment's noncompliance with its own internal record-keeping \nrequirements.  As a result, we frequently could not detetmine with cetiainty whether \nrequests were ultimately granted or aenied.  In addition, the Department also does not \nconsistently notify the inmate, or his or her representative, of its dete1mination in writing, \nas is required by Directive 3802. \nMoreover, it is unclear what, if any, remedies an inmate has if the Department \ndenies or does not respond to his or her request for an accommodation.  Directive 3802 \nstates that an imnate has a right to file a grievance, Directive 3802, § V.C.l4, but DOC's \nGrievance Policy indicates that complaints of disability discrimination are considered \n\"non-grievable.\" \n4 \n\nB.  DOC Fails to Consistently Place Inmates with Mobility and Visual \nImpairments in Accessible Housing Areas. \nDOC has failed to consistently assess the needs of inmates with disabilities and \npromptly place them in accessible housing units with ready access to the programs, \nservices, and activities that are available to other non-disabled inmates.  Although \nDirective 3802 requires staff to notify the DRCI within 24 hours of the admission of any \nnew inmate who has or claims to have a disability, the cuiTent DRCI acknowledged that \nsuch notification is not always provided to her.  The Department has failed to place some \ninmates with mobility and visual impaitments in accessible housing upon their admission, \nand frequently does not grant their requests to be transfeiTed to more accessible areas \nduring their incarceration.  As a result, these inmates are denied equal access to programs \nand services. \nAs the Depmiment has conceded, the vast majority of its jails are not accessible to \npersons with disabilities and have significant structural barriers, such as split-level \ndesigns, inaccessible p1~ogram spaces, and inaccessible pathways to and from housing \nareas. The Depatiment has designated Dorm 3 of the NIC Annex (\"NIC Annex Dorm 3\") \n- a ground floor housing unit with approximately 40-45 beds-to be used for imnates \nwith mobility and visual impainnents.  The Department has added accessible features to \nNIC A1mex Dorm 3 in an effmi to make it ADA-compliant.2  Resources and services for \ninmates with visual impairments, including books on tape and screen readers, are also \navailable in NIC Annex Dorm 3.  According to DOC policy, male inmates who have a \n\"mobility impainnent and use wheelchairs, crutches, canes or walkers\" and/or \"have a \nvisual impailment that restricts their vision or has resulted in blindness\" are to be housed \nin NIC A1mex Dorm 3, provided that they do not \"need medical assistance for activities \nof daily living\" and \"can conduct personal bodily functions independently.\"  However, \nimnates meeting DOC's criteria have not been consistently placed in NIC Annex Dmm 3, \nand instead have remained in non-accessible facilities for lengthy periods of time. \nBased on ourreview of DOC records relating to accommodation requests, several \nimnates with disabilities have requested to be transfeiTed toNIC Am1ex Donn 3, or to be \nat least relocated to a floor in their assigned jail with ready access to programs and \nmedical services, and have either had their requests denied with little explanation or \nreceived no response at all.3  For example: \n•  In January 2014, a representative for inmate  , who \nwas housed in the Am1a M. Kross Center (\"AMK.C\"), \nrequested that Mr.   be hospitalized or transferred to the \n2 As noted in our prior report, the bathroom and bing cell in NIC A1mex Dorm 3 did not \nfully comply with the 1991 ADA standards as of our last on-site inspection. \n3 For purposes of this Letter of Findings, we assume that the Department did not respond \nto an inn1ate's accommodation request when there is no documentation in the file \nreflecting a response, since Directive 3802 requires copies of detenninations to be \nmaintained.  See Directive 3802, Section V.D. \n5 \n\nNIC infinnary due to multiple disabling conditions.  Several \nsimilar requests had been made on behalf of Mr.   dating \nback to as early 2012.  Mr.   repmiedly suffers from \nCharcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (an inherited neurological \ndisorder affecting motor and sensory nerves), left side \nparalysis, seizure disorder, incontinence, and asthma.  He also \nreportedly requires crutches to walk and uses braces for his \nwrist, back, and feet.  The DRCI forwarded the January 2014 \nrequest to a Captain and conveyed that she was \"most \nconcerned about mobility related difficulties of [Mr.  's] leg \nand arms, and [the] stated need for assistance with basic daily \nliving tasks.\"  The DRCI received no response for several \nmonths.  In October 2014, the Depmiment detennined that Mr. \n's condition did not warrant placement in the infirmary or \nNIC Annex Dorm 3, notwithstanding his mobility impaitment. \nInstead, Mr.   was moved to a lower-level dorm in another \njail where he could not navigate stairs to access services.  DOC \ntransferred Mr.   back to AMKC in December 2014. \n•  In April 2014, a representative for irunate   \nrequested that Mr.   be transferred toNIC Annex Dorm \n3 because he is legally blind.  Mr.  's left eye has been \nremoved, and he suffers fron1 degenerative conditions that \nsignificantly impair his vision in his right eye.  A two-line \nemail in the file states that Mr.  's request to be \ntransferred was denied after the inmate \"was seen by an \noptometrist.\"  Despite several follow-up requests and Mr. \n's well-documented visual impairment, Mr.   \nwas not placed in NIC Annex Dorm 3 until late 2015.  Mr. \n also requested a cane and a visor for his \nphotosensitivity, as well as other reasonable accommodations. \nHe submitted an IRAR, which was retumed to him in its \noriginal envelope, unopened, with a post-it stating \"NO CAN \nDO.\" \n•  In May 2015, a representative for irunate  , \nwho reportedly suffered a torn meniscus in his right knee, \nrequested that Mr.   be transfened from an upper level \nhousing area to a banier-free ground floor unit.  The inmate \nrepmied that his condition had been aggravated by several falls \ndown stairs.  The DRCI forwarded the email to the Deputy \nWarden of jail.  The records provided include no indication \nthat DOC responded to this inquiry or that the inmate was \nrelocated. \n6 \n\n•  Beginning in June 2015, representatives for inn1ate   \n, who reportedly had sustained injuries that limited his \nability ambulate after being attacked, repeatedly requested that \nMr.   be provided with a wheelchair and transfeiTed to \nNIC Annex Dorm 3.  Mr.   claimed that he had fallen, \nhit his head, and lost consciousness while trying to ambulate \nwith crutches, and was not able to access program services, \nincluding medical treatment, visitation, and religious services, \ndue to the many steps in his housing area.  According to Mr. \n, Bellevue Hospital had given him a prescription for a \nwheelchair.  In September 2015, the DRCI met with Mr. \n and observed that \"he currently has great difficulties \nmobilizing, both shmi and longer distances, with the one crutch \nhe is able to use.\"  The DRCI recommended that Mr.   \nbe furnished with a wheelchair and be considered for transfer \nto the NIC Annex.  The Depmiment neither provided Mr. \n with the requested wheelchair nor transfeiTed him to \nNIC Annex Dorm 3. \n•  In November 2015, a representative for inmate  , \nwho reportedly has clubbed feet which cause extreme back \npain and make it difficult for him to walk, complained that Mr. \n had been improperly denied a wheelchair and \nrequested that he be transferred from AMKC toNIC Annex \nDorm 3.  Mr.   had previously submitted a grievance \nrequesting reasonable accommodations for his disability. \nMedical staff authorized the use of crutches, but did not \nprovide Mr.   with a wheelchair.  The Depmiment did \nnot transfer Mr.   toNIC Atmex Donn 3, despite his \nmobility impairment and the fact that he seemingly met the \ncriteria for placement in that unit. \nC.  DOC Fails to Consistently Provide Inmates with Mobility Impairments \nwith Access to Appropriate Mobility Devices. \nDOC has failed to consistently and timely provide inmates with mobility \nimpairments with access to appropriate devices to meet their needs, such as wheelchairs, \ncanes, crutches, walkers, suppmiive footwear, braces, and other medically necessary \nequipment.  In addition, conections staff confiscate mobility devices without verifying \nwith medical staff whether inmates have a legitimate medical need for the devices.4  For \nexample: \n4 DOC often has failed to comply with Teletype Order No. HQ-1494-0, which addresses \nthe provision of assistive devices to inmates.  According to that Order, uniformed staff \nare only authorized to confiscate an assistive device if the irunate is observed using the \ndevice \"in a mam1er for which it is not intended.\"  In the event that a device is \n7 \n\n•  In January 2014, a representative for inmate  , \nwho reportedly has epileptic seizures and a degenerative hip \ncondition resulting in osteoarthritis, complained that Mr. \n's cane had been taken away and requested that it be \nreturned.  The records provided include no indication that DOC \nresponded to this inquiry or that the cane was returned. \n•  In January 2014, a representative for inmate  , who \nreportedly has back deformities, complained that staff had \nrefused to provide Mr.   with a walker, a cane, and a back \nbrace.  The records provided include no indication that the \ninmate was evaluated in response to this inquiry to determine \nwhether he needed an assistive device. \n•  In February 2014, a representative for inmate   \nwho reportedly has nerve damage to his ankle, claimed that Mr. \n's cane had been improperly seized.  The records \nprovided include no indication that DOC responded to this \ninquiry or that the cane was returned. \n•  In March 2015, a friend of inmate  , who \nrepotiedly used a wheelchair and had been housed in the NIC \ninfinnary since sustaining bilateral ankle fractures in March \n2014, complained that Mr.   was transfened to the \nGeorge R. Vierno Center (\"GRVC\") and denied a wheelchair \nin retaliation for filing a complaint regarding his medical \ntreatment.  At GRVC, Mr.   reportedly was forced to \ndrag himself across the floor using his hands and arms and was \ndenied access to various programs, including social and \nreligious services. The DRCI was advised not to take any \naction upon receipt of the complaint.  The records provided \nindicate that Mr.   was ultimately transferred to the West \nFacility as opposed to the NIC Annex, and there is no \nindication that the inmate was furnished with a wheelchair. \n•  In October 2015, imnate  , who repotiedly is a \nparaplegic and paralyzed from his waist down due to a gunshot \n. wound to his spinal cord, was discharged from the NIC \ninfirmary.  According to his wife and representative, DOC \nplaced Mr.   in upper tier housing at the Otis Bantum · \nCorrectional Center  (\"OBCC\") and confiscated his wheelchair. \nMr.   claimed that it was extremely difficult to walk with \nconfiscated due to alleged inappropriate usage, staff are required to escort the inmate \n\"immediately for re-evaluation oftheir status to possess the device.\" \n8 \n\nthe cane he was given and that he needed to climb several sets \nof stairs to access programs.  Mr.   also claimed that he \nwas handcuffed to a gurney and placed in isolation for four \ndays shmily after his aiTival at OBCC.  On November 9, 2015, \nthe DRCI emailed a Deputy Warden to inquire why Mr.   \nwas transfeiTed to OBCC \"where wheelchairs are not feasible.\" \nThe records provided include no indication that DOC \ntransferred Mr.   to an accessible housing area or replaced \nhis wheelchair, despite requests from Mr.  's \nrepresentatives. \n•  In November 2015, The Legal Aid Society advised DOC of a \nrepmi that staff had confiscated the canes of all inmates in a \nhousing area used for elderly inmates at the Robert D. Davoren \nCenter (\"RNDC\").  During her interview with our Office in \nlate January 2016, the DRCI advised us that she forwarded this \nemail to her supervisor but was unaware of what steps had \nbeen taken in response to this report. \nD.  DOC Fails to Consistently Ensure that Hearing Impaired Inmates Have \nEqual Access to Telecommunication Services. \nDOC has failed to ensure that all hearing impaired imnates have ready access to \ntelecommunication devices that afford them the ability to communicate with their \ncounsel, friends, and fan1ily during their incarceration.  Although multiple TTY devices \nare supposed to be available in each jail, this appears to not always be the case.  For \ninstance, in a June 2014 email to DOC staff, the DRCI noted the failure to install a \nsufficient number of TTY devices in the George Motchan Detention Center (\"GMDC\") \nand acknowledged that DOC \"has been out of compliance with the ADA regarding TTY \nprovisions for far too long[.]\"  In addition, the Depmiment does not furnish video relay \nservices, which are now the more common telecommunications method used by \nindividuals with hearing impainnents.s \nDeaf and hm·d-of-hearing inmates have complained about their lack of access to \ntelecommunications services.  For example: \n•  In April 2014, a representative for inmate  , a deaf \ninmate who was housed in GMDC, claimed that Mr.   was not \nable to communicate effectively with his family due to the lack of \nresources for individuals with hearing impairments.  Mr.   \nalleged that correction ot1icers did not allow him to use TTY s at \nGMDC and claimed that the machines were broken.  DOC staff \n5 The Depmiment has advised us that it recently began exploring the use of video relay \nservices. \n9 \n\nfailed to respond to the DRCI's repeated emails inquiring whether \nMr.   was provided access to a TTY. \n•  In June 2014, a representative for inmate   who \nreportedly has a severe hearing impairment and was placed in \npunitive segregation, requested that DOC provide accommodations \nfor the inmate's hearing impairment.  The records provided include \nno indication that an accommodation was offered to Mr.    In \nemails sent on July 3, 2014, the former DOC Deputy \nCommissioner for Integrity and Policy stated that Mr.   was \n\"not in fact deaf, but hard of hearing,\" and there was no need to \ntake further action because the inmate appeared able to \ncommunicate with family members on the telephone.  There is \nnothing in the records provided to suggest that a medical \nexamination was conducted to assess Mr.  's hearing \nimpairment or to determine whether accommodations were needed \nto ensure that he had meaningful access to programs and services. \n•  In early March 2015, inmate  , a hearing impaired \ninmate who was placed in the Brooklyn Detention Complex \n(\"BKDC\"), complained about his lack of access to a TTY device. \nIn an email sent on March 27, 2015, the DRCI requested that two \nTTYs be delivered to BKDC to accommodate Mr.  ' \nrequest, and noted that although there should be two TTY s in each \njail, she had \"been receiving complaints that there are none \navailable for inmates with hearing loss.\"  The Department \neventually provided Mr.   with access to a TTY, but staff \nlimited him to six minutes per call -the minimum time generally \nallotted to non-disabled inmates- in violation of DOC's policy \na±Iording hearing impaired imnates at least 20 minutes per call due \nto the additional time associated with communicating via a TTY. \nE.  Conclusions of Law and Minimum Actions Necessary to Remedy \nViolations \nDOC has violated Title II ofthe ADA by denying inmates with disabilities an \nequal opportunity to participate in and benefit from services, programs, or activities by: \n(i) placing iiunates with mobility or vision impairments in inaccessible housing areas; \n(ii) failing to provide inmates with mobility impairments with medically necessary \nassistive devices; and (iii) failing to furnish hearing impaired inmates with appropriate \naids and services to ensure that they have equal access to telecommunication services. \n28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(l); 35.149, 35.152(b); 35.160(b)(l).  To remedy these violations \nand address the deficiencies identified above, DOC should take the following steps at a \nmrmm urn: \n10 \n\n1.  Conduct an ADA self-evaluation that includes the elements discussed \nin the Depatiment of Justice, Technical Assistance Manual, at Section \nII-8.2000. \n2.  Provide effective training to all DOC staff on the requirements of the \nADA, its regulations, and its applicability to the daily work of DOC \nstaff. \n3.  Ensure the prompt and equitable resolution of requests for \naccommodation submitted by or on behalf of disabled inmates and any \nother ADA-related complaints. \n4.  Develop an effective system for tracking and recording requests for \naccommodation submitted by or on behalf of disabled inmates, and the \nDepatiment's responses to such requests. \n5.  Ensure that inmates with disabilities receive a prompt and informed \nevaluation of their needs upon their admission to DOC custody. \n6.  Ensure that inmates with disabilities are placed in accessible housing \nareas where they have equal access to services, programs, and \nactivities that are available to inmates without disabilities. \n7.  Ensure that inmates with mobility impainnents are furnished with \nappropriate medical assistive devices and that such devices are not \nseized unless necessary for a legitimate security purpose and \nappropriate medical personnel are consulted. \n8.  Ensure that appropriate auxiliary aids and services, including video \nrelay services, are available to inmates who are deaf or hard of hearing \nso that they can communicate with their counsel, friends, and family \non an equal basis as imnates without disabilities. \n*** \nWe request that you respond to this Letter of Findings and propose corrective \nactions to address each violation within 60 days.

If DOC determines that the use of a specific assistive device \nor medical equipment by an inmate would raise security concerns or pose a threat to the safety of \nstaff, inmates, or others, DOC shall specifically document the basis for that determination and \nadvise the inmate in writing of the determination.  DOC shall continue to consider alternative \nways to meet the inmate's needs in the event it is determined that a specific device or equipment \nposes a security or safety concern. \n4.  Except as provided in Paragraph III.5 below, DOC uniformed staff may direct the \nconfiscation of an inmate's assistive device or medical equipment only if (a) the inmate uses the \ndevice or equipment in a manner that raises security concerns or poses a threat to the safety of \nstaff, inmates, or others; and (b) a supervisor agrees that confiscating the device or equipment \nserves a legitimate security purpose.  The supervisory approval shall be obtained at the time of \n10 \n\nthe confiscation if a supervisor is immediately available or within 24 hours of the confiscation if \na supervisor is not immediately available.  If an inmate's device or equipment is confiscated, the \nfacility's Deputy Warden of Security, medical staff, and the DRCI shall be promptly advised in \nwriting that the device or equipment has been confiscated and the factual basis for doing so. \nMedical staff shall then promptly re-evaluate the inmate's medical status and need for the device \nor medical equipment.  If medical staff determine that the device or equipment continues to be \nmedically necessary, the device or equipment shall be returned to the inmate unless the facility's \nWarden or his/her designee determines that this would pose a security or safety risk and \ndocuments the basis for that determination, in which case the City shall consider alternative ways \nto meet the needs of the inmate.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to preclude DOC \nfrom, upon an inmate's intake, temporarily taking an inmate's assistive device that poses a \nsecurity risk and replacing it with an equally effective assistive device that does not pose such a \nsecurity risk, provided that medical staff shall then promptly evaluate that inmate to ensure that \nthe alternative assistive device meets the inmate's needs (e.g., replacing a metal cane with a \nwooden cane at intake). \n5.  If DOC uniformed staff have reason to believe that an inmate may not have a \nlegitimate need for an assistive device or medical equipment, staff may provide that information \nto HHC medical staff.  If HHC medical staff determines that the inmate does not have a \nlegitimate need for the assistive device or medical equipment, DOC may confiscate the assistive \ndevice or medical equipment.  If the inmate refuses to be examined by HHS medical staff in \norder to assess the inmate's need for the medical device or equipment, DOC may confiscate the \nassistive device or equipment until the inmate agrees to be examined provided that the inmate's \nrefusal is documented. \n11 \n\n6.  HHC will follow accepted protocols and guidelines for maintaining in a safe and \noperable condition wheelchairs and other assistive devices and medical equipment used by \ninmates.  The City shall promptly address any complaints from inmates with disabilities \nconcerning the functioning or condition of any auxiliary aid, assistive device, or medical \nequipment. \nIV.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR INMATES WITH HEARING OR \nSPEECH IMPAIRMENTS \n1.
