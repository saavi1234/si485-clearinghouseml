    "summary": "<p>On September 30, 2015, Yahya Farooq Mohammad, Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad, Asif Ahmed Salim, and Sultane Roome Salim were indicted in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Ohio for conspiracy to provide and conceal material support and resources to terrorists, for providing material support and resources to terrorists and for conspiracy to obstruct justice.  Farooq Mohammad and Ibrahim Mohammad were additionally indicted for conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The defendants were appointed federal public defenders and retained private counsel. The case was assigned to District Judge Jack Zouhary. </p><p>On December 21, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice notified the criminal defendants in this case that some of the evidence the government intended to use against them came from a FISA warrantless wiretap, pursuant to Sec. 702 of the FISA Amendment Acts of 2008. This notice allows criminal defendants to challenge the constitutionality of the government's surveillance techniques. All cases challenging this provision are available in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=27\">Foreign Targeting (702, 703, 704) special collection</a>. </p><p>On July 6, 2016, Yahya Mohammad was indicted in another case (3:16-cr-00222) in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Ohio for attempted first degree murder of a federal officer, solicitation to commit a crime of violence, and use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of a murder-for-hire. While Yahya Mohammad was detained and housed at the Lucas County Corrections Center in Toledo, Ohio, pending resolution of this case, he had told another inmate that he wanted to hire someone to kill Judge Zouhary. The inmate reported Mohammad to the FBI and introduced Mohammad to an FBI undercover employee, who posed as someone willing to kill Judge Zouhary for money. </p><p>On July 12, 2016, Judge Zouhary ordered recusal of himself from the case due to Yahya Mohammad's attempt to murder him. Chief Judge Solomon Oliver of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Ohio had requested that Chief Judge Guy Cole of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals appoint an out-of-district judge to hear both cases due to their close relation with each other. The cases were transferred to Chief Judge Edmund A. Sargus, Jr. from the Southern District of Ohio.</p><p>On September 30, 2016, the defendants filed a motion for disclosure of FISA-related materials and to suppress the fruits or derivatives obtained from warrantless surveillance under Section 702 of FISA.</p><p>On November 18, 2016, the government filed an ex parte in camera motion for a protective order pursuant to Section 4 of the Classified Information Procedures Act and Rule 16(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The government filed a supplemental motion on February 16, 2018. Both motions were submitted under seal with the Classified Information Security Officer.</p><p>On July 18, 2017, Chief Judge Cole of the Sixth Circuit reassigned Yahya Mohammad's three co-defendants, Ibrahim Mohammad, Asif Salim, and Sultane Salim, to District Judge Jeffrey J. Helmick. However, Judge Sargas was to continue hearing the cases in regard to Yahya Mohammad.</p><p>On November 8, 2017, after Yahya Mohammad pled guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists in this case (count 1) and one count of solicitation to commit a crime of violence (against Judge Zouhary) in case 3:16-cr-222 (count 2), Judge Sargus sentenced Mohammad to 180 months (minus time served) for count 1 and 240 months for count 2, with 90 of those months to run concurrently with count 1. The remaining 150 months were to run consecutively with count 1 for a total of 330 months; 10 years supervised released; and a $200 special assessment fee. No fines or restitution were imposed. </p><p>On March 20, 2018, Judge Helmick granted the government's motion for a protective order (originally filed on November 18, 2016) under Section 4 of the Classified Information Procedure's Act (CIPA). Judge Helmick denied the defendants' motions to suppress evidence obtained from a warrantless surveillance under Section 702 of FISA, to suppress fruits or derivatives of electronic surveillance, to compel discovery, and for disclosure related to FISA amendments. He noted that he had provided classified versions of his opinion to the Classified Information Security Officer for service to the relevant agencies for classification review. </p><p>On September 11, 2018, an unclassified version of Judge Helmick's opinion on the government's classified, ex parte, in camera motion for a protective order was released. 339 F.Supp.3d 724. Although even the unclassified version of the opinion is heavily redacted, it shows Judge Helmick finding that the defendants' objections to an ex parte, in camera review of the government's Section 4 filing without merit because none of the government's surveillance had been deemed unlawful. He further noted that nothing he had seen in his review of the classified documents in this case suggested that the government was using CIPA to conceal unlawful surveillance techniques. Furthermore, although he acknowledged that he was \"not in an optimal position to act as surrogate defense counsel,\" Judge Helmick maintained that he had sufficient knowledge of the case and the defendants' theories of the case to determine whether the government's Section 4 filings discussed information that would be relevant and helpful to the defense.  </p><p>On September 11, 2018, Judge Helmick released an unclassified memorandum opinion denying the defendants' several motions regarding the government's FISA evidence. First, he denied the defendants' request for disclosure of the FISA materials because he concluded that the challenged FISA collection was lawful. Therefore, Judge Helmick believed that disclosure to the defendants was not necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance. He rejected the defendants' argument that disclosure of FISA materials are permitted to the extent that due process requires it; the Sixth Circuit had already rejected an argument similar to the defendants', holding that \"FISA's requirement that the district court conduct an ex parte, in camera review of FISA materials does not deprive a defendant of due process.\" Second, Judge Helmick denied the defendants' motion for suppression of the evidence obtained or derived from FISA surveillance and physical searches because he found that the surveillance and searches were conducted in compliance with the FISC's orders, which had properly found the existence of probable cause.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the government negotiated plea agreements with the remaining defendants. On April 11, 2018 the government filed informations in separate cases charging all three defendants with financing terrorism in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339C. All three defendants immediately pleaded guilty to the new charges. The case against Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad was docketed as 3:18-cr-165 and Asif Ahmed Salim and Sultane Roome Salim's cases were docketed as 3:18-cr-186. Judge Helmick continued to preside over the new cases. According to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-men-plead-guilty-concealing-sending-funds-anwar-al-awlaki\">DOJ press release</a> the basis for these charges was providing money to the radical cleric Anwar Al-Awlaki, who was later killed by an American drone strike in Yemen.</p><p>All three were sentenced between November 9, 2018 and January 22, 2019. Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad and Sultane Roome Saslim received sentences of 60 months incarceration and Asif Ahmed Salim received a sentence of 72 months incarceration. At the sentencing, the government moved to dismiss the original 2015 charges cases against them the three defendants. Judge Helmick granted all these requests.</p><p>None of these defendants appealed their convictions or sentences and all their cases are presumably closed, though Sultane Roome Salime filed a motion for compassionate release in February of 2021.</p><p>Two years after his sentencing on September 9, 2019, Yahya Farooq Mohammad filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals to the Sixth Circuit. That case was docketed as 19-3870. The Sixth Circuit denied Mohammed a certificate of appealability on August 11, 2020. </p><p>There has been no action in Mohammed's case since that date and it is presumably closed.</p>",

For the \nfollowing reasons, the Government's Motion is granted. \nI. \nDefendants Yahya Parooq Mohammad, Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad, Asif Ahmed Salim, \nand Sultane Roome Salim were indicted on September 30, 2015, and charged with (Count I) \nconspiracy to provide and conceal material support to terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § \n2339A; (Count 2) providing material support to terrorists, in violation of 18 U .S.C. § 2339A; \n(Count 3) conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349 (brought against \nFarooq and Ibrahim only); and (Count 4) conspiracy to obstruct justice, in violation of 18 U.S. C. \n§ J5!2(k).(Doc.

PageID #: 9727\nUNCLASSiFIED I CLEAREo FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \nterrorist attacks and killings. (See Doc. No. 1 at 12, 68.) The Government contends that \nDefendants conspired to obstruct its investigation into their illicit fundraising by making false \nstatements to the FBI and destroying or concealing records. (Id at 65-67, 71-72.) And as to \nFarooq and Ibrahim, the Government additionally alleges that they conspired to raise money for \nal-Awlaki through various fraudulent credit card and PayPal transactions. (Id . at 68-71.) \nFarooq has since pleaded guilty to the charges against him. (Doc. No. 284.) The other \nDefendants are scheduled to be tried on April23, 2018. (Doc.

Cl£AREJ FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \nII. \nA.  CIPA§4 \nUnder § 4 of Classified Information Procedures Act, \n[t]he court, upon a sufficient showing, may authorize the United States to delete \nspecified items of classified information from documents to be made available to \nthe defendant through discovery under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \nto substitute a surmnary of the information for such classified documents, or to \nsubstitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the classified information \nwould tend to prove. The court may permit the United States to make a request for \nsuch authorization in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the court \nalone. If the court enters an order granting relief following such an ex parte \nshowing, the entire text of the statement of the United States shall be sealed and \npreserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in \nthe event of an appeal.  · \n18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 4. This section, in other words, \"permits the government to have the trial \ncourt examine classified information in camera and ex parte and determine whether it is \nnecessary for the defense.\" United States v. Hanna, 661 F.3d 271, 295 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting \nUnited States v. Smith, 899 F.2d 564, 565 n.1 (6th Cir. 1990)). \nThe Sixth Circuit has adopted the \"relevant and helpful\" standard for determining under \nCIP A § 4 whether classified information should be disclosed to the defense. See United States v. \nAmawi, 695 F.3d 457, 470 (6th Cir. 2012). This standard involves a three-step analysis. First, the \ncourt must determine that the information is relevant. Id Second, the court must determine \nwhether the Government has asserted a colorable claim of privilege over the information. Id; see \nalso Hanna, 661 F.3d at 295 (\"[A] protective order will only issue against disclosure of \n'classified information,' , , . and 'classified information' is 'information or material that has been \ndetermined by the United States Government ... to require protection against unauthorized \ndisclosure for reasons of national security.\"' (citations omitted)). And third, the court must \ndetermine that the information is helpful to the defense. Amawi, 695 F.3d at 470; see a/so United \n3 \nUNCLASSIFIED I CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 373  Filed:  09/11/18  4 of 18.  PageID #: 9729\nU~!CLAS3:F!EJ ;' CLEARC~ FOR PUBLIC RE~L~SE \nStates v.  Yunis, 867 F.2d 617 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding that \"classified information is not \ndiscoverable on a mere showing of theoretical relevance,\" but only on a showing that the \ninformation is at least helpful to the defense). In applying this analysis, the court acts, in essence, \nas \"standby counsel for the defendants,\" placing itself in defense counsel's shoes and \ndetermining what may be relevant and helpful to the defendants' case. Amawi, 695 F.3d at 471. \nThe relevant and helpful standard under CIP A § 4 is easier to satisfy than the favorable \nmateriality standard under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (I 963). All Brady evidence that is \nfavorable is also relevant and helpful under CIP A § 4, but not all relevant and helpful evidence is \nfavorable. Amawi, 695 F.3d at 471; see also United States v. Mejia, 448 F.3d 436, 456-57 (D.C. \nCir. 2006) (\"While Brady information is plainly subsumed within the larger category of \ninformation that is 'at least helpful' to the defendant, information can be helpful without being \n'favorable' in the Brady sense ....\" ). \"Simply stated, evidence that needs to be disclosed under \nBrady would also need to be disclosed under [CIPA § 4], but not the other way around.\" Amawi, \n695 F.3d at 471. \nIf, after applying the three-step analysis, the court determines that the classified \ninformation is relevant and helpful to the defense, the court sho1,1ld consider \"the protective \noptions short of full disclosure that are set forth in CIPA § 4, namely, permitting the government \n'to substitute a summary of the information for such classified documents, or to substitute a \nstatement admitting relevant facts that the classified information would tend to prove.\"' Mejia, \n448 F.3d at 457 n.l8 (quoting 18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 4). \nB.  Defendants' Objections \nDefendants object to an ex parte, in camera review of the Government's § 4 filings. (See, \n4 \n11~''\"'' ...... ,,.,,.. .. ' \"'' ,. ',,_\" \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 373  Filed:  09/11/18  5 of 18.  PageID #: 9730\ne.g., Doc. No. 178 at 1-2.)1 They contend that defense counsel holding appropriate security \nclearance should be permitted to review the Government's § 4 filings because (i) ex parte \nproceedings are disfavored, (ii) the Supreme Court has held that defendants are entitled to \ndisclosure and adversarial review when courts address Fourth Amendment suppression issues, \nand (iii) I am ill-equipped to act as surrogate defense counsel. (See id. at 1-2, 7-11; Doc. No. \n179 at 3-10; Doc. No. 180 at 1.) Alternatively, Defendants aver that I should \"(a) require the \nGovernment to disclose its legal arguments in support of its§ 4 application to cleared defense \ncounsel; and/or (b) provide defense counsel an opportunity to present to the Court ex parte \ninformation that will significantly assist the Court's review of the [G]overnment's § 4 \nsubmission, as well as its evaluation of whether that submission includes discoverable \ninformation.\" (Doc. No. 178 at 1-2; Doc. No. 180 at 1-2.) \nDefendants' objection to an ex parte, in camera review of the Government's § 4 filings \nlacks merit. Regardless of whether ex parte proceedings are generally disfavored, Federal Rule \nof Criminal Procedure 16(dX1) and CIPA § 4 explicitly provide for such proceedings in certain \ncircumstances. Rule 16(d)(1) states that \"[a]t any time, the court may, for good cause, deny, \nrestrict or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief,\" as well as \"permit a \nparty to show good cause by a written statement that the court will inspect ex parte.\" Fed. R. \nCrim. P. 16(d)(1); see Hanna, 661 F.3.d at 294. And CIPA § 4 states that the Government may \nmake a request for authorization to delete classified information from discovery \"in the form of a \nwritten statement to be inspected by the court alone.\" 18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 4; see Hanna, 661 F.3d \nat 294-95. The Government's representation regarding the harm that could result from disclosure \n1 Su1tane, Asif, and Ibrahim have adopted the arguments made by Farooq in his Memorandum in \nOpposition. (See Doc. No. 179 at 2; Doc. No. 180 at 2; Doc. No. 183 at 1.) Additionally, Asifhas adopted \nSultane's arguments, and Ibrahim has adopted the arguments made by Su1tane and Asif. (See Doc. No. \n180at2; Doc. No.183at 1.) \n5 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 373  Filed:  09/11/18  6 of 18.  PageID #: 9731\nof the classified information-even to cleared counsel-eonstitutes good cause for me to review \nthe Govermnent's Motion ex parte and in camera. The propriety of this approach is reinforced by \nmy conclusion (explained below) that none of the classified information the Govermnent \nproposes to delete from discovery is relevant and helpful to Defendants. See Hanna, 661 F.3d at \n295 (holding that the district court acted within its discretion in withholding from the defendant \nthe Govermnent's ex parte, in camera submission given that the withheld information \"would not \n[have been] helpful to the defense\"). \nDefendants contend that they are entitled to disclosure an adversarial review of the \nGovermnent' s § 4 filings because the Govermnent might be attempting to clandestinely litigate \nFourth Amendment suppression issues using CIP A. (See Doc. No, 179 at 4-1 0.) Defendants rely \non Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 168, 180-85 (1969), and its progeny for this \nproposition. (See Doc, No. 179 at 7-9.) But Alderman is inapposite. There, \"the issue was \nwhether surveillance materials should be produced and an adversarial hearing conducted where \nthe prosecution planned to use evidence from surveillance that had already been deemed \nunlawful.\" United States v. Damrah, 412 F.3d 618, 624 (6th Cir. 2005) (emphasis added) (citing \nAlderman, 394 U.S. at 182...,'!3). Here, by contrast, none of the Govemnient's surveillance has \nbeen deemed unlawful. And nothing I have seen in my review of the classified documents in this \ncase suggests that the Govermnent is using CIP A to conceal unlawful surveillance techniques. \nI acknowledge that I am not in an optimal position to act as surrogate defense counsel. \n(See Doc. No. 178 at 9.) Nonetheless, I have sufficient knowledge of the case-and sufficient \nknowledge of Defendants' theories of the case--to detennine whether the Govermnent's § 4 \nfilings discuss information that would be relevant and helpful to the defense. See Amawi, 695 \n6 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 373  Filed:  09/11/18  7 of 18.  PageID #: 9732\nF.3d at 471 (Acting as standby counsel for the defendants \"is not a position that we relish, yet it \nis required by CIPA, as interpreted by Yunis and its progeny.\"). \nTo the extent that Defendants argue for disclosure of the § 4 filings to defense counsel \nbased on counsel's possession of security clearance, Defendants' argument again falls flat. As \nthe Sixth Circuit has explained, even cleared counsel are not permitted to participate in the ex \nparte, in camera review under CIPA § 4. Amawi, 695 F.3d at 473. \"The possession of a security \nclearance only becomes relevant after the district court determines, in accordance with section 4, \nthat any classified information is discoverable.\" !d. \nDefendants' alternative request for an ex parte meeting with me has been fulfilled. I met \nex parte with defense counsel for all three defendants on November 16, 2017, with counsel for \ntwo of the defendants on December 14, 2017, and with counsel for the remaining defendant on \nJanuary 5, 2018.  At these ex parte meetings, counsel provided me with information to assist in \nmy review of the Government's Motion. \nAs to Defendants' other alternative request-that I should order disclosure of the legal \narguments supporting the Government's Motion-Defendants' request is not well taken. Under§ \n4, the Government may make a request \"in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the \ncourt alone.\" 18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 4. When a court enters an order granting the Government's \nrequested relief following an ex parte showing, \"the entire text ofth e statement of the United \nStates shall be sealed and preserved.\" Jd (emphasis added). Contrary to Defendants' suggestion, \n§ 4 does not distinguish between the Government's legal and factual arguments. Section 4 \nprovides for an ex parte, in camera review of the Government's Motion in its entirety. See id \nC.  The Government's § 4 Motion \nI have carefully reviewed the Government's CIPA § 4 Motion, the Government's \n7 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 373  Filed:  09/11/18  8 of 18.  PageID #: 9733\nSupplemental Memorandum, and the documents accompanying those filings. l also met with the \nGovernment ex: parte on March 2, 2018, to inquire about three potential issues it identified while \nreviewing the materials. Based on the Government's responses at the hearing and supplemental \nfiling related to these inquires plus my review of the § 4 materials, I conclude the information the \nGovernment seeks to substitute or delete from discovery is subject to a colorable claim of \nprivilege and that the information to be deleted is not relevant and helpful to the defense. I \noutline this information below. \n8 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 373  Filed:  09/11/18  9 of 18.

Neither party requests oral argument.  \nWe review the district court’s factual findings for clear error.  Mixed questions of law \nand fact—including the ultimate question of whether detention is warranted—are reviewed de \nnovo.  United States v. Stone, 608 F.3d 939, 945 (6th Cir. 2010); United States v. Hazime, 762 \nF.2d 34, 37 (6th Cir. 1985).  A defendant shall be detained pending trial if, after conducting a \nhearing, “the judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably \nassure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the \ncommunity[.]”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).  In making that determination, the judicial officer shall \ntake into account any available information concerning: (1) “the nature and circumstances of the \n\nC  a  s e : 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 367  Filed:  05/01/18  2 of 3.  PageID #: 9713\nNo. 18-3155 \n-2- \noffense charged”; (2) “the weight of the evidence against the person”; (3) “the history and \ncharacteristics of the person”; and (4) “the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or \nthe community” if the person is released.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(1)–(4). \nThe default position of the law is that a defendant should be released pending trial, but \nthat position is modified for certain “particularly dangerous defendants.”  Stone, 608 F.3d at 945. \nSubject  to  rebuttal  by  the  defendant,  it  is  presumed  that  no  condition  or  combination  of \nconditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any \nother person and the community if there is probable cause to believe that the person committed a \nfederal crime of terrorism for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is \nprescribed.  18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B); 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3).  Salim does not dispute that he \nis charged with offenses that trigger the presumption.  The presumption shifts the burden of \nproduction to the defendant to show that his release would not pose a flight risk or a danger to \nany person and the community.  The government retains the burden of persuasion.  Stone, 608 \nF.3d at 945. \nSalim  did not  meet  that  burden in  his  renewed motion  for pretrial release with  his \nproposal to reside now in Ohio with his mother, who is already serving as a third-party custodian \nfor Salim’s co-defendant and brother, Sultane Salim.  A defendant, charged with terrorism \noffenses, who has not lived in the country for several years, and who has previously been \ndeemed a flight risk by another judge, does not overcome the presumption that he is a danger to \nthe community or a flight risk simply by proposing to live with his mother and his co-defendant.  \nThe  brothers  are  alleged  to  have  committed  terrorism  crimes  jointly,  and  to  have  jointly \nobstructed the federal investigation into those crimes.  Putting them into a living situation, \nshortly before trial, where they can freely communicate, and potentially conspire again, is a bad \n\nC  a  s e : 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 367  Filed:  05/01/18  3 of 3.

Furthermore, as the original district judge found, Salim has loose ties to Ohio and the \nUnited States and significant foreign connections.  \nUpon review of the facts and arguments presented, we conclude that the government has \nshown by clear and convincing evidence that the conditions of release imposed by the district \ncourt judge who is now presiding will not reasonably assure the safety of the community or \navoid a risk of flight. \nWe therefore REVERSE the district court’s order releasing Salim on bond.

PageID #: 9744\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nWESTERN DIVISION \nUnited States of America, \nCase No. 3:15-cr-358 \nPlaintiff \nv.  UNCLASSIFIED MEMORANDUM \nOPINION \nYahya Farooq Mohammad, et al., \nDefendants \nBefore me are several motions.1 First, Defendants have requested the disclosure of \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") material and the suppression of the evidence \nobtained or derived from electronic surveillance and physical searches conducted under FISA \nTitles I and III. (Doc. No. 148 at 1; Doc. No. 156 at 1.) These motions are denied. \nNext, Defendants request the suppression of evidence obtained or derived from \nacquisitions made under FISA Section 702. (Doc. No. 146 at 1-2.) Defendants have also \nrequested the disclosure of the FISA Section 702 materials relevant to this case. (Doc. No. 140 at \n1.) These Section 702 motions are also denied. \nAnd lastly, Defendants have requested an order directing the Government to provide \nnotice and additional information about the surveillance it undertook in preparing this case. \n(Doc. No. 131 at 1.) This motion is denied as well. \n1 All but one of the motions were filed by Yahya Farooq Mohammad, who has since pleaded guilty. The \nother Defendants have, with limited exceptions, joined Farooq's motions and adopted his arguments. (See \nDoc. Nos. 142, 143, 145, 155, 156, 160.) Sultane Roome Salim brings the remaining motion, (Doc. No. \n156 at 1), which Asif Ahmed Salim has joined, (Doc. No. 160 at 2). \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  2 of 53.  PageID #: 9745\nI. \nDefendants Yahya Farooq Mohammad, Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad, Sultane Roome \nSalim, and Asif Ahmed Salim were indicted on September 30,2015, and charged with (Count I) \nconspiracy to provide and conceal material support to terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § \n2339A; (Count 2) providing material support to terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339A; \n(Count 3) conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349 (brought against \nFarooq and Ibrahim only); and (Count 4) conspiracy to obstruct justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1512(k). (Doc. No. I at 12-72.) \nThe Government accuses Defendants of conspiring to provide, and actually providing, \nfunds and other material support to Anwar a!-A wlaki for the preparation and execution of \nterrorist attacks and killings. (See Doc. No. I at 12, 68.) The Government contends Defendants \nconspired to obstruct its investigation into their illicit fundraising by making false statements to \nthe FBI and destroying or concealing records. (!d. at 65-67, 71-72.) And as to Farooq and \nIbrahim, the Government additionally alleges that they conspired to raise money for al-Awlaki \nthrough various fraudulent credit card and PayPal transactions. (!d.  at 68-71.) \nFarooq has since pleaded guilty to the charges against him. (Doc. No. 284 at 1.) The other \nDefendants are scheduled to be tried on Apri123, 2018. (Doc. No. 259 at 1.) \nOn December 21,2015, the Govermnent notified Defendants that it intends to offer into \nevidence, or otherwise use or disclose in any proceeding in this case, information obtained or \nderived from (i) electronic surveillance under FISA Title I (as to Sultane and Asif), (ii) physical \nsearches under FISA Title III (as to Ibrahim, Sultane, and Asif), and (iii) acquisitions under FISA \nSection 702 (as to Ibrahim and Asif) under FISA. (See Doc. Nos. 28, 29, 30.) \n2 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  3 of 53.  PageID #: 9746\nIn response to these notices, Defendants have filed several motions. In motions directed \nat FISA Titles I and III (Doc. Nos. 148, 156), Defendants have moved for (i) me to review the \nGovernment's applications for FISAsurveillance and searches, (ii) the disclosure of the \nGovernment's applications for surveillance and searches, (iii) an evidentiary hearing pursuant to \nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), and (iv) the suppression of any evidence obtained or \nderived from illegally authorized or implemented surveillance or searches. (See Doc. No. 150 at \n3; Doc. No. 156 at 1.) \nIn motions directed at FISA Section 702 (Doc. Nos. 140, 146), Defendants have \nrequested (i) the disclosure of the Section 702 materials relevant to this case and (ii) the \nsuppression of all evidence obtained or derived from acquisitions under Section 702. (Doc. No. \n140 at I; Doc. No. 146 at 1.) \nAnd in a motion aimed broadly at all of the Government's surveillance and evidence \ngathering methods (Doc. No. 131 ), Defendants request an order directing the Government to \nprovide notice of \"(I) each surveillance technique it used to obtain information about \nDefendant's communications or activities in its investigation; (2) the timing or duration of that \nsurveillance; (3) the legal authority relied upon; and (4) the evidence obtained or derived from \nthat surveillance.\" (Doc. No. 131 at 1.) \nThe Government opposes Defendants motions and has responded by filing classified and \nunclassified memoranda in opposition. The Government has also filed an affidavit signed by the \nAttorney General in which she declared under oath that \"it would harm the national security of \nthe United States to disclose or hold an adversary hearing with respect to the FISA Materials\" in \nthis matter. (Doc. No. 190 ~ 3.) The filing of this affidavit triggers a statutory mandate directing \nme to \"review in camera and ex parte the application, order, and such other materials relating to \n3 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  4 of 53.  PageID #: 9747\nthe [FISA J surveillance as may be necessary to determine whether the surveillance of the \naggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1806(£); see also id. § \n1881e(a). \nI have conducted the required in camera, ex parte review of the FISA materials and now \naddress Defendants' motions. I first consider the motions for disclosure and suppression under \nFISA Titles I and III (Doc. Nos. 148, 156). \nII. \nEnacted in 1978, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, establishes a statutory \nframework under which executive branch agencies may collect foreign intelligence information. \nSee United States v. Aziz, 228 F. Supp. 3d 363, 366 (M.D. Pa. 2017); see 50 U.S.C. § 1801, et \nseq. As part of this framework, Congress created two specialized courts: the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (\"FISC\") and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review \n(\"FISCR\"). 50 U.S.C. § 1803. FISA authorizes the Chief Justice of the United States to designate \neleven United States District Judges to sit as judges of the FISC. Id.  § 1803(a)(1). FISC judges \nconsider ex parte applications submitted by the executive branch for electronic surveillance and \nphysical searches. See id. The FISCR, which is composed of three United States District or \nCircuit Judges designated by the Chief Justice, reviews denials by the FISC of applications for \nFISA intelligence collection. I d.  § 1803(b ). \nFISA, as amended in 2001 under the USA PATRIOT Act (\"Patriot Act\") and as amended \nagain in 2008 under the FISA Amendments Act (\"FAA''), consists of eight titles. As relevant \nhere, Title I (codified at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 to 1813) deals with electronic surveillance, Title III \n(codified at 50 U.S. C.§§ 1821-1829) deals with physical searches, and Section 702 (part of Title \nVII and codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1881a) deals with the acquisition of foreign intelligence \n4 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  5 of 53.  PageID #: 9748\ninformation from electronic communication service providers. Unlike surveillance under Titles I \nand III, Section 702 surveillance targets non-United States persons located abroad. See 50 U.S. C. \n§ 188la(b). \nA.  FISA Titles I and III \nTitles I and III of FISA provide detailed procedures for the authorization and execution of \nelectronic surveillance and physical searches. \n1.  Emergency Authorization and Standard FISA Application \nThe Government typically must apply for and obtain an order from the FISC before \nconducting electronic surveillance under Title I or engaging in physical searches under Title III. \nSee United. States v. Huang, 15 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1136 (D.N.M. 2014). An exception to this \ngeneral rule is when the Attorney General authorizes emergency surveillance or an emergency \nphysical search. An emergency authorization is proper if the Attorney General \n(A)  reasonably determines that an emergency situation exists with respect to the \nemployment of electronic surveillance [or a physical search] to obtain foreign \nintelligence information before an order authorizing such surveillance [or \nphysical search] can with due diligence be obtained; \n(B)  reasonably determines that the factual basis for the issuance of an order ... to \napprove such electronic surveillance [or physical search] exists; \n(C)  informs, either personally or through a designee, a judge having jurisdiction . \n. . at the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to \nemploy emergency electronic surveillance [or an emergency physical \nsearch]; and \n(D)  makes an application ... to a judge having jurisdiction ... as soon as \npracticable, but not later than 7 days after the Attorney General authorizes \nsuch surveillance [or physical search]. \n50 U.S.C. § 1805(e)(l); see id.  § 1824(e)(1). \n5 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  6 of 53.  PageID #: 9749\nIn all other circumstances, the Government must apply for and obtain an order from the \nFISC before engaging in electronic surveillance under Title I or a physical search under Title III. \nThe application to conduct electronic surveillance or a physical search must include \n(1) the identity of the [f]ederal officer making the application; \n(2) the identity, if known, or a description of the specific target of the electronic \nsurveillance [or physical search, and, in the case of a physical search, a \ndescription of the information, material, or property to be seized, reproduced, \nor altered]; \n(3) a statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to \njustify his belief that-\n(A)  the target of the electronic surveillance [or physical search] is a \nforeign power or an agent of a foreign power[, and, in the case of a \nphysical search, the premises or property to be searched contains \nforeign intelligence information]; \n(B)  each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance [or \nphysical search] is directed is ... or is about to be used, [owned, \npossessed by, or in transit to] a foreign power or an agent of a foreign \npower; \n(4) a statement of the proposed minimization procedures; \n(5) a description of the nature of the information sought and the type of \ncommunications or activities to be subjected to the [electronic] surveillance[, \nor, in the case of a physical search, a statement of the nature of the foreign \nintelligence sought and the manner in which the physical search is to be \nconducted]; \n(6) A certification [of a high-ranking executive branch official]-\n(A) that the certifying official deems the information sought to be foreign \nintelligence information; \n(B)  that a significant purpose2 of the surveillance [or physical search] is \nto obtain foreign intelligence information; \n2 As originally enacted, FISA required a high-ranking member of the executive branch to certify that \"the \npurpose\" of the surveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information. Aziz, 228 F. Supp. 3d at 367. \nThe required certification changed when Congress enacted the Patriot Act in 2001. See id. The Patriot Act \namended FISA to require that a high-ranking executive branch official certify that the acquisition of \n6 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  7 of 53.  PageID #: 9750\n(C)  that such information cannot reasonably be obtained by normal \ninvestigative techniques; \n(D)  that designates the type of foreign intelligence information being \nsought ... ; and \n(E)  including a statement of the basis for the certification that-\n(i)  the information sought is the type of foreign intelligence \ninformation designated; and \n(ii) such information cannot reasonably be obtained by normal \ninvestigative techniques; \n(7) a summary statement of the means by which the surveillance will be effected \nand a statement whether physical entry is required to effect the [electronic] \nsurveillance[, and, in the case of a physical search of the residence of a United \nStates person, the Attorney General shall state what investigative techniques \nhave previously been utilized to obtain the foreign intelligence information \nconcerned aud the degree to which these techniques resulted in acquiring such \ninformation]; \n(8) a statement of the facts concerning all previous applications that have been \nmade to any judge under this subchapter involving auy of the persons, \nfacilities, or places specified in the application, aud the actions taken on each \nprevious application; and \n(9) a statement of the period of time for which the electronic surveillance is \nrequired to be maintained .... \n50 U.S. C. § 1804(a); see id § 1823(a) (footnote added). The Attorney General must approve \napplications for electronic surveillance or physical search before they are presented to the FISC. \nSee id §§ 1804(a), 1823(a). \nAs used in FISA, \"foreign intelligence information\" encompasses \"information that \nrelates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to, the ability of the United \nStates to protect against- (A) actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign \npower or au agent of a foreign power; [or] (B) ... international terrorism ... by a foreign power \nforeign intelligence information is \"a significant purpose\" of the requested surveillance. See id; 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 1804(a)(6)(B), 1823(a)(6)(B). \n7 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  8 of 53.  PageID #: 9751\nor an agent of a foreign power ....\" 50 U.S.'C. § 1801(e)(1); see id.  § 1821(1). The term also \nencompasses \"information with respect to a foreign power ... that relates to, and if concerning a \nUnited States person is necessary to-(A  ) the national defense or the security of the United \nStates; or (B) the conduct ofthe foreign affairs of the United States.\" Id.  § 1801(e)(2); see id.  § \n1821 (1 ). \nA \"United States person\" encompasses United States citizens and aliens lawfully \nadmitted for permanent residence in the United States. 50 U.S.C. § 1801(i); see id.  § 1821(1). \nA \"foreign power\" includes any \"group engaged in international terrorism or activities in \npreparation therefor.\" 50 U.S.C. § 180l(a)(4); see id.  § 1821(1). And an \"agent of a foreign \npower\" encompasses \"any person other than a United States person, who ... acts in the United \nStates ... as a member of a foreign power ... irrespective of whether the person is inside the \nUnited States\" or \"engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefore.\" Id.  § \n180l(b)(1); see id. § 1821(1). An agent of a foreign power also encompasses \"any person who .. \n. knowingly engages in ... international terrorism, or activities that are in preparation therefore, \nfor or on behalf of a foreign power\" or \"knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of \n[the activities just described] or knowingly conspires with any person to engages in [those] \nactivities.\" Id.  § 1801(b)(2); see id. § 1821(1). \nAlso referenced in the application requirements above (and in other FISA titles), \n\"minimization procedures\" are specific procedures, adopted by the Attorney General, that are, \namong other things, \nreasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular \nsurveillance [or physical search], to minimize the acquisition and retention, and \nprohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning \nunconsenting United States person consistent with the need of the United States to \nobtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information. \n8 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  9 of 53.  PageID #: 9752\n50 U.S.C. § 1801(h)(l); see id. § 1821(4)(A). Notably, minimization procedures allow \"for the \nretention and dissemination of information that is evidence of a crime which has been, is being, \nor is about to be committed and that is to be retained or disseminated for law enforcement \npurposes.\" Id.  §§ 1801(h)(3), 1821(4)(C). \n2.  FISC Order \nAfter reviewing the Government's application, the FISC will issue an ex parte order \nauthorizing electronic surveillance or physical searches if it finds that \n(I) the application has been made by a [f]ederal officer and approved by the \nAttorney General; \n(2) on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant there is probable cause to \nbelieve that-\n(A)  the target of the electronic surveillance [or physical search] is a \nforeign power or an agent of a foreign power: Provided, That no \nUnited States person may be considered a foreign power or an agent \nof a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and \n(B)  each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance [or \nphysical search] is directed is ... or is about to be used, [owned, \npossessed by, or is in transit to] a foreign power or an agent of a \nforeign power; \n(3) the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization \nprocedures under [FISA]; and \n(4) the application ... contains all statements and certifications required [under§ \n1804 (with respect to electronic surveillance) or § 1823 (with respect to a \nphysical search)] ... and, if the tal'get is a United States person, the \ncertification or certifications are not clearly erroneous .... \n50 U.S.C. § 1805(a); see id.  § 1824(a). \nA FISC order must specify \n(A)  the identity, if known, or a description of the specific target of the electronic \nsurveillance [or physical search] ... ; \n9 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  10 of 53.  PageID #: 9753\n(B)  the nature and location of each of the facilities or places at which the \nelectronic surveillance will be directed, if known[, or, in the case of a \nphysical search, the nature and location of each of the premises or property to \nbe searched]; \n(C)  the type of information sought to be acquired and the type of \ncommunications or activities to be subjected to the surveillance[, or, in the \ncase of a physical search, the type of information, material, or property to be \nseized, altered, or reproduced]; \n(D)  the means by which the electronic surveillance will be effected and whether \nphysical entry will be used to effect the  surveillance[, or in the case of a \nphysical search, a statement of the manner in which the search is to be \nconducted and, whenever more than one physical search is authorized under \nthe order, the authorized scope of each search and a description of the \nminimization procedures applicable to the information acquired by each \nsearch]; and \n(E)  the period of time during which the electronic surveillance [or physical \nsearches are J approved. \n50 U.S. C. § 1805(c)(1); see id.  § 1824(c)(1). A FISC order must also direct that the Government \nfollow the applicable minimization procedures. I d.  §§ 1805(c  )(2)(A), 1824(c  )(2)(A). \nElectronic surveillance and physical searches targeting a United States person may be \napproved for up to 90 days; surveillance and searches targeting a non-United States person may \nbe approved for up to 120 days. See 50 U.S. C. §§ 1805(d)(1), 1824(d)(1). An extension to this \ntime frame may be obtained, but only if the United States submits another application that \ncomplies with FISA's requirements. See id.  §§ 1805(d)(2), 1824(d)(2). Extensions relating to a \nUnited States person may be approved for up to 90 days; those relating to a non-United States \nperson may be approved for up to one year. See id. \n3.  District Court Review \nAn \"aggrieved person\" can move to suppress FISA-obtained or -derived evidence that the \nGovernment seeks to use against him in a trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any \ncourt. See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e), 1825(f)(l). A person is aggrieved under FISA if he is the target \n10 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  11 of 53.  PageID #: 9754\nof, or was subject to, electronic surveillance, see id.  § 180l(k), or if his premises, property, \ninformation, or material is the target of, or was subject to, a physical search, see id.  § 1821 (2). \nAn aggrieved person can move for suppression on the grounds that (I) the information was \nunlawfully acquired or (2) the surveillance or physical search was not made in conformity with \nthe FISC's order. See id.  §§ 1806(e), 1825(1)(1). \nWhen considering a motion to suppress evidence obtained through FISA collection, a \ncourt must review the Government's applications, the FISC's orders, and any documentation \ndescribing the execution of the collection. See United States v. Alwan, No.1 :11-CR-13, 2012 \nWL 399154, at *7-8 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 7, 2012). \na.  Reviewing FISA Applications \nA district court's primary task in reviewing an application for FISA collection is to \nensure that it contains all the statutorily mandated elements. See A/wan, 2012 WL 399154, at *7. \nWhen an application \"was properly made and earlier approved by a FISAjudge, it carries a \nstrong presumption of veracity and regularity in a reviewing court.\" !d. (quoting United States v. \nPelton, 835 F.2d 1067, 1076 (4th Cir. 1987)). Consequently, district courts subject the \nGovemment's FISA applications to minimal scrutiny on review. !d. \nLike the application itself, the certification appended to a FISA application is also \npresumed valid and subjected only to minimal scrutiny. See, e.g., United States v. Badia, 827 \nF.2d 1458, 1463 (11th Cir. 1987); United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 77 & n.6 (2d Cir. \n1984). Neither the FISC nor a reviewing district court should \"second-guess the executive branch \nofficial's certification.\" Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77. The reviewing court's role is merely to ensure \nthe certifications were properly made. See id.; United States v. Ahmed, No. 1:06-cr-147, 2009 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 120007, at *20 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 19, 2009). \n11 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  12 of 53.  PageID #: 9755\nb.  Reviewing FISC Orders \nA district court must review FISC orders to ensure they contain the statutorily required \nfindings, specifications, and directions. See A/wan, 2012 WL 399154, at *8, *10. \nOne of the most critical findings the FISC must make before authorizing electronic \nsurveillance is that probable cause exists to believe (a) the target of the surveillance or search is a \nforeign power or an agent of a foreign power and (b) each of the facilities or places at which the \nsurveillance or search is targeted is or is about to be owned, used, possessed by, or is in transit to \nor from a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1805(a)(2), 1824(a)(2). \nThere is some disagreement on the standard district courts should apply when reviewing the \nadequacy of the FISC's probable cause determination. A minority of courts has held that a \nstandard deferential to the FISC's determination is appropriate. See Aziz, 228 F. Supp. 3d at 374. \nThis Court, however, agrees with \"[t]he more robust line of authority,\" which has concluded that \na de novo standard applies. I d.; see, e.g., United States v. Hassan, 742 FJd 104, 138-39 (4th Cir. \n2014) (stating that the district court reviewed the probable cause determinations de novo in \naccordance with the Fourth Circuit's precedent); United States v. Elshinawy, No. 16-0009,2017 \nWL 1048210, at *9 (D. Md. Mar. 20, 2017) (applying a de novo standard of review); United \nStates v. Mubayyid, 521 F. Supp. 2d 125, 131 (D. Mass. 2007) (same); United States v. Rosen, \n447 F. Supp. 2d 538, 545 (E.D. Va. 2006) (same). \nConsequently, in conducting my review of the Title I and Title III materials, I accord a \npresumption of validity to the Government's applications and supporting certifications, and I \nreview de novo the FISC's probable cause determinations. See Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77 & n.6; \nA/wan, 2012 WL 399154, at *7-8; Mubayyid, 521 F. Supp. 2d at 131; Rosen, 447 F. Supp. 2d at \n545. \n12 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  13 of 53.  PageID #: 9756\nI \nc.  Ex Parte and In Camera Procedure \nThe Government has filed an affidavit from the Attorney General in which she stated \nunder oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United \nStates. (Doc. No. 190 ~ 3.) When the Government files such an affidavit, the district court must \nreview the FISA materials in camera and ex parte. 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f). And when the \nGovernment files such an affidavit, the court may only order the disclosure of the FISA materials \n\"where such disclosure is necessary to make ao accurate determination of the legality of the \nsurveillaoce.\" !d.  § 1806(f). Disclosure may be necessary under FISA \nwhere the court's initial review of the application, order, and fruits of the \nsurveillaoce indicates that the question of legality may be complicated by factors \nsuch as \"indications of possible misrepresentation of fact, vague identification of \nthe persons to be surveilled, or surveillance records which include a significant \namount of nonforeign intelligence information, calling into question compliance \nwith the minimization standards contained in the order.\" \nUnited States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-701, at 64 \n(1978)). If, in other words, the court concludes that it can determine, without assistance or input \nfrom the aggrieved party, whether the FISA surveillance was lawful, the court may not order \ndisclosure of the FISA materials. See 50 U.S. C.§ 1806(f); United States v. Amawi, 53! F. Supp. \n2d 832, 837 (N.D. Ohio 2008). \nIf the court determines based on its in camera and ex parte review that the FISA \ncollection was lawfully authorized and conducted in conformity with the FISC's orders, the court \nmust deny the aggrieved party's motions for suppression aod disclosure \"except to the extent that \ndue process requires discovery or disclosure.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1806(g). Courts have interpreted this \nto meao that disclosure is limited to that required under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). \nSee Aziz, 228 F. Supp. 3d at 370; Amawi, 53! F. Supp. 2d at 837. \n13 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  14 of 53.  PageID #: 9757\nB.  Disclosure of the FISA Title I and Title III Materials \nI have reviewed, in camera and ex parte, the Title I and Title Ill materials submitted by \nthe Government. And through this review, I conclude that I can determine, on my own, whether \nthe challenged FISA collection was lawful. I have not observed in the materials any complicating \nfactors, such as misrepresentations of fact, vague identifications of surveillance targets, or \nevidence of significant non-foreign intelligence collection. See Belfield, 692 F.2d at 147. \nDisclosure is, accordingly, not necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the \nsurveillance, see 50 U.S. C. §§ 1806(f), and Defendants' request for the disclosure of the FISA \nmaterials is denied. \nDefendants stress that disclosure of FISA material is permitted to the extent that due \nprocess requires it. (Doc. No. 150 at 25-26 (citing 50 U.S. C.§ 1806(g)).) The due process \nexception does not apply here though. Courts have interpreted the exception narrowly; it \nencompasses only those materials that would be discoverable under Brady. See Aziz, 228 F. \nSupp. 3d at 370; Amawi, 531 F. Supp. 2d at 837. And here, my review of the FISA materials \nreveals no exculpatory information that would need to be disclosed under Brady. \nAs an additional argument for disclosure, Defendants contend that ex parte proceedings, \nlike those mandated under FISA, are \"antithetical to the adversary system that is the hallmark of \nAmerican criminal justice\" and that due process, therefore, requires defense counsel's \nparticipation in reviewing the FISA materials. (Doc. No. 150 at 26.) \nDefendants have legitimate concerns regarding the fairness of ex parte proceedings. \nThese types of proceedings, however, are not foreign to the American criminal justice system. \nSee United States v.  Daoud, 755 FJd 479, 482 (7th Cir. 2014) (\"The judge appears to have \nbelieved that adversary procedure is always essential to resolve contested issues of fact. That is \n14 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  15 of 53.  PageID #: 9758\nan incomplete description of the American judicial system in general and the federal judicial \nsystem in particular. There are ex parte or in camera hearings in the federal courts as well as \nhearings that are neither or both.\"); United States v. !sa, 923 F.2d 1300, 1307 (8th Cir. 1991) \n(\"Courts often conduct in camera reviews in criminal proceedings when, as here, the defendant's \nright of confrontation is subordinated to competing interests of society.\"). \nNor are ex parte proceedings inherently unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful, as \nDefendants seem to suggest. See Daoud, 755 F.3d at 482-83. Indeed, numerous courts have \nfound FISA' s ex parte proceedings permissible. See, e.g., !sa, 923 F.2d at 1306-07 (concluding \nthat the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is not violated by FISA's ex parte, in camera \nreview procedures); United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 147, 149 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (\"The \nlanguage of section 1806(f) clearly anticipates that an ex parte, in camera determination is to be \nthe rule. Disclosure and an adversary hearing are the exception, occurring only when necessary .. \n. . [Moreover,] [a] claim that disclosure and an adversary hearing are constitutionally required \ngoes directly contrary to all pre-FISA precedent on point. In this circuit and in others, it has \nconstantly been held that the legality of electronic, foreign intelligence surveillance may, even \nshould, be determined on an in camera, ex parte basis.\"); United States v.  Thomas, 201 F. Supp. \n3d 643, 650 (E.D. Pa. 2016) (\"[T]he Court can safely reject Defendant's apparent contention that \nFISA's ex parte provisions are per se unlawful.\"); United States v. Nicholson, No. 09-CR-40, \n2010 WL 1641167, at *3 (D. Or. Apr. 21, 2010) (\"FISA's in-camera review provisions have \nbeen held to be constitutional.\"). And as most pertinent here, the Sixth Circuit has already \nrejected an argument similar to Defendants', holding that \"FISA's requirement that the district \ncourt conduct an ex parte, in camera review of FISA materials does not deprive a defendant of \ndue process.\" United States v. Damrah, 412 F.3d 618,624 (6th Cir. 2005) (\"There is likewise no \n15 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  16 of 53.  PageID #: 9759\nmerit to Darmah's argument that Alderman v.  United States, [394 U.S. 165 (1969)], mandates \nthat surveillance materials [be produced] and an adversarial hearing be conducted before a \ndistrict court can determine whether the surveillance was authorized and lawfully conducted. In \nAlderman, the issue was whether surveillance materials should be produced and an adversarial \nhearing conducted where the prosecution planned to use evidence from surveillance that had \nalready been deemed unlawful.\"). Adhering to the Sixth Circuit's conclusion that FISA's ex \nparte and in camera procedures do not run afoul of constitutional due process requirements, I \nfind that Defendants' argument lacks merit. \nC.  Suppression of FISA-Obtained or -Derived Evidence \nDefendants next move for suppression of evidence obtained or derived from surveillance \nand physical searches conducted under FISA Titles I and III. They advance two arguments-one \nconstitutional and one statutory. Defendants contend that Titles I and III violate the Fourth \nAmendment. (Doc. No. 150 at 31-35.) And Defendants highlight several issues that might cause \nthe surveillance and searches to run afoul ofFISA's statutory requirements. (Id. at 2-3.) \n1.  Fourth Amendment Argument \nDefendants' constitutional argument focuses on FISA's amendment by the Patriot Act in \n2001. (See Doc. No. 150 at 31-32.) As amended, FISA allows for surveillance when \"a \nsignificant purpose\" of the collection is the acquisition of foreign intelligence information. (Id. at \n32 (quoting 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(6)(B), 1823(a)(6)(B)) (internal quotation marks omitted).) \nPrior to the amendment, FISA permitted surveillance only when \"the purpose\" of the \nsurveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information. Aziz, 228 F. Supp. 3d at 367. This \nchange, Defendants argue, allows the Government to bypass the Fourth Amendment when \n16 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  17 of 53.  PageID #: 9760\ngathering evidence for a criminal prosecution if the Government simply certifies that a \nsignificant purpose of the FISA collection is the acquisition of foreign intelligence information. \nDefendants aclmowledge that courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of the \n\"significant purpose\" standard. (Doc. No. 150 at 33.) They suggest, however, that these decisions \nshould be revisited because they were issued before \"the widely publicized public disclosures \nregarding the expansive nature of [FISA] Section 702's PRISM and [u]pstrearn collections-\nparticularly insofar as they involve the collection of domestic communications of American \ncitizens.\" (ld.) Because these surveillance programs allegedly \"vacuum-up an untold number of \ndomestic communications,\" courts should no longer \"naively accept[] that the purpose ofFISA \nsurveillance is foreign intelligence.\" (Id . at 33-34.) \nControlling precedent decides this issue. In 2005, the Sixth Circuit rejected a Fourth \nAmendment challenge to FISA's procedures. Damrah, 412 F.3d at 625. The court explained in \nDamrah that the defendant's Fourth Amendment challenge lacked merit, as \"FISA has uniformly \nbeen held to be consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\" I d.; see also Clapper v. Amnesty Jnt 'l \nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 421 n.8 (2013) (In Damrah, \"the Sixth Circuit ultimately held that FISA's \nprocedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\").  Damrah has not been overturned or \naltered in light of the public disclosures regarding PRISM and upstream collections. And \nconsequently, Damrah forecloses Defendants' constitutional challenge.3 \n2.  Statutory Argument \nDefendants' second suppression argument challenges the Government's adherence to \nFISA's statutory requirements. (See Doc. No. 150 at 2-3.) Defendants request suppression based \n3 Although Defendants suggest in passing that FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, may violate other \nconstitutional provisions (i.e., the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments), Defendants' constitutional \nargument focuses exclusively on the Fourth Amendment implications ofFISA's \"significant purpose\" \nlanguage. (See Doc. No. !50 at 31-35.) \n17 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  18 of 53.  PageID #: 9761\non various potential statutory violations: (1) the FISA applications may have failed to establish \nprobable cause that Defendants, or whomever was targeted, was a \"foreign power\" or \"an agent \nof a foreign power\"; (2) the FISA applications may contain intentional or reckless material \nfalsehoods or omissions; (3) the primary purpose of the electronic surveillance or physical \nsearches may have been to obtain evidence of domestic criminal activity and not foreign \nintelligence information or, in other words, capturing foreign intelligence information may not \nhave been a \"significant purpose\" of the surveillance or searches; ( 4) the surveillance or searches \nmay have been impermissibly based on activity protected by the First Amendment; (5) the \nGovernment may have been able to obtain the evidence collected through the surveillance or \nsearches through normal investigative techniques; (6) the Government may not have made the \nrequired certifications in the FISA applications, may have failed to obtain any necessary \nextension of prior FISA orders, or may have continued the surveillance or searches after any \nbasis for such initial surveillance was no longer valid; (7) the Government may not have \nestablished or abided by the appropriate minimization procedures; (8) the surveillance or \nsearches may have been based impermissibly on acquisitions conducted pursuant to FISA \nSection 702; and (9) the Government may have violated other provisions of FISA or the First or \nFourth Amendments, in manners unknown to Defendants. (!d.; Doc. No. 156 at 9-17.) \nBased on my in camera, ex parte review of the Title I and Title III materials, I find \nDefendants' concerns unwarranted. The FISA applications contained the statutorily required \nelements. The FISC's orders contained the necessary elements and properly found the existence \nof probable cause. And the surveillance and searches were conducted in compliance with the \nFISC's orders. Defendants are, consequently, not entitled to suppression of evidence obtained or \nderived from surveillance and physical searches conducted under FISA Titles I and III. \n18 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  19 of 53.  PageID #: 9762\nD.  Franks Hearing \nFor their last argument relating to Titles I and III, Defendants move for an evidentiary \nhearing nnder Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978); Defendants request a Franks \nhearing so they can explore the veracity of the information set forth in the Government's \napplications. (Doc. No. 150 at 18-21.) \nUnder Franks, a criminal defendant may challenge the truthfulness of factual statements \nin an affidavit of probable cause through an evidentiary hearing. See Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56, \n171-72. When a defendant makes \"a substantial preliminary showing\" that the affidavit in \nquestion contains a false statement which was (1) lmowingly or recklessly made and (2) \nnecessary to the finding of probable cause, the court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to \nexamine the sufficiency of the affidavit. I d.  at 15 5. \nThe Sixth Circuit has not explicitly held that Franks applies to FISA applications and \norders. See Damrah, 412 F.3d at 624-25. The Sixth Circuit has indicated, however, that if \nFranks does apply in the FISA context, the threshold burden nnder Franks (i.e., making a \nsubstantial preliminary showing that the affidavit contains a false statement) should also apply. \nSee id. \nI recognize the challenge faced by a defendant in making a substantial preliminary \nshowing that a FISA application contains a false statement when the defendant does not have \naccess to the application. But the threshold burden exists nonetheless. See Mubayyid, 521 F. \nSupp. 2d at 131 (\"The balance struck nnder FISA-which is intended to permit the gathering of \nforeign intelligence under conditions of strict secrecy, while providing for judicial review and \nother appropriate safeguards-would be substantially undermined if criminal defendants were \n19 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  20 of 53.  PageID #: 9763\ngranted a right of disclosure simply to ensure against the possibility of a Franks violation.\"). And \nhere, Defendants have failed to satisfy that burden. \nDefendants support their request for a Franks hearing with a discussion of a 2002 FISC \ndecision, In re All Matters Submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 218 F. \nSupp. 2d 611, 620-21 (FISC 2002), in which the FISC reported that \"[i]n September 2000, the \ngovernment came forward to confess error in some 75 FISA applications related to major \nterrorist attacks directed against the United States\"; these errors \"related to misstatements and \nomissions of material facts.\" Id at 620. Defendants argue that these issues were not isolated or \nresolved-as revealed by a March 2006 Department of Justice Inspector General report, which \nfound that the FBI had frequently violated its own wiretapping and other intelligence-gathering \nprocedures in the two years preceding the report. (Doc. No. 150 at 20-21 (citing U.S. Dep't of \nJustice, Office of the Inspector Gen., A Review of the FBI's Handling ofintelligence Related to \nthe September 11 Attacks (November 2004) 24-25, 29 (2006)).) \nDefendants' argument falls flat. The Government's errors from more than a decade ago \ndo not amount to a substantial preliminary showing that an application for FISA collection \nrelevant to this case contains a false statement which was knowingly or recklessly made and \nnecessary to the finding of probable cause. I also note that in my review of the FISA applications \nrelevant to this case, I have not observed any false statements, let alone false statements made \nknowingly or recklessly that would be necessary to the finding of probable cause. Defendants' \nrequest for a Franks hearing is denied. \nI next consider the motions for disclosure and suppression under FISA Section 702 (Doc. \nNos. 140, 146). \nIII. \n20 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  21 of 53.  PageID #: 9764\nA.  FISA Section 702 \nAs originally enacted, FISA defined \"electronic surveillance\" to cover four types of \ndomestically-focused foreign intelligence collection activities. See 50 U.S.C. § 180l(f); United \nStates v.  Hasbajrami, No. 11-CR-623, 2016 WL 1029500, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2016). \nBecause the definition did not apply to surveillance conducted outside the United States, \nCongress decided to modernize FISA by enacting, in 2007, the Protect America Act (\"P AA''). \nHasbajrami, 2016 WL I 029500, at *4. Under the PAA, the Director of National Intelligence \n(\"DNI\") and the Attorney General could authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence \ninformation concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States. !d. To \nauthorize an acquisition, the DNI and the Attorney General had to certify (i) that there were \nreasonable targeting procedures in place to ensure that the surveillance targeted persons \nreasonably believed to be outside the United States, (ii) that the minimization procedures in place \nsatisfied FISA's requirements, and (iii) and that a significant purpose of the acquisition was to \nobtain foreign intelligence information. !d. The P AA, however, expired in February 2008 due to \na sunset provision. !d. at *5. In response, Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act in July \n2008. !d. \nSection 702 of the FAA, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 188la, \"supplements pre-existing FISA \nauthority by creating a new framework under which the Government may seek the FISC's \nauthorization of certain foreign intelligence targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons \nlocated abroad.\" Clapper, 568 U.S. at 404. Section 702, unlike FISA Titles I and III, allows for \nforeign intelligence acquisition without a requirement that the Government first demonstrate \nprobable cause that the target of the collection is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. !d. \nAlso unlike the surveillance and searches conducted under Titles I and III, under Section 702, the \n21 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  22 of 53.  PageID #: 9765\nGovernment can engage in foreign intelligence collection without first specifying the nature and \nlocation of each of the facilities or places at which the acquisition will occur. !d. \nCongress reauthorized Section 702 acquisitions in January 2018 with the passage of the \nFISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 201 7. \n1.  Authorization \nThe Attorney General and the DNI may, upon the issuance of an order from the FISC, \njointly authorize the \"targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United \nStates\" for a period of up to one year to acquire foreign intelligence information. 50 U.S. C. § \n1881a(a).4 An authorization for Section 702 acquisition is subject to several limitations. The \nauthorization \n(I) may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be \nlocated in the United States; \n(2) may not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be located outside \nthe United States if the purpose of such acquisition is to target a particular, \n!mown person reasonably believed to be in the United States; \n(3) may not intentionally target a United States person reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside the United States; \n(4 ) may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and \nall intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in \nthe United States; [and] \n(5) may not intentionally acquire communications that contain a reference to, but \nare not to or from, a target of an acquisition authorized under subsection (a), \nexcept as provided under section 103(b) of the FISA Amendments \nReauthorization Act of2017; and \n(6) shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the [Fourth Amendment]. \nld. § 188la(b). \n2.  Submission to the FISC \n4 \"Foreign intelligence information\" has the same defmition in § 188la that it has in § 1801( e). See 50 \nU.S.C. § 188l(a). \n22 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  23 of 53.  PageID #: 9766\nBefore the Government can acquire foreign intelligence information under Section 702, \nthe Government must, with limited exceptions, obtain the FISC's approval of (I) the \nGovernment's certification regarding the proposed collection, (2) the applicable targeting \nprocedures, and (3) the applicable minimization procedures. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a), (c)(1)(B), \n(h)(! )(A), (j). \nIn the Government's certification, the Attorney General and the DNI must attest that \n(1) There are targeting procedures in place, which have been or will be submitted for approval \nby the FISC, that are reasonably designed to ensure that the acquisition is limited to targeting \nperson reasonably believed to be located outside the United States and to prevent the \nintentional acquisition of purely domestic communications; \n(2) The minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures set forth in \nFISA Titles I and III (50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h), 1821(4)) and have been or will be submitted for \napproval by the FISC; \n(3) Guidelines have been adopted by the Attorney General to ensure compliance with the \nlimitations set forth in § 1881 a(b) and to ensure that an application for a FISC order is filed; \n(4) The targeting and minimization procedures and guidelines are consistent with the Fourth \nAmendment; \n(5) A significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information; \n(6) The acquisition involves obtaining foreign intelligence information from or with the \nassistance of an electronic communication service provider; and \n(7) The acquisition complies with the limitations set forth in§ !881a(b). 50 U.S.C. § \n188la(h)(2)(A). \n23 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  24 of 53.  PageID #: 9767\nThe Government's certification must include copies of the targeting and minimization \nprocedures. !d. § 1881a(h)(2)(B). The certification must \"be supported, as appropriate, by the \naffidavit of any appropriate official in the area of national security\" who is either \"appointed by \nthe President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" or \"the head of an element of \nthe intelligence community.\" !d. § 1881 a(h)(2)(C). And the certification must include either \"an \neffective date for the authorization that is at least 30 days after the submission of the written \ncertification to the [FISC]\" or, if the acquisition has already begun or the effective date is less \nI \nthan 30 days after the certification's submission, \"the date the acquisition began or the effective \ndate for the acquisition.\" !d. § 188la(h)(2)(D). \nThe Government's targeting procedures must be reasonably designed to (a) ensure that \nany authorized acquisition \"is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States\" and (b) \"prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as \nto which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be \nlocated in the United States.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(d)(l). And the Government's minimization \nprocedures must comport with the definition of the term as found in FISA Titles I and III (50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1801(h), 1821(4)). !d.§ 1881a(e)(l). \n3.  FISC Order \nThe FISC must review (I) the Government's certification, (2) the applicable targeting \nprocedures, and (3) the applicable minimization procedures, along with any amendments to the \ncertification and procedures. 50 U.S.C. § 1881aG)(l)(A).5 The FISC reviews the certification to \nensure that it contains all the required elements. Id.  § 1881a(j)(2)(A). And the FISC reviews the \ntargeting and minimization procedures to assess whether they comport with the requirements \n5 Under the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of2017, the FISC must also review the querying \nprocedures adopted by the Attorney General and the DNI. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881 a(t)(1), (j)(l)(A). This \nnewly added requirement is not implicated in the present case. \n24 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  25 of 53.  PageID #: 9768\ndescribed above. Id § 1881a(j)(2)(B), (C). The FISC must conduct this review not later than 30 \ndays after receiving the Government's submission. Id § 1881a(j)(1)(B). \nIn contrast to FISC approval of surveillance and searches conducted under FISA Titles I \nand III, FISC approval of Section 702 acquisitions does not entail an individualized court order \nfor each person to be targeted. Hasbajrami, 2016 WL 1029500, at *5. Rather, the FISC approves \nannual submissions by the Attorney General and the DNI, thereby authorizing the acquisition of \nforeign intelligence information through the targeting of non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to \nbe located outside the United States. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a), (i)(3); Hasbajrami, 2016 WL \n1029500, at *5. \nIf the FISC finds that the Government's certification contains the required elements and \nthat the targeting procedures and minimization procedures comply with the statutory \nrequirements and with the Fourth Amendment, the FISC \"shall enter an order approving the \ncertification and the use, or continued use [in limited circumstances], of the procedures for the \nacquisition.\" 50 U.S.C. § 188la(j)(3)(A). If, however, the FISC finds deficiencies in the \ncertification, targeting procedures, or minimization procedures, the FISC must issue an order \ndirecting the Government to-at the Govermnent' s election and to the extent required by the \norder-(i) correct, within 30 days, any deficiency identified by the order or (ii) cease, or not \nbegin, the implementation of the authorization. Id § l881a(j)(3)(B). \n4.  Section 702 Acquisition \nThere are two types of Section 702 collection: PRISM and upstream. Hasbajrami, 2016 \nWL l 029500, at *6. When utilizing PRISM collection, the Government identifies the user \naccounts it wants to monitor and sends a \"selector\"-a specific communications facility, such as \na target's email address or telephone number-to the relevant communications service provider. \n25 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  26 of 53.  PageID #: 9769\nld The Government then compels the service provider, through a directive, to provide it with \ncommunications sent to or from the selector. ld This process is known as \"tasking\" the selector. \nSee id. PRISM collection, which intercepts \"to/from\" communications, can result in the \ninterception of communications with U.S. persons if the target communicates with such a person. \nI d. \nThe Govermnent has represented this case does not involve upstream collection. (Doc. \nNo. 191 at 19.) For background though, upstream collection involves the acquisition of \ncommunications through the compelled assistance of the providers that control the \ntelecommunications backbone within the United States. Hasbajrami, 2016 WL 1029500, at *6. \nAs with PRISM collection, upstream collection intercepts \"to/from\" communications. ld \nUpstream, however, also allows for the interception of \"about\" communications, which are \ncommunications that refer to, or are \"about,\" a particular selector. Id. If a targeted email address \nwere to appear in the body of an email, that email would, for example, constitute an \"about\" \ncommunication. !d. Due to its interception of \"about\" communications, upstream collection can \nresult in the acquisition of wholly domestic communications of non-targeted persons. See id. \n5.  Oversight \nSection 702 requires that, at least every six months, the Attorney General and the DNI \nperiodically assess the Government's compliance with the targeting procedures, minimization \nprocedures, and relevant compliance guidelines. 50 U.S. C. § 1881a(m)(l ). The Attorney General \nand the DNI must submit those assessments to the FISC and to congressional oversight \ncommittees. Jd \nThe Inspector General of the Department of Justice and the Inspector General of each \nelement of the intelligence community authorized to acquire information through Section 702 \n26 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  27 of 53.  PageID #: 9770\nmust, among other things, review the number of Section 702 targets that were later detennined to \nbe located in the United States. 50 U.S.C. § l88la(m)(2). The head of each element of the \nintelligence community conducting Section 702 acquisitions must, annually, conduct a similar \nreview. !d. § 188la(m)(3). \nAdditionally, the Attorney General must, at least every six months, \"fully inform\" the \nrelevant congressional oversight committees about the implementation of Section 702. 50 U.S.C. \n§ 188lf(a). \n6.  District Court Review \nInformation acquired through Section 702 surveillance is \"deemed to be information \nacquired from an electronic surveillance pursuant to [FISA Title I]\" for purposes of an aggrieved \nperson's motion to suppress. 50 U.S.C. § 188le(a)(l). So, under Section 702, an aggrieved \nperson can move to suppress PIS A-obtained or -derived evidence that the Government seeks to \nuse against him in a trial; hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court. See id.  § 1806( e). \nAn aggrieved person can move for suppression on the grounds that (I) the information was \nunlawfully acquired or (2) the surveillance was not made in conformity with the FISC's order. \nSee id. \nAnd when the Government files an affidavit from the Attorney General-as the \nGovernment has done here-in which the Attorney General states under oath that disclosure or \nan adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States, the district court \nmust review the FISA materials in camera and ex parte. 50 U.S. C. § 1806(f). When an affidavit \nfrom the Attorney General has been filed, the court may only order the disclosure of the FISA \nmaterials \"where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality \nof the surveillance.\" !d. \n27 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  28 of 53.  PageID #: 9771\nB.  Disclosure of Section 702 Materials \nDefendants have moved for the disclosure of documents and materials concerning the \nGovernment's acquisitions under Section 702. (Doc. No. 140 at 1.) In support of this request, \nDefendants note that on August 11,2016, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \nreleased the 2015 Section 702 minimization procedures for the NSA, CIA, FBI, and National \nCounterterrorism Center (\"NCTC\"). (ld at 2.) Defendants then point to a November 6, 2015 \nFISC opinion in which that court identifies numerous incidents where the intelligence agencies \nfailed to comply with the approved minimization procedures. (!d. at 2-3 .) Further, Defendants \nstate that prosecutors in other national security cases have disclosed information about the \nPRISM and upstream collection programs. (ld at 3.) \nDefendants' arguments demonstrate that the Government has, on several occasions, \nvoluntarily released to the public declassified information on FISA Section 702 surveillance. \nHere, however, aside from its representation that this case does not involve upstream collection, \nthe Government has not offered to voluntarily release information. (See Doc. No. 191 at 19, 95.) \nNor has the Government indicated the information sought by Defendants is, or will be, \ndeclassified. (See id at 95.) Instead, the Government has submitte.d an affidavit in which the \nAttorney General stated under oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing on this matter would \nharm the national security of the United States. (See id. at 28.) Consequently, I may only order \nthe disclosure ofthe FISA materials if the disclosure is necessary to make an accurate \ndetermination of the legality of the acquisition. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(t), 1881e(a). \nI have reviewed, ex parte and in camera, the FISA Section 702 materials submitted by the \nGovernment. And through this review, I conclude that I can determine, on its own, whether the \nchallenged Section 702 acquisition was lawful.  Consequently, disclosure is not necessary to \n28 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  29 of 53.  PageID #: 9772\nmake an accurate determination of the legality of the acquisition, see 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f), \n1881e(a), and Defendants' request for the disclosure of the Section 702 materials is denied. \nDisclosure of Section 702 material is also permitted \"to the extent that due process \nrequires\" it. 50 U.S.C. § 1806(g); see id.  § 188le(a). The due process exception, however, does \nnot apply here. As noted earlier, the exception encompasses only those materials that would be \ndiscoverable under Brady. See Aziz, 228 F. Supp. 3d at 370; Amawi, 531 F. Supp. 2d at 837. And \nhere, my review of the Section 702 materials reveals no exculpatory information that would need \nto be disclosed under Brady. \nC.  Suppression of Section 702-0btained or -Derived Evidence \nDefendants also move to suppress the evidence obtained or derived from FISA Section \n702 acquisitions. (Doc. No. 146 at 1.) They argue that this evidence should be suppressed \nbecause (I) Section 702 violates the Fourth Amendment and (2) the acquisitions here may have \nviolated Section 702's statutory procedures. (See Doc. No. 147 at 19-23, 36-37.) \n1.  Fourth Amendment Argument \nDefendants contend that Section 702 acquisitions are unconstitutional because they are \nsubject to, but fail to satisfY, the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. (See Doc. No. 147 at \n19-23.) The warrant requirement, Defendants argue, \"presupposes a number of measures that are \nconspicuously missing from the search and seizure of electronic communications under Section \n702\": (I) a warrant authorizing the search and seizure; (2) based upon probable cause; (3) \ndescribing the place to be searched and the items to be seized with particularity; (4) based on an \naffidavit under oath or affirmation; ( 5) issued by a neutral and detached magistrate operating in a \njudicial capacity; and (6) procedures assuring compliance with the terms of the warrant in its \nexecution. (Jd.  at 23.) \n29 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  30 of 53.  PageID #: 9773\nDefendants appear to challenge the constitutionality of Section 702 on its face. (See Doc. \nNo. 146 at 1-2; Doc. No. 147 at 19-36.) To succeed on a facial challenge, Defendants would \nneed to establish that no set of circumstances exists under which Section 702 would be valid. See \nUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). But in the exercise of judicial restraint, and \ngiven that the Government \"implemented [the statute] in a defined context\" in this case, I will \nlimit Defendants' challenge to an as-applied challenge. Hasbajrami, 2016 WL 1029500, at *7 \n(quoting In re Directives, 551 F.3d 1004, 1010 (FISCR 2008)); see Warshak v.  United States, \n532 F.3d 521, 529 (6th Cir. 2008) (\"Exercising judicial restraint in a facial challenge frees the \nCourt not only from unnecessary pronouncements on constitutional issues, but also from \npremature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be \ncloudy.\" (quoting United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17,22 (1960))). \nThe Fourth Amendment states: \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants \nshall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and \nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \nseized. \nU.S. Const. amend. IV. The Supreme Court, however, has not interpreted the Fourth Amendment \nto require a warrant, a probable cause determination, or, in fact, any measure of individualized \nsuspicion in every circumstance, for a search to be lawful. See Nat 'I Treasury Emp.  Union v.  Von \nRaab, 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989); United States v. Muhtorov, 187 F. Supp. 3d 1240, 1253 (D. \nColo. 2015); United States v. Mohamud, No. 3:10-cr-00475, 2014 WL 2866749, at *12 (D. Or. \nJune 24, 2014). And, as critical here, when the Government's actions are \"directed against aliens \nin foreign territory,\" the Fourth Amendment's protections do not apply. United States v. \nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 267 (1990). \n30 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  31 of 53.  PageID #: 9774\nIn Verdugo-Urquidez, the Supreme Court considered the scope of the Fourth \nAmendment's protections for non-citizens with no substantial voluntary connection to the United \nStates. See 494 U.S. at 261, 264-75. The Court began its analysis in by looking to the text of the \nConstitution. !d. at 264-66. This textual exegesis, the Court noted, suggests that \"the people\" \nwho enjoy the Fourth Amendment's protections constitute the \"class of persons who are a part of \na national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country \nto be considered part of that community.\" !d. at 265, 274-75; see U.S. Canst. amend. IV (\"The \nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated ....\" (emphasis added)). Guided by this \nunderstanding of the amendment's scope, the Supreme Court concluded that the Fourth \nAmendment's protections did not apply to the respondent because, \"[a]t the time of the search, \nhe was a citizen and resident of Mexico with no voluntary attachment to the United States, and \nthe place searched was located in Mexico.\" Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 274-75. \nThe Supreme Court supported its holding through an analysis of the drafting history and \ncontemporary views of the Fourth Amendment as well as relevant case law and practical \nconsiderations. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 265-74. The drafting history of the Fourth \nAmendment suggested that its purpose was \"to restrict searches and seizures which might be \nconducted by the United States in domestic matters.\" Id. at 266. And contemporaries of the \nframers seemed to view the amendment as having no application to the nation's activities \n\"directed against aliens in foreign territory.\" !d. at 267. In earlier cases, the Supreme Court had \nfound that non-citizens enjoyed certain constitutional rights. !d. at 270-71. But those cases \ninvolved non-citizens who had \"come within the territory of the United States and developed \nsubstantial connections with [the] country.\" Id. at 271; see also Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. \n31 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  32 of 53.  PageID #: 9775\n763, 770 (1950) (stating that a non-citizen is \"accorded a generous and ascending scale of rights \nas he increases his identity with our society\"). The respondent, by contrast, \"had no previous \nsignificant voluntary connection with the United States.\" Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 271. \nPractical concerns also favored a narrow scope for the Fourth Amendment's protections. As the \nSupreme Court noted, \"[t]he United States frequently employs Armed Forces outside this \ncountry ... for the protection of American citizens or national security. Application of the Fourth \nAmendment to those circumstances could significantly disrupt the ability of the political \nbranches to respond to foreign situations involving our national interest.\" ld. at 273-74 (citation \nomitted). Officials in the executive and legislative branches \"are sworn to uphold the \nConstitution, and they presumably desire to follow its commands. But [a] global view of [the \nFourth Amendment's] applicability would plunge them into a sea of uncertainty as to what might \nbe reasonable in the way of searches and seizures conducted abroad.\" Id at 274. \na.  Warrant Requirement \nSection 702 surveillance targets non-U.S. persons located outside of the United States. \nSee 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(b). But, of course, this does not mean that under Section 702 the \nGovernment acquires only foreign communications. If a U.S. person communicates with a \ntargeted individual, the U.S. person's communication will be incidentally acquired. (See Doc. \nNo. 191 at 18-20, 30.) \nThe Fourth Amendment's Protections Do Not Apply to Farooq \nAssuming that Farooq was a target of the Section 702 acquisitions, (footnote added) \nThe identity of the target( s) of the acquisitions is classified.  For the purpose of addressing \nDefendants' argument, this discussion assumes that Farooq was a 702 target. \n32 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  33 of 53.  PageID #: 9776\nDefendants contend that under Verdugo-Urquidez the Fourth Amendment's protections apply to \nFarooq because (i) he has substantial connections to the United States and (ii) the acquisitions at \nissue purportedly occurred on United States soil. If Farooq has substantial connections to the \nUnited States, the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement might apply to the acquisitions at \nissue and, in turn, the incidental collection of the communication(s) at issue. \nThe facts regarding Farooq's citizenship and connections to the United States are not in \ndispute. Farooq is a citizen oflndia. (See Doc. No. 147 at 1.) He was born, however, in the \nUnited Arab Emirates (\"U.A.E.\"), where he lived from his birth (in 1978) untill991.  (!d.) \nFarooq came to the United States in August 1999 to attend Louisiana State University (\"LSU\"). \n(Id.) Farooq studied at LSU through May 2001, when he received a master's degree in electrical \nengineering. (!d.) He then emolled in an engineering Ph.D. program at Ohio State University \n(\"OSU\"). (!d.) Farooq remained a student at OSU until August 2004, when he returned to the \nU.A.E. after his father's death. (Id.)Farooq subsequently visited the United States twice \n(excluding his current presence in the country). He was in the United States on a B-1/B-2 non \nimmigrant visitor visa from October 26 to November 19, 2007, and from March 18 to April2, \n2008. (Doc. No. 191 at 76.) Farooq made the March 2008 trip to marry his wife, a United States \ncitizen, in Orlando, Florida. (!d.; Doc. No. 147 at 8.) Despite his marriage, though, Farooq did \nnot remain in the country. (Doc. No. 191 at 76.) \nThese facts do not evince a voluntary connection to the United States sufficient to bestow \non Farooq the Fourth Amendment's protections. Farooq studied in the United States for roughly \nfive years. But Farooq finished his studies in the United States years before the acquisitions at \nissue occurred. And after finishing his studies and leaving the United States in 2004, Farooq \nreturned to visit the country only twice in the subsequent years-for around 25 days in 2007 and \n33 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  34 of 53.  PageID #: 9777\nfor around 16 days in 2008. Although Farooq may have established a sufficient voluntary \nconnection to the United States to avail himself of the Fourth Amendment's protections during \nhis time as a student, Farooq's connection to the United States has weakened over the years. Cf \nIbrahim v. Dep 't of Homeland Sec., 669 F.3d 983, 997 (9th Cir. 2012) (concluding that the \nplaintiff had established a significant voluntary counection to the United States during her four \nyears at Stanford despite a trip abroad during that time because \"[t]he purpose of her trip was to \nfurther, not to sever, her connection to the United States\" and because she \"intended her stay \nabroad to be brief'). A non-citizen's voluntary connection to the United States is not a lifetime \nstatus that, once conferred, lasts indefinitely irrespective of the non-citizen's intervening life \nchoices. Cf Shaughnessy v.  United States ex rei. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206,208,213-15 (1953) \n(concluding that a 19-month overseas absence of a lawful permanent resident who had \npreviously lived in the United States for 25 years constituted a \"clear break in [his] continuous \nresidence here,\" such that he had no Fifth Amendment right to challenge his denial of re-entry). \nA voluntary connection is just that-voluntary. Just as a non-citizen can choose to establish a \nconnection with the United States, he can also choose to sever or attenuate that connection. Cf \nid; Ibrahim, 669 F.3d at 997. By living abroad since his departure from OSU in 2004, and then \nmaking only two brief trips to the country in the intervening years, Farooq attenuated the \nconnection to the United States that he may have formed while studying here. \nThat.Farooq's wife is a United States citizen does little to alter the Fourth Amendment \nanalysis. The nationality ofFarooq's wife does not automatically amount to a substantial \nvoluntary connection between Farooq and the United States. Farooq's marriage is to an \nindividual, not a nation. Notably, Farooq lived outside the United States despite his marriage to a \nUnited States citizen. Farooq came to the United States for the wedding and then promptly left \n34 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  35 of 53.  PageID #: 9778\nthe country. He remained abroad until he was extradited to the United States to stand trial in this \ncase. \nFarooq's second argument for the application of the Fourth Amendment-the location of \nthe Section 702 acquisitions-also falls flat. Farooq argues, based on his knowledge of the \nlogistics of Section 702 collection, that the acquisitions took place in the United States. (Doc. \nNo. 147 at 18 & n.21.)  According to Farooq, U.S.-based electronic communications companies \nare compelled through FISC directives to produce communications to the Government. (!d.  at \n18.) The NSA collects and stores the information in databases located in the United States, and \nthe intelligence agencies, including the NSA, FBI, and CIA, can then query (i.e., search) through \nthe information. (!d.) \nThe Government does not dispute Farooq's assertion that Section 702 acquisition takes \nplace within the United States. (Doc. No. 191 at 37.) The Government argues, instead, that the \nlocation of the acquisition is not constitutionally significant in this case. (!d.) \nThe Supreme Court's opinion in Verdugo-Urquidez focused primarily on whether the \nrespondent had formed a substantial voluntary connection with the United States. See 494 U.S. at \n265-75. But the Government's argument-that the location of the search is not constitutionally \nsignificant-goes too far. In Verdugo-Urquidez, the Court listed the factual circumstances that \nguided its holding. After noting the respondent was a citizen and resident of Mexico with no \nvoluntary attachment to the United States, the Court noted the place searched was in Mexico. !d. \nat 274-75. Clearly the location ofthe search has some constitutional significance under Verdugo \nUrquidez. The question, however, is how much significance the location of the search should \ncarry. \n35 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  36 of 53.  PageID #: 9779\nAcquisitions under Section 702 are electronic. This is not a situation, for example, where \na non-citizen owns a house in the United States and the Government, claiming the Fourth \nAmendment does not apply to the non-citizen because he lacks a substantial voluntary \nconnection to the United States, searches the house without first obtaining a warrant and collects \nincriminating evidence about a U.S. person. I would likely arrive at a different conclusion in that \nsituation. When a search is electronic, the location of the search carries less weight. The more \nimportant geographic consideration is the location of the target of the acquisition. See United \nStates v. Mohamud, 843 F.3d 420, 439 (9th Cir. 2016) (\"[A]s one court put it, 'what matters here \nis the location of the target,' and not where the government literally obtained the electronic \ndata.\" (quoting Hasbajrami, 2016 WL 1029500, at *9 n.15)). \nA focus on the location of the target better comports with the Supreme Court's statements \nin Verdugo-Urquidez indicating the Fourth Amendment was not intended to apply to \nGovernment actions directed against \"aliens in foreign territory.\" 494 at 267. A focus on the \nlocation of the target also addresses the Supreme Court's concern that interpreting the Fourth \nAmendment to protect non-citizens with no substantial voluntary connection with the United \nStates \"could significantly disrupt the ability of the political branches to respond to foreign \nsituations involving our national interest.\" Id at 273-74.  Applying Fourth Amendment \nprotections to all electronic acquisitions occurring in the United States would allow numerous \naliens in foreign territory, including many suspected terrorists, to claim the protections of the \nFourth Amendment. (See Gov't Resp. to FISA Section 702 Mot. at 38.) \nFocusing on the target's location also conforms to broader Fourth Amendment \njurisprudence regarding the reasonable expectation of privacy test and the Supreme Court's \nrepeated admonition that \"the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\" Katz v.  United \n36 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  37 of 53.  PageID #: 9780\n~~ \ni \nStates, 389 U.S. 347, 511 (1967); see, e.g., Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88 (1998) \n(explaining that the Fourth Amendment \"is a personal right that must be invoked by an \nindividual\" but that \"the extent to which the Fourth Amendment protects people may depend \nupon where those people are\"); Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 96 n.S (1990) (stating that the \nFourth Amendment protects people, not places and \"provides sanctuary for citizens wherever \nthey have a legitimate expectation of privacy\"); Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740 (1979) \n(\"Consistently with Katz, this Court uniformly has held that the application of the Fourth \nAmendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a 'justifiable,' a \n'reasonable,' or a 'legitimate expectation of privacy' that has been invaded by government \naction.\"). The reasonableness of a non-citizen's expectation of privacy regarding his electronic \ncommunications typically depends on the location where he makes the communications, not on \nthe location where the United States acquires the communications. Cf Carter, 525 U.S. at 88 \n(\"We have held that 'capacity to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment depends ... \nupon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate \nexpectation of privacy in the invaded place.\"' (quoting Rakas v.  fllinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143 \n(1978))); United States v.  Yonn, 702 F.2d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir. 1983) (\"The location of the \nelectronic equipment does not alter the irrefutable fact that [the defendant] had no justifiable \nexpectation of privacy in his conversation .... \"). \nIn sum, assuming Farooq was a Section 702 target, he lacked a substantial voluntary \nconnection to the United States at the time of the Section 702 acquisitions sufficient to confer \nupon him Fourth Amendment protections. That the acquisitions took place in the United States \ndoes not alter this conclusion. \n37 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  38 of 53.  PageID #: 9781\ni.  No Warrant Required \nThe question, then, is whether the Government needed to obtain a warrant before it \nincidentally acquired U.S. persons' communications under Section 702 while targeting non-U.S. \npersons located outside of the United States. Consistent with other courts that have answered this \nquestion, and consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Verdugo-Urquidez, I conclude that \nno warrant was required for the acquisitions in this case. See Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 267, \n274-74; Mohamud, 843 F.3d at 439; Hasbajrami, 2016 WL 1029500, at *8-9; Mohamud, 2014 \nWL 2866749, at *14-15. And because no warrant is required, the lack of warrant-related features \nin Section 702 (i.e., the need for a neutral and detached magistrate to make a probable cause \nfinding and describe the scope of the search with particularity) does not render the statute \nunconstitutional. \nCourts \"have long dealt with the issue of incidental interception of non-targeted persons' \ncommunications.\" Hasbajrami, 2016 WL 1029500, at *9; see, e.g., United States v. Kahn, 415 \nU.S. 143, 157-58 (1974) (holding that the interception of a wife's conversations on her home \ntelephone was incidental, and not in violation of the Fourth Amendment, because her criminal \nactivities were not foreseen when the Title III wiretap order targeting her husband was obtained); \nUnited States v. Butenko, 494 F.2d 593,608 (3d Cir. 1974) (finding warrantless surveillance for \nforeign intelligence purposes constitutional even though the conversations of United States' \ncitizens would be overheard). As one example, electronic surveillance conducted under FISA \nTitle I incidentally collects the communications of U.S. persons. (See Doc. No. 191 at 35-36.) \nAnd traditional FISA surveillance, in fact, \"is likely to capture a significantly larger \nconcentration of non-targeted U.S. persons' communications than Section 702\" because \n38 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  39 of 53.  PageID #: 9782\ntraditional FISA surveillance does not target only foreign communications. (See id at 36.) \nDespite this incidental collection, the Sixth Circuit, as well as numerous other courts, have \nrejected Fourth Amendment challenges to FISA Title I surveillance. See Damrah, 412 FJd at \n625. As the FISCR explained in In re Directives, \"[i]t is settled beyond peradventure that \nincidental collections occurring as a result of constitutionally permissible acquisitions do not \nrender those acquisitions unlawful.\" 551 F.3d at 1015; see also Mohamud, 843 FJd at 440 (\"The \nfact that the government knew some U.S. persons' communications would be swept up during \nforeign intelligence gathering does not make such collection any more unlawful in this context \nthan in the Title III or traditional FISA context.\"); Hasbajrami, 2016 WL 1029500, at *8-9 \n(\"[W]hen surveillance is lawful in the first place-where it is the domestic surveillance of U.S. \npersons pursuant to a warrant, or the warrantless surveillance of non-U.S. persons who are \nabroad-the incidental interception of non-targeted U.S. persons' communications with the \ntargeted persons is also lawful.\" (footnote omitted)). And here, the incidental collection of \nDefendants' communications did not render unlawful the constitutionally permissible \nacquisitions targeting non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. \nb.  Reasonableness \nMy conclusion that no warrant was required to conduct the Section 702 acquisitions here \ndoes not necessarily mean that the Fourth Amendment offers Defendants no protection. Courts \nconsidering the constitutionality of Section 702 have assumed the Fourth Amendment offers \nsome protections to the U.S. persons and persons in the United States whose communications \nhave been incidentally collected. See Mohamud, 843 F.3d at 441 & n.26. \n\"Even if a warrant is not required, a search is not beyond Fourth Amendment scrutiny; \nfor it must be reasonable in its scope and marmer of execution.\" Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. 435, \n39 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  40 of 53.  PageID #: 9783\n448 (2013). Finding that no warrant is required to conduct a search \"is merely to aclmowledge \nthat 'rather than employing a per se rule of unreasonableness, [the court must] balance'\" the \ninterests at stake to determine if the search was reasonable. !d. (Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. \n326, 331 (2001)). In balancing the interests, the court examines the totality of the circumstances \nand weighs, \"on the one hand, the degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual's \nprivacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.\" Samson v.  California, 547 U.S. 843, 848 (2006). \nAs the Supreme Court has explained on various occasions, the Government's interest in \nprotecting the nation from terrorism and foreign threats is an urgent and compelling interest of \nthe highest order. See, e.g., Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010) (\"[T]he \nGovernment's interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order.\"); Haig \nv. Agee, 453 U.S. 280,307 (1981) (\"It is 'obvious and unarguable' that no governmental interest \nis more compelling than the security of the Nation.\" (citation omitted)); see also In re Directives, \n551 F.3d at 1012 (\"Here, the relevant governmental interest-the interest in national security-is \nof the highest order of magnitude.\"). And acquiring foreign intelligence information through \nSection 702 is crucial to these national security efforts, the Government argues. (Doc. 191 at 53-\n54.) \nOn the other side of the scale are the privacy interests that Defendants and other U.S. \npersons and persons in the United States have in their electronic communications, both domestic \nand international. (See Doc. No. 147 at 31.) This is not an insignificant interest, the Sixth Circuit \nsuggested in 2010: \nSince the advent of email, the telephone call and the letter have waned in \nimportance, and an explosion of Internet-based communication has taken place. \nPeople are now able to send sensitive and intimate information, instantaneously, \nto friends, family, and colleagues half a world away .... Commerce has also \n40 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  41 of 53.  PageID #: 9784\ntaken hold in email. Online purchases are often documented in email accounts, \nand email is frequently used to remind patients and clients of imminent \nappointment. In short, \"account\" is an apt word for the conglomeration of stored \nmessages that comprises an email account, as it provides an account of its owner's \nlife. By obtaining access to someone's email, govermnent agents gain the ability \nto peer deeply into his activities. \nWarshak, 631 F.3d at 284. \nThe Government contends U.S. persons and persons located in the United States have \nsignificantly diminished, or nonexistent, privacy interests in communications that \"have been \ntransmitted to or obtained from non-U.S. persons located abroad.\" (Doc. No. 191 at 55.) The \nGovernment notes that individuals have no constitutional interest in the communications \nfacilities used by the people targeted under Section 702. (!d.) And the Government notes that \nindividuals lack a legitimate expectation of privacy in emails that have already reached their \nrecipient. (See id. at 56-57.) \nI agree an individual loses some expectation of privacy in an electronic communication \nafter it has reached its recipient. See Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 333 (6th Cir. 2001) (\"[Email \nusers] would lose a legitimate expectation of privacy in an e-mail that had already reached its \nrecipient; at this moment, thee-mailer would be analogous to a letter-writer, whose 'expectation \nof privacy ordinarily terminates upon delivery' of the letter.\" (citation omitted)). But the loss is \nnot complete. See Warshak, 631 F.3d at 286-87 (holding that \"a subscriber enjoys a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in the contents of emails 'that are stored with, or sent or received through, \na commercial ISP'\" and neither the ability nor the right of a third-party intermediary to access \nthe contents of a communication is sufficient to extinguish a reasonable expectation of privacy \n(citation omitted)). An individual still retains a limited expectation of privacy in his electronic \ncommunications after the communication has reached its recipient. See Muhtorov, 187 F. Supp. \n3d at 1255. \n41 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  42 of 53.  PageID #: 9785\nWhen this limited expectation of privacy in delivered electronic communications is \nweighed against the Government's interest in acquiring foreign intelligence information through \nSection 702, the Government's interest prevails. And it prevails in large part because the \nstatutory safeguards and procedures required of the Government to convince me the acquisition \nhere was reasonable. Under Section 702: the DNI and the Attorney General must certify that \ntargeting and minimization procedures are in place to protect the privacy of persons located in \nthe United States; the Government's certification, targeting procedures, and minimization \nprocedures are all subject to FISC review; targeting procedures must be \"reasonably designed\" to \n\"ensure that any acquisition authorized under [the certification] is limited to targeting persons \nreasonably believed to be located outside the United States\" and to \"prevent the intentional \nacquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at \nthe time of the acquisition to be located in the United States\"; a significant purpose of the \ncollection must be to obtain foreign intelligence information; minimization procedures limit how \nlong information concerning U.S. persons can be retained and how it can be disseminated; and \nthe DNI and the Attorney General must periodically assess the Government's compliance with \nthe targeting procedures, the minimization procedures, and with the relevant compliance \nguidelines. (See Doc. No. 191 at 58-73.) \nWhen viewed under the totality of the circumstances, I find the Section 702 acquisitions \nhere were reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. \n2.  Statutory Argument \nDefendants next ask for suppression of the evidence obtained or derived from Section \n702 acquisitions because, they argue, the acquisitions may have violated Section 702's statutory \nprocedures. I have carefully reviewed the FISA Section 702 materials submitted by the \n42 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  43 of 53.  PageID #: 9786\nGovernment. And based on that ex parte, in camera review, I conclude that all the statutorily \nrequired procedures were followed here. Defendants' request for suppression of the Section 702 \nmaterials is, accordingly, denied. \nI now consider Defendants' request for notice and disclosure regarding surveillance \ntechniques (Doc. No. 131). \nIV. \nIn a motion aimed broadly at all the Government's surveillance, Defendants request \nnotice of (I) each surveillance technique the Government used to obtain information about his \ncommunications or activities, (2) the timing or duration of each surveillance technique, (3) the \nlegal authority the Government relied upon in conducting the surveillance, and ( 4) the evidence \nobtained or derived from each surveillance technique. (Doc. No. 131 at 1.) Defendants propose \nthe Government may have surveilled them using a variety of means and authorizations, including \nFISA, FAA, Executive Order 12333, the Warrantless Wiretapping Program (also known as the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program), and National Security Letters. (Id. at 2-6.) \nA.  Due Process \nDefendants begin by arguing the Constitution's due process protections mandate the \nGovernment's disclosure of the requested information. (See Doc. No. 131 at 11-13.) None of the \ncases cited by Defendants stand for that proposition though. \nIn United States v.  United States Dist. Court (Keith), 407 U.S. 297,318-24 (1972), for \nexample, the Supreme Court held that the Government must comply with the Fourth \nAmendment's requirement of prior judicial approval before conducting domestic security \nsurveillance. Because the Government's surveillance in the underlying action was unlawful, the \nGovernment was obligated to disclose the impermissibly intercepted conversations to the \n43 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  44 of 53.  PageID #: 9787\ndefendant. !d. at 324. Importantly though, the Supreme Court in Keith did not consider the \nFourth Amendment considerations associated withjoreign intelligence surveillance-the \nsurveillance at issue here. !d. at 321-22. \nIn Jencks v.  United States, 353 U.S, 657, 672 (1957), the Supreme Court held that a \ncriminal action must be dismissed if the Government refuses to comply with an order to produce \n\"relevant statements or reports in its possession of government witnesses touching the subject \nmatter of their testimony at the trial.\" Defendants, however, request information about \nsurveillance techniques, not statements or reports of Government witnesses. \nBerger, Alderman, Kolod, and Dalia and are equally inapposite to Defendants' request. \nNowhere in these cases did the Supreme Court establish a broad right to notice of, and \ninformation about, each surveillance technique used by the Government. In Berger, the Supreme \nCourt found that a New York eavesdrop statute violated the Fourth Amendment because the \nstatute's \"blanket grant of permission to eavesdrop [was] without adequate judicial supervision \nor protective measures.\" Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 60 (1967). The statute was \nunconstitutional because, among other reasons, it had no notice requirement and did not \n\"overcome [that] defect by requiring some showing of special facts.\" !d. The Court's conclusion \nthat the statute violated the Fourth Amendment did not, however, suggest that the Constitution's \ndue process provisions grant criminal defendants a right to notice of all surveillance techniques, \nIn Alderman and Kolod, the Supreme Court outlined the procedures required when the \ngovernment intends to use evidence from surveillance that, unlike here, has already been deemed \nunlawfuL See Alderman v.  United States, 394 U.S. 165, 182-83 (1969) (holding that surveillance \nmaterials needed to be produced and an adversarial hearing held where the prosecution planned \nto use evidence from surveillance that had already been deemed unlawful); Kolod v.  United \n44 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  45 of 53.  PageID #: 9788\nStates, 390 U.S. 136, 137 (1968) (remanding and directing the district court to hold a hearing \nwhere the government admitted that it had conducted unlawful electronic eavesdropping). And in \nDalia, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Fourth Amendment prohibits covert \nentry onto private premises for the installation of legal electronic bugging equipment. See United \nStates v. Dalia, 441 U.S. 238, 246-48 (1979). Addressing this issue in the context of domestic \ncriminal surveillance authorized under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968, the Supreme Court noted that Title III provides a constitutionally adequate \nsubstitute for advance notice by requiring subsequent notice to those surveilled. Id. at 248. The \nCourt did not establish a Constitutional right to notice of all surveillance techniques used to \nsurveil a criminal defendant. \nB.  Disclosure under 18 U.S.C. § 3504 \nDefendants also cite 18 U.S.C. § 3504 in support of their request. Under§ 3504, if an \naggrieved party claims that \"evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary product of an \nunlawful act or because it was obtained by the exploitation of an unlawful act, the opponent of \nthe claim shall affirm or deny the occurrence ofthe alleged unlawful act.\" 18 U.S.C. § \n3504(a)(1). The statute provides that an \"unlawful act\" is \"any act the use of any electronic, \nmechanical, or other device ... in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or \nany regulation or standard promulgated pursuant thereto.\" Id. § 3504(b). \nDefendants request notice and information regarding each surveillance technique used by \nthe Government in this case. (See Doc. No. 131 at I, 22.) Defendants' request is undermined, \nhowever, by the plain language of§ 3504. The statute mandates that the opponent of the \nunlawful surveillance claim simply \"affirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged unlawful act.\" \n18 U.S. C.§ 3504(a)(1) (emphasis added); see In re Grand Jury Subpoena (T-112), 597 F.3d 189, \n45 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  46 of 53.  PageID #: 9789\n200 (4th Cir. 201 0) (concluding that the Government satisfied its \"obligation to affirm or deny \nTitle III surveillance\" where the Government responded to a demand under 18 U.S. C. § \n3504(a)(1) by representing that relevant entities \"were not and are not a subject of electronic \nsurveillance pursuant to Title III\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The statute does not \nprovide for detailed disclosures regarding each surveillance technique allegedly used by the \nGovernment. See 18 U.S. C.§ 3504(a)(l). \nWhen courts have directed the Government to provide more detailed affirmations or \ndenials under§ 3504, they have typically done so only when the aggrieved party's claim is \nspecific, concrete, and relevant. United States v. Amawi, 3:06CR719, 2007 WL 1431943, at* 1 \n(N.D. Ohio May 14, 2007). Defendants' claim has none of those characteristics. \nDefendants cite United States v. Alter, 482 F.2d 1016, 1027 (9th Cir. 1973), in support of \nthe proposition that§ 3504 requires more than an affirmation or denial from the Government. In \nAlter, the Government filed an affidavit in response to the appellant's allegations of unlawful \nsurveillance. Alter, 482 F.2d at 1027 & n. 17. The Ninth Circuit criticized the affidavit for its \nfailure to \"squarely,., affirm or deny\" the appellant's allegations. Id at 1027. The affidavit \nspoke \"in conclusory terms,\" lacked information about the affiant's efforts to investigate the \nappellant's allegations, failed to explain why the affiant contacted only a limited number of \nagencies as part of his investigation, and neglected to reveal the dates of claimed surveillance \nabout which the affiant inquired. Jd Integral to the Ninth Circuit's discussion, however, was the \ndetailed nature of the appellant's affidavits in which he laid out his allegations of unlawful \nsurveillance. See id (\"Alter's affidavits were sufficiently concrete and specific to make a prima \nfacie showing that on the occasions described someone was interfering with his telephone calls \nand that the F.B.I. was involved.\"). As the court explained, the Government would only be \n46 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  47 of 53.  PageID #: 9790\nobligated to affirm or deny alleged illegal surveillance under§ 3504(a) if an aggrieved party first \n\"raise[ sJ  a prima facie issue of electronic surveillance\" by revealing through affidavits or other \nevidence the dates the surveillance alleged took place and the specific facts supporting the \nparty's allegations, among other things. Id.  at 1026. \nBut here, unlike in Alter, Defendants have not submitted an affidavit or other evidence \nthat malces a prima facie showing of unlawful surveillance. Consequently, even ifi were to \nfollow the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of§ 3504 as laid out in Alter, Defendants would still not \nbe entitled to the information they request. \nC.  FISA Surveillance \nAs a subset of their broader request, Defendants ask for additional information about the \nGovernment's FISA surveillance. The Government informed Defendants that it intended to offer \ninto evidence, or otherwise use or disclose in the case against them, information obtained or \nderived from electronic surveillance, physical searches, and acquisitions under FISA Titles I and \nIII and FISA Section 702. (Doc. Nos. 28, 29, 30.) These notices, Defendants argue, are \ninsufficient because they do not provide specific information about each search or seizure \nconducted by the Government. (See Doc. No. 131 at 21.) Defendants request this additional \ninformation based on their reading ofFISA's text (i.e., 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c), 1825(d), 1881e) \nand legislative history. (See id. at 14-21.) \n\"In all cases of statutory construction, the starting point is the language employed by \nCongress.\" Vergas v.

The Government's notification requirement under FISA Title I (electronic \nsurveillance), FISA Title III (physical searches), and FISA Sections 702 and 703 (acquisitions) \nreads as follows: \nWhenever the Government intends to enter into evidence or otherwise use or \ndisclose in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, \ndepartment, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United \nStates, against an aggrieved person, any information obtained or derived from \n[electronic surveillance, a physical search, or an acquisition conducted] pursuant \nto the authority of this [chapter], the Government shall, prior to the trial, hearing, \nor other proceeding or at a reasonable time prior to an effort to so disclose or so \nuse that information or submit it in evidence, notify the aggrieved person and the \ncourt or other authority in which the information is to be disclosed or used that the \nGovernment intends to so disclose or so use such information. \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(c); see id. §§ 1825(d), !88le.6 \nDefendants interpret this notice requirement as obligating the Government to inform \nthem of (i) the specific search or seizure events at issue, (ii) the information derived from each \nevent, and (iii) the FISA provision justifying each event. (See Doc. No. 131 at 21.) According to \nDefendants, \"Congress's instruction that the government must provide notice prior to each \nproceeding in which it intends to use or disclose FISA information strongly implies that \nCongress intended the government to identify the substance of the information.\" (!d. at 16.) \nDefendants buttress their interpretation by noting Congress also authorized under FISA an \naggrieved person's request for suppression on the grounds that\"(!) the information was \n6 A similar notice requirement applies to the Government's use of information obtained or derived from a \npen register or trap and trace device. 50 U.S.C. § 1845(c). Defendants, however, do not specifically \nrequest information about collections made under that title. (See Doc. No. 131 at 14-21.) Nor do \nDefendants cite§ 1845(c), the applicable notice requirement. (See id.) \nFISA does not include a notice requirement regarding information obtained or derived from \nacquisitions under Section 215 (50 U.S.C. §§ 1861-1864), Section 704 (50 U.S.C. § 1881c), or Section \n705 (50 U.S.C. § 1881d). Defendants, in turn, do not specifically request information about acquisitions \nthat may have been made under these sections. (See Doc. No. 131 at 14-21.) \n48 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  49 of 53.  PageID #: 9792\nunlawfully acquired; or (2) the surveillance was not made in conformity with an order of \nauthorization or approval.\" (!d. (quoting 50 U.S.C. § 1S06(e)).) \nI disagree with Defendants' reading of the notice requirement. Defendants' interpretation \nadds three elements to the notice requirement that are found nowhere in the text. The notice \nrequirement is straightforward. It applies to \"any information obtained or derived from \n[electronic surveillance, a physical search, or an acquisition]\" that the Government \"intends to \nenter into evidence or otherwise use or disclose [at trial].\" 50 U.S. C. § 1S06(c); see id.  §§ \n1S25(d ), 1SS1 e. And it obligates the Government to \"notify the aggrieved person ... that the \nGovernment intends to so disclose or so use such information.\" 50 U.S. C.§ 1S06(c) (emphasis \nadded); see id.  §§ 1S25(d), ISSie. \nDefendants focus on the timing of the required disclosure-\"[w]henever the Government \nintends to enter into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in any trial, hearing, or other \nproceeding in or before any court.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1S06(c); see also id.  § 1S25(d). But the \nGovernment's obligation to provide notice of its intent to use information gathered under FISA \n\"[w]henever the Government intends to enter [it into] evidence or otherwise use or disclose [it]\" \noffers no insight into the content of the required disclosure, and it certainly does not imply that \nthe Government must disclose the specific information about each search or seizure conducted \nunder FISA that Defendants request. \nThat FISA provides an aggrieved party a statutory basis for suppressing information \ngathered under its provisions does not support Defendants' interpretation of the notice \nrequirement either. Defendants contend that a lawyer \"cannot possibly prepare or file a motion to \nsuppress 'the evidence obtained or derived from' FISA on the ground that the evidence was \nunlawfully acquired unless the defendant has notice of which information was obtained by FISA, \n49 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  50 of 53.  PageID #: 9793\nand the FISA authority under which it was sought.\" (Doc. No. 131 at 17 (quoting 50 U.S.C. § \n1806(e)).) Defendants, however, have done what they claim to be impossible. They have moved \nto suppress the evidence obtained or derived from FISA Titles I and III and FISA Section 702. \nAlthough Defendants' suppression motions were ultimately unsuccessful, their lack of success \ndid not derive from Defendants' inability to prepare or file a suppression motion. Defendants, \nlike others with standing to challenge FISA surveillance, raised their suppression motions based \non a Govermnent notice that simply communicated the Government's intent \"to offer into \nevidence, or otherwise use or disclose in any proceedings ... information obtained or derived \nfrom\" FISA collections. (E.g., Doc. No. 28.) Defendants, moreover, seem to overlook FISA's \nactual language regarding motions to suppress. The statute does not require that an aggrieved \nperson identify the challenged evidence with specificity. The statute offers a broad statement of \nthe evidence that an aggrieved person may move to suppress: he \"may move to suppress the \nevidence obtained or derived from electronic surveillance.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e) (emphasis \nadded); see id. § § 1825(f), 1881 e. \nGiven the clarity of the statute, I need not delve into FISA's legislative history. The \nGovernment's notice requirement under FISA does not entail anything beyond what the \nGovermnent has already provided to Defendants. \nD.  Prior Searches and Seizures \nAs a further subset of their discovery request, Defendants ask for additional information \nabout the \"prior searches and seizures\" through which the Government obtained evidence to \nsupport its \"applications for search warrants under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41.\" \n(Doc. No. 131 at 25.) Citing Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978), Roviaro v. \nUnited States, 353 U.S. 53, 59 (1957), and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(l)(E)(i), \n50 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  51 of 53.  PageID #: 9794\nDefendants seek \"information material to determining the legality\" of the alleged prior searches \nand seizures. (Doc. No. 131 at 25.) \nNone of these authorities substantiates Defendants' request. Under Franks, a court will \nhold an evidentiary hearing to examine the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting a finding of \nprobable cause when the criminal defendant has made a substantial preliminary showing that the \naffidavit in question contains a false statement which was (1) knowingly or recklessly made and \n(2) necessary to the finding of probable cause. See Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56, 171-72. \nNowhere in Franks, however, did the Supreme Court mandate that the Government disclose \ninformation about searches and seizures. See generally id. \nIn Roviaro, the Supreme Court identified several exceptions to the \"informer's \nprivilege\"-that is, the Government's ability to withhold from disclosure an informant's identity. \nThe Government's privilege must give way, the Court stated, \"[w]here the disclosure of an \ninformer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the \ndefense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause.\" Roviaro, 353 U.S. at \n60-61. Because Defendants do not seek to uncover the identity of a Government informant, or \nobtain the contents of an informant's communication, Roviaro lends no support to Defendants' \nrequest. \nDefendants also bring their request under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. \nInformation about the alleged prior searches and seizures is purportedly material to preparing a \ndefense, and thus discoverable under Rule 16(a)(l )(E)(i), because Defendants might be able to \nuse the information to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to the Government's subsequent, \nRule 41 search warrants. (See Doc. No. 131 at 26 (\"Evidence obtained pursuant to a search \nwarrant may ... be suppressed if the affiant relied on evidence obtained or derived from \n51 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  52 of 53.  PageID #: 9795\nunlawful government action and the affidavit fails to establish probable cause absent that \ninformation.\").) \nBut Defendants read Rule l6(a)(l)(E)(i) too broadly. The Rule only applies to '\"shield' \nclaims that 'refute the Government's arguments that the defendant committed the crime \ncharged'\" United States v. Robinson, 503 F.3d 522, 532 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. \nArmstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 462 (1996)). Moreover, under Rule l6(a)(l )(E)(i), information is not \nmaterial \"merely because the government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position.\" \nUnited States v. Lykins, 428 F. App'x 621,624 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting United Stales v. Stevens, \n985 F.2d ll75, 1180 (2d Cir. 1993)). Information is material only if\"there [is] an indication that \npre-trial disclosure would have enabled the defendant to 'alter the quantum of proof in his \nfavor.\"' Id. (quoting Stevens, 985 F.2d at 1180). \nDefendants do not request information about the alleged prior searches and seizures to \nrefute the Government's arguments that they committed the crimes charged (i.e., the \nGovernment's case-in-chief). Rather, Defendants request the information because it might allow \nthem to move for suppression of unidentified evidence obtained pursuant to subsequent search \nwarrants. (See Doc. No. 131 at 26.) Defendants imply that the requested information would alter \nthe quantum of proof in this case. (See id.) The connection is too attenuated though. Information \nabout the alleged prior searches and seizures is too disconnected from actually altering the \nquantum of proof in Defendants' favor for the information to be material under Rule \nl6(a)(l)(E)(i). See Lykins, 428 F. App'x at 624. \nNeither Franks, Roviaro, nor Rule 16(a)(l)(E)(i) entitles Defendants to the discovery \nthey request. \n52 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JJH  Doc #: 374  Filed:  09/11/18  53 of 53.  PageID #: 9796\nE.  CIPA \nLastly, Defendants argue that the Government may not rely on the Classified Information \nProcedures Act (\"CIP A\") in refusing to disclose the requested information about its surveillance \ntechniques. (See Doc. No. 131 at 24.) In a concurrently issued Memorandum Opinion, however, I \nhave determined that I may review the Government's CIP A § 4 submission in camera and ex \nparte. And to the extent that the information requested by Defendants may have been addressed \nin the Government's CIPA § 4 submission, I have already determined the Government may \ndelete that information from the documents to be produced to Defendants through discovery. \n(See id. at 7-8.) \nFor all of these reasons, I deny Defendants' request for notice and disclosure regarding \nthe Government's surveillance techniques. \nv. \nEach of Defendants' motions (Doc. Nos. 131, 140, 146, 148, 156) is, accordingly, denied. \nSo Ordered. \nsf Jeffrey J. Helmick \nUnited States District Judge \n53 ",

Again, the point needs to be stressed: Jihad today is obligatory on \nevery capable Muslim ... it is yom duty to find ways to practice it and suppmi it.\"  Awlaki then \nlisted 44 ways to suppmi jihad, including: \n4 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JZ  Doc #: 1  Filed:  09/30/15  5 of 72.  PageID #: 5\na.  Having the right intention: Awlaki stated, \"Ya u must make the intentions \nof joining the ranks of the mujahideen.  The Messenger of Allah says: 'Whoever dies and \nhas not fought or intended to fight has died on a branch of hypocrisy;\"' \nb.  Praying to Allah to award you with martyrdom:  Awlald stated, \"Asking \nAllah to die as a shaheed [martyr] pleases Allah because it shows him that you are willing \nto give your life for him.  But you need to be careful not to be merely paying lip service. \nA person who truly asks for shahadah [martyrdom] would respond to the call of Jihad \nwhenever he hears it and would eagerly search for death in the path of Allah ... Our \nculture 0f martyrdom needs to be revived because the enemy of Allah fears nothing more \nthan our love of death;\" \nc.  Jihad with your wealth: Awlaki stated, \"The financial Jihad has preceded \nthe physical Jihad in every verse except one.  This is to point out to us the importance of \nthe Jihad of wealth because Jihad depends on it: In other words, no money[,] no Jihad, \nand Jihad needs lots of it. .. Probably the most important contribution the Muslims of the \nWest could do for Jihad is J):laldng Jihad with their wealth since in many cases the \nmujal1ideen are in need of money more than they are in need of men.  As Sheikh \n. Abdullah Azzan1 puts it: 'Men are in need of Jihad and Jihad is in need of money;'\" \nd.  Ftmdraising for the mujahideen: Awlaki stated, \"In addition to paying \nfrom your own money you should also encourage others to do the same;\" \ne.  · Fighting the lies .of the Western Media:  Aw  laki stated, \"The perceptions \nof many Muslims are formed by the Western media ... this media demonizes the \nmujahideen ...

Protecting the mujahideen and preserving their secrets: Awlaki stated, \n\"We need to guard our tongues ... A Muslim should develop the habit of being able to \nkeep secrets ... A Muslim should learn not to say more than what needs to be said, to \nwork on a 'need to !mow basis.'  A lot of Jihad work is secret and clandestine by nature. \nTherefore, brothers and sisters should be very careful with their words.  A lot of harm \nwas inflicted on Jihad work because of otherwise good and sincere brothers who had \nloose tongues;\" \ng.  Following the news of Jihad and spreading it:  Awlaki stated, \"Following \nthe news of Jihad and tl1e mujahideen is important because it keeps your attaclnnent to \nJihad alive ... It encourages you to join Jihad ... The news of Jihad is the news of the \nconflict between good and evil...;\" \nh.  Spreading the writings of the mujahideen and their scholars: Awlaki \nstated, \"There are plenty of scholars and strategic thinkers who are supporters of Jihad \ntoday.  The problem is that because they are on the true path most ofiliem are killed, \njailed or forced to go underground.\"  Awlaki then suggested meiliods to spread this \ninformation, including posting material online, setting up websites to publish tl1e \nmaterial, guiding others to the material, and establishing email lists; \n1.  Physical fitness:  Aw  laki stated, \"Physical fitness is part of the preparation \nfor Jihad.  What Jihad needs is not body builders.  What Jihad needs is mujahideen who \nhave the ability to walk for long hours, to run for long distances (important for guerilla \nwarfare), to sprint (important for urban warfare), and to climb mountains;\" \n6 \n\nCase: 3:15-cr-00358-JZ  Doc #: 1  Filed:  09/30/15  7 of 72.  PageID #: 7\nJ.  Developing the Aqeedah [Creed] ofWalaa' [Loyalty to Islam] and Baraa' \n[Animosity to Non-believers in Islam]:  Awlaki stated, \"The mnjahid should have a clear \nnnderstanding of what it means to be loyal to Allah, His Messenger and the believers and . \ndeclaring animosity towards the disbelievers ... ·The hatred ofknffar [non-believers] is a \ncentral element of onr military creed.  We need to realize that Allah will not grant ns \nvictory as long as we still have some love towards his enemies in onr hearts;\" \nk.  WWW Jihad:  Awlaki stated, \"The internet has become a great medium \nfor spreading the call of Jihad and following the news of the muj ahideen.\"  A wlaki then \nsuggested methods to become \"internet mujahideen,\" including establishing discussion \nforums, email lists, websites to cover specific areas of Jihad, and posting or emailing \nJihad literature and news; \n1.

In the indictment, MOHAMMAD was charged \nwith conspiring to and actually providing material support and resources to terrorists, knowing \nand intending that the supp01i and resources would be used in preparation for and in carrying out \nthe kjlling of officers and employees of the United States and for acts of international terrorism. \n\nCase: 3:16-cr-00222-SAE  Doc #: 1  Filed:  07/06/16  2 of 7.  PageID #: 2\n2.  That criminal case was assigned to United States District Court Judge Jack \nZouhary, Northern District of Ohio. \n3.  MOHAMMAD was detained and housed at the Lucas County Corrections \nCenter, Toledo, Ohio pending resolution of the case. \n4.  In or about March 2016, MOHAMMAD met another inmate, Individual \nA, in the Lucas County Corrections Center.  MOHAMMAD told Individual A that he wanted to \nhire someone to kill Judge Zouhary.  Individual A reported MOHAMMAD's statements to the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation. \n5.

Individual A introduced an FBI undercover employee (\"UCE\") to \nMOHAMMAD, who posed as an associate of Individual A who was capable of implementing \nMOHAMMAD's plan to kill Judge Zouhary.  MOHAMMAD told Individual A that he was \nwilling to pay the UCE $15,000 to kill Judge Zouhary.  Individual A told MOHAMMAD that the \nUCE needed a $1,000 down payment before the murder could occur. \n7.  In order to disguise their conversations, MOHAMMAD and Individual A \nworked out a code to be used when MOHAMMAD communicated with the UCE about the \nmurder of Judge Zouhary. \n8.  On or about April 26, 2016, at approximately 6:08 p.m., MOHAMMAD \ncalled the UCE from the Lucas County Corrections Center.  Using the code that MOHAMMAD \nhad previously worked out with Individual A, MOHAMMAD told the UCE he wanted to have \nJudge Zouhary killed.  MOHAMMAD stated that he could either send the down payment money \nto the UCE directly through a mail courier, or the UCE could meet MOHAMMAD's wife, N.T., \n2 \n\nCase: 3:16-cr-00222-SAE  Doc #: 1  Filed:  07/06/16  3 of 7.

On or about April28, 2016, MOHAMMAD called the UCE to arrange the \n$1,000 down payment for the murder.  MOHAMMAD told the UCE that he would provide the \nUCE's telephone number to his wife in Chicago so they could arrange a time the following week \nto exchange the money.  Further, MOHAMMAD stated that once the UCE had killed Judge \nZouhary, MOHAMMAD's wife would give the rest of the money to the UCE.  Using coded \nlanguage, MOHAMMAD told the UCE that he did not \"want [Judge Zouhary] found.\" \n11.  On or about April28, 2016, at approximately 9:01p.m., MOHAMMAD \ncalled his wife, N.T., provided her with the UCE's telephone number, and instructed her to call \nthe number and ask the UCE to come meet her at her place of employment to give the UCE the \n$1 , 000 in cash. \n12.  On or about May 3, 2016, N.T. called the UCE and stated she had $1,000 \nto give him.  N.T. instructed the UCE to meet her at a post office located in Bolingbrook, \nIllinois. \n13.  On or about May 5, 2016, N.T. met the UCE at the arranged location, and \nshe provided the UCE with $1,000 in U.S. currency inside a white envelope.

N.T. asked  MOHAMMAD if he had made \narrangements to pay an additional $13,000.  In response, MOHAMMAD told her it was only \n$1,000 this time.  N.T. told MOHAMMAD that the UCE was expecting an additional $13,000 \npayment by next week.  MOHAMMAD said he would work on it. \n15.  On or about May 11,2016, MOHAMMAD told Individual A that the rest \nof the money for the murder was coming from Dubai to Texas to Chicago to N.T. and then to the \nUCE. \n16.  On or about May 13,2016, the UCE called N.T. and told her that he \nneeded to show her something that would be of interest to her husband.  They agreed to meet on \nMay 16, 2016 at the previous meet location. \n17.  On or about May 14,2016, N.T. informed MOHAMMAD that she \nreceived a call from the UCE.

On or about May 14,2016, N.T. informed MOHAMMAD that her future \nmeeting with the UCE was not to provide money.  N.T. told MOHAMMAD that she could \nprovide $7,000 to the UCE right now, and if necessary, could get the additional money within a \nfew days. \n18.  On May 16, 2016, the UCE met with N.T. at the previously arranged \nlocation.  The UCE showed N.T. a photograph that purported to show the dead body of Judge \nZouhary.  The UCE told N.T. that the photograph was the matter that he was to conduct for her \nhusband.  The UCE told N.T. that he needed the rest of the money that was owed to him.  N.T. \ntold the UCE that she would contact MOHAMMAD and then she would contact the UCE. \n4 \n\nCase: 3:16-cr-00222-SAE  Doc #: 1  Filed:  07/06/16  5 of 7.
