The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, ECF No. 270 and ECF No. 342, are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as described in this order. The preliminary injunction entered in this case, ECF No. 185, which was subsequently modified and renewed, see, e.g., ECF No. 437, is hereby dissolved. No later than 5/20/2019, the parties must confer and file a jointly proposed briefing schedule regarding the entitlement to and determination of attorney's fees and costs. The Clerk is directed to provide a copy of this order to inmate Steven A. McLeod. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment stating: a. Defendant must ensure that the Florida Department of Corrections (\"FDC\"), FDC's employees, and FDC's agents comply with FDC's Hepatitis C Virus (\"HCV\") policy, HSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3, as it is revised. b. Defendant must ensure that FDC's HCV policy, HSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3, is not modified absent this Court's instruction. c. Defendant must ensure that, no later than May 20, 2019, FDC's HCV policy, HSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3, is modified as follows: i. The policy must be modified to reflect that treatment must be initiated for F0 and F1 inmates within two years of staging. ii. A section must be added to the policy requiring an explanation to anyone who refuses staging or treatment of, at least, (1) the consequences of HCV, (2) the availability, lack of side effects, and efficacy of the new medications, (3) the staging process, and (4) whether and when they will receive treatment. iii. The policy must be modified to reflect that (1) patients must be initially staged using a FibroSure test within 30 days of confirming they have chronic HCV; (2) patients who need ultrasounds must receive an ultrasound within 90 days of confirming they have chronic HCV; (3) if a patient needs to be restaged as a result of an ultrasound, the restaging must take place within 5 days of receiving the ultrasound results; and (4) staff must rely on the test, exam, or study indicating the highest fibrosis level for staging. iv. The policy must be modified to reflect that deadlines are mandatory. v. The policy must be modified to reflect that staff have the discretion to restage inmates sooner than scheduled. vi. The exclusion for time remaining on an inmate's sentence must be modified such that (1) it no longer refers to \"pre-treatment evaluation\"; (2) it no longer refers to \"post treatment SVR assessment\"; (3) it no longer includes a \"12-18 months\" estimate; and (4) it reflects that an inmate-who has already been staged and evaluated-simply needs to have \"sufficient\" time remaining on their sentence to complete a course of treatment. vii. The exclusion for high-risk behaviors must be modified to reflect that (1) high-risk behaviors only warrant a delay if there is a \"medical reason\" to delay treatment and (2) it only provides for temporary ineligibility, not permanent exclusion. viii. Section J.3., which refers to \"chronic disciplinary issues,\" must be amended to reflect that chronic disciplinary issues, in and of themselves, are not sufficient to render an inmate ineligible for treatment; rather, treatment may only be delayed for medical reasons. ix. Section P, which governs referrals for liver transplants, must be modified as follows: (1) decompensation must be defined as \"the presence of encephalopathy, ascites, bleeding varices, or jaundice\"; (2) it must be clarified to reflect that patients will be referred if they have any one of the listed items; (3) referrals must be initiated within 30 days of any one of the triggering events; (4) it must provide that FDC must promptly comply with the transplant center's request for records and other information, and to promptly transport the inmate to and from the transplant center; and (5) it must be clarified that for individuals who have been scheduled to receive DAA medication, are undergoing DAA treatment, or who have finished DAA treatment, a referral must be made only if the post-treatment MELD score is over 15. x. Section A.2., which refers to risk factors, must be modified to include \"being born between 1945 and 1965, previous incarceration, and HIV\" as risk factors. d. Defendant must ensure that FDC initiates treatment for all known chronic-HCV inmates who are currently staged F0 or F1 within two years of the date of this order. e. Defendant must ensure that FDC either (1) adopts a system of opt-out testing along with an aggressive notice campaign or (2) adopts a system of opt-in testing paired with peer education. FDC must make its choice and Defendant must inform this Court of FDC's decision no later than 5/20/2019. f. Defendant must ensure that FDC forms a definite plan to make elastography available to its medical staff within a reasonably immediate timeframe. Defendant must file its proposed plan with this Court no later than 5/20/2019. g. Defendant must ensure that-for inmates who were known to have chronic HCV in December 2017, who have fibrosis stage 2, and who are eligible for treatment-FDC initiates treatment no later than December 31, 2019. Beginning on 6/3/2019, and on the first day of each month thereafter, Defendant must file with this Court a status report reflecting FDC's progress in complying with this Court's injunction. That status report must include: i. A certification regarding FDC's compliance with the applicable deadlines for prisoners known to have chronic HCV in December 2017. ii. Information regarding the total number of inmates who: 1. have been screened/tested for HCV, 2. have been identified as having chronic HCV, 3. have been identified as having chronic HCV and have been staged (which must be further broken down by stage, including F0, F1, F2, F3, F4, decompensated cirrhosis, and those with HIV), 4. have been submitted to the Hepatitis C Committee for evaluation (which must be further broken down by stage, including F0, F1, F2, F3, F4, decompensated cirrhosis, and those with HIV), 5. have begun treatment with DAAs, 6. have completed treatment with DAAs, 7. have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR), 8. have not achieved SVR, and 9. have been deemed (temporarily or permanently) ineligible for treatment with DAAs along with the specific reason for ineligibility. Signed by CHIEF JUDGE MARK E WALKER on 4/18/2019. (kjw) **Order mailed to inmate McLeod as directed.** Modified on 11/4/2020 (blb). (Entered: 04/18/2019)"

    "summary": "<p>On May 11, 2017, three Florida Department of Corrections prisoners who had chronic hepatitis C filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Judge Mark E. Walker was assigned to the case. The plaintiffs sued the Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act for failing to provide prisoners in its custody who had chronic hepatitis C with adequate medical treatment, even though the standard treatment for the deadly disease (direct-acting antivirals) cured 95% of hepatitis C patients. The plaintiffs alleged that the FDC&rsquo;s deliberate indifference to prisoners&rsquo; serious medical needs violated the Eighth Amendment and that the FDC discriminated on the basis of disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs, represented by the Florida Justice Institute, sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>On May 23, 2017, the plaintiffs sought class certification and a preliminary injunction, arguing that many sick prisoners would become sicker and die if they had to wait until the end of the litigation to get relief. A few months later, on November 17, the court granted both of the plaintiffs&rsquo; requests. (The FDC had also sought to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim, but the court dismissed that motion without hearing it.) The class included all current and future prisoners in FDC custody who have been diagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C. 323 F.R.D. 694. The preliminary injunction required the FDC to come up with a plan to provide medical treatment to prisoners with hepatitis C and to put that plan into effect immediately after it was approved.</p>\r\n<p>On December 13, 2017, the court approved a plan that required the FDC to treat all prisoners with hepatitis C, giving priority to those whose conditions were most serious. The plan contained a timetable for the FDC&rsquo;s goals; all would be fully implemented over the next year. On January 31, 2018, the court allowed the FDC to modify the preliminary injunction: the FDC began using different tests to determine which patients had the most serious conditions, and its timeline for treating patients with lower fibrosis scores was extended by twelve months. Nine days later, the court allowed the plaintiffs to modify the preliminary injunction as well: the FDC was required to initiate treatment for prisoners who were co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV by the end of the year, even if they had low fibrosis scores. On February 21, 2018, the court issued a second preliminary injunction because the first was about to expire.</p>\r\n<p>By the time the FDC&rsquo;s preliminary injunction took effect, more than seven months had passed since the plaintiffs had filed their initial complaint. One plaintiff&rsquo;s decompensated cirrhosis (liver scarring as a result of hepatitis C) had worsened considerably, and the plaintiffs sought an evaluation for a liver transplant for him on January 5, 2018. They alleged that the FDC had known about the severity of his condition for many months and should have referred him to the transplant center already. The court denied this motion for mootness, likely because the FDC&rsquo;s timetable put January 31 as the date that the FDC needed to have evaluated all prisoners with decompensated cirrhosis. Less than three months later, the plaintiff died.</p>\r\n<p>On April 26, 2018, a prisoner in FDC custody (and, thus, a class member to this suit) filed a motion to intervene, citing his dissatisfaction with class counsel. The inmate alleged that class counsel had an ethical conflict in suing FDC and moved the court (a) to require counsel to amend the case and seek monetary damages or (b) to terminate and replace class counsel. On April 28, 2018, the court denied this motion on the basis that it failed to articulate a conflict that would warrant disqualifying class counsel. Additionally, the court noted this suit did not preclude the prisoner from separately seeking monetary damages from defendant. On May 7, 2018, the inmate filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion to supplement his original motion to intervene. Both motions were denied. On June 1, 2018, plaintiff appealed the court&rsquo;s denial of his motion to intervene and later motion to supplement his motion to intervene (18-12292). On September 7, 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that plaintiff&rsquo;s appeal was frivolous and denied all pending motions as moot. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied on December 11, 2018. Before the motion for reconsideration was denied, on September 12, 2018, this same prisoner filed a second motion to intervene in the trial court, alleging insufficient medical care. The court dismissed this motion after the defendant presented evidence that the prisoner received adequate medical care.</p>\r\n<p>On November 1, 2018 the same individual plaintiff filed another interlocutory appeal challenging the trial court's denial of his motion to intervene. One month later, this appeal was dismissed for want of prosecution because the plaintiff did not pay the filing and docketing fees (18-14652). On April 3, 2019, the plaintiff filed a third motion to intervene. The court found that the plaintiff had failed to state a basis on which to intervene and that the plaintiff had failed to state a violation of the preliminary injunction. On June 12, 2019, the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis (to proceed without payment of fees). The next day, the court denied his motion, and held that his appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on May 10, 2018, another individual plaintiff filed a motion alleging that his interest for economic and punitive damages was not being considered. The court denied this motion on the grounds that this suit is based on treatment, not damages. On May 23, 2018, the plaintiff filed a motion to amend his May 10th motion. The court again denied his motion, warning the plaintiff not to file another motion complaining about damages in this suit. On June 19, 2018, plaintiff appealed the court&rsquo;s denial of his motion to amend (18-12571). On July 23, 2018 the appeal was dismissed because appellant did not pay the requisite filing fees.</p>\r\n<p>On May 24, 2018, the court granted the original plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a third preliminary injunction with the same terms as the first two. On September 5, 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion for a fourth preliminary injunction, proposing a permanent injunction as an alternative remedy. That same day the court only granted the fourth preliminary injunction with the same terms as the previous iterations.</p>\r\n<p>On June 22, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment seeking both a permanent injunction as well as other forms of relief not currently required by the preliminary injunction. Though the proposed permanent injunction looked largely similar to the past preliminary injunctions, the plaintiffs sought to change some of the mechanisms by which the defendants tested for and treated hepatitis C in prisoners. On November 26, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed fifth motion for a preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, a permanent injunction. The next day, the court granted the motion for the preliminary injunction and it was was renewed.</p>\r\n<p>Another prisoner filed a motion to intervene on February 8, 2019. On the same day, this inmate filed a motion for joinder of the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) as a defendant because he was transferred from the FDC to the VDOC under an Interstate Corrections Compact. This individual also filed a motion for relief from judgment on the same day. Four days later, the court denied the petitioner's motion to intervene. Because the petitioner was originally incarcerated in the FDC and was then transferred to the VDOC, the court held that it was unclear if the petitioner was a member of the certified class. The court ordered the defendants to respond the petitioner's motion to clear up the confusion. Judge Walker also denied the petitioner's motion for joinder of the VDOC as a defendant. Judge Walker construed the petitioner's motion for relief from judgment as a motion to enforce the court's preliminary injunction. Additionally, the court ordered the defendants to respond to this motion and address whether the petitioner was wrongfully denied treatment in violation of the court's preliminary injunction. On March 5, 2019, the court denied the petitioner's motion for enforcement of the preliminary injunction. Judge Walker held that the injunction required the defendants to provide treatment for the petitioner by the end of December 2019, and so the deadline had not yet passed.</p>\r\n<p>Since the onset of the first preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs have filed motions both to enforce the preliminary injunctions and to compel defendant to treat other prisoners in compliance with the preliminary injunctions' terms. The court denied these motions without prejudice on the basis that the defendant was either complying with, or at least not in actionable violation of, the injunctions at the time the motions were considered. Individuals in FCD custody have also filed motions for civil contempt that alleged violations of the preliminary injunction, and the court denied them all on the basis that the defendants had not violated the injunction. Since the first preliminary injunction was issued, the FDC screened 55,348 prisoners for chronic hepatitis C, diagnosed 7,185 prisoners with hepatitis C, and began treatment for 4,901 prisoners using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).</p>\r\n<p>On February 25, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for issuance of a sixth preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, a permanent injunction. Judge Walker renewed the preliminary injunction the next day.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Walker issued a permanent injunction on April 18, 2019 and as such dissolved the preliminary injunction. The permanent injunction required defendants to modify the FDC's policy on managing prisoners with hepatitis C by May 20, 2019. The FDC had to provide medical staff with the option of elastography, which is a more accurate method of identifying hepatitis C and evaluating the severity. The injunction required the FDC to adopt either opt-out testing with an aggressive notice campaign or opt-in testing with peer education for all prisoners. The FDC was required to begin treating all prisoners with hepatitis C. Prisoners with the most severe hepatitis C infections (Priority Level 1) had to start receiving treatment within six months of diagnosis, those with Priority Level 2 hepatitis C must begin receiving treatment within twelve months of diagnosis, and those with less severe hepatitis C infections must begin receiving treatment within two years of diagnosis. Judge Walker made it clear that these treatment deadlines are absolutely mandatory. The court ordered that the FDC&rsquo;s new policy must ensure that prisoners receive routine FibroSure and ultrasound testing every twelve months once diagnosed with hepatitis C of any severity. The agreement required that FDC&rsquo;s new policy must make clear that \"chronic disciplinary issues\" were not a sufficient reason for an inmate to be ineligible for treatment. Starting in June 2019, the FDC had to file monthly status reports with the court to show its progress complying with the injunction. 382 F. Supp. 3d. 1288 (N.D. Fla. 2019).</p>\r\n<p>Twelve days after the court issued the permanent injunction, the plaintiffs filed a motion for modification of the injunction to ask that the defendants provide class counsel with spreadsheets containing the names of all prisoners diagnosed with HCV. Two weeks later, the court denied the motion because the spreadsheets at issue contained inaccurate information.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed an appeal of the order and final judgment (as well as all preliminary injunctions and the order granting class certification) in the Eleventh Circuit on May 17, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On August 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's injunction and remanded back to the district court to make adequate findings on the record that its permanent injunction complied with the Prison Litigation Reform Act. 973 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir. 2020). The Eleventh Circuit also reversed the part of the district court's order that mandated direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment for low-fibrosis-scored HCV-positive inmates, and instructed the district court to grant defendants summary judgment on that issue. The Eleventh Circuit held that failure to provide DAA treatment does not violate the Eighth Amendment because, it found, such treatment was not medically necessary for HCV-positive inmates with low fibrosis scores. Thus, plaintiffs failed to prove that defendants acted with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. The Eleventh Circuit issued its mandate on November 2, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery continued through early 2021 with the court's approval. On August 11, 2021, counsel for the parties informed the court that a settlement agreement had been reached resulting in modifications to the Health Services Bulletin governing Hepatitis C care, the precise terms of which are unknown to the Clearinghouse. Thereafter, on August 12, 2021, the court issued an order requiring the parties to comply with the settlement agreement.&nbsp; It retained jurisdiction to enforce the order to comply with the agreement and otherwise granted voluntary dismissal of the claims, with prejudice.&nbsp; As of November 2024, there does not appear to have been any further action in this case.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

The plaintiffs alleged that the FDC's failure to provide treatment to inmates with hepatitis C violated their rights under the Eighth Amendment and the American with Disabilities Act. In 2019, the court issued a permanent injunction requiring the FDC to improve testing and treatment for chronic hepatitis C.  The injunction also required the FDC to submit monthly reports to the court showing that it was complying with the terms of the injunction.  The defendants appealed, and on August 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's injunction and remanded back to the district court to make adequate findings on the record that its permanent injunction complied with the Prison Litigation Reform Act. 973 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir. 2020).

Case No. 4:17cv214-MW/CAS \n \nJULIE L. JONES, in her official \ncapacity as Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of \nCorrections, \n \nDefendant. \n__________________________/ \n \nORDER GRANTING  \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \nPlaintiffs challenge the policies and practices of the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections (“FDC”) for treating Hepatitis C. ECF \nNo. 1. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that Defendant is acting with \ndeliberate indifference to their serious medical needs, in violation \nof the Eighth Amendment, and that Defendant is discriminating \nagainst  them  on  the  basis  of  disability  in  violation  of  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation \nAct (“RA”). Id. Presently before this Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for \nclass certification, in which Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of “all \ncurrent  and  future  prisoners  in  FDC  custody  who  have  been \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 2 of 15\n   \n \ndiagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C virus \n(HCV).” ECF No. 10, at 2. To succeed in their motion, Plaintiffs \nmust  satisfy  the  four  requirements  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 23(a). Plaintiffs must also satisfy the requirements of \nRule 23(b)(2).1 This Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the \nnecessary requirements; accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for class \ncertification is GRANTED. \nI. Rule (23)(a) Requirements \n  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a)  imposes  four \nrequirements on a party moving to certify a class. Specifically, the \nmoving  party  must  show:  (1)  numerosity,  (2)  commonality,  (3) \ntypicality, and (4) adequacy. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). This Court \nfinds that each of these requirements has been met. \n(1) Numerosity \n  The numerosity requirement provides that a class can only \nbe certified if “the class is so numerous that joinder of all members \nis impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). “[W]hile there is no fixed \nnumerosity rule, ‘generally less than twenty-one is inadequate, \nmore  than  forty  adequate,  with  numbers  between  varying \n                                           \n1 Plaintiffs could choose to qualify for any of the Rule 23(b) class-types, \nbut they have only alleged that Rule 23(b)(2) applies, ECF No. 10, at 2. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 3 of 15\n   \n \naccording to other factors.’” Cox v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d \n1546, 1553 (11th Cir. 1986). At the hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion, \nthe parties presented evidence showing that the proposed class \nincludes at least 7,000 inmates and likely includes upwards of \n20,000 inmates.2 ECF No. 151, at 52–53; Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. \nJoining that many members would certainly be impracticable. See \nWilliams v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 280 F.R.D. 665, 671–72 (S.D. \nFla.  2012).  As  such,  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the  numerosity \nrequirement. \n(2) Commonality \n  The commonality requirement provides that a class can only \nbe certified if “there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). There is no requirement as to the \nnumber of common questions—even a single common question will \ndo. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 359 (2011). A \nquestion is “common” if it “is capable of classwide resolution—\nwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve \nan issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in \none stroke.” See id. at 350. \n                                           \n2 “[A] plaintiff need not show the precise number of members in the \nclass.” Evans v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co., 696 F.2d 925, 930 (11th Cir. 1983). \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 4 of 15\n   \n \n  In  this  case  there  are  several  questions  of  law  or  fact \ncommon to the class. For example, one common question of fact is \nwhat the appropriate standard of care is for a person with chronic \nHCV. Common questions of law include whether FDC’s failure to \nmeet  that  standard  of  care  constitutes  deliberate  indifference \nunder the Eighth Amendment or discrimination under the ADA or \nRA. All of these questions are subject to classwide resolution.  \n  Defendant  disputes  that  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the \ncommonality requirement and argues that “[b]ased on the wide \ndisparity of symptoms and the decades long process in which it \ntakes for symptoms to occur . . . a one stroke determination by this \nCourt  would  undermine  the  individualized  assessment  and \ntreatment required for those with HCV.”3 ECF No. 32, at 6 n.2. But \n                                           \n3 Defendant repeatedly cites the Supreme Court’s decision in Wal-Mart, \nemphasizing that it “heightened the standards for establishing commonality” \nand “made  it  more  difficult for  all class  action  proponents to  satisfy  the \ncommon-issue  requirement.”  ECF  No.  32, at 6–7  (quotations  omitted). \nWhatever  the  result  of  Wal-Mart,  Plaintiffs’  proposed  class  satisfies  the \nSupreme Court’s standard. In discussing commonality, the Court explained as \nfollows: \n \nCommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class \nmembers “have suffered the same injury.” This does not mean \nmerely  that  they  have  all  suffered  a  violation  of  the  same \nprovision of law. Title VII, for example, can be violated in many \nways—by intentional discrimination, or by hiring and promotion \ncriteria that result in disparate impact, and by the use of these \npractices on the part of many different superiors in a single \ncompany. Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of the \nsame company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 5 of 15\n   \n \nDefendant  misses  the  point.  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  focused  “on \nDefendant’s policy of non-treatment for HCV, which exposes every \nHCV patient to the same risk, regardless of their symptoms.” ECF \nNo. 35, at 3.  \n  Defendant’s  misguidance  is  best  illustrated  through  an \nexample. Consider, for instance, a prison policy that states that \nevery inmate with a broken bone must wait five years before they \nare treated. Under Defendant’s logic, inmates subject to that policy \ncould not initiate a class action to change the policy because each \ninmate  suffers  from  individualized  conditions.  That,  of  course, \nwould  be  pure  applesauce.4  Although  each  inmate  may  be \ndifferently situated (e.g., one may have a broken toe, and another \na broken rib), they each suffer from the same injury: being subject \n                                           \na disparate-impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that \nall their  claims  can  productively  be litigated  at  once.  Their \nclaims must depend on a common contention—for example, the \nassertion  of  discriminatory  bias  on  the  part  of  the  same \nsupervisor. \n \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349–50 (citation omitted). \n \n  Here, Plaintiffs do not merely share a violation of the same provision of \nlaw; rather, they also share a “common contention”—they allege that FDC’s \npolicies and practices for treating inmates with HCV are illegal. \n \n4 Credit goes to the late Justice Scalia for introducing this phrase to the \nlegal world. See King v. Burwell, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 2501 (2015) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting). \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 6 of 15\n   \n \nto the five-year delay. See Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th \nCir.  2014)  (affirming  certification  of  statewide  prisoner-class \nalleging deficient medical care; noting that “every inmate suffers \nexactly the same constitutional injury when he is exposed to a \nsingle  statewide  [prison]  policy  or  practice  that  creates  a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm”); see also Cooper v. S. Co., 390 \nF.3d 695, 714 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Neither the typicality nor the \ncommonality  requirement  ‘mandates  that  all  putative  class \nmembers share identical claims, and . . . factual differences among \nthe  claims  of  the  putative  class  members  do  not  defeat \ncertification.’” (quoting Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. \n1994)),  overruling  on  other  grounds  recognized  by  SEC  v. \nBankatlantic Bancorp, Inc., 661 F. App’x 629, 635 (11th Cir. 2016). \n  If Plaintiffs were asking this Court to order Defendant to \nimmediately  give  each  member  of  the  class  specific  medical \ntreatment, then individualized differences might preclude class \ncertification. But that is not what Plaintiffs are asking for. See \nECF No. 1, at 43–45. Indeed, the relief that Plaintiffs seek with \nrespect to the class as a whole is limited to changing Defendant’s \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 7 of 15\n   \n \npolicies and practices.5 Defendant has not shown why differences \nin  symptoms  and  treatment  considerations  should  preclude \nawarding  such  class-wide  relief.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs  have \nsatisfied the commonality requirement. \n(3) Typicality \n  The typicality requirement provides that a class can only be \ncertified if “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of  the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(3). Claims are typical of each other if they “arise from the \nsame event or pattern or practice and are based on the same legal \ntheory.” Kornberg v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., 741 F.2d 1332, \n1337 (11th Cir. 1984). In this case, Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the \nvery same “pattern or practice” as the class’s claims. Specifically, \nboth groups’ claims arise from Defendant’s policies and practices \nfor treating HCV. See ECF No. 1. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ claims are \nbased  on  the  exact  same  legal  theories  as  the  class’s  claims: \n                                           \n5 For instance, Plaintiffs request an injunction ordering Defendant to \n“develop and adhere to a plan to provide direct-acting antiviral medications to \nall FDC prisoners with chronic HCV, consistent with the standard of care.” \nECF No. 1, at 44. Ordering a change in policy (even with specific treatment in \nmind) is not the same as ordering a specific treatment. The distinction is that, \neven after the change is enacted, the policy can still take into account inmates’ \nindividualized conditions. \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 8 of 15\n   \n \ndeliberate  indifference  under  the  Eighth  Amendment,  and \ndiscrimination under the ADA and RA. See id. \n  Nonetheless, Defendant argues that this Court should not \ncertify the proposed class because of alleged differences between \nPlaintiffs  and  other  class  members.  See  ECF  No.  32,  at  15 \n(“Because . . . a significant portion of the . . . FDC prisoners which \nchronic HCV have vastly different symptoms when compared to \nthe Plaintiffs, or even have no symptoms at all, the motion for class \ncertification  should  be  denied.”).  Again,  Defendant  misses  the \npoint. Although “[a] class representative must possess the same \ninterest and suffer the same injury as the class members in order \nto be typical under Rule 23(a)(3),” Murray v. Auslander, 244 F.3d \n807, 811 (11th Cir. 2001), “[t]he typicality requirement may be \nsatisfied despite substantial factual differences . . . when there is \na ‘strong similarity of legal theories,’” id. (quoting Appleyard v. \nWallace, 754 F.2d 955, 958 (11th Cir. 1985)); see also Kornberg, 741 \nF.2d  at  1337  (“A  factual  variation  will  not  render  a  class \nrepresentative’s claim atypical unless the factual position of the \nrepresentative markedly differs from that of other members of the \nclass.”).  Here,  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  based  on  the  same  legal \ntheories as the class’s claims, and Plaintiffs are not in a markedly \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 9 of 15\n   \n \ndifferent factual position than other class members (at least not in \na  sense  that  would  be  relevant  for  purposes  of  their  claims). \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement. \n(4) Adequacy \n  The adequacy requirement provides that a class can only be \ncertified if “the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect  the  interests  of  the  class.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a)(4). \nDetermining adequacy “involves questions of whether plaintiffs’ \ncounsel are qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct \nthe proposed litigation, and of whether plaintiffs have interests \nantagonistic to the rest of the class.” Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d \n1516, 1533 (11th Cir. 1985). \n  There does not appear to be any dispute as to the adequacy \nof Plaintiffs’ counsel. Indeed, Plaintiffs note that their attorneys \n“have extensive experience in class action cases involving federal \ncivil rights claims for prisoners,” ECF No. 10, at 21, and Defendant \ndoes not suggest otherwise, see ECF No. 32, at 18–19. Similarly, \nthere does not appear to be much dispute as to Plaintiffs’ adequacy. \nPlaintiffs summarily state that they have “no interest antagonistic \nto or in conflict with the interests of the class members,” ECF No. \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 10 of 15\n   \n \n10, at 22, and Defendant summarily argues that because Plaintiffs \nfail typicality they also fail adequacy, ECF No. 32 at 18–19. \n  This Court observed all three Plaintiffs testify at the hearing \non  class  certification.  All  three  testified  strongly  about  their \nconditions and their belief that FDC is not treating HCV properly. \nMoreover, all three were asked whether they would adequately \nrepresent the class (despite having already begun treatment for \nHCV), and all three confirmed that they will. This Court is without \nany doubt as to Plaintiffs’ credibility on this point. Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have satisfied the adequacy requirement. \nII. Rule (23)(b)(2) Requirements \n  To certify a class  under Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure \n23(b)(2), the moving party must show that “the party opposing the \nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \nthe  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” \nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b)(2).  “The  key  to  the  (b)(2)  class  is  ‘the \nindivisible  nature  of  the  injunctive  or  declaratory  remedy \nwarranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be \nenjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members \nor as to none of them.’” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360 (quoting Richard \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 11 of 15\n   \n \nA. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 \nN.Y.U.  L.  Rev.  97,  132  (2009)).  “In  other  words,  Rule  23(b)(2) \napplies only when  a single injunction or declaratory judgment \nwould provide relief to each member of the class.” Id. \n  Here,  certification  under  Rule  23(b)(2)  is  appropriate \nbecause a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide \nrelief to each member of the proposed class. Specifically, if this \nCourt enters an injunction forcing Defendant to change FDC’s \npolicies and practices with respect to HCV treatment, then each \nmember of the proposed class will be able to enjoy those changes.  \nNevertheless, Defendant argues that this Court “should be \nhesitant to allow a Rule 23(b) class determine the how [sic] Florida \nmanages its prison system.” ECF No. 32, at 26. Indeed, this Court \nis mindful of FDC’s desire to maintain independent control of its \noperations. But the mere fact that FDC operates prisons is not \nenough to prevent class certification.  In fact, class actions are \ncommon vehicles for raising the type of claims raised here. See \ngenerally  Parsons,  754  F.3d  at  686  (“[C]ourts  have  repeatedly \ninvoked  [Rule  23(b)(2)]  to  certify  classes  of  inmates  seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief for alleged widespread Eighth \nAmendment violations in prison systems . . . .”); see also Postawko \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 12 of 15\n   \n \nv. Mo. Dep’t of Corr., No. 2:16-cv-04219-NKL, 2017 WL 3185155, \nat *1 (W.D. Mo. July 26, 2017) (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class of \ninmates  alleging  “inadequate  medical  care  for  their  chronic \nHepatitis  C”);  Graham  v.  Parker,  No.  3-16-cv-01954,  2017  WL \n1737871, at *1 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, 2017) (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) \nclass of inmates challenging “whether the State of Tennessee’s \npolicies  and  procedures  for  inmates  with  Hepatitis  C  satisfies \nconstitutional standards”). \nDefendant also argues that class certification is unnecessary \ngiven that Plaintiffs “have sued regarding a policy.” ECF No. 32, \nat 30–31. This Court disagrees.6 Nevertheless, class actions need \nnot be necessary. See generally 7AA Charles Alan Wright et al., \n                                           \n6 There is at least one reason why class certification is necessary in this \ncase: to avoid a dismissal for mootness. See Hamilton v. Hall ex rel. Santa Rosa \nCounty, No. 3:10cv355/MCR/EMT, 2011 WL 2161139, at *1 (N.D. Fla. May 26, \n2011) (recognizing that “a class action may not be necessary where the relief \nrequested otherwise can be obtained” but finding that a class action was \nnecessary to avoid the potential for mootness). A class action can proceed even \nif the class representatives obtain their requested relief. See Davis v. Coca-\nCola Bottling Co. Consol., 516 F.3d 955, 968 n.28 (11th Cir. 2008) (“A class \nrepresentative can have standing to continuing prosecuting a class action for \nrelief on behalf of the class members even though he has settled his claim \nagainst the defendant and his own case is therefore moot.”), abrogation on \nother grounds recognized by LaCroix v. W. Dist. Ky., 627 F. App’x 816, 818 (11th \nCir. 2015); see also Bishop’s Prop. & Invs., LLC v. Protective Life Ins. Co., 463 \nF. Supp. 2d 1375, 1377–82 (M.D. Ga. 2006) (explaining that a party cannot \nmoot a case by giving the class representatives their requested relief before the \nCourt rules on the motion for certification). So even though Plaintiffs have \nalready begun receiving most of the treatment they want, or even if they leave \nFDC custody during the pendency of this case, the case can still go forward. \nThis is a luxury that individual plaintiffs would not enjoy. \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 13 of 15\n   \n \nFederal Practice & Procedure § 1785.2 (3d ed. & Apr. 2017 update) \n(explaining  that  the  necessity  of  a  class  action  is  simply  a \ndiscretionary factor for a court to consider). Thus, even if class \ncertification is unnecessary here, this Court chooses to exercise its \ndiscretion by allowing the case to proceed as a class action. \nIII. Subsidiary Issues \n  The parties raise several subsidiary issues in their filings. \nFor instance, Plaintiffs ask this Court to appoint their attorneys \nas  class  counsel  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure \n23(g)(1).  ECF  No.  10,  at  26–27.  After  considering  the  factors \noutlined in Rule 23(g)(1), this Court finds that Plaintiffs’ attorneys \nshould be appointed class counsel. \n  In her response to Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, \nDefendant  argues  that  “FDC  should  be  allowed  to  complete \ndiscovery pertaining to the propriety of a class before a class is \ncertified.” ECF No. 32, at 32. Defendant’s response was filed on \nJuly 7, 2017 (i.e., over four months ago). Since then, the parties \nhave had ample time to conduct discovery. Moreover, this Court \nheld a five-day hearing on Plaintiffs’  motion. Accordingly, this \nCourt does not find that any further delay is necessary. \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 14 of 15\n   \n \n  Finally,  Defendant  argues  that  certifying  Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class would violate the Rules Enabling Act (“REA”). ECF \nNo. 32, at 31–32. Specifically, Defendant argues that the REA \nforbids interpreting Rule 23 to abridge, enlarge or modify any \nsubstantive right and “[i]f Plaintiffs’ purported class of all chronic \nHCV inmates within FDC is permitted to go forward, plaintiffs \nrights will be enlarged, and the rights of the FDC will be abridged.” \nId. at 31. Defendant offers no support for this argument, nor does \nshe engage in any substantive analysis of the issue. See id. at 31–\n32. Ultimately, this Court disagrees with Defendant’s conclusion \nand summarily rejects the argument without discussion. \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, ECF No. 10, is \nGRANTED. \n2.  This Court certifies a class defined as “all current and \nfuture prisoners in the custody of the Florida Department \nof  Corrections  who  have  been  diagnosed,  or  will  be \ndiagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV).” \n \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 152   Filed 11/17/17   Page 15 of 15\n   \n \n3.  The class issues are: \na.  Whether  FDC’s  policies  and  practices  for  HCV-\ntreatment  constitute  deliberate  indifference  to \nserious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment; \nb.  Whether  FDC’s  policies  and  practices  for  HCV-\ntreatment result in discrimination in violation of \nthe ADA; and \nc.  Whether  FDC’s  policies  and  practices  for  HCV-\ntreatment result in discrimination in violation of \nthe RA. \n4.  Plaintiffs Carl Hoffer, Ronald McPherson, and Roland \nMolina shall serve as class representatives. \n5.  This  Court  appoints  Randall  C.  Berg,  Jr.,  Dante  P. \nTrevisani, and Erica A. Selig as class counsel. \nSO ORDERED on November 17, 2017. \n \n        s/Mark E. Walker     \n          United States District Judge \n15 \n ",

INCH, in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of \nCorrections, \n \nDefendant. \n__________________________/ \n \nORDER ON  \nCROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n  This  Court  previously  issued  a  preliminary  injunction \nrequiring the Florida Department of Corrections (“FDC”) to treat \ninmates infected with the Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”). ECF No. 153; \nECF No. 185. Defendant admits most of this Court’s prior findings \nand, by way of a motion for summary judgment, asks this Court to \nmake the preliminary injunction permanent and award no further \nrelief. ECF No. 270. Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment \nbut ask this Court to enter a permanent injunction broader in \nscope  than  the  preliminary  injunction.  ECF  No.  342.  For  the \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 2 of 68\n   \n \nreasons  that  follow,  the  parties’  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgment are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nI. Background \nA. Forging the Path \n  Plaintiffs  Carl  Hoffer,  Ronald  McPherson,  and  Roland \nMolina filed this case on May 11, 2017. ECF No. 1. All three were \ninmates in FDC’s custody, were infected with HCV, and had been \ndenied proper medical treatment. See id. They moved to certify a \nclass  of  similarly  situated  plaintiffs  and  also  moved  for  a \npreliminary  injunction  requiring  FDC  to  properly  treat  HCV-\ninfected inmates. ECF No. 10; ECF No. 11. \n  To  resolve  Plaintiffs’  motions,  this  Court  held  a  five-day \nevidentiary hearing beginning on October 19, 2017. See ECF No. \n142. This Court heard from medical experts, FDC officials, and the \nnamed Plaintiffs themselves. See id. The parties also introduced \nseveral exhibits, the most notable of which was “HSB 15.03.09 \nSupplement #3,” FDC’s official written policy for managing HCV \n(“FDC’s policy”). \n  Although  a  number  of  facts  remained  unclear,  the  truth \nuncovered at the hearing was crystal: FDC was shirking its duty \nto properly treat HCV-infected inmates because the treatment—\n2 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 3 of 68\n   \n \nspecifically, the use of direct-acting antivirals (“DAAs”)—was too \ncostly. By order dated November 17, 2017, this Court detailed \nFDC’s “long and sordid history of failing to treat HCV-infected \ninmates,”  held  that  Plaintiffs  were  likely  to  succeed  on  their \nEighth  Amendment  deliberate-indifference  claim,  and  granted \nPlaintiffs’  motion  for  preliminary  injunction.  ECF  No.  153. \nMoreover,  having  found  that  the  necessary  requirements  were \nmet, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification as \nwell. ECF No. 152. \n  Before  issuing  a  preliminary  injunction,  this  Court  first \nordered Defendant to file a proposed treatment plan consistent \nwith this Court’s “broad” directions. See ECF No. 153, at 28–32. \nAfter receiving Defendant’s plan, noting deficiencies with the plan, \nand  receiving  further  comments  from  the  parties,  this  Court \nultimately issued a preliminary injunction on December 13, 2017. \nECF No. 185. Simply put, the injunction requires Defendant to \n(1) ensure that FDC and its agents comply with the treatment plan \n(with modifications), (2) ensure that FDC and its agents comply \nwith FDC’s policy (with modifications), and (3) file monthly status \nreports outlining FDC’s progress in complying with the injunction. \nId. at 3–6. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 4 of 68\n   \n \nB. Fifteen Months Down the Road \n  Over fifteen months have passed since this Court issued the \npreliminary  injunction.  Within  that  time,  FDC  has  screened \n55,348  inmates  for  HCV,  identified  7,185  inmates  as  having \nchronic HCV (“cHCV”),1 and begun or completed treating 4,901 \ninmates with DAAs.2 ECF No. 453. In addition to making amends, \nFDC has also recognized some of its past wrongs. For instance, \nFDC  now  admits  that  it  “was  not  adequately  monitoring  all \ninmates with cHCV prior to the preliminary injunction.” ECF No. \n270, at 28. FDC further admits that “cHCV constitutes a serious \nmedical need” and that FDC’s “failure to treat inmates with cHCV \nwas due to lack of funding.” Id. at 17–18. In short, FDC admits this \nCourt’s finding of deliberate indifference. See id. at 18. \n                                           \n1 As explained in a previous order, “about 20–50% of people infected \nwith HCV spontaneously clear the virus within six months of infection.” ECF \nNo. 153, at 4. “The remaining 50–80% who don’t clear the virus are referred to \nas having chronic HCV.” Id. \n \n2 Time has also brought much change for the named Plaintiffs. Carl \nHoffer completed DAA treatment but died while still in custody and waiting \nfor a liver transplant. ECF No. 269-1, at 2; ECF No. 342, at 19. Ronald \nMcPherson completed DAA treatment and was later released from prison. ECF \nNo. 269-1, at 2. Roland Molina remains in FDC custody but has completed DAA \ntreatment, and “his post-testing indicates that he has achieved a sustained \nvirologic response (SVR), which means that [HCV] is no longer detected in his \nblood.” Id. Of course, these developments do not moot this case. See, e.g., J W \nex rel. Tammy Williams v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 904 F.3d 1248, 1265 n.4 \n(11th Cir. 2018). \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 5 of 68\n   \n \nC. A Course for the Future \n  Cases tend to be resolved rather quickly after a preliminary \ninjunction is issued. That is, preliminary injunctions  often get \nappealed, and the appellate courts’ opinions tend to be so decisive \nthat the parties either settle or one side accepts defeat.  Here, \nneither side appealed, and Defendant only accepted partial defeat. \nIndeed,  although  Defendant  “no  longer  wishes  to  contest”  the \nissues this Court “already resolved” and asks this Court to convert \nthe preliminary injunction to a permanent injunction, Defendant \nstill seeks summary judgment in his favor as to any unresolved \nissues.  ECF  No.  270,  at  2.  And  while  Plaintiffs  “agree  that  a \npermanent injunction should be entered against Defendant,” they \nsubmit that “there are a number of issues that are still in dispute, \nand several forms of relief that Plaintiffs are requesting that are \nnot currently required by the preliminary injunction,” ECF No. \n342, at 2. \n  Consequently, this Court is left to finish what it started \nwhen it issued the preliminary injunction almost a year and a half \nago. This Court agrees with the parties that summary judgment is \nthe right tool for that job. No triable issues of fact remain, so an \nevidentiary hearing is unnecessary to “convert” the preliminary \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 6 of 68\n   \n \ninjunction to a permanent injunction. United States v. Prater, No. \n8:02-CV-2052-T-23MSS, 2005 WL 2715401, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Sep. \n23, 2005). Instead, this Court may simply incorporate its prior \nfindings and “recast” them in terms of the permanent-injunction \nstandard.  See  id.  Accordingly,  this  Court  hereby  expressly \nincorporates all findings from its prior order granting Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction, ECF No. 153. \nII. Analysis \n  This Court begins its analysis by addressing the merits of \nPlaintiffs’ three claims: deliberate indifference under the Eighth \nAmendment; discrimination under Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  and  discrimination  under  the \nRehabilitation Act (“RA”). See ECF No. 1. This Court then turns to \nthe propriety of Plaintiffs’ additional requests for relief. Finally, \nthis Court considers the requirements for a permanent injunction.  \nA. The Merits of Plaintiffs’ Claims \n1.  Deliberate Indifference Under the Eighth Amendment \n  The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nprohibits  the  government  from  inflicting  “cruel  and  unusual \npunishments” on inmates. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 296–97 \n(1991). The Supreme Court has interpreted this prohibition to \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 7 of 68\n   \n \nencompass “deprivations . . . not specifically part of [a] sentence \nbut . . . suffered during imprisonment.” Id. at 297. Consequently, \nan  inmate  who  suffers  “deliberate  indifference”  to  his  “serious \nmedical needs” may state a claim for a violation of the Eighth \nAmendment. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). To prevail \non their claim of deliberate indifference, Plaintiffs must show (1) a \nserious medical need, (2) Defendant’s deliberate indifference to \nthat need, and (3) causation between Defendant’s indifference and \nPlaintiffs’ injuries. Goebert v. Lee County, 510 F.3d 1312, 1326 \n(11th Cir. 2007). \n  This Court previously found that chronic HCV is a serious \nmedical need. ECF No. 153, at 14–15. Defendant does not dispute \nthat finding. ECF No. 270, at 17. Moreover, several other courts \nhave since held that chronic HCV is a serious medical need. See, \ne.g., Stafford v. Carter, No. 1:17-cv-00289-JMS-MJD, 2018 WL \n4361639, at *12 (S.D. Ind. Sep. 13, 2018); Pevia v. Wexford Health \nSource, Inc., No. ELH-16-1950, 2018 WL 999964, at *16 (D. Md. \nFeb. 20, 2018). Once again, this Court concludes that chronic HCV \nis a serious medical need. \n  This  Court  also  previously  found  that  Defendant  was \ndeliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs. ECF \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 8 of 68\n   \n \nNo. 153, at 16–24. Defendant does not dispute that either. See \nsupra p. 4 (citing ECF No. 270). Of course, Defendant’s compliance \nwith the preliminary injunction since its issuance does not absolve \nDefendant of liability. This Court may still take Defendant’s past \nactions into account. See, e.g., O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, \n496 (1974) (“[P]ast wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there \nis a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.”). Moreover, \nDefendant continues to oppose relief that this Court finds to be \nconstitutionally required. See infra pp. 14–53. Given Defendant’s \npast  actions  as  well  as  Defendant’s  continued  opposition  to \nimplementing  constitutionally  required  relief,  this  Court  finds \nthat  Defendant  is  being  deliberately  indifferent  to  Plaintiffs’ \nserious medical needs and that there is a real and immediate \nthreat of repeated injury in the future. \n  Finally, as it did before, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have \nestablished  causation.  As  Secretary  of  FDC,  Defendant  is \nultimately  responsible  for  FDC’s  policies  and  practices.  See \n§ 20.315(3), Fla. Stat. As such, because Plaintiffs’ claim is based on \ninadequacies  in  FDC’s  policy  and  the  implementation  of  that \npolicy, the causation element is satisfied. Cf. Cottone v. Jenne, 326 \nF.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir. 2003) (“[T]he causal connection may be \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 9 of 68\n   \n \nestablished when a supervisor’s custom or policy . . . result[s] in \ndeliberate indifference to constitutional rights . . . .” (alteration in \noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Zatler v. Wainright, \n802 F.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir. 1986) (same).  \nThus, Plaintiffs have succeeded on the merits of their Eighth \nAmendment deliberate-indifference claim. \n2.  Discrimination Under Title II of the ADA3 \n  Title II of the ADA provides in relevant part: \nSubject  to  the  provisions  of  this  subchapter,  no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities  of  a  public  entity,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination by any such entity. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n \n  “[T]he  plain  text  of  Title  II  of  the  ADA  unambiguously \nextends to state prison inmates . . . .” Pa. Dep’t of Corrs. v. Yeskey, \n524 U.S. 206, 213 (1998). That is, “a disabled prisoner can state a \nTitle  II-ADA  claim  if  he  is  denied  participation  in  an  activity \nprovided in state prison by reason of his disability.” Bircoll v. \nMiami-Dade  County,  480  F.3d  1072,  1081  (11th  Cir.  2007). \n                                           \n3 This Court did not address Plaintiffs’ ADA claim in its order granting \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. See ECF No. 153, at 13 n.12. \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 10 of 68\n   \n \nAlthough “the ADA . . . was never intended to apply to decisions \ninvolving . . . medical treatment,” Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. \nSchiavo, 403 F.3d 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. 2005), the Supreme Court \nhas made clear that “medical ‘services’” fall within the ambit of \nTitle II, see Yeskey, 524 U.S. at 210. Therefore, a qualified inmate \nwho is denied the benefit of medical services by reason of his \ndisability can state a Title II ADA claim.4 \nDefendant does not dispute that a prison inmate can state a \nTitle II ADA claim for medical services. See ECF No. 270, at 28. \nRather,  the  only  dispute  regarding  Plaintiffs’  ADA  claim  is \nwhether inmates can assert a disability en masse. See id. at 28–32; \nECF No. 342, at 21. This Court finds they cannot.  \nThe ADA defines “disability” as “(A) a physical or mental \nimpairment  that  substantially  limits  one  or  more  major  life \nactivities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; \n                                           \n4 See, e.g., Lonergan v. Fla. Dep’t of Corrs., 623 F. App’x 990, 994 (11th \nCir.  2015)  (unpublished)  (holding  that  prison’s  failure  to  give  an  inmate \ntreatment prescribed by his dermatologist was “sufficient for the [inmate] to \nplead a prima facie ADA claim”); Stafford v. Wexford of Ind., LLC, No. 1:17-cv-\n00289-JMS-MJD, 2017 WL 4517506, at *3 (S.D. Ind. Oct. 10, 2017) (“Plaintiffs \ndo not complain[] about the quality of care administered by Wexford; rather, \nthey assert that Wexford has refused to treat Plaintiffs’ disabilities, which is \nactionable under the ADA.”); Johnson v. Bryson, No. 5:16-cv-453-CAR-MSH, \n2017 WL 3951602, at *1 (M.D. Ga. Sep. 8, 2017) (“[T]he ADA is not wholly \ninapplicable to claims based on deliberate indifference to an inmate’s medical \ncondition.”). \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 11 of 68\n   \n \nor (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102. A claimant only needs to satisfy one of those definitions. \nGordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., 100 F.3d 907, 911 (11th Cir. \n1996). Here, Plaintiffs claim that they satisfy the first two. ECF \nNo.  342,  at  21.  But  Plaintiffs  gloss  over  the  mandatory \nindividualized inquiry that accompanies both definitions.  \nAlthough Plaintiffs argue that “the case Defendant cites for \nthe  proposition  that  a  disability  determination  is  a  highly \nindividualized inquiry . . . was abrogated by the ADA Amendments \nAct of 2008 . . . and the Act’s implementing regulations,” ECF No. \n362, at 13–14, the very regulations Plaintiffs rely on still require \nan  “individualized”  inquiry.  Indeed,  beginning  with  the  first \ndefinition, the applicable regulation explicitly provides that “[t]he \ndetermination of whether an impairment substantially limits a \nmajor life activity requires an individualized assessment.” 28 \nC.F.R.  §  35.108(d)(1)(vi)  (emphasis  added).  This  Court  cannot \nignore the plain meaning of the word “requires.”5 This is especially \ntrue given that another subsection of the same regulation also \n                                           \n5 “[A] regulation should be construed to give effect to the natural and \nplain meaning of its words.” Ala. Air. Pollution Control Comm’n v. Republic \nSteel Corp., 646 F.2d 210, 213 (5th Cir. Unit B May 1981). \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 12 of 68\n   \n \nrefers to the individualized inquiry using mandatory language. \nSpecifically,  although  a  later  subsection  notes  that  “the \nindividualized assessment of some types of impairments will, in \nvirtually all cases, result in a determination of coverage,” it still \nrefers to the individualized assessment as being “necessary.”6 Id. \n§ 35.108(d)(2)(ii). \nThese  same  requirements  apply  to  the  ADA’s  second \ndefinition  of  disability  (i.e.,  the  “record  of”  definition).  Id. \n§ 35.108(e)(2) (noting that “the principles articulated in paragraph \n(d)(1) of this section apply”); § 35.108(d)(2)(ii) (referring to the \n“‘record of’ prong). And, as Plaintiffs point out, “[b]ecause Congress \nexplicitly  authorized  the  Attorney  General  to  promulgate \nregulations under the ADA . . . the regulations must [be given] \nlegislative and hence controlling weight.” ECF No. 362, at 15 n.8 \n(quoting Shotz v. Cates, 256 F.3d 1077, 1079–80 (11th Cir. 2001)). \n                                           \n6 It is no answer to harp on the fact that the assessment “should be \nparticularly  simple  and  straightforward.”  28  C.F.R.  §  35.108(d)(2)(ii).  No \nmatter how easy or straightforward the “individualized assessment” is, it is \nstill plainly “necessary.” Id.; see also Alston v. Park Pleasant, Inc., 679 F. App’x \n169,  172  (3d  Cir.  2017)  (unpublished)  (“We  agree  that  cancer  can—and \ngenerally will—be a qualifying disability under the ADA. Nevertheless, ‘[t]he \ndetermination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life \nactivity requires an individualized assessment.’ Although the ADAAA makes \nthe individualized assessment ‘particularly simple and straightforward’ for \ndiseases like cancer, an individualized assessment must still take place.” \n(citations omitted)). \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 13 of 68\n   \n \nBecause Plaintiffs assert their ADA claim as a class, and \nbecause an ADA claim requires an individualized inquiry, this \nCourt must decertify the class as to Plaintiffs’ ADA claim. See, e.g., \nStafford, 2018 WL 4361639, at *21 (decertifying class of HCV-\ninfected inmates with respect to ADA claim because the claim \nrequires an individualized assessment). However, given that Carl \nHoffer is  deceased, Ronald McPherson has been released from \nprison, and Roland Molina has been successfully treated, see ECF \nNo. 269-1, at 2, the named Plaintiffs can no longer state individual \nADA claims. As such, their ADA claims are denied as moot. \n3.  Discrimination under the RA7 \n  “Discrimination  claims  under  the  Rehabilitation  Act  are \ngoverned by the same standards used in ADA cases . . . .” Cash v. \nSmith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). The only relevant \ndifference is that the RA has a federal funding requirement. See, \ne.g., Badillo v. Thorpe, 158 F. App’x 208, 214 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(unpublished). It is undisputed that FDC receives federal funds. \nECF No. 1, at 42; ECF No. 187, at 29. Accordingly, for the same \nreason this Court decertified the class with respect to the ADA \n                                           \n7 This Court did not address Plaintiffs’ RA claim in its order granting \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. See ECF No. 153, at 13 n.12. \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 14 of 68\n   \n \nclaim, this Court also decertifies the class with respect to the RA \nclaim. See supra pp. 9–13. Again, the named Plaintiffs’ individual \nRA claims are denied as moot.  \nB. Plaintiffs’ Additional Requests for Relief \n  This Court did not address all of Plaintiffs’ requests for relief \nwhen it granted their motion for preliminary injunction. See ECF \nNo. 185, at 2. Instead, this Court focused on what seemed to be the \nmost pressing issues and noted that Plaintiffs were not precluded \nfrom seeking further relief later on. See id. Plaintiffs have taken \nadvantage of this Court’s promise and now seek fifteen categories \nof additional relief. See ECF No. 342. This Court addresses each \ncategory in turn.  \n1.  Routine  Opt-Out  Testing  and  an  Aggressive  Notice \nCampaign \n \nFDC uses an “opt-in” method of testing/screening inmates \nfor HCV; i.e., inmates are asked if they want their blood tested for \nHCV and only receive the test if they respond affirmatively. See \nECF No. 270, at 27; see also ECF No. 340-6, at 23–26. This is in \ncontrast to an “opt-out” method, where patients are told they are \ngoing  to  be  tested  for  HCV  (among  other  things)  and  must \nexplicitly ask to be excluded. \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 15 of 68\n   \n \n  Plaintiffs have asked for routine opt-out testing since the \ninception of this case. See ECF No. 1, at 44. They claim that FDC \nis knowingly undercounting the number of HCV-infected inmates \nand that opt-out testing would capture a larger amount. See ECF \nNo.  342,  at  24–27.  They  argue  that  FDC’s  knowledge  of  the \nproblem  and  failure  to  remedy  it  constitutes  deliberate \nindifference: \nDefendant  knows  that  there  are  thousands  more \nprisoners in its care who are infected with HCV and \nare at serious risk of damage to their health, but has \ndeliberately  remained  ignorant  of  their  identities, \nthereby ensuring they will never receive treatment. \nThis  “head-in-the-sand”  approach  amounts  to  clear \ndeliberate indifference. See, e.g., Lancaster v. Monroe \nCounty,  116  F.3d  1419,  1425  (11th  Cir.  1997). \n \nId. at 25. \nAt the evidentiary hearing in late 2017, Defendant’s medical \nexpert, Dr. Dewsnup, approved of opt-out testing but stated that \nopt-in testing was also appropriate as long as it was combined with \n“peer education.”8 ECF No. 340-19, at 46. However, FDC is only \nemploying peer education at two of its institutions and has no \n                                           \n8  Peer  education  consists  of  experienced  inmates  educating  other \ninmates  about  HCV  and  its  treatment.  Dr.  Dewsnup  explained  that  the \nbenefits of peer education are that inmate educators act as role models, speak \nthe right “language,” and can be asked questions without fear of reprisal. See \nECF No. 340-19, at 47. \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 16 of 68\n   \n \nspecified timeline for expanding the program statewide. ECF No. \n340-6, at 71–77. Moreover, FDC is unaware of whether materials \nare given out as part of the program, how many inmate educators \nhave been trained, or how many inmates have participated. Id. at \n198. \nFDC’s failure to implement peer education is also evident \nfrom the numbers. National estimates suggest that between 16% \nand 41% of the United States jail and prison population has HCV, \ntranslating to between 14,700 and 40,184 FDC prisoners. ECF No. \n10-1, at 5, 12. Dr. Dewsnup believes the best estimate for FDC \nprisoners  is  approximately  20%.  ECF  No.  340-5,  at  41–42. \nHowever, FDC has only identified 7,185 inmates as having chronic \nHCV; i.e., roughly 7%. ECF No. 453. Clearly FDC is undercounting \nthe number of inmates with chronic HCV, and it unquestionably \nknows it is doing so. ECF No. 340-6, at 232–35. This struthious \napproach to treatment amounts to deliberate indifference as it \nallows FDC to avoid any further obligations simply by pretending \nsick inmates don’t exist.9 \n                                           \n9 It is of no legal significance that FDC is being deliberately indifferent \nto inmates who are ignorant of their serious medical needs. The focus is on \nFDC’s knowledge, not the inmates’. See, e.g., Melton v. Abston, 841 F.3d 1207, \n1224 (11th Cir. 2016) (“[A] finding of deliberate indifference requires a finding \nof the defendant’s subjective knowledge of the relevant risk . . . .”). To hold \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 17 of 68\n   \n \nConsequently,  something  has  to  change.  This  Court  is \nmindful of its role “not to supervise prisons but to enforce the \nconstitutional rights of . . . prisoners.” Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, \n321  (1972);  see  also  Bell  v.  Wolfish,  441  U.S.  520,  562  (1979) \n(cautioning  federal  courts  not  to  become  “enmeshed  in  the \nminutiae of prison operations”). However, time has also shown \nthat FDC cannot be given free reign. Accordingly, this Court will \noffer Defendant two options. FDC can accept Plaintiffs’ proposal, \nwhich is to implement a system of opt-out testing along with an \naggressive  notice  campaign.  See  ECF  No.  342,  at  24–27. \nAlternatively, FDC can accept the proposal of its own expert, Dr. \nDewsnup, which is to undertake opt-in testing paired with peer \neducation.10 See ECF No. 340-19, at 46.  \nWhichever option Defendant takes, the undertaking needs \nto be legitimate. FDC may not continue to use opt-in testing and \nonly put forth a half-baked attempt at peer education. This Court \nis not choosing the best policy, but simply seeks to enforce the \n                                           \notherwise would mean that FDC could avoid treating an insane inmate simply \nbecause he is unaware of his condition. \n \n10 It is worth noting that Dr. Dewsnup also advised: “if it was going to \ncause a big kerfuffle, [he didn’t] think it’s worth the kerfuffle” to stick with opt-\nin testing. See ECF No. 340-19, at 46. Unless FDC operates under a policy of \njudicio-masochism, it would be wise to take the advice of its own experts. \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 18 of 68\n   \n \nrights of prisoners. In sum, this Court finds that FDC is being \ndeliberately  indifferent  by  not  following  the  advice  of  its  own \nmedical expert regarding a proper screening method. \n2.  Elastography \n  “The principal consequence of [HCV] infection is infection of \nthe liver, which causes inflammation that in turn may result in \nscarring of the liver (fibrosis).” ECF No. 153, at 2. “The amount of \nliver scarring a patient has is usually measured on the METAVIR \nscale.” Id. at 3. “On this scale, a person can be classified F0 (no \nfibrosis),  F1  (mild  fibrosis),  F2  (moderate  fibrosis),  F3  (severe \nfibrosis), or F4 (cirrhosis).” Id. \n  Both this Court and the parties have used the METAVIR \nscale  to  set  appropriate  medical  deadlines.  For  instance,  the \npreliminary injunction explicitly provides that “FDC must initiate \ntreatment for all known chronic HCV inmates, who are eligible for \ntreatment, and who have fibrosis stage 3, by December 31, 2018.” \nECF  No.  185,  at  4.  These  deadlines  are  premised  on  the \nunderstanding  that  liver  scarring  presents  serious  medical \nconsequences  and  that  survival  rates  differ  depending  on  the \nextent of scarring. Cf. ECF No. 153, at 3–6. As such, it is extremely \nimportant that inmates’ fibrosis levels are correctly identified. \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 19 of 68\n   \n \n  Currently, FDC is using FibroSure11 tests combined with \nultrasounds to estimate fibrosis levels. See ECF No. 370, at 14–15. \nHowever,  Plaintiffs’  medical  expert,  Dr.  Koziel,  claims  that \nFibroSure is “only accurate about 70% of the time.” ECF No. 340-\n34, at 1. She further notes that while FibroSure has “relatively \ngood sensitivity and specificity for advanced fibrosis or complete \nlack of fibrosis, [it] is not as good for measuring patients in the \nmiddle of the spectrum.” Id. Thus, she claims “there is a significant \nlikelihood that a patient with a FibroSure score of F1 may in fact \nhave fibrosis in the range of F2 to F3” and that “a FibroSure test \nmay miss fibrosis in a significant number of patients.” Id. at 1–2. \nMoreover,  she  believes  that  “[u]tilizing  follow-up  abdominal \nultrasounds,  while  helpful,  is  not  sufficient  to  identify  these \npatients.” Id. at 2. \n  Instead  of  using  the  FibroSure-plus-ultrasound  method, \nPlaintiffs want FDC to begin using elastography.12 ECF No. 342, \n                                           \n11  FibroSure  is  a  “proprietary  predictive  index  [that]  utilizes  a \ncombination of age, sex, and a battery of laboratory parameters [from a blood \ntest] to provide an estimate of the fibrosis stage.” ECF No. 369-3, at 2. \n \n12 The parties haven’t explained what elastography is in great detail. To \nplace things in context, this Court has taken judicial notice of certain facts that \nare not subject to reasonable dispute from sources whose accuracy cannot \nreasonably be questioned (at least not with respect to the facts at issue). Fed. \nR. Evid. 201(b)(2). From what this Court has gathered, elastography is a way \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 20 of 68\n   \n \nat  27–29.  Dr.  Koziel  states  that  “transient  elastography  is \nextremely accurate in detecting hepatic fibrosis, particularly for \npatients with moderate fibrosis (F1 to F2).” ECF No. 340-34, at 2. \nAlthough the gold standard for evaluating liver disease is (or, at \nleast,  was)  the  liver  biopsy,  Dr.  Koziel  believes  that  transient \nelastography  is  the  “next  most  accurate”  thing  (and  far  less \ninvasive). See ECF No. 361-3, at 34–35; ECF No. 10-1, at 7. \n  Dr. Dewsnup, on the other hand, sees things differently. Dr. \nDewsnup believes “there is a lack of data to support” Dr. Koziel’s \nstatement that FibroSure is only accurate about 70% of the time. \nECF No. 369-3, at 2. While Dr. Dewsnup “would acknowledge that \n.  .  .  predictive  indices  [(like  FibroSure)]  are  less  effective  for \ndistinguishing between those who are at Stage 2 or 3,” he believes \nthey are “strongly predictive at identifying the individuals who \nhave cirrhosis, and those who are at F0 and F1.” Id. Moreover, Dr. \n                                           \nof mapping the elastic properties of soft tissue (e.g., a liver) using various \nmedical  imaging  techniques.  See,  e.g.,  Elastography,  Wikipedia, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography  [https://perma.cc/6A5K-FDUP] \n(hereinafter “Wiki”). One form of elastography using ultrasound imaging is \nreferred  to  as  “transient  elastography,”  which  is  used  by the  commercial \nsystem FibroScan. See id. A newer form of elastography using ultrasound \nimaging is referred to as point shear-wave elastography. See, e.g., Rosa M.S. \nSigrist et al., Ultrasound Elastography: Review of Techniques and Clinical \nApplications, 7(5) Theranostics 1303, 1307–08 (2017). Finally, another form of \nelastography uses magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”). See Wiki. \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 21 of 68\n   \n \nDewsnup states that “[t]he abdominal ultrasound can be used as a \ncheck  to  make  sure  that  the  patient  is  not  worse  than  the \nproprietary score indicates.” Id. at 3.  \n  From his experience, Dr. Dewsnup finds that “no one test \nwill  give  you  a  perfect  estimate  of  staging”  and  that,  instead, \n“practitioners look for a concordance with the history, physical \nexam and symptoms, labs, and test results.” Id. He states that \nusually “there is concordance,” but “[i]n the limited circumstances \nin which that does not occur, . . . FDC has retained the option of \nusing  ultrasound  elastography.”  Id.  Dr.  Dewsnup  “do[es]  not \nbelieve [elastography] is necessary for all inmates who have cHCV, \nnor do[es] [he] believe that it is necessary for all inmates who are \nstaged at F0-F2.” Id. at 4. Rather, he “believe[s] there should be \nphysician discretion to use elastography for those inmates who are \nat F0 or F1 by FibroSure but have other laboratory or clinical \nindications that the stage may actually be higher.” Id. at 4. \n  After considering the statements of both sides’ experts, it \nseems that the propriety of using routine elastography is a matter \nof reasonable medical disagreement. Such disagreement does not \namount to deliberate indifference. See, e.g., Waldrop v. Evans, 871 \nF.2d  1030,  1033  (11th  Cir.  1989)  (“Mere  medical  malpractice, \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 22 of 68\n   \n \nhowever, does not constitute deliberate indifference. Nor does a \nsimple  difference  in  medical  opinion.”  (citation  omitted)). \nAccordingly,  this  Court  finds  that  FDC  is  not  constitutionally \nrequired to stage every HCV-infected inmate using elastography \n(despite the fact that it would probably be much better practice).  \n  Having  said  that,  this  Court  does  find  that  FDC  is \nconstitutionally  required  to  make  the  option  of  elastography \navailable to its medical staff. Even Dr. Dewsnup believes that \nphysicians should have the discretion to use elastography when \nnecessary. ECF No. 369-3. While Dr. Dewsnup hoped that FDC \nwould  be  utilizing  elastography  within  6–12  months  of  the \npreliminary-injunction  hearing,  id.  at  5,  it  is  this  Court’s \nunderstanding  that  FDC  is  still  not  using  any  kind  of \nelastography, see ECF No. 340-6, at 129. Instead, FDC merely has \nvague plans to obtain elastography machines at some unspecified \ntime in the future. Id.  at 129–30. Accordingly, this Court will \nrequire FDC to form a definite plan to make elastography available \nto its medical staff within a reasonably immediate timeframe and \nwill require FDC to stick to that plan assuming this Court agrees \nwith it. \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 23 of 68\n   \n \n  In sum, this Court finds that it is not deliberately indifferent \nfor FDC to use the fibrosure-plus-ultrasound method of staging \ninstead  of  elastography.  However,  this  Court  finds  that  it  is \ndeliberately  indifferent  for  FDC  not  to  have  the  option  of \nelastography available to medical staff.  \n3.  Treatment for F0 and F1 Inmates \n  FDC is not prescribing DAAs to inmates with fibrosis scores \nof F0 or F1.13 See ECF No. 340-23, at 8–10; ECF No. 340-6, at 129, \n200. Instead, those inmates are only monitored. That is, they are \n“seen” in the clinic every six months, “receive laboratory testing” \nevery  six  months,  and  receive  “proprietary  predictive  indices \nand/or elastography” every twelve months. ECF No. 340-23, at 7. \n  Plaintiffs  argue  that  F0  and  F1  inmates  should  also  be \ntreated with DAAs. ECF No. 342, at 30–31. They claim that “[t]he \nonly reason why FDC is electing not to provide treatment is due to \nthe cost of treatment, which is per se deliberate indifference.” Id. \nat 30 (quoting Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1509 (11th Cir. \n1991)). This Court agrees. \n                                           \n13 Unless they have another unique qualifying condition. See ECF No. \n340-23, at 8–10. \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 24 of 68\n   \n \n  Although Dr. Dewsnup testified that, with respect to the \ntreatment of F0 and F1 inmates, “it’s safe to wait for a bit,” ECF \nNo. 340-19, at 114, he never testified that F0 and F1 inmates \nshould never be treated, see id. at 1–208. Indeed, his statement was \nsimply made in the context of a preliminary-injunction hearing \nand faced with the need to triage thousands of inmates. See id. at \n117–18. FDC has not put forth any medical reason (nor does the \nrecord otherwise reveal a medical reason) why F0 and F1 inmates \nshould not be treated. Rather, as Dr. Dewsnup explicitly noted, F0 \nand F1 inmates must be treated eventually. Id. at 120 (“[W]e’re \ngoing to have to treat eventually even if they are Stage 0 or Stage \n1 . . . .”). \n  Meanwhile, F0 and F1 inmates face substantial suffering \nand harm. Dr. Koziel explained that HCV infection can result in \nmany symptoms, that there isn’t an “absolute correlation” between \nsymptoms and fibrosis stage, and that even F0 and F1 inmates can \nsuffer symptoms. ECF No. 361-3, at 45–48. And both Dr. Koziel \nand Dr. Dewsnup agreed that—even for F0 and F1 inmates—\nsuccessful treatment of HCV tends to decrease mortality rates. \nECF No. 340-40, at 58.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 25 of 68\n   \n \n  While Defendant claims that this Court already “rejected” \ntreatment for F0 and F1 inmates, ECF No. 370, at 17, that was \nonly this Court’s holding at the preliminary-injunction stage. This \nCourt  was  focused  on  ensuring  that  the  sickest  inmates  were \ntreated first and understood that—as a practical matter—it was \nunrealistic to order FDC to treat everyone immediately. See ECF \nNo. 340-19, at 130–31. But fifteen months have passed since then, \nand FDC has begun or completed treating almost 5000 inmates \nwithin that time. See supra p. 4. FDC can no longer use resource \nlimitations and implementation difficulties as an excuse to delay \ntreatment.  \n  This  Court  is  not  alone  in  recognizing  that  F0  and  F1 \ninmates  must  be  treated.  Indeed,  a  court  in  Indiana  granted \nsummary  judgment  in  favor  of  a  class  of  inmates  as  to  their \ndeliberate-indifference  claim  and  found  that  the  undisputed \nevidence in the case showed that all inmates with chronic HCV \nshould be treated. See Stafford, 2018 WL 4361639 at *18–20. And \na court in Pennsylvania denied the prison defendants’ motion for \nsummary judgment because it found that there was a genuine \ndispute of material fact as to whether they were being deliberately \nindifferent by not treating F0 and F1 inmates. Chimenti v. Wetzel, \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 26 of 68\n   \n \nNo.  15-3333,  2018  WL  3388305,  at  *10–12  (E.D.  Pa.  July  12, \n2018).14 Finally, although a third court declined to order treatment \nof F0 and F1 inmates at the preliminary-injunction stage, it still \nrecognized that the inmate plaintiffs “raise[d] substantial doubts” \nabout the defendants’ failure to treat F0 and F1 inmates. Buffkin \nv. Hooks, No. 1:17CV502, 2019 WL 1282785, at *9 (M.D.N.C. Mar. \n20, 2019). Further, that court enjoined the enforcement of the \nprison’s HCV policy because of the risk “that the policy might be \nconstrued to prohibit or prevent doctors from administering DAAs \nto any prisoner with HCV whose FibroSure score is below F2.” Id. \n  As far as timing, Plaintiffs propose that F0 and F1 inmates \nbe treated within two years of staging. See ECF No. 342, at 30–31. \nDefendant does not propose an alternative date (other than never). \nSee ECF No. 370. Given FDC’s progress in treating inmates within \nthe past fifteen months, see supra p. 4, this Court finds a two-year \ndeadline to be appropriate. Indeed, considering that FDC has been \nable to begin or complete treatment of almost 5000 inmates within \nthe past fifteen months, FDC should be able to begin treating the \n                                           \n14 The case has since settled. See Order, Chimenti v. Wetzel, No. CV 15-\n3333 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 7, 2019), ECF No. 139. \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 27 of 68\n   \n \n~4000 known F0 and F1 within the next two years. See ECF No. \n453, at 2–3. \n  In sum, this Court finds that even F0 and F1 inmates have \nserious medical needs, FDC is aware of those needs, and FDC’s \ndecision not to treat those inmates—without any medical reason \nfor that decision—constitutes deliberate indifference.  \n4.  Informed Refusals and Proper Education \n  FDC’s policy provides that “[o]nce patients are found to be \ninfected with chronic HCV, they should be counseled by a clinician \nduring  the  initial  visit  regarding  the  natural  history  of  the \ninfection,  measures  to  assess  the  progress  of  cHCV,  potential \ntreatment options, and specific measures to prevent transmitting \nthe HCV infection to others.” ECF No. 340-23, at 6. The policy does \nnot provide for any counseling or education after an inmate rejects \na procedure. See id. at 1–14. As of March 2019, 61 inmates have \nrefused to participate in the staging process and 171 inmates have \nrefused DAA treatment. ECF No. 453, at 2, 4. \n  As Plaintiffs rightfully point out, these refusal statistics “are \nincredibly high numbers given the 95% cure rate, absence of side \neffects, and devastating consequences of the disease.” ECF No. \n342, at 31. Plaintiffs argue “[t]he only logical inference is that the \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 28 of 68\n   \n \nvast majority of these patients were not fully informed of the above \ninformation.”  Id.  at  31–32.  In  support,  Plaintiffs  cite  the \ndeclarations of three inmates who refused staging because they \nwere not adequately informed of the process. Id. at 32. All three \ninmates  state  that  they  would  have  consented  had  they  been \nproperly informed. Id.  \nIn response, FDC cites the declaration of Dr. Alvia Varona, \nwho claims she personally counselled one of the three inmates \nPlaintiffs refer to. ECF No. 370, at 20. Dr. Varona states that \nduring her encounter with the inmate she “explained the blood \ndraw . . . and told him the labs were absolutely necessary in order \nfor him to be evaluated for curative treatment for cHCV.” ECF No. \n374-1, at 2. However, Dr. Varona does not state whether she told \nthe inmate about DAAs or why his blood test was different than \nthe others he had been offered for years. See id. And the inmate \nstates that Dr. Varona failed to provide him that information. ECF \nNo. 377-1. \n  FDC also cites the declarations of two nurses who claim that \nthey  provide  educational  information  about  HCV  to  newly \nincarcerated inmates at two of FDC’s reception centers. ECF No. \n370, at 19 (citing ECF No. 369-4, ECF No. 369-5). One of the nurses \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 29 of 68\n   \n \nfurther states that when an inmate refuses to have their blood \ndrawn  for  HCV  testing  she  “provide[s]  more  education  to  the \ninmate  about  cHCV,  particularly  about  the  risks  of  refusing \ntreatment, in an effort to get them to consent to being screened.” \nECF No. 369-4, at 1–2. But what the nurses don’t say is whether \nthey educate inmates about DAAs, the significance of the new HCV \ntests FDC is using, and FDC’s obligations for treatment as a result \nof this litigation. See ECF No. 369-4; ECF No. 369-5. Moreover, the \ntwo nurses can only speak for the education they provide at their \ntwo institutions; they don’t explain what is happening at the many \nother institutions FDC operates. \n  In short, Plaintiffs have presented evidence showing that \ninmates  are  not  being  properly  informed  after  refusing  HCV-\nrelated medical care. The declarations prepared by Dr. Varona and \nthe two nurses do not create a genuine dispute of material fact as \nto that issue.15 And, just as FDC cannot avoid its duty to treat by \nknowingly  undercounting  inmates,  see  supra  p.  16,  FDC  also \ncannot  avoid  its  duty  to  treat  by  knowingly  keeping  inmates \nunderinformed. Accordingly, this Court agrees with Plaintiffs that \n                                           \n15 Nor do the other cited declarations. See ECF No. 369-7, ECF No. 369-\n8, ECF No. 369-9. \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 30 of 68\n   \n \n“a  section  [must]  be  added  to  [FDC’s]  policy  requiring  an \nexplanation to anyone who refuses staging or treatment of, at \nleast, a) the consequences of HCV, b) the availability, lack of side \neffects, and efficacy of the new medications, c) the staging process, \nand d) whether and when they will receive treatment.” ECF No. \n342, at 32. This is so because it would be deliberately indifferent \nto  avoid  treating  HCV-infected  inmates  by  keeping  them \nuninformed about the nature of their treatment. \nDefendant can rest assured that this relief will not “usurp \nCenturion’s[16] medical judgment.” See ECF No. 370, at 21. It goes \nwithout saying that medical staff will still retain their independent \nmedical judgment when informing inmates. For example, staff will \nnot be required to tell inmates that DAAs have no side effects, but \nthey must be informing inmates that DAAs have far fewer side \neffects than the previous regimen. Cf. ECF No. 153, at 6–7.  \n5.  Shortening the Staging Deadline and Requiring Reliance on \nthe Most Serious Test Result \n \n  FDC’s policy provides that inmates must be staged within 90 \ndays of confirming they have chronic HCV. ECF No. 340-23, at 6. \n                                           \n16 FDC has outsourced its provision of medical care to Centurion, a \nprivate contractor. See ECF No. 153, at 10–12. \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 31 of 68\n   \n \nThis Court originally set the deadline at 60 days but later extended \nit at Defendant’s request. ECF No. 243. This Court granted the \nextension  because  it  accepted  Defendant’s  representation  that \nFDC needed additional time for inmates to undergo “ultrasound or \n‘EGD’ tests” with outside vendors. See id. Plaintiffs now claim that \n“further  discovery  has  demonstrated  that  the  deadline  should \nactually be shortened to 30 days.” ECF No. 342, at 33. This Court \nagrees.  \n  As Plaintiffs point out, “[s]taging is simply determining a \npatient’s fibrosis level.” Id. The record now reveals that FDC is \nrelying almost exclusively on the FibroSure to determine fibrosis \nlevels. See supra p. 19; see also ECF No. 370, at 14–15; ECF No. \n340-6, at 119–20. Although Defendant claims that FDC also uses \nultrasounds to stage inmates, see ECF No. 370, at 22–23, the truth \nis that ultrasound results can only make an inmate’s stage go up \n(by indicating the presence of cirrhosis). Dr. Dewsnup made clear \nthat  “the  ultrasound  is  not  used  to  estimate.  It’s  not  used  to \nestimate staging. It’s used to rule out occult portal hypertension \nand cirrhosis. It’s just a part.” ECF No. 340-5, at 76; see also ECF \nNo. 340-19, at 75. Dr. Cherry, Centurion’s Medical Director for the \nState of Florida, testified similarly: \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 32 of 68\n   \n \nQ.  So  everybody  gets  the  initial  staging  from  the \nFibroSure, right? \n \nA. Right. \n \nQ.  And  some  portion  of  those  patients  the  staging \ncould  be  changed  based  on  the  results  of  the \nultrasound? \n \nA. No. We just go by the FibroSure only. \n \nQ. Just by the FibroSure only? \n \nA. Right. \n \nQ. So – \n \nA. It’s not as accurate, but that’s what we are doing. \n \nQ.  Okay.  So  the  staging  --  the  initial  staging  that \nhappens  with  the  FibroSure  is  done  when  the \nFibroSure happens? \n \nA. Right. \n \nQ. And the follow-up ultrasounds are to screen for \nabnormalities? \n \nA. Right. Well, it allows you to – you have somebody \nthat’s an F4, okay, on the FibroSure test, you do the \nultrasound, it can be absolutely normal because the \nFibroSure is not – does not have a hundred percent \nspecificity  obviously.  So  we  find  that  kind  of \ninformation. \n  And also if they have F4, F3, you are doing an \nultrasound to see, like I said before, what’s going on \nwith  the  spleen.  If  it’s  enlarged,  its  an  indirect \nindication  of  significant  cirrhosis  or  some  kind  of \nfibrosis or whatever in the liver. You also use that to \ncalculate a platelet screen ratio.  \n \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 33 of 68\n   \n \nECF No. 340-4, at 48–49. \n \n  Since inmates can be initially staged using a FibroSure, the \nstaging deadline must only be based on the time it takes to get \nthose results. Indeed, it is critical that the staging deadline is only \nas short as necessary because treatment deadlines run from the \ndate an inmate is staged. In other words, if the staging deadline is \nartificially long, then that enables FDC delay treatment for a non-\nmedical  reason.17  “[A]  deliberate  delay  in  rendering  necessary \nmedical treatment for non-medical reasons is enough to state a \ndeliberate indifference claim.” Melton, 841 F.3d at 1229. \n  Plaintiffs claim that “[i]t only takes five days from the initial \nblood draw to get the [FibroSure] results,” ECF No. 342, at 33, and \nthat “[t]here is no reason why the vast majority of patients cannot \nsimply be staged initially within 30 days,” id. at 35. In a Rule \n30(b)(6)  deposition,  Dr.  Keller,  the  Chief  Medical  Officer  for \nCenturion, and Victoria Love, the Vice President of Operations for \nCenturion of Florida, also indicated that it should only take five \n                                           \n17 Not only does an artificially long staging deadline enable FDC to \ndelay treating inmates, it also enables FDC to avoid treating some inmates \naltogether because some inmates will have insufficient time remaining on their \nsentences—time they would have otherwise had but for the artificially long \nstaging  period.  See  infra  pp.  38–40  (discussing  the  exclusion  for  time \nremaining on sentence). \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 34 of 68\n   \n \ndays to obtain FibroSure results. See ECF No. 340-6, at 118–19. \nHowever,  Ms.  Love  has  since  stated  in  a  declaration  that  “all \nresults are not received within that amount of time.” ECF No. 369-\n11, at 2. Rather, she claims “[t]here is a range of time for the \nreceipt  of  the  FibroSure  results,  and  five  days  is  the  soonest \namount of time.” Id. Ms. Love does not state what the outer limit \nis for receiving results. See id. \n  To the extent Ms. Love’s declaration contradicts what she \nstated at her deposition, the declaration may be disregarded. See, \ne.g., Van T. Junkins & Assocs., 736 F.2d 656, 657 (11th Cir. 1984) \n(“When a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions \nwhich negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact, \nthat party cannot thereafter create such an issue with an affidavit \nthat  merely  contradicts,  without  explanation,  previously  given \nclear testimony.”). Regardless, Ms. Love did not state—and FDC \nhas  not  otherwise  shown—that  FibroSure  results  cannot  be \nobtained within thirty days. See ECF No. 369-11; see also ECF No. \n370, at 21–23. As such, this Court finds that the staging deadline \nmust be shortened to thirty days. Having the staging deadline any \nlonger amounts to deliberate indifference because it delays (and in \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 35 of 68\n   \n \nsome cases excludes) an inmate’s necessary treatment without a \nmedical reason. \n  To be clear, the thirty-day deadline does not mean that an \ninmate must be given an ultrasound within thirty days. As already \nmentioned, an inmate can be initially staged using a FibroSure.18 \nSee supra pp. 29–31. To the extent an inmate needs an ultrasound \nand the ultrasound reveals that the inmate is in a worse condition, \nthe inmate can be restaged to a higher level and placed on a shorter \ntreatment timeline. Ms. Love states that ultrasound results can be \nobtained within 90 days of the date a patient is found to be positive \nfor chronic HCV. ECF No. 369-11, at 2. Accordingly, any necessary \nultrasounds must occur within 90 days of the date an inmate is \ndiagnosed with chronic HCV. Any necessary restaging must occur \nwithin five days after the ultrasound results are obtained.  \n  Finally, Plaintiffs are right that it must be explicit in FDC’s \npolicy that “FDC must rely on the test, exam, or study indicating \nthe highest fibrosis level.” ECF No. 342, at 35; see also id. (“That \nis, if one indicator shows F3 but another shows F2, FDC must stage \nthe patient at F3.”). Defendant’s only counterargument is that \n                                           \n18 Of course, the deadline might have to be modified if FDC voluntarily \nswitches to using elastography instead of FibroSure tests. \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 36 of 68\n   \n \nPlaintiffs have failed to “supply any testimony or documents to \nsuggest this is not already being done.” ECF No. 370, at 23. What \nDefendant  fails  to  recognize  is  that  it  has  a  “long  and  sordid \nhistory” of failing to treat HCV-infected inmates. See ECF No. 153. \nAs a result, even if FDC is already relying on the most serious test \nresult, that requirement must be explicit in the policy to prevent \nany confusion or relapse in the future. \n6.  Shortening  the  Treatment  Deadlines  and  Making  them \nMandatory \n \nFDC’s  policy  states  that  inmates  in  Priority  1  “should” \nreceive treatment within six months and that inmates in Priority \n2 “should” receive treatment within twelve months. ECF No. 340-\n23, at 9. Plaintiffs argue that “the policy should be edited to clarify \nthat these are mandatory deadlines, not aspirational goals,” and \nthat “the deadlines should be shortened.” ECF No. 342, at 36. \nThis Court finds that FDC’s policy needs to have mandatory \ndeadlines. Defendant’s only counterargument is that “[c]reating \nmandatory deadlines would completely remove medical judgment \nfrom the treatment of the inmates, and would not account for the \nindividual circumstances of different inmates.” ECF No. 370, at 24. \nBut  Defendant  fails  to  adequately  explain  why  mandatory \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 37 of 68\n   \n \ndeadlines would be unworkable. This Court set several deadlines \nin its preliminary injunction, and Defendant seems to understand \nthose are mandatory. This Court sees no reason why the case \nshould be any different when those deadlines are in FDC’s policy. \nMoreover,  contrary  to  Defendant’s  assertion,  adding \nmandatory  deadlines  to  FDC’s  policy  does  not  mean  that  all \n“medical flexibility to treat the patient would be removed.” Cf. id. \nat 25. The policy still permits medical staff to temporarily exclude \nan inmate from treatment if the inmate isn’t ready for it. See ECF \nNo. 340-23, at 10. That exclusion necessarily includes inmates who \nare “not cooperative with the process of being diagnosed, staged, \nand evaluated.” Cf. ECF No. 370, at 25.  \nHowever, this Court finds that the deadlines do not need to \nbe shortened. While it might be ideal to have shorter treatment \ndeadlines, Plaintiffs have failed to show that the current deadlines \nresult in deliberate indifference. In fact, the only support Plaintiffs \noffer for shorter deadlines is a settlement entered into  by the \nMassachusetts Department of Corrections. See ECF No. 342, at 36. \nThe  fact  that  one  state’s  prison  system  settled  for  a  shorter \ndeadline does mean every state must follow suit. Besides, this \nCourt decided on the deadlines it set at the preliminary-injunction \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 38 of 68\n   \n \nstage because they were supported by Dr. Dewsnup’s testimony. \nPlaintiffs have failed to provide any medical evidence suggesting \nthat the deadlines should be shortened. Thus, this Court cannot \nconclude  that  the  current  deadlines  amount  to  deliberate \nindifference. \n7.  Restaging F0, F1, and F2 Inmates Every 6 Months \n \n  FDC’s policy provides that F0, F1, and F2 inmates shall be \n“seen” and “receive laboratory testing” every six months but only \nbe restaged every twelve months. ECF No. 340-23, at 7. Plaintiffs \nargue that these inmates should instead be restaged every six \nmonths. ECF No. 342, at 36–37. This Court disagrees. \n  While it might be better to have inmates restaged every six \nmonths, that does not make it constitutionally required. Moreover, \ncontrary to Plaintiffs’ representation, “both Dr. Dewsnup and Dr. \nKoziel” did not recommend restaging every six months. Cf. id. at \n37. While Dr. Koziel did make such a recommendation, ECF No. \n340-34, at 2, Dr. Dewsnup simply said that “continual monitoring \nand serial evaluation is . . . critical.” ECF No. 340-19, at 161. When \nasked whether “that would include monitoring or drawing labs \nevery 3 to 6 months,” Dr. Dewsnup replied: “That’s correct. And \ndoing  imaging  studies  probably  every  year.  I  think  we  are \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 39 of 68\n   \n \nstabilizing it about a year for serial elastography.”19 Id. (emphasis \nadded). \n  Additionally,  Dr.  Keller  recommends  against  restaging \nevery six months. ECF No. 369-10, at 3. He states that it would not \nbring “any significant medical benefit.” Id. Further, he states that \nhe is “not aware of any medical literature that would support this \nrequest.” Id. Finally, he notes that “[i]n the rare instance in which \nan inmate in stages F0-F2 were to show signs of rapid progression, \nmedical staff has the discretion to re-order a FibroSure for updated \nstaging.” Id. at 3–4. \n  Consequently,  this  Court  finds  that  there  is  reasonable \nmedical  disagreement  about  whether  F0,  F1,  and  F2  inmates \nshould be restaged every six months. As previously explained, such \ndisagreement does not amount to deliberate indifference. See, e.g., \nWaldrop, 871 F.2d at 1033. Therefore, this Court cannot order \nFDC to restage F0, F1, and F2 inmates every six months. \nHowever,  even  Dr.  Keller  recognizes  that  medical  staff \nshould  have  the  discretion  to  restage  inmates  sooner  than \n                                           \n19 This Court understands that “imaging studies” are not the same thing \nas a FibroSure test. However, they are both tools for restaging. And Dr. \nDewsnup has already stated that he finds them effectively equivalent. See \nsupra pp. 20–21. Given that context, Dr. Dewsnup can be understood to be \nrecommending restaging once a year. \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 40 of 68\n   \n \nscheduled. ECF No. 369-10, at 3–4. FDC’s policy does not explicitly \nallow for such discretion. See ECF No. 340-23, at 7. Given FDC’s \npast and the potential for relapse in the future, it is important that \nthe policy include clear directives. Accordingly, this Court finds \nthat FDC’s policy must be amended to make clear that medical \nstaff have the discretion to restage inmates sooner than scheduled. \nDenying such discretion amounts to deliberate indifference. \n8.  The Exclusion for Time Remaining on Sentence \n \n  FDC’s policy excludes from treatment anyone who does not \n \nhave sufficient time remaining on their sentence in the \nDepartment of Corrections to complete pre-treatment \nevaluation, a course of treatment (lasting between 8-\n24 weeks) and post treatment SVR[20] assessment at \n12 weeks after treatment is completed, in order for \npatient  education  and  system  efficiencies  to  be \nevaluated (generally, this requires approximately 12-\n18 months). \n \nECF No. 340-23, at 10.  \nPlaintiffs argue that this exclusion should be amended in \nseveral respects. ECF No. 342, at 37–38. This Court agrees. \n  First, this Court finds that the exclusion must not refer to \n“pre-treatment evaluation.” FDC only considers the exclusion after \n                                           \n20 SVR stands for sustained viral or virologic(al) response. See ECF No. \n340-19, at 58; ECF No. 10-1, at 9. The term is used to describe the condition of \nhaving cleared a virus on a certain date after treatment. See ECF No. 340-19, \nat 59; ECF No. 10-1, at 9. \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 41 of 68\n   \n \nan inmate has already been evaluated.21 See ECF No. 340-6, at 84, \n121–22. As such, leaving in the requirement that there be time for \npre-treatment evaluation will only cause confusion and increase \nthe  potential  for  unwarranted  future  exclusions.  Plaintiffs  are \ncorrect in noting that “it’s important for the policy to be precise and \naccurate because it will be relied upon by practitioners long after \nthis  case  is  over  and  therefore  must  be  easily  understood  by \nsomeone unfamiliar with this case.” ECF No. 378, at 13. \n  Second, this Court finds that the exclusion must not refer to \n“post treatment SVR assessment.” The only rationale FDC offers \nfor post-treatment testing is that it allows FDC to make sure the \nprogram is working and to make improvements to the program in \nthe future. See ECF No. 370, at 29–32 (citing ECF No. 369-3). \nWhile that is certainly a worthwhile goal, that goal only helps \nmake treatment generally better for inmates in the future, it’s not \n                                           \n  21 Defendant harps on the need “to do a pre-treatment evaluation of \nsuch  things  as  [an  inmate’s]  readiness  and  willingness  to  adhere  to  the \ntreatment.” ECF No. 370, at 28. This Court is not holding that FDC cannot \nconduct such an evaluation. Rather, this Court is simply acknowledging the \nfact that—according to Defendant’s Rule 30(b)(6) representative—the decision \nto exclude an inmate for remaining time on their sentence isn’t made until after \nan evaluation has occurred. That is, the inmate has already been evaluated for \nreadiness and willingness to adhere to treatment.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 42 of 68\n   \n \na medical reason to withhold treatment from a specific inmate in \nthe present. \n  Finally, this Court finds that the exclusion must not include \nthe  “12-18  months”  estimate.  Given  that  pre-treatment \nevaluations and post-treatment SVR assessments will no longer be \ntaken into account, an inmate shouldn’t need twelve to eighteen \nmonths remaining on their sentence. Instead, the inmate—who \nhas already been staged and evaluated—simply  needs to have \n“sufficient” time remaining on their sentence to complete a course \nof treatment. \n  In  sum,  this  Court  finds  that  the  exclusion  for  time \nremaining on an inmate’s sentence contains language that will \nlead to an inmate being excluded from necessary treatment for \nnon-medical  reasons.  Such  exclusion  amounts  to  deliberate \nindifference.  \n9.  Referrals to Health Clinics for Those Being Released \n \n  Plaintiffs  argue  that  inmates  who  are  deemed  ineligible \nbased on insufficient time remaining on their sentence “should be \nreferred  to community health centers to obtain treatment and \ntesting.” ECF No. 342, at 39. However, “FDC already provides pre-\nrelease planning for inmates who need continuity of health care \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 43 of 68\n   \n \nwhen  they  are  released.”  ECF  No.  370,  at  32.  Plaintiffs  have \noffered no legal basis for ordering FDC to do any more than it is \nalready doing in that respect. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request is \ndenied. \n10. Exclusion for High-Risk Behaviors \nFDC’s policy excludes from treatment anyone who does not \n“demonstrate willingness and an ability to adhere to a rigorous \ntreatment regimen and to abstain from high risk behaviors while \nincarcerated.” ECF No. 340-23, at 10. Plaintiffs argue that this \nexclusion should be amended in several respects. ECF No. 342, at \n39–41. This Court agrees in part and disagrees in part. \nFirst, this Court finds that “not all infractions should result \nin automatic exclusions.” Cf. id. at 39. Treatment can only be \ndelayed for “medical reasons.” See Melton, 841 F.3d at 1229. As \nsuch, unless there is a medical reason to exclude an inmate from \ntreatment based on a single infraction, the inmate must not be \nexcluded. However, the question is not—as Plaintiffs propose—\nsimply  whether  the  behavior  has  “any  bearing  on  whether  a \npatient will show up to the pill line every day.” ECF No. 342, at 30. \nRather,  as  Dr.  Dewsnup  points  out,  “ineligibility  is  a  clinical \njudgment  that  must  be  made  by  physicians  who  take  into \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 44 of 68\n   \n \nconsideration many factors on a case-by-case basis.” ECF No. 369-\n3, at 8. \nOf course, it is impossible for this Court to list each and every \ntype of behavior that might render an inmate ineligible. This Court \nis  not  a  medical  professional,  and,  as  Dr.  Dewsnup  stated, \nexclusions require a case-by-case analysis. However, Defendant \nmust be aware that the acts of consuming illicit drugs or fighting \nother  inmates,  in  and  of  themselves,  are  not  valid  reasons  to \nexclude  treatment.  This  is  true  even  if  an  inmate  is  using \nintravenous  drugs  and  risks  re-infecting  himself  with  HCV.22 \nWhat  matters  is  whether  there  is  a  “medical  reason”  to  deny \ntreatment. If medical staff conclude that that there is a medical \nreason to deny an inmate treatment because of the inmate’s illicit \ndrug use or fighting, then so be it. If FDC begins abusing the \nexclusion by excluding inmates without a valid medical reason, \nthen Plaintiffs can move this Court to find Defendant in violation \nof the permanent injunction.  \n                                           \n22 Cf. Reid v. Clarke, No. 7:16-cv-00547, 2018 WL 3626122, at *4, n.2 \n(W.D. Va. July 30, 2018) (“Take a prisoner who cuts his own wrists. A prison \nwould have little basis to refuse treatment on the grounds that he himself had \ncreated the harm, or that he might try to commit suicide again.”). \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 45 of 68\n   \n \nSecond, this Court finds that the policy must be amended to \nclarify  that  these  are  temporary  ineligibilities,  not  permanent \nexclusions. FDC and its experts seem to agree that the exclusion \nis only “temporary.” See ECF No. 370, at 34–35. Although the \npolicy already states that inmates are only ineligible “until [their] \nissues are considered to be resolved,” ECF No. 340-23, at 10, the \npolicy must be amended to minimize any confusion. \nThird, this Court disagrees that FDC should be required to \nre-evaluate inmates after a period of no more than three months. \nSee ECF No. 342, at 41. Plaintiffs have failed to provide a legal \nbasis for that requirement. And both Dr. Keller and Dr. Dewsnup \nstate that the question is determined on a case-by-case basis. See \nECF No. 340-6, at 125 (“I think it’s on a case-by-case basis, but as \na general rule, I believe it’s six months, but that’s not a hard-and-\nfast rule.”); ECF No. 369-3, at 8. \nFinally, this Court finds that “the language in J.3 implying \nthat  patients  can  be  excluded  for  vague  things  like  ‘chronic \ndisciplinary  issues’  or  ‘chronic  behavioral  management  issues’” \nmust be amended. See ECF No. 342, at 41. Defendant admits that \nFDC considers these factors to be a basis for ineligibility. ECF No. \n370, at 36. As this Court just explained, FDC must be mindful of \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 46 of 68\n   \n \nthe fact that a history of “chronic disciplinary issues,” in and of \nitself, is not a valid reason to exclude an inmate. Indeed, there are \nplenty of disciplinary issues that do not bear on an inmates’ ability \nto “maintain a therapeutic provider-patient relationship.”23 Cf. id. \nIn sum, this Court finds that the exclusion for high-risk \nbehaviors includes language that will lead to an inmate being \nexcluded from necessary treatment for non-medical reasons. Such \nexclusion amounts to deliberate indifference. \n11. Clarifying MELD Score Calculation and Liver Transplant \nPolicy \n \n  Sometimes HCV infections can cause so much damage to a \npatient’s liver that the patient needs a liver transplant. See ECF \nNo. 10-1, at 6. Indeed, “HCV is . . . the most common reason for \nliver transplants in the United States.” Id. at 3. Accordingly, FDC’s \npolicy includes a section on liver transplants. ECF No. 340-23, at \n13. Both sides seek to amend the section. ECF No. 342, at 41–43; \nECF No. 370, at 38–40. This Court begins with Plaintiffs’ requests \nand then turns to Defendant’s. \n                                           \n23 For example, an inmate who is repeatedly found in possession of \n“excess photographs” could be considered to have chronic disciplinary issues. \nSee Fla. Admin. Code R. 33-602.201(5)(a)(2). This Court can conceive of no \nreason how that history, in and of itself, could constitute a medical reason to \ndeny treatment. \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 47 of 68\n   \n \n  First,  this  Court  agrees  with  Plaintiffs  that \n“decompensation”  must  be  defined  as  “the  presence  of \nencephalopathy, ascites, bleeding varices, or jaundice.” See id. at \n41. Dr. Keller states that is the “standard medical definition.” ECF \nNo.  340-6,  at  86;  see  also  ECF  No.  369-10,  at  4.  Moreover, \nDefendant does not object to including that definition in the policy. \nECF No. 370, at 38. \n  Second, this Court agrees with Plaintiffs that “it [must] be \nclarified to state that patients will be referred if they have any \none of the listed items.” ECF No. 342, at 41–42. Defendant does \nnot object to that request. See ECF No. 370, at 37–43. Moreover, \nthere is no dispute that any one of the listed conditions qualifies \nan inmate for referral. See id. at 38–39. \n  Third, this Court disagrees with Plaintiffs that “the policy \nshould require that MELD scores be calculated every 30 days.” \nECF No. 342, at 42. Dr. Dewsnup testified that MELD scores cover \na three-month period. See ECF No. 340-19, at 156–57. Moreover, \nDr.  Keller  states  that  “he  would  not  recommend  a  30-day \nrecalculation  of  MELD  for  patients  who  have  decompensated \ncirrhosis.” ECF No. 369-10, at 5. He explains that “inmates with \nanemia can ill afford a regular 30-day blood loss” and “drawing \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 48 of 68\n   \n \nblood every 30 days could cause an inmates’ veins to collapse.” Id. \nPlaintiffs offer no contrary medical evidence. See ECF No. 342, at \n41–43; see also ECF No. 378, at 18–19. \n  Fourth, this Court agrees with Plaintiffs that referrals “must \nbe [initiated] within 30 days of any one of the triggering events.” \nECF No. 342, at 42. There is no apparent medical reason to justify \nmore than such a delay. And Defendant “do[es] not oppose the \nincorporation of a 30-day period-of-time for a referral,” as long as \nit only constitutes the deadline for initiation. ECF No. 370, at 40. \n  Fifth,  this  Court  agrees  with  Plaintiffs  that  “the  policy \n[must] require the FDC to promptly comply with the transplant \ncenter’s request for records and other information, and to promptly \ntransport the inmate to and from the transplant center.” ECF No. \n342, at 42–43. Defendant does not offer any medical reason why it \nshould be permitted to delay complying with such requests. ECF \nNo. 370, at 42. And Defendant’s long and sordid history shows that \nthere is a risk of future harm absent clear instructions. \n  Finally, this Court disagrees with Defendant’s request to \nrevise the list of qualifying conditions. See ECF No. 370, at 38–39. \nDefendant  offers  no  medical  reason  to  remove  the  “significant \ncomplication or co-morbidity of cirrhosis” language. See ECF No. \n48 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 49 of 68\n   \n \n370, at 39–40. Instead, Defendant simply notes that it “would be \ndifficult for providers to interpret and apply consistently.” Id. at \n40. That difficulty is not a medical reason to deny an inmate access \nto a liver transplant.24 Moreover, that argument is inconsistent \nwith  Defendant’s  position  that  medical  staff  must  be  given \nsufficient discretion. See, e.g., id. at 10 (claiming that Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief “shockingly seeks to remove medical judgment and \ndiscretion”). \n  However,  this  Court  agrees  with  Defendant  that  “for \nindividuals who have been scheduled to receive DAA medication, \nare  undergoing  DAA  treatment,  or  who  have  finished  DAA \ntreatment, a referral [must] be made only if the post-treatment \nMELD score is over 15.”  Id.  at 39. Dr. Keller believes that is \nappropriate because DAAs “have the potential of lowering one’s \ndegree of fibrosis and the MELD score.” ECF No. 369–10, at 4. \nPlaintiffs have offered no evidence to the contrary. See ECF No. \n342, at 41–43; ECF No. 378, at 18–19. \n \n \n                                           \n24 If anything, it might mean that the language needs to be further \nclarified. \n49 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 50 of 68\n   \n \n12. Clarifying Exclusion for Life Expectancy \n \n  FDC’s policy excludes from treatment anyone who does not \n“have a life expectancy sufficient to achieve a benefit from HCV \nviral eradication.” ECF No. 340-23, at 10. Plaintiffs argue that “the \npolicy should state that a patient is only ineligible if he or she has \na life expectancy of less than 18 months.” ECF No. 342, at 43. This \nCourt disagrees. \nThe only support Plaintiffs offer for their request is the fact \nthat the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), Massachusetts, and \nMinnesota  use  eighteen  months  for  their  life-expectancy \nexclusions.  See  id.  Neither  the  BOP,  nor  Massachusetts,  nor \nMinnesota  sets  the  national  standard  for  what  is  appropriate. \nMoreover,  Dr.  Dewsnup  states  that  if  Plaintiffs’  request  were \nimplemented,  “FDC  physicians  would  be  less  able  to  make \ndecisions  that  were  individualized  to  the  patient’s  unique \ncircumstances.” ECF No. 369-3, at 10. As such, there appears to be \na medical reason to justify the current wording of FDC’s exclusion. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have failed to show that the exclusion for \nlife expectancy amounts to deliberate indifference. \n \n  \n50 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 51 of 68\n   \n \n13. Correcting the Risk Factors \n  FDC’s policy provides that “[r]isk factors for [HCV] infection \nmay include, but are not limited to, injection drug use, transfusion \nwith  HCV-infected  blood  or  blood  products,  tattooing,  vertical \ntransmission from mother to child, and massive exposure to HCV-\ninfected blood during fighting or other trauma.” ECF No. 340-23, \nat  1.  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  list  of  risk  factors  should  also \nexplicitly include “being born between 1945 and 1965, previous \nincarceration, and HIV.” ECF No. 342, at 43. This Court agrees. \nDr. Dewsnup admitted that previous incarceration and being born \nbetween 1945 and 1965 should be included as risk factors. ECF No. \n340-5, at 141. And he also stated that the co-infection rate of HCV \nand HIV “is somewhere between 25 and 40 percent.” Id. at 16–17.  \n  In  response,  Defendant  notes  that  screening  for  HCV  is \noffered to all patients “regardless of risk factors.” ECF No. 370, at \n46 (quoting ECF No. 340-23, at 6). But that argument misses the \npoint. Risk factors affect the decision-making of an inmate who \nmight be concerned whether he should self-select for screening. By \ngiving  inmates  more  risk  factors,  inmates  can  make  better-\ninformed decisions, which should lead to greater number of HCV-\ninfected inmates being tested. Contrarily, by minimizing the list of \n51 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 52 of 68\n   \n \nrisk factors, FDC can avoid its duty to treat by keeping inmates \nunderinformed  and  remaining  ignorant  of  the  true  number  of \ninfected inmates. In sum, FDC’s current wording of the risk-factor \nlanguage amounts to deliberate indifference.  \n14. Monitoring \n  This Court’s preliminary injunction requires Defendant to \nfile monthly status reports outlining FDC’s progress in treating \nHCV-infected inmates. See ECF No. 185, at 5–6; see also id. at 2 \nn.1 (“Like President Ronald Reagan, this Court will ‘trust but \nverify.’”). The injunction requires Defendant to include specific \nstatistics like, for example, “[t]he total number of inmates in FDC \ncustody who have been identified as having chronic HCV.” Id. at 6. \nPlaintiffs  claim  that  the  reports  are  “not  sufficient  .  .  .  to \nadequately ensure that Defendant is in compliance.” ECF No. 342, \nat 44–46. Accordingly, Plaintiffs propose several changes to the \nmonitoring scheme. This Court agrees in part and disagrees in \npart. \n  First, this Court finds that the monthly status reports must \ninclude the total number of inmates who \n(a) have been screened/tested for HCV,  \n(b) have been identified as having chronic HCV,  \n52 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 53 of 68\n   \n \n(c) have been identified as having chronic HCV and \nhave been staged (which must be further broken \ndown  by  stage,  including  F0,  F1,  F2,  F3,  F4, \ndecompensated cirrhosis, and those with HIV), \n(d) have been submitted to the Hepatitis C Committee \nfor evaluation (which must be further broken down \nby  stage,  including  F0,  F1,  F2,  F3,  F4, \ndecompensated cirrhosis, and those with HIV), \n(e) have begun treatment with DAAs,  \n(f) have completed treatment with DAAs, \n(g) have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR),  \n(h) have not achieved SVR, and  \n(i) have  been  deemed  (temporarily  or  permanently) \nineligible for treatment with DAAs along with the \nspecific reason for ineligibility. \n \nSee ECF No. 342, at 44. This information is necessary for this \nCourt to ensure that the permanent injunction is being complied \nwith and that FDC has not relapsed to its sordid past. Cf., e.g., \nWishtoyo Found. v. United Water Conservation Dist., No. CV 17-\n3869-DOC (PLAx), 2018 WL 5256099, at 75 (C.D. Cal. Sep. 23, \n2018) (appointing a special master to “monitor compliance” with a \npermanent injunction and retaining jurisdiction “for the purposes \nof enforcing or modifying the terms of” a permanent injunction). \n  Second,  this  Court  finds  that  Defendant’s  reports  must \ninclude  a  certification  regarding  FDC’s  compliance  “with  the \napplicable deadlines for prisoners known to have chronic HCV in \nDecember 2017.” Id. Again, this information is necessary to ensure \ncompliance with this Court’s permanent injunction. \n53 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 54 of 68\n   \n \n  Third, this Court disagrees that Defendant must provide \nPlaintiffs  with  updated  versions  of  its  spreadsheets  or  “all \ndocumentation” associated with prisoners deemed ineligible for \ntreatment or who refuse staging See id. at 45. The status reports \nshould be sufficient to monitor compliance. If they’re not, Plaintiffs \ncan  move  for  a  modification  of  the  permanent  injunction  and \nexplain why further information is required. Moreover, Plaintiffs \ncan  submit  public-records  requests  for  the  spreadsheets  and \ndocumentation if they so choose.  \n  Fourth, this court disagrees that FDC should “be required to \nreceive complaints from Plaintiffs’ counsel about compliance with \nthe order.” See ECF No. 342, at 45–46. Again, the status reports \nshould be sufficient to monitor compliance. If Plaintiffs want to \ninitiate  complaints,  Plaintiffs  are  free  to  direct  those  to  FDC. \nHopefully, the parties will be able to  resolve those complaints \nharmoniously. If not, it is Plaintiffs’ prerogative to decide whether \nto bring those complaints to this Court’s attention. \n  Finally, this Court agrees that any future changes to FDC’s \npolicy must be submitted to this Court for approval. See id. at 46. \nGiven FDC’s long and sordid history of neglecting HCV-infected \ninmates,  as  well  as  FDC’s  continued  opposition  to  the  relief \n54 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 55 of 68\n   \n \ngranted  in  this  order,  this  Court  finds  that  FDC  must  not  be \npermitted to unilaterally amend its policy (at least for the time \nbeing).  In  the  future,  this  Court  may  consider  modifying  the \ninjunction to remove that requirement. \n15. Amending the Deadline for Treating F2s Who Were Known \nto Have Chronic HCV in December 2017 \n \n  This Court’s preliminary injunction (which was entered in \nDecember  2017)  distinguished  between  FDC’s  obligations  with \nrespect to inmates who were known to have chronic HCV at the \ntime and inmates whom FDC only discovered to be infected in the \nfuture. See ECF No. 185. Plaintiffs point out that this dual track \nof deadlines presented an anomaly: \nCurrently, for inmates known to have chronic HCV in \nDecember 2017 who are at F2, the treatment deadline \nis  December  2019  and  the  evaluation  deadline  is \nSeptember 2019. But going forward, F2 inmates will \nbe treated at most within 1 year of staging (although \nPlaintiffs have requested 6 months) and evaluated at \nleast  30  days  before  treatment.  This  produces  an \nanomalous result: An F2 inmate discovered tomorrow \nwill be treated within 1 year (June 2019), or 6 months \n(December  2018),  whereas  someone  known  in \nDecember 2017 will have to wait until December 2019 \nfor  treatment. Thus, the December 2019 treatment \ndeadline and September 2019 evaluation deadline for \nF2  inmates  known  in  December  2017  should  be \ndeleted,  and  all  F2  inmates  should  be  treated \naccording to the policy going forward. (To phase in this \nchange, the treatment deadline can begin to run from \n55 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 56 of 68\n   \n \nthe date judgment is entered, rather than the date \nthey were staged). \n \nECF No. 342, at 48. \n \n  Plaintiffs  are  right  that  the  situation  they  describe  is \nanomalous.  However,  given  the  time  that  has  passed  since \nPlaintiffs moved for summary judgment, the anomaly Plaintiffs \nnoted no longer exists.25 Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request is denied \nas moot. \n16. Concluding Note on Plaintiffs’ Requests for Relief \nLet it be clear: this Court is not picking and choosing what \nkind of treatment it personally thinks or feels Plaintiffs should get. \n(If it were up to this Court, every inmate would be tested for HCV \nand every non-contraindicated inmate with chronic HCV would be \nimmediately treated with DAAs.) Instead, this Court is simply \ndetermining  whether  FDC  is  being  deliberately  indifferent  by \nfailing  to  provide  the  minimally  adequate  treatment  that  the \nConstitution  requires.  Where  there  was  reasonable  medical \ndisagreement about a request for relief, this Court recognized that \nit could not order FDC to change its conduct. However, where there \n                                           \n25 That is, an inmate who is staged F2 today will initiate treatment by \nApril 2020. An F2 inmate who was known in December 2017 will initiate \ntreatment by December 2019. \n56 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 57 of 68\n   \n \nwas  no  medical  reason  for  particular  conduct—or  where  even \nFDC’s own experts found that certain conduct was warranted but \nFDC still failed to comply—this Court properly concluded that \nFDC needed to change course. \nC. The Requirements for a Permanent Injunction \n  Having discussed the merits of Plaintiffs’ remaining claims \nfor  relief,  this  Court  now  turns  to  the  requirements  for  a \npermanent  injunction.  To  obtain  a  permanent  injunction, \nPlaintiffs must show (1) that they have suffered an irreparable \ninjury; (2) that their remedies at law are inadequate; (3) that the \nbalance  of  hardships  weighs  in  their  favor,  and  (4)  that  a \npermanent injunction would not disserve the public interest. eBay \nInc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). Plaintiffs \nhave satisfied each factor. \n  First,  Plaintiffs  have  suffered  an  irreparable  injury. \n“[I]njunctive relief is appropriate ‘to prevent a substantial risk of \nserious injury from ripening into actual harm.’” Thomas v. Bryant, \n614 F.3d 1288, 1318 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, \n511 U.S. 825, 845 (1994)). “In such circumstances, the irreparable-\ninjury requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating a history of \npast misconduct, which gives rise to an inference that future injury \n57 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 58 of 68\n   \n \nis imminent.” Id. Here, FDC’s history of past misconduct and its \ncontinued opposition to other forms of relief leads this Court to \nbelieve that future injury is imminent. Specifically, this Court \nfinds  that  FDC  will  not  treat  HCV-infected  inmates  in  an \nappropriate and timely manner. If these inmates are not treated, \nthey will undoubtedly suffer irreparable injury.  \n  Second, remedies at law are inadequate to address Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries. Plaintiffs suffer continued harm as well as the risk of \nfuture harm. Damages will not address those injuries. \n  Third, the balance of hardships weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor. \nThe only hardship Defendant faces is that FDC will have to spend \nmore money and treat more inmates than it wants to.26 Plaintiffs, \non the other hand, face great injuries. “The threat of harm to the \nplaintiffs cannot be outweighed by the risk of financial burden or \nadministrative inconvenience to the defendants.” Laube v. Haley, \n234 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (M.D. Ala. 2002).  \n                                           \n26 It is no excuse to cry that resources may be diverted from other \nmedical programs. FDC cannot use its constitutional duty to treat one group \nof inmates as a reason to not treat a different group. Cf. Williams v. Bennett, \n689 F.2d 1370, 1388 (11th Cir. 1982) (“If . . . a state chooses to operate a prison \nsystem, then each facility must be operated in a manner consistent with the \nconstitution.”). \n58 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 59 of 68\n   \n \n  Fourth,  the  permanent  injunction  will  not  disserve  the \npublic interest. Rather, the public is undoubtedly interested in \nseeing that inmates’ constitutional rights are upheld. Cf. Laube, \n234 F. Supp. 2d at 1252 (“[T]here is a strong public interest in \nrequiring that the  plaintiffs’ constitutional rights no  longer be \nviolated . . . .”); cf. also Costello v. Wainright, 397 F. Supp. 20, 37 \n(M.D. Fla. 1976) (“[I]t seems clear to this Court that, in the long \nrun, providing decent medical care and housing to inmates would \nserve to promote the rehabilitative goals of the criminal justice \nsystem so as to permit their re-entry into free society as upright \nand law abiding citizens and to prevent their re-entry into the \ncriminal justice system.”), vacated in part on other grounds, 539 \nF.2d 547 (5th Cir.), rev’d, 430 U.S. 325 (1977). \n  Finally,  the  permanent  injunction  satisfies  the  Prison \nLitigation  Reform  Act  (“PLRA”)  because  it  is  narrowly  drawn, \nextends no further than necessary to effect the changes this Court \nconcludes are constitutionally required, and is the least intrusive \nmeans of effecting such changes. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1). \nIII. Conclusion \n  This  case  started  with  three  inmates  facing  deliberate \nindifference to their serious medical needs. Through persistence of \n59 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 60 of 68\n   \n \ncounsel,  it  was  uncovered  that  FDC  was  being  deliberately \nindifferent to more than just those three inmates. Indeed, FDC \nturned out to have a long and sordid history of failing to adequately \nmanage HCV in its prisons. \n  Nearly two years later, FDC has come a long way. But FDC’s \nimprovement does not mean that it is no longer being deliberately \nindifferent to HCV-infected inmates, nor does it mean that there \nis no risk of such deliberate indifference reoccurring in the future. \nDefendant’s  continued  opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  requested  relief \nproves just that. \n  This Court is entering a permanent injunction with several \nimportant deadlines. In fashioning those deadlines, this Court has \nbeen mindful to ensure that Defendant has ample time to comply \nwhile considering an appeal. This Court notes that if Defendant \ndoes appeal and seeks to stay this Court’s order, Defendant must \nfirst  seek  a  stay  with  this  Court.  Fed.  R.  App.  P.  8(a)(1)(A). \nMoreover,  even  if  this  Court  denies  a  stay  pending  appeal, \nDefendant  may  also  move  this  Court  to  modify  the  injunction \npending appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(C).  \n  Accordingly, \n \n60 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 61 of 68\n   \n \n  IT IS ORDERED: \n1.  The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, ECF \nNo. 270 and ECF No. 342, are GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part, as described in this order. \n2.  This  Court  retains  jurisdiction  for  the  purposes  of \nenforcing  and/or  modifying  the  terms  of  this  Court’s \npermanent injunction. \n3.  The preliminary injunction entered in this case, ECF No. \n185, which was subsequently modified and renewed, see, \ne.g., ECF No. 437, is hereby dissolved.  \n4.  No later than May 20, 2019, the parties must confer and \nfile a jointly proposed briefing schedule regarding  the \nentitlement to and determination of attorney’s fees and \ncosts. \n5.  The Clerk is directed to provide a copy of this order to \ninmate Steven A. McLeod. See ECF No. 450.  \n6.  The Clerk is directed to enter judgment stating: \na.  Defendant  must  ensure  that  the  Florida \nDepartment  of  Corrections  (“FDC”),  FDC’s \nemployees, and FDC’s agents comply with FDC’s \n61 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 62 of 68\n   \n \nHepatitis  C  Virus  (“HCV”)  policy,  HSB  15.03.09 \nSupplement #3, as it is revised. \nb.  Defendant  must  ensure  that  FDC’s  HCV  policy, \nHSB  15.03.09  Supplement  #3,  is  not  modified \nabsent this Court’s instruction. \nc.  Defendant must ensure that, no later than May 20, \n2019, FDC’s HCV policy, HSB 15.03.09 Supplement \n#3, is modified as follows: \ni.  The policy must be modified to reflect that \ntreatment must be initiated for F0 and F1 \ninmates within two years of staging.  \nii.  A  section  must  be  added  to  the  policy \nrequiring  an  explanation  to  anyone  who \nrefuses  staging  or  treatment  of,  at  least, \n(1) the  consequences  of  HCV,  (2)  the \navailability, lack of side effects, and efficacy \nof  the  new  medications,  (3)  the  staging \nprocess, and (4) whether and when they will \nreceive treatment. \niii.  The policy must be modified to reflect that \n(1) patients must be initially staged using a \n62 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 63 of 68\n   \n \nFibroSure test within 30 days of confirming \nthey have chronic HCV; (2) patients who need \nultrasounds  must  receive  an  ultrasound \nwithin  90  days  of  confirming  they  have \nchronic  HCV;  (3)  if  a  patient  needs  to  be \nrestaged  as  a  result  of  an  ultrasound,  the \nrestaging must take place within 5 days of \nreceiving the ultrasound results; and (4) staff \nmust  rely  on  the  test,  exam,  or  study \nindicating  the  highest  fibrosis  level  for \nstaging. \niv.  The policy must be modified to reflect that \ndeadlines are mandatory. \nv.  The policy must be modified to reflect that \nstaff have the discretion to restage inmates \nsooner than scheduled. \nvi.  The  exclusion  for  time  remaining  on  an \ninmate’s sentence must be modified such that \n(1)  it  no  longer  refers  to  “pre-treatment \nevaluation”; (2) it no longer refers to “post \ntreatment SVR assessment”; (3) it no longer \n63 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 64 of 68\n   \n \nincludes a “12-18 months” estimate; and (4) it \nreflects  that  an  inmate—who  has  already \nbeen staged and evaluated—simply needs to \nhave  “sufficient”  time  remaining  on  their \nsentence to complete a course of treatment. \nvii.  The exclusion for high-risk behaviors must be \nmodified  to  reflect  that  (1)  high-risk \nbehaviors only warrant a delay if there is a \n“medical reason” to delay treatment and (2) it \nonly provides for temporary ineligibility, not \npermanent exclusion.  \nviii.  Section  J.3.,  which  refers  to  “chronic \ndisciplinary  issues,”  must  be  amended  to \nreflect that chronic disciplinary issues, in and \nof themselves, are not sufficient to render an \ninmate  ineligible  for  treatment;  rather, \ntreatment may only be delayed for medical \nreasons. \nix.  Section P, which governs referrals for liver \ntransplants,  must  be  modified  as  follows: \n(1) decompensation must be defined as “the \n64 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 65 of 68\n   \n \npresence of encephalopathy, ascites, bleeding \nvarices, or jaundice”; (2) it must be clarified \nto reflect that patients will be referred if they \nhave any one of the listed items; (3) referrals \nmust be initiated within 30 days of any one of \nthe triggering events; (4) it must provide that \nFDC  must  promptly  comply  with  the \ntransplant center’s request for records and \nother information, and to promptly transport \nthe inmate to and from the transplant center; \nand  (5)  it  must  be  clarified  that  for \nindividuals  who  have  been  scheduled  to \nreceive  DAA  medication,  are  undergoing \nDAA treatment, or who have finished DAA \ntreatment, a referral must be made only if the \npost-treatment MELD score is over 15. \nx.  Section  A.2.,  which  refers  to  risk  factors, \nmust  be  modified  to  include  “being  born \nbetween  1945  and  1965,  previous \nincarceration, and HIV” as risk factors. \n65 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 66 of 68\n   \n \nd.  Defendant  must  ensure  that  FDC  initiates \ntreatment for all known chronic-HCV inmates who \nare currently staged F0 or F1 within two years of \nthe date of this order.  \ne.  Defendant must ensure that FDC either (1) adopts \na system of opt-out testing along with an aggressive \nnotice campaign or (2) adopts a system of opt-in \ntesting  paired  with  peer  education.  FDC  must \nmake its choice and Defendant must inform this \nCourt of FDC’s decision no later than May 20, 2019. \nf.  Defendant must ensure that FDC forms a definite \nplan to make elastography available to its medical \nstaff  within  a  reasonably  immediate  timeframe. \nDefendant  must  file  its  proposed  plan  with  this \nCourt no later than May 20, 2019.  \ng.  Defendant  must  ensure  that—for  inmates  who \nwere  known  to  have  chronic  HCV  in  December \n2017,  who  have  fibrosis  stage  2,  and  who  are \neligible for treatment—FDC initiates treatment no \nlater than December 31, 2019. \n66 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 465   Filed 04/18/19   Page 67 of 68\n   \n \nh.

Case No. 4:17cv214-MW/CAS \n \nJULIE L. JONES, in her official \ncapacity as Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of \nCorrections, \n \nDefendant. \n__________________________/ \n \nORDER GRANTING  \nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nThe Florida Department of Corrections (“FDC”) is charged \nwith  the  care  of  over  98,000  inmates.  At  least  7,000  of  those \ninmates—and perhaps as many as 20,000—are infected with the \nHepatitis C virus (“HCV”). The issue in this case is whether FDC \nis screening, evaluating, and treating HCV-infected inmates in a \nmanner that comports with constitutional requirements. \nAfter holding a five-day hearing (including testimony from \nexpert witnesses, FDC officials, and FDC inmates),  this  Court \nfinds that FDC has not treated HCV-infected inmates as required \nby the Constitution. Moreover, although FDC has tried to moot \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 2 of 32\n   \n \nthis case by promising to change its practices going forward, this \nCourt finds that a preliminary injunction is necessary to ensure \nthat inmates with HCV receive medical care in a timely manner \nconsistent  with  constitutional  requirements.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED. \nI. Findings of Fact1 \nA. Hepatitis C and the Progression of Liver Disease \n  HCV “is a viral infection, which is spread by exposure to \nblood or blood products.” Pls.’ Ex. 28, at 3.2 The most common way \nof contracting HCV is through intravenous drug use, but a person \ncan also get infected through tattooing or blood transfusions. Id. \n“The principal consequence of [HCV] infection is infection of the \nliver,  which  causes  inflammation  that  in  turn  may  result  in \nscarring of the liver (fibrosis).” Id.  \n                                           \n1 This Court held a five-day evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction. The factual statements in this section represent this \nCourt’s findings of fact. To the extent this Court cites or quotes exhibits or \ntestimony, it is because this Court finds said exhibits and testimony to be \ncredible and useful references. Many of these factual statements are sourced \nfrom the declarations and in-court testimony of the parties’ expert witnesses, \nDr. Koziel and Dr. Dewsnup. For the most part, the parties’ experts were in \nagreement with each other. Due to the expedited nature of these proceedings, \nthis Court has not obtained certified transcripts of each witness’s testimony. \nWhere necessary, this Court has relied on its own notes and recollection of the \ntestimony. Consequently, certain citations do not include pincites. \n \n2 Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 28 is the “First Amended Unsworn Declaration of Dr. \nMargaret Koziel.” \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 3 of 32\n   \n \n  Unlike a scar on your skin, scarring of the liver can have \nsevere consequences. “Liver scarring can significantly impair liver \nfunction and damage its crucial role in filtering toxins from the \nblood, as well as making proteins involved in liver clotting and \nfighting infections.” Id. Moreover, liver scarring places patients “at \nrisk of liver failure or liver cancer.” Id. Liver failure carries with it \na host of serious symptoms, including bleeding from any site, fluid \naccumulation in the legs or abdomen, life-threatening infections, \nand failure of other organs such as the kidneys. Id. Liver cancer is \nessentially untreatable, and “has a very dismal prognosis.” See id. \n  The  amount  of  liver  scarring  a  patient  has  is  usually \nmeasured on the METAVIR scale. Id. at 7–8. On this scale, a \nperson can be classified F0 (no fibrosis), F1 (mild fibrosis), F2 \n(moderate fibrosis), F3 (severe fibrosis), or F4 (cirrhosis). ECF No. \n138, at 166.3 The rate at which patients progress along this scale \ndiffers among the population. Defendant’s Exhibit 1 includes a \nuseful flowchart demonstrating this difference in progression: \n \n \n                                           \n3  ECF  No.  138  is  a  certified  transcript  of  Dr.  Koziel’s  testimony  at  the \nevidentiary hearing.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 4 of 32\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDef.’s Ex. 1. \n  As can be seen in the flowchart, about 20–50% of people \ninfected  with  HCV  spontaneously  clear  the  virus  within  six \nmonths of infection. ECF No. 138, at 58. The remaining 50–80% \nwho don’t clear the virus are referred to as having chronic HCV. \nId.  \nAmong  those  with  chronic  HCV,  about  30%  of  patients \nmaintain a stable chronic infection, 40% suffer from slow fibrosis \nprogression, and 30% suffer from rapid fibrosis progression. See \nTest. of Dr. Dewsnup.4 Patients with a stable chronic infection \nusually only reach F1 (mild fibrosis) as long as they maintain other \nhealthy habits such as abstaining from alcohol. See Test. of Dr. \n                                           \n4 According to Dr. Dewsnup, as many 6,000 Florida inmates may suffer from \nrapid fibrosis progression. See Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 5 of 32\n   \n \nDewsnup.  Patients  with  a  slow  fibrosis  progression  may  take \nupwards of 20 years to reach F4 (cirrhosis). Id. Finally, patients \nwith a rapid fibrosis progression may reach cirrhosis within as \nshort a timeframe as one year. Id.  \nThe  extent  of  liver  scarring  a  patient  has  does  not \nnecessarily correlate with the symptoms they are suffering. For \ninstance,  “[s]omebody  can  be  completely  asymptomatic  and \npresent with cirrhosis.” ECF No. 138, at 51. Nor do “symptoms \nhave anything to do with what the risk is of liver failure.” Id. at \n113.  \n Once  a  person  reaches  F4  (cirrhosis),  they  are  further \nclassified based on whether they are suffering from HCV-related \nsymptoms/complications. A patient with cirrhosis and no related \ncomplications is referred to as having compensated cirrhosis. Id. \nat  49.  On  the  other  hand,  a  patient  with  cirrhosis  that  is \naccompanied  with  complications  is  referred  to  as  having \ndecompensated cirrhosis. Id. The distinction between these two \ngroups is important because their survival rates are markedly \ndifferent. Whereas the five-year survival rate for someone with \ncompensated  cirrhosis  is  91%,  the  five-year  survival  rate  for \nsomeone with decompensated cirrhosis is only 50%.

Treatment of Hepatitis C \n  Historically, HCV has been “difficult to treat.” Id. at 9. One \nold  method  of  treatment  involved  the  drugs  Interferon  and \nRibavirin. ECF No. 138, at 62–63. That treatment required weekly \ninjections and could take as long as twelve months to complete. Id.; \nPls.’ Ex. 28, at 9. The side effects were “terrible.” ECF No. 138, at \n62. Taking the treatment was akin to “having the flu for a year.” \nId. “People’s hair fell out, they had rashes, they had chest pain, \nthey felt suicidal, [and] some committed suicide.” Id. at 63. Despite \nthese  side  effects,  doctors  still  prescribed  the  treatment  when \npatients had a high level of liver scarring because “the likelihood \nof getting to cure, which was still only about 30 percent, was better \nthan those terrible side effects.” Id. \n  But in late 2013 a new class of drugs known as direct-acting \nantivirals  (“DAAs”)  were  released  to  market.  Id.  These  DAAs \nproved to be “a revolution in medicine.” Id. Treatment with DAAs \nconsists of taking a pill once or twice a day. See id.; see also Pls.’ \nEx.  28,  at  10.  The  treatment  period  with  DAAs  is  only  about \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 7 of 32\n   \n \ntwelve-weeks long. ECF No. 138, at 64. Moreover, DAAs have “very \nfew” side effects. Id. Most importantly, about 95% of patients who \ntake DAAs are cured of HCV. Id. \n  Unfortunately,  this  revolution  in  medicine  came  with  a \nprice. DAAs “are very expensive.” Id. at 74. In September of 2016, \na  single  course  of  treatment  with  DAAs  cost  approximately \n$50,000 to $75,000. ECF No. 151, at 34.5 Even though prices have \nbeen going down as new DAAs are released, a single course of \ntreatment may still cost $37,000 today. Id. at 45. \n  Despite the high cost of DAAs, the present-day standard of \ncare is to treat chronic-HCV patients with DAAs as long as there \nare  no  contraindications  or  exceptional  circumstances.  It  is \ninappropriate to only treat those with advanced levels of fibrosis. \nECF No. 138, at 66–67, 73; see also Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. The HCV \nGuidance—a resource developed by the American Association for \nthe Study of Liver Diseases (AALSD) and the Infectious Diseases \nSociety  of  America  (IDSA)—recommends  giving  DAAs  to  any \n                                           \n5 ECF No. 151 is a certified transcript of a portion of Mr. Reimers’s testimony \nat the evidentiary hearing. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 8 of 32\n   \n \npatient with chronic HCV (absent certain contraindications). See \nPls.’ Ex. 6.6 \nC. The Plaintiffs \n  The named Plaintiffs in this case are Carl Hoffer, Ronald \nMcPherson, and Roland Molina. All three are inmates in FDC \ncustody and are infected with HCV. Mr. Hoffer currently suffers \nfrom decompensated cirrhosis, and Mr. McPherson and Mr. Molina \nhave compensated cirrhosis. ECF No. 138, at 136–42.  \n  FDC has known about the Plaintiffs’ conditions for years. \nMr.  Hoffer  likely  had  cirrhosis  as  early  as  2012  and  likely \ndeveloped decompensated cirrhosis “around the midpoint of 2014.” \nId. at 136. Mr. Hoffer needs to be referred for a liver transplant \nevaluation. Id. at 138. Mr. Hoffer should have been treated “as \nearly as 2012 or certainly by 2014.” Id. at 137.  \nMr. McPherson has HIV in addition to having chronic HCV. \nId.  at 139. Doctors realized that Mr.  McPherson had cirrhosis \nduring a gallbladder surgery in 2015. Id. Mr. McPherson should \nhave been treated as soon as doctors realized he had cirrhosis. Id.  \n                                           \n6 Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 6 is a copy of the HCV Guidance dated September 21, 2017. \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 9 of 32\n   \n \nMr. Molina likely had cirrhosis as early as 2013. See id. at \n141. Although an ultrasound in April of 2016 showed that his liver \nwas  normal,  doctors  failed  to  account  for  his  enlarged  spleen, \nwhich is indicative of cirrhosis. Id. \n  All three Plaintiffs have been complaining about their lack \nof treatment for years. See Pls.’ Ex. 1; Pls.’ Ex. 2; Pls.’ Ex. 3.7 But \nthey could only complain for so long. On May 11, 2017, Plaintiffs \ninitiated this lawsuit against the Secretary of FDC. ECF No. 1. \nAfter months of litigating, FDC has finally begun to treat Plaintiffs \nwith DAAs. ECF No. 138, at 136–42. \n  Even  though  Plaintiffs  are  receiving  the  treatment  they \nwant, this case is not yet over. In addition to seeking relief for \nthemselves, Plaintiffs also moved to certify a class of “all current \nand future prisoners in FDC custody who have been diagnosed, or \nwill be diagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV).” ECF No. \n10, at 2. This Court has already granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class \ncertification. ECF No. 152. Accordingly, this case may proceed with \nPlaintiffs seeking relief for the class. See, e.g., Davis v. Coca-Cola \nBottling Co. Consol., 516 F.3d 955, 968 n.28 (11th Cir. 2008) (“A \n                                           \n7 Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 are composites of their FDC administrative \ngrievances and appeals. \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 10 of 32\n   \n \nclass representative can have standing to continuing prosecuting \na class action for relief on behalf of the class members even though \nhe has settled his claim against the defendant and his own case is \ntherefore  moot.”),  abrogation  on  other  grounds  recognized  by \nLaCroix v. W. Dist. Ky., 627 F. App’x 816, 818 (11th Cir. 2015). \n  D. FDC’s Long and Sordid History of Failing to Treat HCV \n  Like prison systems in many other states, FDC decided some \ntime  ago  to  outsource  its  provision  of  medical  care  to  private \ncontractors. ECF No. 151, at 5. In 2013, those contractors were \nCorizon and Wexford. Id. Under FDC’s contracts with Corizon and \nWexford, there were two ways that doctors could obtain drugs. \nMost drugs were listed on an FDC-approved list, referred to as the \nformulary. Id. at 6. Those drugs were readily available to doctors \nand were paid for directly by FDC. Id. Drugs not listed on the \nformulary had to be specially requested. See Test. of Dr. Maier. \nSpecially requested drugs were paid for by Corizon or Wexford. Id. \n  When DAAs came out in late 2013, they were not included \non the formulary. ECF No. 151, at 6–7. Nevertheless, Dr. Scott \nKennedy (who worked for Corizon at the time) decided to assemble \ntwelve inmates (the “Kennedy 12”) with the goal of treating them \nwith DAAs. See Test. of Dr. Maier. By the end of 2014, the Kennedy \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 11 of 32\n   \n \n12 had been assembled and thoroughly evaluated. Id. But the \nKennedy 12 were never given any DAAs because the necessary \nfunds were not available. Id. This was so despite the fact that all \ntwelve inmates showed signs of advanced liver damage. Id. \nAs the years went on, FDC officials recognized that inmates \nwere dying from HCV because they were not being treated. Id. \n(discussing  conversations  with  Dr.  Long  Do).  Similarly,  Mr. \nReimers, the FDC administrator responsible for overseeing the \ncontractors, recognized that inmates with HCV were not being \ntreated and found the lack of treatment to be unacceptable. See \nECF No. 151, at 10, 40–43. Again, the reason why inmates weren’t \nbeing treated was because of a lack of funding. See id. at 40.  \nBy mid-2016, FDC had updated its HCV-treatment policy to \nacknowledge that prescribing DAAs was the standard of care. See \nDef.’s Ex. 8, at 6–7.8 But again, the funding was not available to \ntreat anyone. In 2015, Mr. Reimers prepared a legislative budget \nrequest of $6.5 million to obtain DAAs for the 2016–17 fiscal year, \nbut the request never made it out of FDC (i.e., someone in FDC \ndenied  it).  See  ECF  No.  151,  at  44–45.  In  2016,  Mr.  Reimers \n                                           \n8 Defendant’s Exhibit 8 is FDC’s HCV-treatment policy dated June 27, 2016. \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 12 of 32\n   \n \nprepared a $29 million request for the 2017–18 fiscal year, but that \ntoo never made it out of FDC. Id. at 46–47.  \nEventually,  Corizon  and  Wexford’s  contracts  with  FDC \nended, and FDC began a new contract with Centurion. Id. at 7. But \nthe change in contractor did not come with a change in behavior; \ninmates with HCV were still not being treated. Indeed, to date only \nthirteen inmates have been treated with DAAs (three of those \nbeing the named Plaintiffs in this case).9 Id at 47–48; see also Pls.’ \nEx. 11.10  \nII. Analysis \nPresently  before  this  Court  is  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a \npreliminary  injunction.  ECF  No.  11.  To  obtain  a  preliminary \ninjunction,  Plaintiffs  must  clearly  show  that:  (A)  they  have  a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claims; (B) \nan injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable injury; (C) the \nthreatened injury outweighs the harm that an injunction would \n                                           \n9 To put that number in context, FDC knows of at least 7,000 inmates in its \ncustody who have HCV. ECF No. 151, at 52–53. Furthermore, FDC’s own \nexpert testified that the true number is likely closer to 20,000. See Test of. Dr. \nDewsnup. \n \n10 Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 11 is FDC’s drug utilization list of DAAs for the period of \nMay 1, 2013 to June 30, 2017.  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 13 of 32\n   \n \ncause to Defendant; and (D) an injunction would not be adverse to \nthe public interest. See Wreal, LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., 840 F.3d \n1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2016). This Court finds that Plaintiffs have \nmet the necessary requirements.11 \nA. Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits12 \nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nprohibits  the  government  from  inflicting  “cruel  and  unusual \npunishments” on convicts. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 296–97 \n(1991). The Supreme Court has interpreted this prohibition to \nencompass “deprivations . . . not specifically part of [a] sentence \nbut . . . suffered during imprisonment.” Id. at 297. Accordingly, an \ninmate who suffers “deliberate indifference” to his “serious medical \n                                           \n11 It is not a close call, particularly in light of the testimony of Defendant’s own \nexpert. \n \n12 To determine Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, this Court must \nconsider the individual elements of each of Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs raise \nthree separate claims about FDC’s policies and practices for HCV treatment: \n(1) deliberate indifference to serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment; (2) discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”); and (3) discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”). ECF No. 1. This Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on their Eighth \nAmendment claim; accordingly, this Court will not address Plaintiffs’ ADA and \nRA claims at this stage of the case. See, e.g., Arval Serv. Lease S.A. v. Clifton, \nNo. 3:14-cv-1047-J-39MCR, 2014 WL 12614422, at *15 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 21, \n2014)  (“Because  the  Court  determines  that  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  a \npreliminary injunction based upon [their first claim], the Court need not \naddress the remaining claims at this time.”). \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 14 of 32\n   \n \nneeds” may state a claim for a violation of the Eighth Amendment. \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).  \nPlaintiffs argue that FDC’s policies and practices for HCV \ntreatment  constitute  deliberate  indifference  to  their  (and  the \nclass’s) serious medical needs. ECF No. 1, at 37–39. To prevail on \nthis claim, Plaintiffs must show (1) a serious medical need, (2) \nDefendant’s deliberate indifference to that need, and (3) causation \nbetween Defendant’s indifference and Plaintiffs’ injuries. Goebert \nv. Lee County, 510 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir. 2007). This Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of proving each \nelement. \n1. Serious Medical Need \n  “A serious medical need is ‘one that has been diagnosed by a \nphysician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that \neven a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s \nattention.’” Mann v. Taser Int’l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1307 (11th \nCir. 2009) (quoting Hill v. Dekalb Reg’l Youth Det. Ctr., 40 F.3d \n1176, 1187 (11th Cir. 1994)). “In the alternative, a serious medical \nneed  is  determined  by  whether  a  delay  in  treating  the  need \nworsens the condition.” Id. “In either case, ‘the medical need must \nbe one that, if left unattended, poses a substantial risk of serious \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 15 of 32\n   \n \nharm.’” Id. (quoting Farrow v. West, 320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir. \n2003)). \n  Plaintiffs (by diagnosis) and Plaintiffs’ class (by definition) \nall  suffer  from  chronic  HCV.  As  a  consequence,  Plaintiffs  and \nPlaintiffs’ class are faced with substantial risks of serious harm, \nincluding, but not limited to, bleeding from any site in the body, \naccumulation  of  fluid  in  the  legs  or  abdomen,  life-threatening \ninfections,  significant  pain  or  discomfort,  organ  failure,  liver \ncancer, and death. See Pls.’ Ex. 28, at 3–4. Accordingly, it is not \nsurprising  that  Plaintiffs’  expert  describes  HCV  as  “a  serious \nmedical need.” Id. at 4. Nor should it be surprising that this Court \nfinds chronic HCV to be a serious medical need.13 Cf. Loeber v. \nAndem,  487  F.  App’x  548,  549  (11th  Cir.  2012)  (unpublished) \n(“That  Hepatitis  C  presents  a  serious  medical  need  is \nundisputed.”); Brown v. Johnson, 387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir. \n2004)  (“HIV  and  hepatitis  meet  either  of  the[]  definitions  [of \nserious medical need]. The defendants wisely do not deny that \n[plaintiff] has serious medical needs.”). \n                                           \n13 Even Defendant conceded that a subclass of HCV-infected inmates have a \nserious  medical  need  within  the  meaning  of  deliberate-indifference \njurisprudence. \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 16 of 32\n   \n \n2. Deliberate Indifference \n  To satisfy the deliberate-indifference prong, Plaintiffs must \nshow Defendant’s subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm \nand Defendant’s disregard of that risk by conduct that is more than \nmere negligence. See Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1326–27. There is no \nquestion that Defendant has knowledge of a risk of serious harm—\nDefendant knows that Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ class are diagnosed \nwith HCV. Cf. Brown, 387 F.3d at 1351 (finding that subjective-\nknowledge requirement was met because “[t]he defendants were \naware of [plaintiff’s] diagnosis with HIV and hepatitis”). As such, \nthe only issue is whether Defendant has disregarded that risk by \nconduct that is more than mere negligence.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit has listed several examples of conduct \nthat is considered more than mere negligence: \n(1) knowledge of a serious medical need and a failure \nor refusal to provide care; (2) delaying treatment for \nnon-medical reasons; (3) grossly inadequate care; (4) a \ndecision to take an easier but less efficacious course of \ntreatment; or (5) medical care that is so cursory as to \namount to no treatment at all. \n \nBaez  v.  Rogers,  522  F.  App’x  819,  821  (11th  Cir.  2013) \n(unpublished).  According  to  Plaintiffs,  “Defendant  has  been \ndeliberately  indifferent  under  nearly  every  formulation  of  the \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 17 of 32\n   \n \nstandard.” ECF No. 11, at 17. This Court agrees. The record is \nreplete with evidence to support this conclusion. \nThis Court has already explained that FDC has a long and \nsordid history of failing to treat HCV-infected inmates. See supra, \nat 10–12. And this Court finds as a matter of fact that FDC’s \nfailure to treat was due to a lack of funding. The record is filled \nwith evidence demonstrating as much14: \n•  Dr. Carl Maier testified extensively about funding issues. \nSee  Test.  of  Dr.  Maier.  In  2014,  Dr.  Maier  worked  for \nCorizon as the medical director at the FDC prison where \nthe  Kennedy  12  were  being  assembled.  Id.  Dr.  Maier \ntestified that the reason why the Kennedy 12 weren’t given \nDAAs is because there was no funding. Id.  \n \n•  Mr. Reimers testified about funding issues. In 2015, Mr. \nReimers was employed by FDC as the Director of Health \nServices Administration. ECF No. 151, at 5. Part of his \nresponsibilities at that time was “contract monitoring of \nCorizon and Wexford.” Id. During this time, Mr. Reimers \nspoke with a Wexford official about funding issues related \nto  DAAs.  Id.  at  40–42.  Mr.  Reimers  knew  that  HCV-\ninfected inmates weren’t being treated and told the official \nthat that was “not acceptable.” Id. Thereafter, Mr. Reimers \nbegan trying to specifically procure funds for DAAs, but \nthose requests were denied from within FDC. Id. at 44–47.  \n \n                                           \n14 Dr. Whalen testified that there were no funding issues. See Test. of Dr. \nWhalen. This Court finds Dr. Whalen’s testimony particularly incredible given \nother  statements  he  made  in  sworn  declarations.  See  Pls.’  Ex.  26,  at  3 \n(“[T]reatment with DAA drugs . . . will be provided as resources are available.”); \nsee also ECF No. 46-1, at 1 (“Mr. Molina and Mr. McPherson may be eligible \nfor treatment with direct acting antiviral (“DAA”) drugs in the first wave of \nprisoners provided the treatment pending funding for the drugs.” (emphasis \nadded)). \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 18 of 32\n   \n \n•  Defendant’s own expert, Dr. Dewsnup, also testified about \nfunding issues. See Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. Dr. Dewsnup is \nemployed  by  Centurion  and  is  intimately  familiar  with \nHCV treatment. See id. When Centurion took over medical \ncare for FDC, Dr. Dewsnup encouraged doctors working \nwith  FDC  to  refer  HCV-infected  inmates  for  DAA \ntreatment.  Id.  But  those  doctors  were  unable  to  do  so \nbecause of FDC funding issues. \n  \nHere,  funding  is  no  excuse  for  FDC’s  failure  to  provide \ntreatment.15 Accordingly, there is no question that Defendant has \nbeen deliberately indifferent the serious medical needs of Plaintiffs \nand the class. But FDC’s past failures do not entitle Plaintiffs to a \n                                           \n15 See, e.g., Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1509 (11th Cir. 1991) (“We do not \nagree that ‘financial considerations must be considered in determining the \nreasonableness’ of inmates’ medical care to the extent that such a rationale \ncould ever be used by so-called ‘poor states’ to deny a prisoner the minimally \nadequate care to which he or she is entitled. . . . We are aware that systemic \ndeficiencies in medical care may be related to a lack of funds allocated to \nprisons by the state legislature. Such a lack, however, will not excuse the \nfailure of correctional systems to maintain a certain minimum level of medical \nservice necessary to avoid the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment.”); \nAncata v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 705 (11th Cir. 1985) (“Lack \nof funds for facilities cannot justify an unconstitutional lack of competent \nmedical care and treatment for inmates.”); but see Ralston v. McGovern, 167 \nF.3d 1160, 1162 (7th Cir. 1999) (Posner, C.J.) (“[T]he civilized minimum [of \npublic concern for the health of prisoners] is a function both of objective need \nand of cost. The lower the cost, the less need has to be shown, but the need \nmust still be shown to be substantial.”); Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F.3d 166, 175 \n(3d Cir. 1997) (Alito, J.) (“[T]he deliberate indifference standard of Estelle does \nnot  guarantee  prisoners  the  right  to  be  entirely  free  from  the  cost \nconsiderations that figure in the medical-care decisions made by most non-\nprisoners in our society.”). Of course, this Court recognizes that issues of \nfunding  might  excuse  some  delay.  For  instance,  if  DAAs  were  released \nyesterday,  this  Court would  not expect  FDC  to wave  a magic wand  and \nsuddenly treat thousands of inmates overnight. But that is not the case. FDC \nhas had since late 2013 to respond to this problem, and it has only just recently \nstarted doing what it should have done years ago. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 19 of 32\n   \n \npreliminary injunction. See O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495 \n(1974) (“Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a \npresent case or controversy regarding injunctive relief .  . . .”). \nInstead,  there  must  be  some  evidence  of  ongoing  or  future \nviolations. See id. at 495–96. Accordingly, this Court must focus on \nwhat FDC has promised to do going forward.16  \nIn that light, two pieces of evidence are particularly relevant \nto this Court’s analysis. The first is FDC’s HCV-treatment policy. \nThe second is a letter sent by Mr. Reimers (FDC’s current Director \nof Health Services) to Centurion. \n      a. FDC’s Treatment Policy \nFDC’s treatment policy for HCV is enshrined in an ever-\nevolving document titled “HSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3.” There \nare four different versions of the policy in the record, the earliest \ndating back to September 2014. See Def.’s Ex. 7; Def.’s Ex. 8; Def.’s \nEx. 9; Def.’s Ex. 10.  \nThe  most  recent  version  of  FDC’s  policy  was  created  in \nOctober 2017.17 Def.’s Ex. 10. Broadly speaking, it specifies how \n                                           \n16 Of course, this Court can still consider FDC’s past violations to place things \ninto context. Cf. O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 496 (“[P]ast wrongs are evidence bearing \non whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.”). \n \n17 Undoubtedly in response to this litigation. \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 20 of 32\n   \n \nand when doctors should screen, evaluate, and treat inmates with \nHCV. See id. For example, as to screening the policy notes that \n“[t]he  preferred  screening  test  for  HCV  infection  is  an \nimmunoassay” and that “[s]creening will be offered to all patients, \nregardless of risk factors.” Id. at 2. As to treatment, the policy sets \nout eligibility criteria and groups patients into four priority levels \nbased on the severity of their conditions and other considerations. \nId.  at  6–8.  Generally  speaking,  patients  with  the  most  severe \nconditions are grouped in “Priority Level 1 – Highest Priority for \nTreatment,”  and  patients  with  the  least  severe  conditions  are \ngrouped into “Priority Level 4 – Routine for Treatment.” Id.  \n  When Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, FDC was operating under \nan  older  version  of  the  policy.  Plaintiffs  identified  several \nshortcomings with the policy at the time, but a number of those \nshortcomings have been resolved. Compare ECF No. 11, at 21–23, \nwith Def.’s Ex. 10. Nevertheless, the policy still has shortcomings. \n  Indeed,  Defendant’s  own  expert,  Dr.  Dewsnup,  admitted \nthat the policy needs to be fixed. See Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. That \nadmission  is  significant  because  Dr.  Dewsnup  is  in  charge  of \ndrafting FDC’s policy. Id. That is, after this litigation ensued, FDC \nhired Dr. Dewsnup not only to serve as an expert witness for \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 21 of 32\n   \n \npurposes of the hearing before this Court, but also for purposes of \nguiding  and  advising  FDC’s  policies  and  practices  for  treating \nHCV. Id. Accordingly, this Court finds that Defendant needs to \nupdate FDC’s policy in light of the shortcomings identified by Dr. \nDewsnup at the hearing.  \n      b. Mr. Reimers’s Letter \nOn October 13, 2017, Mr. Reimers sent a letter on behalf of \nFDC to the CEO of Centurion (FDC’s current medical contractor). \nDef.’s Ex. 20. The stated purpose of the letter “is to follow-up on a \ndiscussion” between Dr. Whalen (FDC’s Chief Clinical Advisor) \nand Dr. Cherry (Centurion’s medical director for FDC). Id. During \nthat discussion, Dr. Whalen allegedly asked Dr. Cherry “to identify \nPriority 1 Level patients, and some Priority 2 patients, for HCV \ntreatment in accordance with HSB 15.0.3.09 Supplement 3.” Id. \n(emphasis added). Mr. Reimers’s letter memorializes FDC’s intent \nthat those inmates, “once identified as appropriate for treatment, \nreceive DAA medications during Fiscal Year 2017/2018.” Id. The \nletter then continues: \nGoing forward, we are requesting that you ensure that \nall patients diagnosed with HCV have been identified \nand  properly  prioritized  in  accordance  with  HSB \n15.03.09  Supplement  3.  It  is  our  intent  to  provide \ntreatment for thee inmates, once properly educated, \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 22 of 32\n   \n \nscreened, and evaluated as appropriate for treatment, \nin accordance with HSB 15.03.09. Supplement 3. \n \nId.  \n \nOstensibly, the letter seem to be an attempt to moot this \ncase.18 It was drafted less than a week before this Court’s hearing, \nand  soon  after  it  was  written  Defendant  moved  for  a  case \nmanagement  conference  to  discuss  the  fact  that  Plaintiffs  had \nreceived the relief they wanted. See ECF No. 128. Whatever FDC’s \nintended effect may have been, the letter does not moot this case.  \nIndeed, FDC’s own expert, Dr. Dewsnup, testified that FDC \nshould be treating many more inmates than what was promised in \nMr. Reimers’s letter.19 See Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. Dr. Dewsnup also \ntestified that FDC should be treating inmates at a faster rate than \nwhat was promised in Mr. Reimers’s letter. Id. In fact, even if \n                                           \n18 Mr. Reimers, of course, disagrees. According to him, the letter served “to \nmake it clear what the expectations are for Centurion in the short term and in \nthe long term what their requirements are as [FDC’s] contractor to provide \nservices for individuals with Hepatitis C.” ECF No. 151, at 25. \n \n19 For instance, Mr. Reimers’s letter says that only “some Priority 2 patients” \nwill be treated. Dr. Dewsnup testified that all Priority 2 patients should be \ntreated. See Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. In fact, Dr. Dewsnup testified that more \nthan just Priority 2 patients should be treated. Id. The way FDC has currently \nworded its Priority 2 class means that even patients with F3 or F4 fibrosis \nscores might not get treatment under FDC’s promise. Compare Def.’s Ex. 10, \nat 7 (requiring APRI score over 2 to qualify), with Def.’s Ex, 22, at 5 (explaining \nthat  APRI  testing  generally  “lack[s]  the  power  to  exclude  patients  with \nadvanced fibrosis to a statistically significant level”). \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 23 of 32\n   \n \nFDC’s promises were good enough, Dr. Dewsnup testified that FDC \ncurrently lacks the system capacity to be able to accomplish what \nit has promised. Id. Specifically, Dr. Dewsnup testified that FDC \nneeds more practitioners to screen, evaluate, and treat inmates in \na timely fashion. Id. \nThis Court agrees with Dr. Dewsnup’s conclusions. Since the \nKennedy 12 were first assembled in 2014, up to and including of \nthis very litigation, FDC has been extremely slow to respond to the \nserious issue of treating HCV-infected inmates.20 Even if FDC \nwere excused for Corizon and Wexford’s failures,21 when Centurion \ncame  on  board  in  mid-2016  Dr.  Dewsnup  specifically  told  Dr. \n                                           \n20 Plaintiffs filed their complaint on May 11, 2017, and filed their motion for a \npreliminary injunction on May 23, 2017. Ordinarily, this Court would rule on \na motion for a preliminary injunction based on sworn declarations or affidavits \nso as to resolve the matter as soon as possible. But Defendant wanted a four- \nor five-day hearing. ECF No. 37, at 2. So this Court set one for the end of \nAugust. ECF No. 53. But then Defendant informed this Court that she had not \nyet retained an expert and wanted to continue the scheduled hearing. ECF No. \n59. This Court reluctantly granted a continuance, ECF No. 64, and then did so \nagain due to Hurricane Irma, ECF No. 90. When this Court finally held the \nhearing on Plaintiffs’ motion, it was revealed that Defendant did not hire her \nexpert witness, Dr. Dewsnup, until sometime in August 2017. See Test. of Dr. \nDewsnup.  This delay  is significant considering  that Dr.  Dewsnup is  now \nredrafting  FDC’s  policy  and  directing  FDC  how  to  move  forward  with \ntreatment. One can only wonder how long Defendant would have kicked the \ncan down the road had Plaintiffs not filed this case. \n \n21  Which  it  isn’t.  See  Ancata,  769  F.2d  at  705  (“The federal  courts  have \nconsistently ruled that governments, state and local, have an obligation to \nprovide medical care to incarcerated individuals. This duty is not absolved by \ncontracting with an entity . . . .” (citation omitted)). \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 24 of 32\n   \n \nCherry to develop a list of patients with HCV-inmates and to stage \nthem appropriately. See Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. Over a year has \npassed, and the completion of the list and staging process has \nbarely begun.22 Id. \nThis  Court  has  no  doubt  that  without  a  court-ordered \ninjunction, FDC is unlikely to treat inmates in a constitutionally \nappropriate  manner.  In  fact,  Defendant’s  own  expert,  Dr. \nDewsnup,  testified  that  an  injunction  is  necessary  for  FDC  to \nrespond to this problem with the requisite alacrity. See Test. of Dr. \nDewsnup. This Court finds Dr. Dewsnup’s testimony to be credible, \nand accordingly finds that FDC must comply with the treatment \ndirections and timelines Dr. Dewsnup identified at the hearing \nwith some clarifications. \n3. Causation \n  “The final requirement for a deliberate indifference claim is \nthat a defendant have a causal connection to the constitutional \nharm.” Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1327. As Secretary of FDC, Defendant \nis  ultimately  responsible  for  FDC’s  policies  and  practices.  See \n                                           \n22 FDC cannot hide behind the excuse that this is a difficult or lengthy process. \nDr. Dewsnup testified that inmates with the most advanced liver disease could \nbe quickly and simply identified based on what FDC already knows about their \nalbumin levels and through further testing with proprietary indices. See Test. \nof Dr. Dewsnup.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 25 of 32\n   \n \n§ 20.315(3),  Fla.  Stat.  Accordingly,  because  Plaintiffs’  claim  is \nbased on inadequacies in FDC’s policies and implementation of \nthose  policies,  the  causation  element  has  been  satisfied.  Cf. \nCottone v. Jenne, 326 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir. 2003) (“[T]he \ncausal connection may be established when a supervisor’s custom \nor policy . . . result[s] in deliberate indifference to constitutional \nrights . . . .” (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \n4. Conclusion \n  Plaintiffs have shown that the class suffers from chronic \nHCV and that chronic HCV is a serious medical need. Plaintiffs \nhave also shown that Defendant has been deliberately indifferent \nto  the  class’s  serious  medical  needs.  Moreover,  Plaintiffs  have \nshown  a  causal  connection  between  Defendant’s  deliberate \nindifference and the class’s injuries. Consequently, Plaintiffs have \na substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their Eighth \nAmendment claim. \nB.  Whether  an  Injunction  is  Necessary  to  Prevent \nIrreparable Injury \n \n  “[I]njunctive relief is appropriate ‘to prevent a substantial \nrisk of serious injury from ripening into actual harm.’” Thomas v. \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 26 of 32\n   \n \nBryant, 614 F.3d 1288, 1318 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 845 (1994)). “In such circumstances, the \nirreparable-injury requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating \na history of past misconduct, which gives rise to an inference that \nfuture  injury  is  imminent.”  Id.  Here,  FDC’s  history  of  past \nmisconduct  leads  this  Court  to  believe  that  future  injury  is \nimminent. Specifically, this Court finds that FDC will not treat \nHCV-infected inmates in an appropriate and timely manner. \nIf these inmates are not treated, they will undoubtedly suffer \nirreparable injury. Although DAAs can cure a person of HCV, they \ndo not necessarily reduce the level of fibrosis a person has already \nsuffered. ECF No. 138, at 64. Consequently, it is important to treat \npatients with HCV as soon as possible so that they can be cured of \nthe virus before their liver becomes significantly diseased. Pls.’ Ex. \n28, at 11. \nC. Whether the Threatened Injury Outweighs the Harm \nthat an Injunction Would Cause to Defendant \n \n  The only harm facing FDC is that it will have to spend more \nmoney than it wants to.23 Indeed, Defendant identifies no other \n                                           \n 23 Defendant argues that any funds required to be spent by FDC are funds \ntaken from providing care to other inmates. ECF No. 31, at 21. But that is no \nexcuse. FDC cannot use its constitutional duty to treat a certain group of \ninmates as a reason not to treat a different group. See, e.g., Williams v. Bennett, \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 27 of 32\n   \n \npossible harm that could result in this case. See ECF No. 31, at 19–\n21. “The threat of harm to the plaintiffs cannot be outweighed by \nthe risk of financial burden or administrative inconvenience to the \ndefendants.” Laube v. Haley, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (M.D. Ala. \n2002).  Contrarily,  Plaintiffs  and  Plaintiffs’  class  face  great \ninjuries.  The  record  is  rife  with  evidence  of  the  harmful \nconsequences that result from untreated HCV. See supra, at 14–\n15. Accordingly, this Court finds that the threatened injury facing \nPlaintiffs  and  Plaintiffs’  class  outweighs  any  harm  that  the \ninjunction would cause to Defendant. \n  D. Whether an Injunction is Adverse to the Public Interest \n \nAgain, FDC only identifies the financial consequences it will \nsuffer in discussing whether an injunction in this case would be \nadverse to the public interest. ECF No. 31, at 21–23. On the other \nhand, the public is undoubtedly interested in seeing that inmates’ \nconstitutional rights are not violated. See, e.g., Laube, 234 F. Supp. \n2d at 1252 (“[T]here is a strong public interest in requiring that \nthe plaintiffs’ constitutional rights no longer be violated . . . .”). \n                                           \n689 F.2d 1370, 1388 (11th Cir. 1982) (“If . . . a state chooses to operate a prison \nsystem, then each facility must be operated in a manner consistent with the \nconstitution.”). \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 28 of 32\n   \n \nMoreover, both parties’ experts testified that treating HCV inside \nprisons may have great impacts on reducing the prevalence of HCV \noutside prisons. ECF No. 138, at 81; Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. So, if \nanything, it seems that an injunction in this case would actually \nserve the public interest. Cf. Costello v. Wainwright, 397 F. Supp. \n20, 37 (M.D. Fla. 1976) (“[I]t seems clear to this Court that, in the \nlong run, providing decent medical care and housing to inmates \nwould serve to promote the rehabilitative goals of the criminal \njustice system so as to permit their re-entry into free society as \nupright and law abiding citizens and to prevent their re-entry into \nthe criminal justice system.”), vacated in part on other grounds, \n539 F.2d 547 (5th Cir.), rev’d, 430 U.S. 325 (1977). \nIII. Conclusion \n“Preventable  deaths  from  HCV  are  occurring  within  the \nprison system.” Def.’s Ex. 22, at 1. Most of the witnesses who \ntestified before this Court, and even Defendant’s own expert, all \nbut admitted that Defendant has been deliberately indifferent to \nPlaintiffs’  (and  the  class’s)  serious  medical  needs.24  Moreover, \n                                           \n24 When asked whether the standard of care is currently being met by FDC \ngiven so few inmates have been evaluated to date, Dr, Dewsnup responded, “I \ndon’t believe it’s being met at all. I think those numbers that you’ve just \noutlined, you know, on their face is a prima facie case that it’s not being met.” \nSee Test. of Dr. Dewsnup.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 29 of 32\n   \n \nFDC’s  promises  and  plan  for  the  future  are  simply  not  good \nenough. Relying heavily on the testimony of Defendant’s expert, \nDr. Dewsnup, this Court finds that an injunction is necessary to \nensure that Plaintiffs and the class receive timely and appropriate \nmedical care in a manner that complies with the Constitution. \nAccordingly, with limited exceptions, this Court is ordering \nDefendant  to  ensure  that  FDC  complies  with  its  own  expert’s \nrecommendations.  Specifically,  FDC  must  update  its  HCV-\ntreatment policy (HSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3) in line with the \nshortcomings noted by Dr. Dewsnup during the hearing before this \nCourt so that there is a clear plan for doctors and practitioners to \nfollow.25 Moreover, FDC must formulate a plan to implement its \npolicy by screening, evaluating, and treating inmates in line with \nthe directions and timelines identified by Dr. Dewsnup during the \nhearing before this Court.26 To the extent FDC does not have the \n                                           \n \n25 Indeed, even Mr. Reimers testified that the reason he sent his letter was to \nmake FDC’s expectations clear. ECF No. 151, at 25. Similarly, Mr. Reimers \nhad to make FDC’s expectations clear when Corizon and Wexford weren’t \ntreating anyone. Id. at 40–43. Enough is enough. FDC needs to clear up the \nloosey-goosey language in its treatment policy so that it can no longer hide \nbehind the consequences of its own obfuscations.  \n \n26 As noted by Dr. Dewsnup during his testimony, this includes referring \ninmates for liver-transplant evaluation where necessary. \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 30 of 32\n   \n \nsystem capacity to meet these requirements, it must increase its \ncapacity and outline a timetable for doing so.27 \n  As to system capacity, Dr. Dewsnup testified that FDC will \nlikely only be able to evaluate inmates at a rate of 100 per month. \nSee Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. To the extent Dr. Dewsnup finds this \nrate acceptable, this Court disagrees. Dr. Dewsnup testified that, \nas  long  as  otherwise  eligible,  inmates  with  decompensated \ncirrhosis should be treated immediately, inmates with cirrhosis \nshould be treated within three to six months, and inmates with F2 \nand  F3  fibrosis  scores  should  be  treated  within  a  year.  Id. \nMoreover, Dr. Dewsnup testified that the balance of the infected \ninmates, with F1 and F0 fibrosis scores, should continue to be \nmonitored, including restaging labs every six months. This Court \nagrees with those timelines, and FDC needs to increase its system \ncapacity to be able to satisfy them.28   \n                                           \n27 Dr. Dewsnup unequivocally stated that to gather the requisite information, \nscreen the inmates, evaluate the inmates, and to begin treatments of the \ninmates to meet the appropriate standard of care will “require a massive \nexpansion of system capacity.” See Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. He made plain that \na single infectious disease nurse, “Christine,” could not update the spreadsheet \nbeing used to help prioritize the infected inmates and it would take more than \none  doctor,  himself,  to  review  the  data  with  Dr.  Cherry  and  make \nrecommendations.   \n \n28 Dr. Dewsnup agreed there are ways to speed this process. For example, \nDefendant could—and should—immediately send the blood of the 500 inmates \nwith the lowest albumin levels for lab work and proprietary testing. See Test. \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 31 of 32\n   \n \nThis Court recognizes that these directions are broad. To be \nclear,  this  was  done  at  Defendant’s  request.  During  closing \narguments before this Court, Defendant stated that she wishes to \nprepare a plan in light of this Court’s directions. Accordingly, at \nthis stage this Court is only providing overarching guidance of how \nit believes FDC should address HCV treatment going forward. \nThis guidance is consistent with the opinions expressed by Dr. \nDewsnup during his testimony before this Court. Defendant shall \nbe permitted to provide a more specific plan, and this Court will \nconsider  Defendant’s  plan  before  entering  a  preliminary \ninjunction. In so ruling, this Court notes that Defendant must \nmove  with  “alacrity.”  This  Court  will  not  tolerate  further  foot \ndragging. If Defendant needs further direction from this Court \nwith  respect  to  what  the  proposed  plan  must  contain  then \nDefendant  shall  contact  this  Court  no  later  than  Monday, \nNovember 20, 2017, to schedule a telephonic hearing to be held no \nlater than November 22, 2017. It was been represented to this \nCourt  at  hearing  that  Defendant  is  already  in  the  process  of \n                                           \nof Dr. Dewsnup. Defendant needs to have a plan and a timetable to do the same \nfor  the  other  6,500  inmates.  This  Court  recognizes  that  the  labs  and \nproprietary testing costs approximately $400 per inmate but time is of the \nessence and the urgency is born of delays of the Defendant. \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 153   Filed 11/17/17   Page 32 of 32\n   \n \nformulating  and  implementing  such  a  plan.  Stated  otherwise, \nDefendant has already had time to refine its plan and marshal \nresources to address this problem. \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. \n11, is GRANTED. \n2.  No later than December 1, 2017, Defendant shall file a \nplan  consistent  with  the  directions  this  Court  listed \nabove. Defendant must include specific timetables. Once \nthis Court issues its injunction, it will require Defendant \nto file updates to make sure such benchmarks are met.  \nSO ORDERED on November 17, 2017. \n        s/Mark E. Walker     \n          United States District Judge \n32 \n ",

The Florida Department of Correction (FDC) is refusing to provide life-\nsaving treatment to thousands of incarcerated people with hepatitis C.  This policy, \npractice, and custom has resulted in the suffering and probable death of numerous \nprisoners,  and  puts  tens  of  thousands  of  other  prisoners  at  serious  risk  of \nexperiencing pain, liver failure, cancer, and death—despite the fact that there are \nmedications that will cure almost all hepatitis C patients with little to no side effects, \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 2 of 51\nand the fact that the medical standard of care requires treatment for all such patients.   \nThe failure to provide treatment also creates the potential for further spreading of \nthe disease to the general public. These actions amount to deliberate indifference to \nthe serious medical needs of FDC prisoners with hepatitis C, in violation of the \nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and discrimination on the basis \nof disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation \nAct.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of all \nFDC prisoners with hepatitis C, so that they can receive the treatment that they \ndesperately need.   \nJurisdiction and Venue \n2.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 in \nthat this is a civil action arising under the Constitution of the United States. \n3.  Jurisdiction of the Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) \nin that this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights \nsecured to the Plaintiffs by the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n4.  Plaintiffs’ claims for relief are predicated, in part, upon 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, which authorizes actions to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, \nof rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States, and upon 42 U.S.C. § 1988, which authorizes the award of attorneys’ \n-2- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 3 of 51\nfees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs in actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983.    Plaintiffs’  claims  are  also  brought  pursuant  to  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29 \nU.S.C. § 794, and pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205, and 29 U.S.C. § 794a, which \nauthorize an award of attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing plaintiffs. \n5.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202, as well as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. \n6.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) and \n§ 1391(c), as Defendant does business in this judicial district and division, and many \nof the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district \nand division. \n7.  Plaintiffs seek a preliminary and permanent injunction pursuant to Rule \n65, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nParties \n8.  Plaintiff Carl Hoffer is incarcerated in the FDC system, and was at all \nrelevant times.  He suffers from hepatitis C but has not been treated for it.   \n9.  Plaintiff Ronald McPherson is incarcerated in the FDC system, and was \nat all relevant times.  He suffers from hepatitis C but has not been treated for it.   \n-3- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 4 of 51\n10.  Plaintiff Roland Molina is incarcerated in the FDC system, and was at \nall relevant times.  He suffers from hepatitis C but has not been treated for it.   \n11.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n12.  Defendant Julie L. Jones is the Secretary of the Florida Department of \nCorrections (FDC).  As such, she is responsible for the overall operation of the FDC, \nincluding  the  operation  of  Florida’s  prison  system  and  compliance  with  the \nConstitution and federal laws.  Defendant Jones has a non-delegable duty to provide \nconstitutionally adequate medical care to all persons in her custody.  She is sued in \nher official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief.  Defendant Jones may be \nreferred to herein as the Florida Department of Corrections or FDC.   \n13.  Defendant Jones has statutory authority to implement the relief sought \nin the Compliant.  See Fla. Stat. § 20.315.  \n14.  The actions of Defendant Jones and her agents were performed under \ncolor of state law and constitute state action. \n15.  All  staff  members  mentioned  herein  were  employees  or  agents  of \nDefendant and acted within the scope of their employment or agency at all relevant \ntimes.  \n-4- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 5 of 51\n16.  The FDC is a public entity under Title II of the ADA, and receives \nfederal financial assistance within the meaning of the RA, and has at all relevant \ntimes.   \nGeneral Factual Allegations \nHepatitis C and Its Symptoms \n17.  Hepatitis C is a blood borne disease caused by the hepatitis C virus \n(HCV).  The virus causes inflammation that damages liver cells, and is a leading \ncause of liver disease and liver transplants. \n18.  HCV is transmitted by infected blood via several methods, including \nintravenous drug use and tattooing using shared equipment, blood transfusions with \ninfected blood (typically before regular screening of donated blood began), and \nsexual  activity.    Intravenous  drug  use  is  the  most  common  means  of  HCV \ntransmission in the United States. \n19.  HCV can be either acute or chronic.  In people with acute HCV, the \nvirus will spontaneously clear itself from the blood stream within six months of \nexposure.  Chronic HCV, on the other hand, is defined as having a detectable HCV \nviral level in the blood at some point six months after exposure.  Fifty-five to eighty-\nfive percent of infected people will develop chronic HCV.   \n-5- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 6 of 51\n20.  Liver inflammation caused by chronic HCV can significantly impair \nliver function and damage its crucial role in digesting nutrients, filtering toxins from \nthe blood, fighting infection, and conducting other metabolic processes in the body.  \nLiver inflammation can also cause fatigue, weakness, muscle wasting, skin rashes, \nand arthritis. \n21.  People with chronic HCV develop fibrosis of the liver, a process by \nwhich healthy liver tissue is replaced with scarring.  Scar tissue cannot perform the \njob of normal liver cells, so fibrosis reduces liver function and results in the same \nsymptoms mentioned above, but with greater intensity.  Fibrosis can also lead to \nhepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).  \n22.  When scar tissue begins to take over most of the liver, this extensive \nfibrosis is termed cirrhosis.  Of those with chronic HCV, the majority will develop \nchronic liver disease and approximately 20% will develop cirrhosis in a 20-year \ntimeframe. \n23.  Cirrhosis  causes  additional  painful  complications,  including \nwidespread itching, kidney disease, jaundice, fluid retention with edema, internal \nbleeding, varices (enlarged veins that develop in the esophagus or intestines, which \ncan burst), easy bruising, ascites (fluid accumulation in the legs and abdomen), \nencephalopathy (mental confusion and disorientation), lymph disorders, increased \n-6- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 7 of 51\nrisk of infection, seizures, and extreme fatigue.  Most of these complications can \noccur before cirrhosis.  If they go untreated, some can cause death, often from \ninfection, bleeding, and fluid accumulation.  \n24.  Abdominal ascites can require paracentesis, a procedure wherein a \nneedle  is  inserted  into  the  abdomen  to  drain  the  fluid.    Without  this  periodic \nprocedure, the fluid accumulation can decrease the available space for the patient’s \nlungs, thus causing shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. \n25.  Moreover, once an HCV patient’s liver has cirrhosis, it may not be \nreversible.  Some patients with cirrhosis may have too much scar tissue in the liver, \neven if the liver can heal to some degree once the virus is eliminated by treatment.  \nIf scar tissue persists, the patient may still experience the complications of cirrhosis, \nincluding liver cancer. \n26.  Cirrhosis that is accompanied by serious complications is known as \ndecompensated  cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis  without  serious  complications  is  called \ncompensated cirrhosis.  \n27.  Thus, HCV is a physiological disorder or condition that affects one or \nmore body systems, including but not limited to the digestive, gastrointestinal, \nimmune, circulatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems, and is therefore a physical \nimpairment.  This physical impairment substantially limits one or more major life \n-7- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 8 of 51\nactivity, including but not limited to eating, walking, bending, lifting, concentrating, \nthinking,  and  communicating;  the  operation  of  major  bodily  functions  such  as \ndigestive, gastrointestinal, immune, circulatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems; \nand the operation of the liver.    \n28.  For all FDC prisoners who have been diagnosed with HCV, there is a \nrecord of their impairment.   \n29.  The  FDC  regards  all  prisoners  with  HCV  as  having  a  physical \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity.  \n30.  HCV is a serious medical need.  \nGeneral Prevalence of Hepatitis C \n31.  Approximately 2.7 to 3.9 million Americans have chronic HCV.   \n32.  In  2000,  the  United  States  Surgeon  General  called  HCV  a  “silent \nepidemic,” and estimated that as much as two percent of the adult U.S. population \nhad HCV.   \n33.  In 2013, HCV caused more deaths than sixty other infectious diseases \ncombined, including HIV, pneumococcal disease, and tuberculosis.   \n34.  Approximately 19,000 people die of HCV-caused liver disease every \nyear in the United States.   \n35.  HCV is the leading indication for liver transplants in the United States. \n-8- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 9 of 51\nHepatitis C in Prison \n36.  The prevalence of HCV in prison is much higher than in the general \npopulation.  It is estimated that between 16% and 41% of the United States jail and \nprison population has HCV.  Thus, incarceration is a risk factor for HCV. \n37.  The FDC has reported to the media and researchers that 5,000 to 5,272 \nof its approximately 98,010 prisoners have HCV.  As of August 8, 2016, the FDC \nlisted 4,797 prisoners as having HCV in its internal records. \n38.  Because the FDC does not conduct routine opt-out testing for HCV, \nupon information and belief, FDC is undercounting the number of prisoners with \nHCV. \n39.  In  fact,  because  it  is  estimated  that  between  16%  and  41%  of \nincarcerated people have HCV, it is likely that between 14,700 and 40,184 FDC \nprisoners have HCV.  The true number is likely at the higher end of that spectrum \nbecause of the high prevalence of HCV in Florida:  Between 2009 and 2013, rates \nof acute HCV in Florida increased by 133%.  \nStandard of Care for HCV \n40.  For many years, there were no universally safe and effective treatments \nfor HCV.  The standard treatment prior to 2011, which included the use of interferon \nand  ribavirin  medications,  sometime  required  injections,  had  a  long  treatment \n-9- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 10 of 51\nduration (up to 48 weeks), failed to cure most patients, and was associated with \nnumerous  side  effects,  including  psychiatric  and  autoimmune  disorders,  flulike \nsymptoms, gastrointestinal distress, skin rashes, and severe anemia.   Moreover, not \nall drug regimens worked for all types of HCV, and many could not be given to \npatients with other comorbid diseases.   \n41.  In 2011, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began \napproving new oral medications, called direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs, which \nhave proven to work more quickly, cause fewer side effects, and treat chronic HCV \nmuch more effectively.  At first, they were designed to work in tandem with the old \ntreatment regimen.  But beginning in 2013, the FDA began to approve DAA drugs \nthat can be taken alone.   \n42.  These  DAA  drugs—currently  Sovaldi  (sofosbuvir),  Olysio \n(simeprevir),  Harvoni  (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir),  Viekira  Pak \n(ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir),  Daklinza  (daclatasvir),  Technivie \n(ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir),  Zepatier  (elbasvir/grazprevir),  and  Epclusa \n(sofosbuvir/velpatasvir)—have far fewer side effects, dramatically greater efficacy, \na shorter treatment duration (12 weeks), and are administered orally (commonly a \nonce-daily pill) rather than by injections.  They have truly revolutionized the way \nHCV is treated.   \n-10- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 11 of 51\n43.  Most importantly, 90 to 95% of HCV patients treated with any of these \nDAA drugs are cured, whereas the old treatment regime only helped roughly one \nthird of patients.   \n44.  For HCV, a “cure” is defined as a sustained virologic response (SVR)—\ni.e., no detectable HCV genetic material in the patient’s blood—for three months \nfollowing the end of treatment.   \n45.  In  response  to  the  revolutionary  DAA  medications,  the  American \nAssociation for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Disease \nSociety of America (IDSA) formed a panel of experts to conduct an extensive, \nevidence-based review of the testing, management, and treatment of HCV.  The \nresults of that review have been published in a comprehensive document called the \nHCV  Guidance,  which  is  updated  regularly  and  is  available  at \nwww.hcvguidelines.org.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nencourages health care professionals to follow the evidence-based standard of care \ndeveloped by the IDSA/AASLD. \n46.  The IDSA/AASLD guidelines set forth the medical standard of care for \nthe treatment of HCV, which is now well-established in the medical community. \n47.  The IDSA/AALSD panel, through the HCV Guidance, recommends \nimmediate treatment with DAA drugs for all persons with chronic HCV.  This is the \n-11- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 12 of 51\nstandard of care for the treatment of HCV, and it reflects the continuing medical \nresearch showing the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and dramatic benefits of the DAA \ndrugs.   \n48.  The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF), the agency \nresponsible for administering the Medicaid program in Florida, recently confirmed \nthat,  in  determining  what  is  medically  necessary  and  therefore  covered  by  the \nMedicaid program, DAA medications for HCV should be approved for all adult \npatients with an HCV diagnosis.  DCF also specifically eliminated any requirement \nthat there be any evidence of hepatic fibrosis before covering treatment.  Thus, DCF \nhas recognized that the standard of care for HCV is to provide immediate treatment \nwith DAA drugs to all patients with HCV, regardless of the stage of the disease.  \n49.  Under this standard of care, treatment with DAA drugs is expected to \ncure nearly all infected persons.   \n50.  The benefits of immediate treatment include immediate decrease in \nliver inflammation, reduction in the rate of progression of liver fibrosis, reduction in \nthe likelihood of the manifestations of cirrhosis and associated complications, a 70% \nreduction in the risk of liver cancer, a 90% reduction in the risk of liver-related \nmortality, and a dramatic improvement in quality of life. \n-12- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 13 of 51\n51.  Treatment  must  be  provided  timely  to  ensure  efficacy.  Delay  in \ntreatment increases the risk that the treatment will be ineffective.    \nScreening, Diagnosis, and Monitoring of HCV  \n52.  Under the IDSA/AASLD guidelines, all persons with risk factors for \nHCV infection should be offered testing for HCV.  This includes all persons born \nbetween 1945 and 1965 and all persons who were ever incarcerated. \n53.  A person is generally diagnosed with HCV through a rapid blood test \nin  which  the  blood  is  examined  for  HCV  antibodies.    A  follow-up  blood  test \ndetermines whether the genetic material of HCV remains in the blood.  A third blood \ntest can determine which variation, or genotype, of HCV a person has. \n54.  Although the standard of care is to treat all persons with chronic HCV \nwith DAA drugs, it is still useful to determine the progression of fibrosis and/or \ncirrhosis in the liver to choose the appropriate DAA drug, to treat other conditions \nor complications a person may be experiencing, to screen for liver cancer, to advise \npatients about contraindications and drugs to avoid, and to determine whether liver \ntransplantation is necessary. \n55.  There are several methods used to determine the level of cirrhosis or \nfibrosis, along with an evaluation of the patient’s symptoms.  One such method is a \nliver biopsy, which is a surgery wherein a small sample of liver tissue is removed \n-13- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 14 of 51\nand histologically assessed.  A typical biopsy evaluation method is a system called \nMetavir, which assigns a number corresponding to the amount of scar tissue on the \nliver, with 0 meaning no fibrosis and 4 meaning severe fibrosis or cirrhosis.  A score \nof  2  or  greater  is  considered  significant  fibrosis.   Liver  biopsies  are  generally \nregarded as the most accurate measure of fibrosis and cirrhosis, but they are not \nroutinely recommended because they are invasive and potentially dangerous, and \nalso because they are generally unnecessary, as the standard of care is to treat all \nHCV patients, regardless of disease progression.  \n56.  Other methods of assessing fibrosis and cirrhosis include blood tests, \nsuch as the APRI (AST to Platelet Ratio Index) score.   This score is a ratio derived \nby comparing the level of an enzyme in the blood called aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) with the usual amount of AST in the blood of a healthy person and the number \nof platelets in the affected person’s blood.  Generally, an APRI score greater than \n0.7 indicates significant fibrosis, and a score of 1.0 or greater indicates cirrhosis.  \nBut as explained below, a low APRI score does not necessarily indicate the absence \nof fibrosis.  \n57.  Another blood test is called the FIB-4, which is a ratio derived using \nthe level of two enzymes in the blood, AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as \nwell as platelet count and the person’s age.   \n-14- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 15 of 51\n58.  Standard ultrasounds or sonograms of the liver are unreliable indicators \nof the level of fibrosis, as advanced fibrosis may not be detected by these scans.  But \nthere is a more accurate version called FibroScan, which is a type of ultrasound \nknown as transient elastography that uses sound waves to determine the amount of \nfibrosis present in the liver. \n59.  In assessing the level of fibrosis or cirrhosis, the entire clinical picture \nmust be taken into account.  There is no one blood test, scan, or symptom that will \naccurately determine the extent of liver damage, and therefore relying solely on strict \nnumerical cutoffs of any test result is inappropriate.  Any abnormal test result or \nsymptom should be taken as a sign of fibrosis or cirrhosis, but normal results in \nisolation cannot rule out fibrosis or cirrhosis.   \n60.  Relying solely on the APRI score to make treatment decisions is not \nadequate or appropriate because APRI has significant limitations.  First, when an \nAPRI score is extremely high, it has good diagnostic utility in predicting severe \nfibrosis or cirrhosis, but low and mid-range scores may miss many people who have \nsignificant fibrosis or cirrhosis.  In fact, in more than 90% of HCV cases, an APRI \nscore of at least 2.0 indicates that a person has cirrhosis, but more than half of people \nwith cirrhosis will not have an APRI score of at least 2.0.  Second, where a person \nhas been diagnosed with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis through some other means, a \n-15- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 16 of 51\nlow APRI score does not negate the diagnosis—it should be presumed the patient \nhas cirrhosis.  Third, because AST levels fluctuate from day to day, a decreased or \nnormalized level does not mean the condition has improved, and even a series of \nnormal readings over time may fail to accurately show the level of fibrosis or \ncirrhosis.  \n61.  A health care provider must also evaluate a patient’s symptoms and \ndetermine whether the liver disease is compensated or decompensated.  Once liver \ndisease has advanced, scoring of the clinical degree of liver dysfunction is done \nusing  the  Childs-Pugh  (C-P)  score,  also  termed  the  Child-Turcotte-Pugh  score \n(CPT).  Variables include the serum albumin and bilirubin, ascites, encephalopathy, \nand prothrombin time (a measure of how well the blood clots). The score ranges \nfrom 5 to 15.  Patients with a score of 5 or 6 have CPT class A cirrhosis (well-\ncompensated cirrhosis), those with a score of 7 to 9 have CPT class B cirrhosis \n(significant functional compromise), and those with a score of 10 to 15 have CPT \nclass C cirrhosis (decompensated cirrhosis). \n62.  Once cirrhosis has developed, patients should also be followed with \ntwice  yearly  alfa  fetoprotein  (AFP)  screens,  which  is  a  serum  marker  for  the \ndevelopment of liver cancer.  Increases in AFP indicate the possible presence of liver \ncancer. \n-16- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 17 of 51\n63.  Individuals with comorbid HIV (or other immune disorders) and HCV \nare at a much greater risk for more rapidly progressive liver disease, and should be \ntreated and closely followed. \nFDC’s Unlawful Policy and Practice of Denying Treatment for HCV \n64.  Despite the clear agreement in the medical community that all persons \nwith chronic HCV should be treated with DAA drugs, the FDC does not provide \nthese lifesaving medications to FDC prisoners with HCV.  Instead, Defendant has a \npolicy, custom, and practice of not providing DAA medications to prisoners with \nHCV,  in  contravention  of  the  prevailing  standard  of  care  and  in  deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners with HCV. \n65.  This policy, practice, and custom has caused, and continues to cause, \nthe unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain and an unreasonable risk of serious \ndamage to the health of FDC prisoners with HCV. \n66.  Although Defendant has a policy governing the treatment of prisoners \nwith HCV, which is outlined in Supplement #3 to Health Service Bulletin (HSB) \n15.03.09 and was promulgated on June 27, 2016, in practice almost no prisoners \nreceive DAA medications.  Instead, Defendant simply enters the names of prisoners \nwith known HCV infection into a database and enrolls them in a gastrointestinal \n-17- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 18 of 51\nclinic—which means blood draws are taken every six to twelve months—but does \nnot actually treat them. \n67.  Although the HSB states that “all patients with chronic HCV infection \nmay benefit from treatment,” it does not require treatment for anyone.  Rather, the \nHSB recommends treatment based on priority levels.   \n68.  In Priority Level 1 (“highest priority”) are patients with decompensated \ncirrhosis  measured  as  a  7-9  on  the  CTP  scale,  liver  transplant  candidates  or \nrecipients,  patients  with  hepatocellular  carcinoma  and  other  serious  comorbid \nmedical conditions, and patients on immunosuppressant medication.  In Priority \nLevel 2 (“high priority”) are patients with an APRI score greater than 2, advanced \nfibrosis shown on a liver biopsy, or other comorbid diseases and infections.  In \nPriority Level 3 (“intermediate priority”) are patients with Stage 2 fibrosis shown on \na liver biopsy, an APRI score greater than 1.5, and patients with porphyria or \ndiabetes.  In Priority Level 4 (“routine”) are patients with stage 1 fibrosis shown \nfrom a liver biopsy and all others with HCV infection.  There is no further guidance \nin the policy regarding which priority levels receive treatment, or when. And again, \ndespite this written policy of prioritization, in practice FDC provides almost no \ntreatment with medications.   \n-18- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 19 of 51\n69.  Liver biopsies are generally not performed for FDC prisoners with \nHCV.  \n70.  Because the standard of care is to treat everyone, without regard to the \nstage of the disease, Defendant’s written policy (even if it was followed) of only \nproviding treatment to patients with the most advanced stages of the disease amounts \nto  deliberate  indifference  to  serious  medical  needs,  in  violation  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment.  It is not consistent with the standard of care.  Delaying treatment until \na patient is extremely sick has the perverse effect of withholding treatment from the \npatients who could benefit the most from it, because the treatment is less effective \nfor patients with the most advanced stages of the disease.   \n71.  But even if the policy were adequate, the FDC does not follow it \nbecause it provides treatment to almost none of the HCV-positive prisoners in its \ncustody.  Indeed, despite the fact that Defendant knows of at least 4,790 patients \nwith chronic HCV, as of July 6, 2016, Defendant has treated only five with DAA \ndrugs.  Upon information and belief, Defendant also knows, based on national \nestimates and the fact that FDC does not routinely test for HCV, that it is very likely \nthat at least 14,700, and as many as 40,184 FDC prisoners have HCV.   \n72.  In fact, the FDC’s treatment rate is among the lowest in the country for \nwhich there is reported data.  \n-19- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 20 of 51\n73.  And since 2013, the year the FDA approved DAA medications that cure \nHCV, at least 160 FDC prisoners have died of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and \nother diseases of the digestive system.  Since HCV is the most common cause of \nliver failure in the United States, it is likely that most of these deaths were due to \nchronic  HCV.    Upon  information  and  belief,  past  and  current  practices  of  the \nDefendant are resulting in deaths that could have been prevented through treatment \nof HCV.   \n74.  Furthermore,  assuming  that  prioritization  were  appropriate, \nDefendant’s policy is also inadequate because it relies on strict numerical cutoffs \n(and almost exclusively on the APRI score) rather than a holistic evaluation of the \nentire clinical picture to determine the level of fibrosis.    \n75.  And assuming that using numerical cutoffs were appropriate, FDC has \nset them so high that it precludes treatment for all but the most advanced cases of \ncirrhosis and fibrosis. \n76.  Further, assuming that numerical cutoffs were appropriate and were set \nat appropriate levels, FDC is  not even following them.  Of the 4,790 patients \nidentified by FDC as having chronic HCV, an analysis of their APRI scores and \nplatelet counts indicates that almost 400 have probable cirrhosis, over 1,000 likely \nhave advanced fibrosis, and over 1,700 likely have significant fibrosis.  At the very \n-20- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 21 of 51\nleast, all of these prisoners should receive treatment.  Yet, only five have been \ntreated. \n77.  The FDC also unjustifiably delays providing HCV treatment, even \nthough the standard of care requires treatment as early as possible.  If DAA treatment \nis delayed until a patient has advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (generally, the first two \nFDC  priority  levels),  these  medications  can  be  significantly  less  effective.  \nMoreover, if DAA treatment is delayed until a patient develops decompensated \ncirrhosis (generally, the first FDC priority level), a liver transplant preceded or \nfollowed by DAA treatment is the only way to cure the patient.  \n78.  In practice, the FDC delays treatment for virtually all patients with \nHCV, regardless of their disease progression, until the patient is released from prison \nor dies. \n79.  Moreover, Defendant’s policy does not address liver transplantation, \nthe only possible cure for people with decompensated cirrhosis.  Even if given DAA \ntreatment, many of these patients will likely die without liver transplants. \n80.  Defendant’s policy does not address the need for liver cancer screening, \nwhich is standard medical practice once individuals have progressed to advanced \nfibrosis or cirrhosis.  Unless there is regular surveillance to find cancers early and \nremove them surgically, liver cancer has a very dismal prognosis.  Contrary to the \n-21- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 22 of 51\nproper and necessary medical procedures and the community standard of care, \nDefendant has not been screening Plaintiffs, and, upon information and belief, other \nHCV-positive FDC prisoners with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, for liver cancer.   \n81.  The  HSB  does  not  include  routine  opt-out  testing  for  HCV  (i.e., \nrequiring the test unless the prisoner affirmatively opts out).  Thus, FDC does not \nknow  the  full  number  of  FDC  prisoners  who  have  HCV,  even  though,  upon \ninformation and belief, it knows the number to be much higher based on national \nestimates. \n82.  Defendant categorically withholds treatment from FDC prisoners with \nHCV,  but  does  not  categorically  withhold  treatment  from  prisoners  with  other \nsimilar diseases or conditions (such as HIV) or from other prisoners without similar \ndiseases or conditions.   \n83.  The FDC has enforced the above-described policies, practices, and \ncustoms despite knowing that the failure to provide DAA medications to prisoners \nwith HCV subjects those prisoners to an unreasonable risk of pain, liver failure, \ncancer, permanent damage to their health, and even death.  Defendant has acted with \ndeliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of FDC prisoners with chronic \nHCV. \n-22- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 23 of 51\n84.  Defendant will continue its course of conduct unless enjoined by this \nCourt.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.    \nPublic Health Benefits of Treatment in Prison \n85.  Providing expanded HCV screening and DAA treatment in Florida’s \nprisons would greatly reduce the number of new HCV cases in the community.  \nCuring  the  disease  while  people  are  in  prison  would  prevent  prisoners  from \ntransmitting it when released, and testing would diagnose numerous individuals who \nwere  unaware  they  were  infected,  thus  allowing  them  to  seek  treatment  once \nreleased.   \n86.  Studies have shown that providing DAA treatment to everyone with \nchronic  HCV  increases  long  term  cost-savings.    One  study  even  found  that \nrestricting DAA treatment access until patients were in the later stages of fibrosis \nactually results in higher per-patient costs because, while it may be initially less \nexpensive to delay administering DAAs, over the course of treatment, the follow-up \ncare outweighs the initial costs.   \n87.  Thus, early DAA treatment has the potential to both drastically reduce \nthe  incidence  of  HCV  in  the  general  population  and  also  to  reduce  the  costs \nassociated with serious complications from untreated HCV, such as liver transplants \nand liver cancer. \n-23- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 24 of 51\nAllegations Regarding Named Plaintiffs \n  Plaintiff Carl Hoffer \n88.  Plaintiff Carl Hoffer has been incarcerated in the FDC system since \n1988.  He is 70 years old.  He has chronic HCV and decompensated cirrhosis. \n89.  His chronic HCV is a physiological disorder or condition that affects \none  or  more  of  his  body  systems,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  digestive, \ngastrointestinal, immune, circulatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems, and is \ntherefore a physical impairment.  This physical impairment substantially limits one \nor more major life activity, including but not limited to walking, bending, sitting, \nlifting, and thinking; the operation of major bodily functions such as his digestive, \ngastrointestinal, immune, circulatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems; and the \noperation of his liver.    \n90.  Mr. Hoffer has a record of having an impairment that substantially \nlimits one or more major life activity, as he has a history of such an impairment, and \nthe FDC has diagnosed him with HCV, records some of his symptoms in his medical \nrecords, and has enrolled him in the gastrointestinal chronic illness clinic. \n91.  Mr. Hoffer is regarded by FDC  as has having an impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity, as FDC perceives him as having \nsuch an impairment, has diagnosed him with HCV, records some of his symptoms \n-24- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 25 of 51\nin his medical records, and has enrolled him in the gastrointestinal chronic illness \nclinic. \n92.  Mr. Hoffer meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt \nof services or the participation in programs or activities provided by FDC, including \nbut not limited to medical services.  \n93.  Mr. Hoffer first learned he had contracted HCV around 1999, while at \nFlorida State Prison.  Mr. Hoffer requested treatment for HCV then, and was told \nthat he did not meet the requirements for treatment.   \n94.  Mr. Hoffer continued to request treatment at every annual checkup, but \nto no avail.  He was told that he was not sick enough to be treated. \n95.  About eight years ago, while at Jackson Correctional Institution, Mr. \nHoffer noticed that his ankles and calves were beginning to swell painfully.  Chronic \nswelling of the legs and feet is a symptom of HCV. \n96.  Mr. Hoffer repeatedly requested treatment for this painful swelling and \nfor HCV, but his requests were ignored.  His condition continued to worsen.   \n97.    In May and June of 2015, Mr. Hoffer’s feet, ankles, calves, knees, \nthighs, testicles, and stomach became painfully swollen.  His shins were cracked and \nleaking white liquid.   \n-25- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 26 of 51\n98.  In June of 2015, FDC staff transferred Mr. Hoffer to the prison clinic, \nwhere he was put on antibiotics and a liquid diet.  He had developed severe ascites.  \nMr.  Hoffer  remained  there  for  approximately  28  days  until  his  symptoms \ndiminished. \n99.    Since then, while housed at Suwanee Correctional Institution, two \ndoctors have told Mr. Hoffer that they would recommend treatment for him for HCV.  \nHowever, he has never received treatment for HCV. \n100.  Mr.  Hoffer  has  filed  numerous  grievances,  complaining  of  his \nsymptoms and requesting treatment, and appealed them to the Defendant Secretary’s \nOffice, yet they have all been denied. \n101.  In August of 2016, Mr. Hoffer was sent to the emergency room at \nMemorial Hospital Jacksonville.  He was diagnosed with ascites, cirrhosis of the \nliver, and chronic hepatitis C.  Paracentesis was performed to drain the fluid, and \nMr. Hoffer stayed in the hospital for 19 days.   \n102.  Mr. Hoffer’s condition has continued to worsen.  His feet, ankles, and \ncalves are swelling again.  His liver is failing.  Further grievances have been denied.    \n103.  Mr.  Hoffer  uses  a  wheelchair  because  of  the  swelling  and  pain \nassociated with end stage liver disease caused by HCV.  Sometimes it hurts Mr. \n-26- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 27 of 51\nHoffer to walk or even just to sit.  Mr. Hoffer also has problems remembering names, \nfacts, and people.  Mental confusion is associated with late-stage HCV. \n104.  If Mr. Hoffer does not receive treatment for HCV, he will likely die of \nliver disease.  He has an approximately 10% chance of dying each year.  Mr. Hoffer \nneeds a liver transplant and DAA treatment to save his life.   \n105.  Despite all of this, FDC’s response to Mr. Hoffer’s latest grievance, \nsigned  April  11,  2017,  by  the  FDC  Health  Services  Director,  states  that  his \n“treatment is being deferred at this time until it becomes clinically indicated.”     \n106.  The FDC’s deliberate indifference to Mr. Hoffer’s serious medical \nneeds caused his liver to decompensate as early as June 2014, and his condition has \nbeen getting worse ever since.  Despite Mr. Hoffer being so sick that he now qualifies \nas “Priority 1” for HCV treatment under FDC’s own guidelines, he continues to be \ndenied treatment.     \n107.  He will continue to suffer, and will likely die of liver disease, unless he \nreceives the DAA drug treatment and a liver transplant.   \nPlaintiff Ronald McPherson \n108.  Ronald McPherson has been incarcerated in the FDC system since July \nof 2013.  He is 53 years old.   He has chronic HCV. \n-27- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 28 of 51\n109.  His chronic HCV is a physiological disorder or condition that affects \none  or  more  of  his  body  systems,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  digestive, \ngastrointestinal, immune, circulatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems, and is \ntherefore a physical impairment.  This physical impairment substantially limits one \nor more major life activity, including but not limited to performing manual tasks, \nwalking, bending, lifting, concentrating, working, and eating; the operation of major \nbodily  functions  such  as  his  digestive,  gastrointestinal,  immune,  circulatory, \ncardiovascular, and hemic systems; and the operation of his liver.    \n110.  Mr. McPherson has a record of having an impairment that substantially \nlimits one or more major life activity, as he has a history of such an impairment, and \nthe FDC has diagnosed him with HCV, records some of his symptoms in his medical \nrecords, and has enrolled him in the gastrointestinal chronic illness clinic. \n111.  Mr. McPherson is regarded by FDC as has having an impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity, as FDC perceives him as having \nsuch an impairment, has diagnosed him with HCV, records some of his symptoms \nin his medical records, and has enrolled him in the gastrointestinal chronic illness \nclinic. \n-28- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 29 of 51\n112.  Mr.  McPherson  meets  the  essential  eligibility  requirements  for the \nreceipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by FDC, \nincluding but not limited to medical services. \n113.  At his initial physical exam in prison in July of 2013, Mr. McPherson \nreported to medical staff that he had HIV and HCV.  Subsequent tests at Reception \nand Medical Center in Lake Butler confirmed this.  He receives treatment for HIV, \nwhich is well-controlled.   \n114.    Mr. McPherson has not been seen by an HCV specialist since being \nincarcerated in July of 2013.  He has not been informed by FDC medical staff about \nthe stage of his HCV.   \n115.  Beginning in May of 2014 and continuing through the present, Mr. \nMcPherson has filed numerous grievances and appeals, complaining about his HCV \nrelated symptoms and requesting treatment. They have all been denied.   \n116.  Mr. McPherson experiences acute weakness, dizziness, chest pains, \nmuscular spasms, nausea, and memory loss.  He is anemic and bruises easily.  He \nhas difficulty eating due to his medical condition.   His lab tests and medical records \nindicate that he has cirrhosis and is likely in liver failure.   \n117.  In  August  of  2016,  Nurse  Juliann  Dwares  recommended  that  Mr. \nMcPherson be treated with Harvoni (a DAA drug) for twelve weeks, due to his \n-29- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 30 of 51\ngenotype, low platelet levels, APRI score of over 2.0, and HIV co-infection.  But he \nnever received the treatment.   \n118.  In December of 2016 or January of 2017, Mr. McPherson filed another \nformal grievance asking for HCV treatment.  It was denied and Mr. McPherson filed \na timely appeal.   \n119.  On February 10, 2017, Mr. McPherson was seen by Nurse Dwares at \nColumbia Correctional Institution.  She again recommended that Mr. McPherson be \ntreated for HCV. \n120.  On February 13, 2017, Mr. McPherson was seen by Dr. Cruz at Baker \nCorrectional Institution.  Dr. Cruz did not refer Mr. McPherson for HCV treatment \nand said that the only thing they would do is continue monitoring his illness.  Dr. \nCruz “recommended” that Mr. McPherson avoid injuries in order to maintain his \nhealth. \n121.  In the last six months, Mr. McPherson has passed out four times.  His \nplatelet levels are dangerously low, as is his pulse.  Mr. McPherson’s blood doesn’t \nclot properly.  \n122.  Despite the recommendations for DAA medication, Mr. McPherson has \nstill not received HCV treatment.  The delay in treating Mr. McPherson’s HCV has \n-30- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 31 of 51\ncaused cirrhosis of his liver and has significantly decreased the possibility that the \nDAA drugs (if given to him) will be effective.  \n123.  The FDC’s deliberate indifference to Mr. McPherson’s serious medical \nneeds caused his quality of life to substantially deteriorate, has likely caused his liver \nto fail, and has caused him to experience the numerous symptoms described above.  \nHe is at risk for developing further symptoms, further advanced liver failure, and \neven  death.  He  may  not  survive  his  five-year  prison  sentence.  Despite  Mr. \nMcPherson qualifying for HCV treatment under FDC’s own guidelines, he continues \nto be denied treatment.     \n124.  He  will  continue  to  suffer,  and  his  liver  disease  will  continue  to \nadvance, unless he receives the DAA drug treatment.   \nPlaintiff Roland Molina \n125.  Roland Molina has been incarcerated in the FDC system since 2004.  \nHe is 51 years old.   He has chronic HCV, which he contracted by donating blood.  \n126.  His chronic HCV is a physiological disorder or condition that affects \none  or  more  of  his  body  systems,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  digestive, \ngastrointestinal, immune, circulatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems, and is \ntherefore a physical impairment.  This physical impairment substantially limits one \nor more major life activity, including but not limited walking and standing; the \n-31- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 32 of 51\noperation of major bodily functions such as his digestive, gastrointestinal, immune, \ncirculatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems; and the operation of his liver.    \n127.  Mr. Molina has a record of having an impairment that substantially \nlimits one or more major life activity, as he has a history of such an impairment, and \nthe FDC has diagnosed him with HCV, records some of his symptoms in his medical \nrecords, and has enrolled him in the gastrointestinal chronic illness clinic. \n128.  Mr. Molina is regarded by FDC as has having an impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity, as FDC perceives him as having \nsuch an impairment, has diagnosed him with HCV, records some of his symptoms \nin his medical records, and has enrolled him in the gastrointestinal chronic illness \nclinic. \n129.  Mr. Molina meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt \nof services or the participation in programs or activities provided by FDC, including \nbut not limited to medical services. \n130.  In  January  of  2013,  Mr.  Molina  told  FDC  staff  that  he  had  been \ndiagnosed with hepatitis 15 year ago.  A hepatitis panel was ordered and Mr. Molina \nwas diagnosed with HCV.  Thereafter, FDC staff began monitoring Mr. Molina’s \nHCV through biannual blood draws, but has not treated his underlying disease. \n-32- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 33 of 51\n131.  Mr. Molina has suffered from abnormally low platelet levels since at \nleast 2013, caused by his untreated HCV.  The low platelet levels have caused Mr. \nMolina to have surface bleeding, which can be seen in red blotches just underneath \nhis skin.  The condition is very painful.  On a scale of one to ten, Mr. Molina would \nrate it a seven or eight.  Mr. Molina also bruises very easily. \n132.  Mr. Molina’s platelet levels were so dangerously low in February of \n2015 that the doctor had to order Prednisone.  That caused his platelet levels to \nincrease slightly, but within a couple of months they were at dangerously low levels \nagain. \n133.  In  January  2016,  Mr.  Molina  filed  a  grievance  asking  for  HCV \ntreatment, but it was denied.  He appealed the denial, but it was also denied.   \n134.  In May of 2016, Mr. Molina’s labs indicated his APRI score was 2.652, \nindicating cirrhosis.   \n135.  Mr. Molina should be found eligible for treatment under the FDC’s own \nguidelines due to his low platelet levels and APRI scores, which indicate liver \ncirrhosis. \n136.  In addition to suffering from surface bleeding and jaundice, Mr. Molina \ngets easily tired.  Mr. Molina is only 51 years old and has always exercised and taken \n-33- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 34 of 51\ncare of himself.  However, his doctor has told him not to exercise due to his low \nplatelet levels.   \n137.  Mr. Molina suffers from numbness and a brown discoloration in his \nlegs, feet, and toes.  A nurse told Mr. Molina that he has cryoglobulinemia, a \ncomplication of HCV.  Mr. Molina experiences severe pain through his legs, feet, \nand toes.  The pain is constant and on a scale of one to ten, it sometimes reaches a \nten.     \n138.  The FDC’s deliberate indifference to Mr. Molina’s serious medical \nneeds caused his quality of life to substantially deteriorate and his liver to be scarred \nwith cirrhosis.  He suffers from the above symptoms and is at serious risk for \ndeveloping more symptoms, and experiencing further serious liver failure and death.  \nDespite Mr. Molina qualifying for HCV treatment under FDC’s own guidelines, he \ncontinues to be denied treatment.     \n139.  He  will  continue  to  suffer,  and  his  liver  disease  will  continue  to \nadvance, unless he receives the DAA drug treatment.   \nClass Action Allegations \n140.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs seek to \ncertify a class of all current and future prisoners in FDC custody who have been \ndiagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic HCV (the “Plaintiff Class”).   \n-34- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 35 of 51\n141.  Upon information and belief, Defendant has the ability to identify all \nsuch  similarly  situated  class  members,  through  medical  and  other  records  in \nDefendant’s possession.   \n142.  The requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied: \na. Numerosity.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.  The FDC has identified approximately 5,000 FDC prisoners \nwith HCV.  But national estimates suggest there are likely at least 14,700 FDC \nprisoners with HCV, and as many as 40,184.   \nb. Commonality.  There are questions of law or fact common to the class, \nincluding but not limited to: 1) whether HCV is a serious medical need; 2) \nwhether  Defendant’s  policy  and  practice  of  not  providing  HCV  treatment \nconstitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical needs in violation of the \nEight Amendment; 3) whether Defendant has knowingly failed to provide the \nnecessary staging of HCV patients in accordance with the prevailing standard \nof care, including the pretreatment testing to determine the severity of the \ndisease; 4) whether Defendant has knowingly employed policies and practices \nthat unjustifiably delay or deny treatment for HCV;  5) whether Defendant has \npermitted cost considerations to improperly interfere with the treatment of \nHCV; 6) whether HCV is a disability under the ADA; 7) whether medical \n-35- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 36 of 51\nservices in prison are a program or service under the ADA; and 8) whether \nDefendant has discriminated against FDC prisoners with HCV on the basis of \ntheir  disability  by  categorically  denying  them  medical  treatment,  while \nproviding treatment for other diseases and conditions such as HIV. \nc. Typicality. The claims or defenses of the class representatives are typical \nof the claims or defenses of the class.  The class representatives have been \ndiagnosed with chronic HCV but have been refused treatment, and suffer from \nthe same kind of complications and substantial risk of serious harm that the \nclass members suffer from.  \nd. Adequacy.  The  class  representatives  and  class  counsel  will  fairly  and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.  The class representatives are \ncommitted  to  obtaining  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  that  will  benefit \nthemselves as well as the class by ending Defendant’s unconstitutional policy \nand practice.  Their interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the \ninterests of the class.  They have a strong personal interest in the outcome of \nthis case and have no conflicts with class members.  They are represented by \nexperienced counsel who specialize in civil rights and class action litigation on \nbehalf of prisoners.    \n-36- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 37 of 51\n143.  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are satisfied, as the party opposing \nthe class has acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class so \nthat final declaratory and injunctive relief would be appropriate to the class as a \nwhole. Injunctive relief will end the policy and practice for all class members, \nallowing them to receive proper medical evaluation and treatment for HCV. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nCOUNT I \nEighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nvia 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n144.  Defendant and its policymakers know about and enforce the policies \nand practices described herein.  Defendant and its policymakers know of Plaintiffs’ \nand the Plaintiff Class’s serious medical needs, yet Defendant has intentionally \nfailed and refused to provide treatment that will address those serious medical needs, \nknowing that those actions have resulted, and will continue to result, in Plaintiffs \nand the Plaintiff Class’s continued suffering and exposure to liver failure and its \nsymptoms, liver cancer, and death.  \n145.  Defendant has caused the wanton infliction of pain upon FDC prisoners \nwith HCV, and has exhibited deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of \nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.    \n-37- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 38 of 51\n146.  Defendant knows, and has known, of the substantial risk of serious \nharm, and actual harms, faced by FDC prisoners with chronic HCV. Yet Defendant \nhas disregarded, and continues to disregard, those risks and harms by failing to \nprovide the very medication that would alleviate those risks and harms.  Defendant \nhas been deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of serious harm to FDC \nprisoners with chronic HCV. \n147.  By denying Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class their medically needed \nHCV treatment, Defendant has imposed punishment far in excess of that authorized \nby law, contrary to the Eighth Amendment. \n148.  Defendant’s denial of Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class’s medically \nnecessary HCV treatment violates all standards of decency, contrary to the Eighth \nAmendment. \n149.  Defendant’s actions with respect to Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class \namount to grossly inadequate care. \n150.  Defendant’s actions with respect to Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class is \nmedical care so cursory as to amount to no medical care at all. \n151.  As a direct and proximate cause of this pattern, practice, policy, and \ndeliberate indifference, Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have suffered, and continue \n-38- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 39 of 51\nto suffer from harm and violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. These harms \nwill continue unless enjoined by this Court. \nCOUNT II \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq. \n \n152.  This count is brought under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. and 42. U.S.C. § 12131 – 12134, and its \nimplementing regulations. \n153.  Defendant FDC is a “public entity” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n154.  All Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have chronic HCV, which is a \nphysiological disorder or condition that affects one or more body systems, including \nbut  not  limited  to  the  digestive,  gastrointestinal,  immune,  circulatory, \ncardiovascular, and hemic systems, and is therefore a physical impairment.  42 \nU.S.C. § 12102(1) & (2); 28 C.F.R. § 35.108(a) & (b).  This physical impairment \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity, including but not limited to \neating, walking, bending, lifting, concentrating, thinking, and communicating; the \noperation of major bodily functions such as digestive, gastrointestinal, immune, \ncirculatory, cardiovascular, and hemic systems; and the operation of the liver.   42 \nU.S.C. § 12102(2); 28 C.F.R. § 35.108(c).    \n-39- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 40 of 51\n155.  All  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff  Class  have  a  record  of  having  an \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity, as they have a \nhistory  of  such  an  impairment.    42  U.S.C.  §  12102(1)(B);  28  C.F.R.  § \n35.108(a)(1)(ii) & (e).   \n156.  All Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are regarded by FDC as has having \nan impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity, as FDC \nperceives them as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(C) & (3); 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.108(a)(1)(iii) & (f).  Defendant FDC has subjected them to a prohibited \naction because of an actual or perceived physical impairment.   \n157.  All Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are qualified individuals with a \ndisability because they meet the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of \nservices or the participation in programs or activities provided by FDC, including \nbut not limited to medical services.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  \n158.  By  withholding  medical  treatment  from  those  with  HCV,  but  not \nwithholding medical treatment from those with other disabilities or those who are \nnot  disabled,  Defendant  FDC  excludes  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff  Class  from \nparticipation  in,  and  denies  them  the  benefits  of  FDC  services,  programs,  and \nactivities (such as medical services), by reason of their disability.  42 U.S.C. § 12132; \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a).  \n-40- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 41 of 51\n159.  By  withholding  medical  treatment  from  those  with  HCV,  but  not \nwithholding medical treatment from those with other disabilities or those who are \nnot  disabled,  Defendant  FDC  subjects  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff  Class  to \ndiscrimination.  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a).   \n160.  Defendant FDC fails to provide Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class with \nequal access and enjoyment of effective medical services.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n161.  Defendant FDC utilizes criteria or methods of administration that have \nthe effect of subjecting Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class to discrimination and that \ndefeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of medical treatment \nfor HCV. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3).   \n162.  Defendant has known about the violations noted herein but has failed \nto correct them, thereby exhibiting deliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs \nand the Plaintiff Class. \n163.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  these  actions  and  omissions, \nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have suffered and continue to suffer from harm and \nviolation of their ADA rights.  These harms will continue unless enjoined by this \nCourt. \n \n \n-41- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 42 of 51\nCOUNT III \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 791 – 794a \n \n164.

Defendant FDC subjects Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class—all qualified \nindividuals with disabilities—to discrimination. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n168.  Defendant FDC denies Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class—all qualified \nhandicapped persons—the opportunity accorded others to participate in programs or \nactivities. 28 C.F.R. § 42.503(b)(1). \n169.  Defendant FDC utilizes criteria or methods of administration that either \npurposely  or  in  effect  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  handicap,  and  defeat  or \nsubstantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of Defendant’s programs or \nactivities with respect to handicapped persons. 28 C.F.R. § 42.503(b)(3). \n-42- \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 05/11/17   Page 43 of 51\n170.

Docket\nNo. 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS.\nErica A. Selig, Raymond J. Taseff, Dante Pasquale Trevisani, Florida Justice Institute,\nMiami, FL, for Plaintiffs-Appellees.\nAmit Agarwal, Karen Ann Brodeen, Ashley Moody, James Hamilton Percival, II, Office of the\nAttorney General, Tallahassee, FL, Albert J. Bowden, III, Bowden Law Firm, LLC,\nTallahassee, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.\nBefore MARTIN, NEWSOM, and BALDOCK,[*] Circuit Judges.\n1266\n*1266 NEWSOM, Circuit Judge.\nThis case principally presents the question whether the Eighth Amendment requires Florida\nprison officials to treat all inmates with chronic Hepatitis C—including those who have only\nmild (or no) liver fibrosis—with expensive, state-of-the-art \"direct acting antiviral\" (DAA)\ndrugs. The district court held that it does and entered a permanent injunction mandating\nacross-the-board DAA treatment. We hold, to the contrary, that the officials' current\ntreatment plan—pursuant to which they monitor all HCV-positive inmates, including those\nwho have yet to exhibit serious symptoms, and provide DAAs to anyone who has an\nexacerbating condition, shows signs of rapid progression, or develops even moderate\nfibrosis—satisfies constitutional requirements. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's\ndecision, vacate its injunction, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n1267\nI\n*1267\nA\nHepatitis C—here, HCV—is a bloodborne virus that is commonly spread, among other\nmeans, by sharing contaminated needles, utilizing unsterilized tattoo equipment, and\nengaging in risky sexual behavior. Only about 1% of the general population suffers from the\ndisease, but its prevalence among prison inmates is much higher. Although estimates vary,\nit's safe to say that thousands—and quite possibly tens of thousands—of inmates confined\nin Florida state prisons have HCV.\nHCV primarily attacks the liver and, in particular, can cause liver scarring, or \"fibrosis.\" Liver\nfibrosis can be measured, or staged, on a five-step scale, in ascending order of severity,\nfrom F0 (no fibrosis) to F1 (mild fibrosis) to F2 (moderate fibrosis) to F3 (severe fibrosis) to\nF4 (cirrhosis). Fortunately, many people afflicted with HCV will \"spontaneously clear\" the\nvirus without treatment. At least 50% of HCV cases, though, are \"chronic,\" meaning that\nthey can be cured only with medication. Among chronic HCV patients, the disease's rate of\nprogression varies: 30% are stable, meaning that they aren't currently moving up the\nfibrosis scale; 40% progress slowly, taking several years to advance from one level to\nanother and more than 20 years to reach full-blown cirrhosis; and 30% progress rapidly,\nreaching cirrhosis in fewer than 20 years and possibly as few as one.\nIn years past, HCV patients were prescribed Interferon, a weekly injectable medication that\nhad a number of drawbacks —among them that it required patients to remain sober, caused\nseveral unpleasant side effects, and succeeded in eradicating the virus only about 30% of\nthe time. In 2013, a new HCV treatment option arrived on the scene—direct acting\nantivirals. These DAAs brought great promise—the once- or twice-daily pills were easily\nadministrable, had few side effects, and boasted a 95% cure rate. Unfortunately, and not\nsurprisingly, they also came at great cost. Although the parties dispute the exact price tag of\na single 12-week course of DAA treatment—in 2017, the Secretary put it between $25,000\nand $37,000 per inmate, while the plaintiffs insisted that discounts and rebates reduced that\ncost—all agree that DAAs are very expensive.\nB\nIn May 2017, Carl Hoffer, Ronald McPherson, and Roland Molina—chronic —HCV inmates\nincarcerated in Florida prisons —sued the Secretary of the Florida Department of\nCorrections on behalf of a putative class in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Florida. Among other claims, the plaintiffs alleged, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nthat the Secretary's HCV treatment plan—or, at the time, the lack thereof—was deliberately\nindifferent to inmates' serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. As\nparticularly relevant here, the plaintiffs sought a class-wide injunction requiring the FDC to\n\"develop and adhere to a plan to provide direct-acting antiviral medication to all FDC\nprisoners with chronic HCV, consistent with the standard of care.\"\nNot long after the plaintiffs filed, the Secretary hired Dr. Daniel Dewsnup to formulate a\ntreatment plan for HCV-infected inmates. Dr. Dewsnup, who had earlier developed and\nimplemented a similar HCV-treatment plan for the Oregon prison system, recommended\ntreating some inmates with DAAs, but not all of them. In particular, he proposed (1)\nproviding DAAs for all inmates at level F2 and above and (2) monitoring F0- and F1-level\ninmates and treating them with DAAs if they (a) have or develop an exacerbating\n1268\n*1268 condition like HIV, (b) exhibit signs of rapid fibrosis progression, or (c) advance to F2.\nThe Secretary adopted Dr. Dewsnup's recommendations.\nIn October 2017, the district court held a five-day evidentiary hearing, which featured Dr.\nDewsnup and the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Margaret Koziel. The experts testified concerning a\nrange of topics, but for present purposes our focus is on their dueling conclusions regarding\nthe necessity of treating HCV-positive inmates who show little or no liver scarring—i.e.,\nthose at levels F0 and F1 on the fibrosis scale.\nDr. Koziel \"advocate[d]\" in favor of treating all HCV-positive inmates with DAAs—even, she\nsaid, F0-level inmates, who have \"no fibrosis.\" Her view, she said, comports with guidelines\npublished by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious\nDiseases Society of America, which recommend DAA treatment for all chronic HCV\npatients, regardless of staging. Dr. Koziel further testified that \"there are clearcut economic\nbenefits to treating all-comers with Hepatitis C\"—in particular, she reported that one paper\nshe had recently reviewed estimated that \"the U.S. health system would save about $13\nbillion by treating everybody.\"\nRegarding medical outcomes, though, Dr. Koziel was more circumspect. As particularly\nrelevant here, the district court judge asked her the following question: \"[I]n terms of\nscoring, F0 to F4, ... what's the tipping point where suddenly [a patient's] chance of getting\ncancer is dramatically much greater [or his] chance of permanent damage in terms of liver\nfunction... is greater?\" Dr. Koziel began her response by stating that \"there is some\nincreased risk of mortality even in the earlier stages\" and emphasizing that she \"will always\nadvocate for people.\" \"But,\" she went on, \"when I really, really start to get agitated ... is\nabout at F3, and that's when people really get into the irreversible complications because\n[of] the amount of scar tissue, and at that point I can no longer say to you that we are going\nto make you completely whole again.\" Even so, Dr. Koziel reiterated later in her testimony\nthat her job as a physician \"is to advocate for the best medical care\" and agreed with the\n\ndistrict court that \"treating everyone who has [HCV] with DAA medication is the best\npossible management.\"\nFor his part, Dr. Dewsnup opined that F0- and F1-level inmates \"don't need to be treated\nimmediately\" but, rather, \"can be deferred.\" Usually, he said, the FDC only \"see[s] them for\na few years.\" At the same time, he recognized that it's different for \"lifetime prisoners,\"\nwhom the FDC is \"going to have to treat eventually even if they are Stage 0 or Stage 1.\" Dr.\nDewsnup also explained that the evidence concerning the relationship between the\neradication of HCV and F0-and F1-level inmates' \"mortality rates\" may suffer from\nconfounding; he acknowledged Interferon-era studies that suggest a correlation between\nthe two, but clarified that \"[w]e don't have the scientific data that say[s] that it's the viral\neradication that does it.\" The reason, he said, is because Interferon treatment required\npatients \"to make huge lifestyle changes\"—in particular, \"[t]hey had to be sober.\" Because\n\"substance abuse ... [is] the major reason\" that HCV-positive inmates die, Dr. Dewsnup\ndidn't believe that the correlation between Interferon treatment for F0s and F1s and\ndecreased mortality rates established the necessary causal link.\nShortly after the hearing, the district court certified a plaintiff class of \"all current and future\nprisoners in FDC custody who have been, or will be, diagnosed with chronic HCV\" and\nentered a preliminary injunction. \"[W]ith limited exceptions,\" the court ordered the FDC to\n\"compl[y] with\n1269\n*1269 its own expert's recommendations\" and to \"formulate a plan\" to ensure the treatment\nof HCV-positive inmates in accordance with a specified schedule. Later, having received the\nSecretary's plan, the court ordered DAA treatment for prisoners with decompensated\ncirrhosis (i.e., liver failure) within about a month, prisoners with F4-level cirrhosis within six\nmonths, and prisoners with F2 (moderate) and F3 (severe) fibrosis within about a year. The\ncourt's preliminary-injunction order did not require DAA treatment for F0- and F1-level\ninmates unless they had an exacerbating condition.\nSeveral months later, the Secretary moved for summary judgment—in essence, against\nhimself—seeking to make the district court's preliminary injunction permanent. As\nparticularly relevant here, the Secretary reiterated his position that the Eighth Amendment\ndoesn't require immediate DAA treatment of all F0- and F1-level inmates. As a general\nmatter, the Secretary proposed to monitor F0s and F1s, to schedule infirmary visits and lab\ntests every six months, and, if necessary, to re-stage their fibrosis annually. F0s and F1s\nwould be put on DAAs, however, if they (1) had or developed an exacerbating condition, (2)\nshowed signs of rapid progression, or (3) advanced to F2. The plaintiffs cross-moved for\nsummary judgment, seeking 15 additional forms of relief, all of which the Secretary\nopposed. Most significantly for present purposes, the plaintiffs asked the court to require the\nSecretary to provide DAA treatment for all F0- and F1-level patients, regardless of\nunderlying comorbidities or the pace of disease progression.\n\nThe district court granted the plaintiffs' summary-judgment motion in substantial part,\ndenying or altering only a few of their additional requests, and entered a permanent\ninjunction. See Hoffer v. Inch, 382 F. Supp. 3d 1288 (N.D. Fla. 2019). As relevant here, the\ninjunction requires the Secretary to treat all F0- and F1-level inmates with DAAs. In its\norder, the district court found that the Secretary \"ha[d] not put forth any medical reason (nor\ndoes the record otherwise reveal a medical reason) why F0 and F1 inmates should not be\ntreated.\" Id. at 1302. Instead, the court agreed with the plaintiffs that \"[t]he only reason why\n[the Secretary] is electing not to provide treatment\" to F0 and F1 patients \"is due to the cost\nof treatment, which is per se deliberate indifference.\" Id. (first alteration in original)\n(quotation omitted). Accordingly, the court ordered the Secretary to begin DAA treatment of\nall F0s and F1s within two years of their initial staging. Id. at 1302-03.\nToward the end of its order, the district court included the following one-sentence paragraph,\naddressing its obligation to ensure that the injunction complied with the Prison Litigation\nReform Act:\nFinally, the permanent injunction satisfies the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\")\nbecause it is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to effect the changes this\nCourt concludes are constitutionally required, and is the least intrusive means of effecting\nsuch changes.\nId. at 1315 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)).\n* * *\nThe Secretary now appeals the district court's summary-judgment order and accompanying\ninjunction, arguing (1) that his plan for monitoring F0- and F1-level inmates, and treating\nthem with DAAs if they develop an exacerbating condition, exhibit rapid disease\nprogression, or advance to F2, does not violate the Eighth Amendment, and (2) that the\ndistrict court's PLRA-related findings were not sufficiently particularized.[1]\n1270\nII\n*1270\nA\nThe Eighth Amendment forbids the \"inflict[ion]\" of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" U.S.\nConst. amend. VIII. And the Supreme Court has held that because the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause prohibits \"the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\" it also\nprohibits \"deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners.\" Estelle v. Gamble,\n\n429 U.S. 97, 103-04, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (quotation omitted). \"Federal and\nstate governments therefore have a constitutional obligation to provide minimally adequate\nmedical care to those whom they are punishing by incarceration.\" Harris v. Thigpen, 941\nF.2d 1495, 1504 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\"To show that a prison official acted with deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, a\nplaintiff must satisfy both an objective and a subjective inquiry.\" Farrow v. West, 320 F.3d\n1235, 1243 (11th Cir. 2003). To meet the first prong, the plaintiff must demonstrate an\n\"objectively serious medical need\"—i.e., \"one that has been diagnosed by a physician as\nmandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily\nrecognize the necessity for a doctor's attention,\" and, in either instance, \"one that, if left\nunattended, poses a substantial risk of serious harm.\" Id. (alteration adopted) (quotations\nomitted). To satisfy the second, subjective prong, the plaintiff must prove that the prison\nofficials \"acted with deliberate indifference to [his serious medical] need.\" Harper v.\nLawrence Cty., 592 F.3d 1227, 1234 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \"To establish\ndeliberate indifference,\" a plaintiff must demonstrate that the prison officials \"(1) had\nsubjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregarded that risk; and (3) acted with\nmore than gross negligence.\" Id. (quotation omitted).[2] An inmate-plaintiff bears the burden\nto establish both prongs. Goebert v. Lee Cty., 510 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir. 2007).\nB\nThe Secretary seems to concede (we think wisely) that chronic HCV is, at least as a general\nmatter, a \"serious medical need\" within the meaning of our precedents. See Reply Br. at 5\nn.5. And although the parties spar over the subsidiary question whether chronic HCV\nconstitutes\n1271\n*1271 a condition \"that, if left unattended, poses a substantial risk of serious harm\" to F0-\nand F1-level inmates, Farrow, 320 F.3d at 1243, we find that it is unnecessary to address\nthat issue. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that even if the plaintiffs could satisfy\nthe objective prong of the two-part Eighth Amendment standard, they haven't shown that\nthe Secretary's response to F0- and F1-level inmates' medical needs was deliberately\nindifferent in the subjective sense—in particular, that the Secretary \"acted with more than\ngross negligence.\" Harper, 592 F.3d at 1234.[3]\n1\nWe think it worth reiterating at the outset the stringency of the deliberate-indifference\nstandard—because, it seems to us, the district court here lost track of it and impermissibly\nevaluated the Secretary's treatment plan against a negligence (or perhaps even more\n\nlenient) benchmark. It's an easy enough mistake to make: Confronted with an inmate who\nhas a serious medical condition, a reviewing court hears from experts about measures that\n(in their view) would provide the most effective treatment. When the court then sees\nevidence that prison authorities aren't taking those measures—that perhaps they could be\ndoing more, doing better—it concludes that liability must presumably follow.\nIntuitive as that line of thinking may be—especially for lawyers and judges educated and\ntrained in the common-law tradition—it does not reflect the constitutional standard. As we\nrecently reiterated, \"deliberate indifference is not a constitutionalized version of\ncommon-law negligence.\" Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1287-88 (11th Cir. 2020). \"To the\ncontrary, we (echoing the Supreme Court) have been at pains to emphasize that `the\ndeliberate indifference standard ... is far more onerous than normal tort-based standards of\nconduct sounding in negligence,' and is in fact akin to `subjective recklessness as used in\nthe criminal law.'\" Id. (quoting, respectively, Goodman v. Kimbrough, 718 F.3d 1325, 1332\n(11th Cir. 2013), and Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 839-40, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d\n811 (1994)). With respect to prisoners' medical care, in particular, we have held that the\nEighth Amendment doesn't require it to be \"perfect, the best obtainable, or even very good.\"\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1510 (quotation omitted). Rather, we have emphasized, \"[m]edical\ntreatment violates the [E]ighth [A]mendment only when it is so grossly incompetent,\ninadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental\nfairness.\" Id. at 1505 (quotation omitted).\nThe question here, therefore, isn't whether, in the best of all possible worlds,\n1272\n*1272 F0- and F1-level HCV-positive inmates should receive treatment with DAAs. Nor is it\nwhether, if we were doctors, we would prescribe DAAs to all F0 and F1 patients. Nor, for\nthat matter, is it even whether, if we were sitting as a common-law court, we might conclude\nthat ordinary prudence requires across-the-board DAA treatment. Rather, because the\nplaintiffs here have invoked the Eighth Amendment, the sole question before us is whether\nthe Secretary's approach to the treatment of F0- and F1-level inmates is so reckless—so\nconscience-shocking—that it violates the Constitution. As explained below, it is not.\n2\nWe should first recap briefly what the Secretary's treatment plan is. For starters, the\nSecretary treats all HCV-positive inmates at the F2 level and above with DAAs. Among\nthose at the F0 and F1 levels, the Secretary monitors their conditions and provides DAA\ntreatment to those who either (1) have an exacerbating illness, such as HIV, (2) exhibit\nsigns of rapid fibrosis progression, or (3) advance to F2.\n\nSo, to be clear—and contrary to misimpressions that the district court's opinion might leave,\nsee Hoffer, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 1302-03—the Secretary isn't refusing or denying medical\ncare to any HCV-positive inmate. He may not be providing F0- and F1-level inmates the\nparticular course of treatment that they and their experts want—or as quickly as they want\nit—but he isn't turning a blind eye, either.\nTwo fundamental considerations— both of which reflect the steep hill that\ndeliberate-indifference plaintiffs must climb—combine to demonstrate that the Secretary's\ntreatment of F0- and F1-level patients is neither criminally reckless nor\nconscience-shocking. First, we have recognized that \"[w]here a prisoner has received some\nmedical attention and the dispute is over the adequacy of the treatment, federal courts are\ngenerally reluctant to second guess medical judgments and to constitutionalize claims\nwhich sound in state tort law.\" Harris, 941 F.2d at 1507 (quoting Westlake v. Lucas, 537 F.2d\n857, 860 n.5 (6th Cir. 1976)); accord, e.g., Hamm v. DeKalb Cty., 774 F.2d 1567, 1575 (11th\nCir. 1985) (\"Although [the inmate] may have desired different modes of treatment, the care\nthe jail provided did not amount to deliberate indifference.\"). Here, as already explained, the\nSecretary is providing \"some medical attention\" to F0- and F1-level inmates—diagnosing\ntheir illnesses, assessing their risk of future harm, and regularly monitoring and managing\ntheir disease progression. The plaintiffs' complaint isn't that the Secretary is providing no\ncare, just that he isn't providing the more aggressive—and they say better— care that they\ndesire.\nTo be clear, \"some medical attention\" doesn't necessarily demand curative care. Rather,\nmedical intervention exists along a spectrum. At one end is ignoring medical needs entirely,\nwhich our decisions have rightly and repeatedly condemned: \"`Choosing to deliberately\ndisregard' an inmate's complaints of pain `without any investigation or inquiry,'\" we have\nheld, constitutes deliberate indifference. Taylor v. Hughes, 920 F.3d 729, 734 (11th Cir.\n2019) (quoting Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1328). The plaintiffs here, understandably, demand\ncare at the other end of the spectrum —a prompt and an effective, albeit expensive, cure.\nThere is, though, a range of responsible treatment options between the two poles that will\nsatisfy the Eighth Amendment.\nConsider an inmate with kidney disease. Surely the Constitution doesn't require prison\nauthorities to schedule an immediate transplant, even though that might be the most\neffective, and permanent, solution. Rather, even for an inmate with end-stage\n1273\n*1273 renal disease, a regular course of dialysis treatments would doubtlessly pass\nconstitutional muster. And for those whose condition hasn't progressed to near-complete\nkidney failure, even less aggressive measures—say, monitoring and managing diet and\nexercise—would presumably suffice. Or consider an inmate in the early stages of\nprogressive hearing loss. Prison authorities needn't jump straight to cochlear implants, or\neven hearing aids. At least for a spell—until his condition worsens, anyway—the inmate\n\nmay have to content himself with asking people to speak up. The long and short of it is that\ndiagnosing, monitoring, and managing conditions —even where a complete cure may be\navailable—will often meet the \"minimally adequate medical care\" standard that the Eighth\nAmendment imposes. Harris, 941 F.2d at 1504.\nSecond, and relatedly, we have emphasized—as have our sister circuits— that \"a simple\ndifference in medical opinion between the prison's medical staff and the inmate as to the\nlatter's diagnosis or course of treatment [fails to] support a claim of cruel and unusual\npunishment.\" Id. at 1505; accord, e.g., Lamb v. Norwood, 899 F.3d 1159, 1162 (10th Cir.\n2018) (\"We have consistently held that prison officials do not act with deliberate indifference\nwhen they provide medical treatment even if it is subpar or different from what the inmate\nwants.\"); Kosilek v. Spencer, 774 F.3d 63, 82 (1st Cir. 2014) (en banc) (\"[The Eighth\nAmendment] does not impose upon prison administrators a duty to provide care that is\nideal, or of the prisoner's choosing.\"). That, at bottom, is exactly what we have here. The\nplaintiffs' expert, Dr. Koziel, opined that all F0- and F1-level inmates should be treated with\nDAAs, regardless of underlying condition or disease progression.[4] The Secretary's expert,\nDr. Dewsnup, testified, to the contrary, that it is sufficient to prescribe DAAs to inmates at\nlevel F2 and above, to monitor F0- and F1-level inmates, and to provide DAAs to F0s and\nF1s who either have underlying co-conditions or whose disease seems to be progressing\nrapidly.\nBecause the plaintiffs here are receiving medical care—and because the adequacy of that\ncare is the subject of genuine, good-faith disagreement between healthcare\nprofessionals—we are hard-pressed to find that the Secretary has acted in so reckless and\nconscience-shocking a manner as to have violated the Constitution. \"Measured against\nconstitutional minima,\" the Secretary's plan \"evidence[s] at least tolerable and responsive\nmedical treatment.\" Harris, 941 F.2d at 1507\nC\nIn just two short pages, the district court reached the opposite conclusion. It did so\nprincipally on two bases. First, the court accepted the plaintiffs' contention that \"[t]he only\nreason why FDC is electing not to provide [DAA] treatment is due to the cost of treatment,\nwhich is per se\n1274\n*1274 deliberate indifference.\" Hoffer, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 1302 (alteration in original)\n(quotation omitted). And second, it emphasized that the \"FDC has not put forth any medical\nreason (nor does the record otherwise reveal a medical reason) why F0 and F1 inmates\nshould not be treated.\" Id.\n\nWe conclude that the district court erred on both counts. We take up its errors in reverse\norder, because the second—concerning the Secretary's supposed failure to demonstrate a\nmedical basis for declining DAA treatment for F0s and F1s—is easy to explain, while the\nfirst—regarding the role of \"cost\" in a deliberate-indifference analysis—will take bit of\nunpacking.\n1\nSo first, the easy(ish) part. In stating that the Secretary \"ha[d] not put forth any medical\nreason ... why F0 and F1 inmates should not be treated,\" the district court triply erred. As an\ninitial matter, the court impermissibly flipped the burden of proof. Our precedent is clear that\nan inmate bears the burden of proving all aspects of his Eighth Amendment claim—as\nrelevant here, he \"must satisfy the subjective component by showing that the prison official\nacted with deliberate indifference to h[is] serious medical need.\" Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1326;\naccord, e.g., Hill v. Dekalb Reg'l Youth Ctr., 40 F.3d 1176, 1190 (11th Cir. 1994) (noting that\nthe plaintiff \"submitted no medical evidence explaining how the four-hour delay in taking\n[him] to the hospital detrimented or worsened his medical condition\"), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). So it\nwasn't the Secretary's burden to demonstrate that treatment of F0s and F1s isn't medically\nnecessary; it was the plaintiffs' burden to prove that such treatment is necessary. See H.C.\nby Hewett v. Jarrard, 786 F.2d 1080, 1086 (11th Cir. 1986) (\"[T]he failure to provide\ndiagnostic care and medical treatment known to be necessary [i]s deliberate\nindifference.\").[5]\nTo compound matters, in connection with its determination that the Secretary had failed to\ndischarge its phantom burden, the district court misconstrued Dr. Dewsnup's testimony in\ntwo key respects. First, immediately after faulting the Secretary for \"not put[ting] forth any\nmedical reason\" for delaying DAA treatment for F0- and F1-level inmates, the court stated\nthat Dr. Dewsnup had \"explicitly noted... [that] F0 and F1 inmates must be treated\neventually\"—thereby implying that even the Secretary's own expert believed that medical\nconsiderations counsel in favor of treating all inmates. Hoffer, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 1302.\nContext, though, reveals the district court's error. As already explained, what Dr. Dewsnup\nactually said was (1) that in the main, F0s and F1s \"don't need to be treated immediately\"\nand instead \"can be deferred,\" but (2) that \"there are others who are lifetime prisoners that\n... [the FDC is] going to have to\n1275\n*1275 treat eventually even if they are Stage 0 or Stage 1.\" In context, it's clear that Dr.\nDewsnup simply meant to acknowledge that many inmates who are currently at F0 or F1\nwill, if they remain incarcerated long enough, \"eventually\" progress to F2 and need DAA\ntreatment.\n\nSecond, and even more conspicuously, as part of the same discussion, the district court\nemphasized that \"both Dr. Koziel and Dr. Dewsnup agreed that—even for F0 and F1\ninmates—successful treatment of HCV tends to decrease mortality rates.\" Hoffer, 382 F.\nSupp. 3d at 1302. That is demonstrably incorrect. In fact, Dr. Dewsnup said precisely the\nopposite. As already explained, he testified that (1) because the only available studies were\nfrom the Interferon era, when treatment required HCV patients \"to be sober,\" and (2)\nbecause \"substance abuse ... [is] the major reason\" that HCV-positive inmates die, there is\nsimply no way to know whether it was the HCV treatment, the \"huge lifestyle changes\" that\nthe Interferon regimen required, or some combination of the two that led to a decrease in\nmortality rates.\nFor all these reasons—legal and factual —we conclude that the district court erred in\nconcluding that the Secretary had somehow failed to prove a medical justification for\ndelaying DAA treatment to F0- and F1-level inmates.\n2\nNow for the tougher part—the role of \"cost.\" Again, although the parties squabble over the\nexact price of a single DAA course of treatment—the Secretary pegged it at between\n$25,000 and $37,000 per inmate in 2017, while the plaintiffs insisted that it was lower as a\nresult of discounts and rebates—there is no dispute that DAAs are expensive. The parties'\nreal debate is over the legal questions whether, at what point, and to what extent the cost of\na particular medical treatment should factor into an Eighth Amendment\ndeliberate-indifference analysis.\nAs already noted, the district court agreed with the plaintiffs that \"[t]he only reason why FDC\nis electing not to provide [DAA] treatment is due to the cost of treatment, which is per se\ndeliberate indifference.\" Hoffer, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 1302 (alteration in original) (quotation\nomitted). On appeal, the parties can't even agree on how to interpret the court's order. For\nhis part, the Secretary complains that the district court here improperly held that\n\"consideration of the `cost of treatment' in making medical decisions is `per se deliberate\nindifference.'\" Br. of Appellant at 16. In response, the plaintiffs insist that the district court\nmerely—and properly—held that \"[t]he Eighth Amendment prohibits the refusal of medical\ntreatment solely because of costs.\" Br. of Appellees at 22. Because the issue of cost has\nbecome such a bone of contention in this case—and because the district court's decision\nand the parties' arguments reflect confusion about the meaning and application of our\nprecedent—we will examine it in some detail.\nThe contest over cost's proper place in a deliberate-indifference analysis centers on our\ndecision in Harris v. Thigpen. There, in the course of rejecting Eighth Amendment claims\nbrought by HIV-positive inmates, the panel offered the following observations in dicta:\n\n[W]e are troubled by and reject any suggestion ... that a state's comparative wealth might\naffect an HIV-infected prisoner's right to constitutionally adequate medical care. We do not\nagree that \"financial considerations must be considered in determining the reasonableness\"\nof inmates' medical care to the extent that such a rationale could ever be used by so-called\n\"poor states\" to\n1276\n*1276 deny a prisoner the minimally adequate care to which he or she is entitled.\n941 F.2d at 1509.\nWe agree with the Secretary that nothing in Harris—or in any of our other\ndecisions—precludes prison authorities from \"consider[ing] ... the cost of treatment in\nmaking medical decisions.\" Br. of Appellant at 16 (quotation omitted). Although we have\nnever had occasion to say so expressly, other courts have recognized the commonsense\nnotion that \"the civilized minimum\" level of care required by the Eighth Amendment \"is a\nfunction both of objective need and cost.\" Ralston v. McGovern, 167 F.3d 1160, 1162 (7th\nCir. 1999).[6] Need and cost are correlated, such that the more serious and exigent an\ninmate's need, the more likely it is that \"the civilized minimum\" might be deemed to require\nexpensive treatment—and vice versa. See id.\nThe First Circuit's recently addressed this very issue in Zingg v. Groblewski, 907 F.3d 630\n(1st Cir. 2018). There, an inmate suffering from severe psoriasis asked prison officials to\ngive her Humira, an injectable \"systemic treatment that targets the immune system,\" which\nshe had been taking before her detention and to which she had responded well. Id. at 633.\nThe prison officials denied her requests, treating her instead—and unsuccessfully—with\ntopical steroids. See id. Eventually, after the inmate's psoriasis continued to deteriorate, the\nofficials approved treatment with Humira, which led to \"significant improvement in her\ncondition.\" Id. The inmate sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that by delaying the\nauthorization of Humira, the officials had acted with deliberate indifference in violation of the\nEighth Amendment. Id. at 634. The district court granted summary judgment for the officials,\nand the inmate appealed. Id.\nAs particularly relevant here, the First Circuit addressed the inmate's contention that a jury\ncould find that the prison officials \"denied Humira because of its cost and that such a finding\nwould suffice to permit a jury to find that [the prison officials were] deliberately indifferent to\nher serious medical needs.\" Id. at 638. For support, the inmate cited evidence, for instance,\nthat Humira \"is an expensive medication,\" that \"cost containment was important to\" prison\nadministrators, and, indeed, that she had been told—point blank—that \"Humira would not\nbe approved because of its high cost.\" Id. Notwithstanding that smoking-gun evidence, the\nFirst Circuit rejected the inmate's legal argument: \"We are not aware of any authority ... to\nsupport the proposition that there is a per se Eighth Amendment prohibition against\n\ncorrections officials considering cost, even when considered only in the course of selecting\ntreatment that is aimed at attending to an incarcerated person's serious medical needs.\" Id.\nWe agree. Indeed, the law could hardly be otherwise. It is surely uncontroversial that \"the\ndeliberate indifference standard... does not guarantee prisoners the right to be entirely free\nfrom the cost considerations that figure in the medical-care decisions made by most\nnon-prisoners in our society.\" Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F.3d 166, 175 (3d Cir. 1997) (Alito,\nJ.). Every minute of every day, ordinary Americans forgo or delay beneficial—and even\nlife-altering —medical treatment because it's\n1277\n*1277 just too expensive. A couple decides to pass on in vitro fertilization in favor of less\nexpensive (if also less effective) fertility treatment. A woman suffering from an autoimmune\ncondition postpones an intravenous-immunoglobulin infusion because her insurance hasn't\ncome through. Parents opt to delay reconstructive surgery for a physically disabled child.\nHealthcare can be expensive—sadly, sometimes prohibitively so. What a topsy-turvy world\nit would be if incarcerated inmates were somehow immune from that cold—and sometimes\ncruel—reality. See Maggert v. Hanks, 131 F.3d 670, 671 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"A prison is not\nrequired by the Eighth Amendment to give a prisoner medical care that is as good as he\nwould receive if he were a free person, let alone an affluent free person.\").\nSo, to be clear, the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit prison officials from considering\ncost in determining what type (or level) of medical care inmates should receive. Nor,\ncorrelatively, are cost considerations off-limits to reviewing courts charged with determining\nwhether prison officials have acted in so reckless and conscience-shocking a manner as to\nviolate the Constitution.\nNow, having said that, our cases do recognize an outer limit. While it is clear that cost can\n(and often will) be a relevant criterion in determining what the Eighth Amendment requires\nin a particular circumstance —what \"minimally adequate care\" entails in the first instance,\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1509—it is also clear that cost can never be an absolute defense to what\nthe Constitution otherwise requires. Put differently, if a particular course of treatment is\nindeed essential to \"minimally adequate care,\" prison authorities can't plead poverty as an\nexcuse for refusing to provide it. See, e.g., Anderson v. City of Atlanta, 778 F.2d 678, 688\nn.14 (11th Cir. 1985) (\"Lack of funds for facilities cannot justify an unconstitutional lack of\ncompetent medical care or treatment of inmates.\").\nBut importantly, that outer-limit principle itself has limits. Cost isn't a sufficient excuse for\nfailing to provide \"minimally adequate care\" only (and precisely) because \"minimally\nadequate care\" is—as Harris itself repeatedly emphasized and as we have reiterated\nhere—quite minimal. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1505 (observing that an inmate's \"[m]edical\ntreatment violates the [E]ighth [A]mendment only when it is so grossly incompetent,\ninadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental\n\nfairness\" (quotation omitted)). If the Constitution required prison authorities to provide all\ninmates with \"perfect, the best obtainable, or even very good\" care, id. (quotation omitted),\nthen a rule prohibiting the state from raising cost as a defense would be inconceivable—and\nunsustainable. It would also impermissibly (and perversely) create a world—already\ndiscussed and dismissed —in which incarcerated prisoners would be constitutionally\nentitled to medical care, at taxpayer expense, that many private citizens can't get; there are,\nas already explained, countless instances in which ordinary Americans forgo particular\nmedical treatments for the sole and exclusive reason that they can't afford them.\nAccordingly, the two—the constitutionally required level of care and the propriety of a cost\ndefense—necessarily go hand in hand. Here, because we have held that the Eighth\nAmendment's \"minimally adequate care\" does not require the Secretary to prescribe DAAs\nto all F0- and F1-level inmates, without respect to comorbid conditions or disease\nprogression, the issue of a cost \"defense\" never arises.\n* * *\nBecause the Secretary has implemented a treatment plan that provides \"minimally\n1278\n*1278 adequate care,\" we cannot say that his conduct is so reckless or conscience-shocking\nas to constitute deliberate indifference. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claim\nfails as a matter of law. We reverse the district court's decision inasmuch as it requires DAA\ntreatment for all F0- and F1-level inmates, vacate that portion of the injunction, and remand\nwith instructions to grant summary judgment for the Secretary on that issue.\nIII\nIn addition to requiring DAA treatment of all F0- and F1-level HCV-positive inmates, the\ndistrict court's permanent injunction also granted, in whole or in part, many of the plaintiffs'\n14 other requests for relief. Although the Secretary challenged those additional items in the\ndistrict court, he has narrowed his appeal (insofar as the Eighth Amendment is concerned)\nto the DAA issue. Even so, the Secretary maintains, with respect to all 15 items, that the\ndistrict court's single \"threadbare recitation\" that its injunction satisfied the Prison Litigation\nReform Act's narrowness, necessity, and non-intrusiveness requirements was insufficiently\nparticularized. Accordingly, he insists, we must remand so that the district court can make\n(and explain) the PLRA-mandated findings with respect to all aspects of the permanent\ninjunction other than the (now vacated) directive that all F0 and F1 inmates be treated with\nDAAs. We agree.[7]\n\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), a \"court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief\nunless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary\nto correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to\ncorrect the violation of the Federal right.\" As we have explained, § 3626(a)(1)(A) \"require[s]\nparticularized findings that each requirement imposed by the preliminary injunction satisfies\neach of the need-narrowness-intrusiveness criteria.\" United States v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of\nCorr., 778 F.3d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir. 2015). And, as we have also explained, the\nparticularity required by § 3626(a)(1)(A) is the same as that required by § 3626(b)(3), which\napplies when a district court declines to lift an injunction. See id. (\"We see no reason why\nthe term `finds' in § 3626(a)(1) does not require the same particularity as the term `findings'\nin § 3626(b)(3).\").\nIn Cason v. Seckinger, we considered § 3626(b)(3) and concluded that \"summary\nconclusion[s]\" regarding the required PLRA requirements are \"seriously deficient.\" 231 F.3d\n777, 785 (11th Cir. 2000). We explained that the PLRA \"requir[es] particularized findings, on\na provision-by-provision basis,\" meaning that \"[p]articularized findings, analysis, and\nexplanations should be made as to the application of each criteria to each requirement\nimposed.\" Id.\nThe district court's one-sentence, boilerplate paragraph here regarding PLRA compliance\nwas \"seriously deficient.\" Id. Even where, as in this case, a\n1279\n*1279 district court issues a lengthy order that carefully considers each requested form of\nrelief on the merits, it cannot just append a rote, catch-all assertion that \"the permanent\ninjunction satisfies the Prison Litigation Reform Act ... because it is narrowly drawn, extends\nno further than necessary to effect the changes this Court concludes are constitutionally\nrequired, and is the least intrusive means of effecting such changes.\" Hoffer, 382 F. Supp.\n3d at 1315. As we held in Cason, \"[i]t is not enough to simply state in conclusory fashion\nthat the requirements of the [injunction] satisfy\" the PLRA's narrowness, necessity, and\nnon-intrusiveness standards. 231 F.3d at 785. Rather, our precedent makes clear that if a\ndistrict court's injunction grants 15 separate forms of relief, the court must make—and\nexplain—15 separate PLRA-related findings.[8]\nIV\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's order inasmuch as it mandates\nDAA treatment of all F0- and F1-level HCV-positive inmates and remand to the district court\nwith instructions to award summary judgment to the Secretary on that issue. We likewise\nvacate the district court's permanent injunction to the extent that it requires such treatment.\nWe vacate the remainder of the order and injunction and remand to the district court so that\nit can make the findings required by the PLRA.\n\nOrder REVERSED IN PART, injunction VACATED IN PART, and case REMANDED.\nMARTIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nPeople who are incarcerated are stripped of \"virtually every means of self-protection\" and\nhave no \"access to outside aid.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S. Ct. 1970,\n1977, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Recognizing this, the Supreme Court told us decades ago\nthat \"prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate ... medical care, and must\ntake reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.\" Id. at 832, 114 S. Ct. at\n1976 (quotation marks omitted); see also Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S. Ct.\n285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (\"[E]lementary principles establish the\n1280\n*1280 government's obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by\nincarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the\nauthorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met.\").\nOur Court's ruling today reverses the District Court's ruling on summary judgment that found\nthe Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections (the \"Secretary\") to be deliberately\nindifferent to the medical needs of the Plaintiffs, Florida prisoners in the early stages of the\nchronic hepatitis C virus (\"cHCV\").[1] I do not share my colleagues' view of this case, and I\nwould have affirmed the District Court. Beyond that, I am concerned that recent decisions of\nthis Court will undermine the rights of our incarcerated citizens to maintain their health and\nsafety while they serve their sentences.[2]\nI take issue with four main points in the majority's deliberate indifference holding. First, the\nmajority says that the disagreement between the parties' respective experts is \"a simple\ndifference in medical opinion.\" Maj. Op. at 1273 (quotation marks omitted). In contrast, my\nreading of the expert testimony reveals more agreement than disagreement. The expert\noffered by the Secretary affirmatively acknowledged that all cHCV-positive prisoners need\ntreatment. Second, the majority concludes the Secretary \"isn't refusing or denying medical\ncare to any HCV-positive inmate.\" Id. at 1272 (emphases omitted). Yet it appears to me that\nrefusing treatment is precisely what the Secretary is doing—at least up to a certain point. It\nis not until an cHCV-positive prisoner reaches the F2 stage[3] that the Secretary provides\ntreatment. This delay in treatment ignores the progression of the disease and the underlying\ndamage that cHCV-positive prisoners experience in the meantime. Third, I think the majority\ngets it wrong when it says the District Court shifted the burden of proof from Plaintiffs to the\nSecretary. See id. at 1273-75. As someone who once wrote opinions in a busy district court,\nI say the majority's judgment rests too heavily on a single sentence in the District Court's\norder. In directing so much attention to a summary sentence, the majority opinion fails to\nacknowledge the evidence of harm Plaintiffs did present to demonstrate that treatment of\nF0- and F1-stage patients is medically necessary.\n\n1281\n*1281 Fourth, I do not agree with the discussion in Section II.C.2 relating to the Secretary's\ncost arguments. My review of the record reveals no evidence of any reason, other than\ncost, for delaying treatment to F0- and F1-stage patients. Cost may be considered in\ndetermining whether a prison official is deliberately indifferent. However, in light of the\nSecretary's years-long delay in providing treatment for cost reasons, and the evidence\nshowing the standard of care here is to treat everyone with cHCV, I would affirm the District\nCourt's finding of deliberate indifference.\nAnd generally, I do not join the majority's strict application of the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct's narrowness-need-intrusiveness requirements. It is evident when reviewing the entirety\nof District Court's order that the court made proper findings. I view the majority's decision to\nremand for the District Court to further explain its findings as elevating form over substance.\nI also think it ignores the findings the District Court has already made.\nI.\nFor years, the Florida Department of Corrections (\"FDOC\") denied Carl Hoffer, Ronald\nMcPherson, and Roland Molina, along with thousands of others, proper medical treatment\nfor their cHCV.[4] The Secretary does not dispute this fact. In an attempt to remedy this\nwrong, the District Court ordered the Secretary to provide treatment to Florida prisoners\nsuffering from cHCV. Everyone agreed that the proper standard of care was to treat\ncHCV-positive prisoners with direct acting antivirals, or DAAs.[5] So that's what the District\nCourt ordered—at least, with respect to prisoners at the more advanced stages of cHCV,\nwho needed to be prioritized in the treatment queue at the preliminary injunction stage. See\nR. 465 at 24 (explaining that Secretary's expert \"never testified that F0 and F1 inmates\nshould never be treated,\" and that his statement that \"it's safe to wait for a bit\" for the\ntreatment of F0- and F1-stage patients \"was simply made in the context of a\npreliminary-injunction hearing and faced with the need to triage thousands of inmates\").\nThis record reflects that the Secretary agreed that cHCV-positive patients must be treated\nwith DAAs, until Plaintiffs asked the District Court to order the Secretary to provide\ntreatment with DAAs to every cHCV-positive prisoner, as opposed to just the F2-, F3-, and\nF4-stage patients covered by the preliminary injunction. It was only then, when the\nSecretary realized the cost of these treatments, that this dispute arose. The Secretary\ndraws the line— in my view, arbitrarily and without support from this record—between\nprisoners at\n1282\n*1282 less-progressed stages of cHCV and prisoners at stages that have progressed further.\nSee R. 270 at 8 (The Secretary says \"the present-day standard of care is to treat cHCV\n\npatients with DAAs.... There has been no showing that delaying treatment with DAAs for\ninmates with fibrosis scores of F0 or F1, until they reach F2, will cause harm to those\ninmates....\"). In other words, despite acknowledging that all cHCV-positive prisoners should\nbe treated with DAAs, and that cHCV— which all Plaintiffs and class members have—is a\nserious medical need to which the Secretary was deliberately indifferent,[6] the Secretary is\nnow drawing lines between the stages of symptoms of the underlying disease.\nTo its credit, the majority refuses to engage in the arbitrary line-drawing for which the\nSecretary advocates. See Maj. Op. at 1270-71. Instead, I gather that the majority agrees\nwith the Secretary's ultimate outcome because treating prisoners at the less-progressed\nstages of cHCV is the \"best obtainable\" care, rather than the \"minimally adequate care\" they\nare owed. Id. at 1277 (quotation marks omitted). But the majority opinion's holding that the\nSecretary was not deliberately indifferent overlooks one important fact: the District Court\nfound, and the Secretary did not contest, that the only reason cHCV patients were not\ntreated was due to lack of funding. The District Court found—twice, in fact—that the\nSecretary admitted the failure to treat prisoners with cHCV, a serious medical need, was\nbased solely on cost. And now, the Secretary draws lines between what stages of cHCV\nshould receive treatment on the same rationale: cost. So even though the District Court\nfound that the Secretary was deliberately indifferent by not providing treatment for the\nunderlying disease that the Plaintiffs and class members all have, the Secretary now argues\nthat he was not deliberately indifferent to F0- and F1-stage patients. It is on this basis that\nthe Secretary seeks to limit the injunction entered by the District Court.\nThe majority finds it unnecessary to rule on this argument made by the Secretary. But in\nmaking its ruling, I fear the majority is rejecting facts found by the District Court and instead\nproviding its own interpretation of the facts in the record. See Maj. Op. at 1270-71. By\nreversing the District Court's order, the majority effectively denies treatment to prisoners\nwho \"plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening [medical] condition ... on the ground that\nnothing yet had happened to them.\" See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, 113 S. Ct.\n2475, 2481, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993). Because this holding offends contemporary standards\nof decency and is also contrary to the Secretary's own expert testimony on the proper\nstandard of care, I cannot join it. See id. at 32, 113 S. Ct. at 2480 (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at\n103-04, 97 S. Ct. at 290-91).\nA. THE PARTIES' EXPERTS AGREE THAT F0- AND\nF1-STAGE PATIENTS MUST BE TREATED.\nThe majority says that the parties' differing expert testimony reflects \"a simple difference in\nmedical opinion.\" Maj. Op. at 1273 (quotation marks omitted). I don't think this view properly\ncharacterizes the testimony of the Secretary's expert. Indeed, neither Dr. Daniel Dewsnup,\nthe Secretary's expert, nor Dr. Margaret Koziel, Plaintiffs' expert, dispute that the\n\n1283\n*1283 standard of care is to treat all cHCV-positive prisoners with DAAs.\nDr. Koziel gave a statement explaining that \"[a]lthough the standard of care is to treat all\npersons with chronic HCV with DAA drugs, the choice of the regimen is dictated by ... the\nprogression (staging) of fibrosis and/or cirrhosis.\" She explained that \"[t]he HCV guidelines\ncall for all individuals with Hepatitis C to be treated [with DAAs] unless there is a\ncontraindication to treatment.\"[7] She reiterated that \"all\" patients, including those at the F0-\nand F1-stage, \"need to be treated.\" However, when determining how \"to set up a priority\nsystem for treatment,\" Dr. Koziel said that she would treat those with more advanced\nfibrosis and cirrhosis, which typically fall within the F3 and F4 stages, and then keep treating\nthe next, less-advanced cHCV stages in descending order, from the F2 to F1 to F0. Dr.\nKoziel put it this way: \"So if you have a list of 5,000 patients, it is reasonable to think I can't\nsee 5,000 patients tomorrow. Let's find[,] of those 5,000[,] the individuals who are sickest\nand treat those first because they are most[ ] like[ly] to suffer the complications of liver\ndisease.\"\nDr. Dewsnup's testimony seems to align with that of Dr. Koziel. Dr. Dewsnup agreed that the\nHCV Guidelines recommend \"treating everyone with chronic hepatitis C\" with DAAs, and\nthat this recommendation represents the standard of care. He noted that \"in the correctional\nsetting,\" the standard of care is \"a goal that we should strive for.\" He recognized that in\npractice, due to the sheer number of prisoners, patients must be triaged and then prioritized\n\"to treat the sickest first.\" Dr. Dewsnup admitted \"this is the reality\" of things, and he would\ntreat less-advanced cHCV-positive prisoners \"as soon as we can.\" He suggested prioritizing\ntreatment as follows: people with decompensated cirrhosis \"need to be prioritized for\nurgent, immediate treatment\"; people with cirrhosis (F4-stage) \"need to be treated very\nsoon\"; people at the F3- and F2-stages are slotted next; and \"it's safe to wait for a bit\" to\ntreat the F0- and F1-stage patients, but they would need to be treated \"eventually.\"[8]\nBased on this testimony, the experts' opinions do not differ in the ways the majority seems\nto think. See Maj. Op. at 1273. Rather, both experts agree that the standard of care requires\ntreating all cHCV-positive prisoners and, while F0-and F1-stage patients need not be\ntreated immediately, the goal is to treat them with DAAs.\nB. THE MAJORITY OPINION FAILS TO ADDRESS\nEVIDENCE SHOWING F0- AND F1-STAGE PATIENTS ARE\nAT RISK DURING THE PERIOD DAA TREATMENT IS\nDELAYED.\nI agree, based on the expert testimony described above, that the FDOC's current\n\n1284\n*1284 policy of monitoring F0- and F1-stage patients is appropriate for some period of time.\nNotably, however, neither expert testified that treatment with DAAs could be delayed\nindefinitely for the F0- and F1-stage patients. The question thus becomes whether delaying\nDAA treatment for F0- and F1-stage patients is \"tolerable\"; and that \"depends on the nature\nof the medical need and the reason for the delay.\" Farrow v. West, 320 F.3d 1235, 1247\n(11th Cir. 2003) (quotation marks omitted). Courts have recognized that if symptoms of a\ndisease get progressively worse, this factors into whether the delay constitutes gross\nnegligence. See Goebert v. Lee County, 510 F.3d 1312, 1327 (11th Cir. 2007) (\"Where the\nprisoner has suffered increased physical injury due to the delay, we have consistently\nconsidered: (1) the seriousness of the medical need; (2) whether the delay worsened the\nmedical condition; and (3) the reason for the delay.\"). Again, the Secretary admits both that\ncHCV is a serious medical need and the reason for the delay is the cost of treatment. See\nAncata v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir. 1985) (concluding prison\nwas deliberately indifferent when \"necessary medical treatment ha[d] been delayed for\nnon-medical reasons\"). We therefore must examine the risks posed to F0- and F1-stage\npatients when their treatment is delayed, and whether, during the delay, Plaintiffs' conditions\nworsen such that treatment with DAAs is medically \"necessary.\" See id.\nFirst, no one here disputes that the \"principal consequence\" of HCV is \"infection of the liver,\nwhich causes inflammation that in turn may result in scarring of the liver (fibrosis).\" R. 270 at\n4 (quotation marks omitted); see also R. 153 at 2. Neither is there any dispute that a\npatient's symptoms do not necessarily match up with the extent of liver scarring they are\nexperiencing, or that a patient's symptoms correlate to their risk of liver failure. A person\n\"can be completely asymptomatic and present with cirrhosis.\" R. 270 at 6 (quotation marks\nomitted); see also R. 153 at 5. Consistent with this, Dr. Dewsnup testified that he has\nmeasured the progression of F2- and F3-stage patients' symptoms from none \"to end-stage\nliver disease.\" This record thus shows that symptoms are not indicative of the progression\nof the virus and the underlying damage to the liver. This matters because the Secretary is\nproposing delaying treatment until a patient reaches a more advanced stage. But because\nthere is no dispute that once a patient reaches this higher F2 stage, scarring of the liver is\nalready present, the Secretary is in essence waiting for F0- and F1-stage patients' condition\nto deteriorate to begin treatment. R. Doc. 270 at 4-5 (describing the F2 stage as \"moderate\nfibrosis\" and defining fibrosis as \"scarring of the liver\"); Doc. 153: 2-3 (same).\nThe Secretary's approach does not come with a precise time frame. The delay in treatment\ncould be one year, or it could be twenty years. Either way, the experts' testimony provides\nevidence that treating cHCV patients is medically necessary and, in the absence of\ntreatment, cHCV-positive prisoners experience liver inflammation that may progress to liver\nscarring. The Secretary's proposed outcome, adopted in the majority opinion, banks on the\nchance that some F0- and F1-stage patients may not ever progress to F2 while they are\nincarcerated and that some may not progress to the most serious fibrosis stage—\n\ncirrhosis—until 20 years from now. But the fact that a disease may progress slowly does not\nmean that prison officials may refuse to treat it. The Supreme Court has said as much,\nwarning that prison officials cannot ignore harm \"that is sure or very likely to cause serious\nillness and needless suffering the next week or month or year.\" See Helling, 509 U.S. at 33,\n113 S. Ct. at 2480 (reconciling standard for conditions of\n1285\n*1285 confinement with deliberate indifference standard).\nThis record shows that all cHCV patients —no matter the stage—are at risk of suffering liver\ndamage. At least one other circuit has reached the same conclusion based on similar cHCV\nevidence. In Gordon v. Schilling, 937 F.3d 348 (4th Cir. 2019), the Fourth Circuit critiqued\nthe prison's decision to simply monitor a plaintiff diagnosed with acute HCV. Id. at 359. That\ncourt recognized that even though the plaintiff's lab tests were \"normal,\" he \"could be\nsuffering from ongoing liver damage.\" Id. The Fourth Circuit concluded \"it is inconsistent\nwith the Eighth Amendment for a prison official to withhold treatment from an inmate who\nsuffers from a serious, chronic disease until the inmate's condition significantly\ndeteriorates.\" Id. I agree and would hold the same here.\nThe majority also takes issue with District Court's statement that the Secretary \"ha[d] not\nput forth any medical reason... why F0 and F1 inmates should not be treated.\" Maj. Op. at\n1274. The majority says the District Court improperly removed the burden of proof from\nPlaintiffs and put it on the Secretary. See id. at 1273-75. To arrive at this judgment, the\nmajority seizes on one sentence in the District Court's order and ignores that Plaintiffs had\nalready established that cHCV is a \"serious medical need\" within the meaning of our\nprecedent. The majority's approach also overlooks that Plaintiffs did provide evidence to\ndemonstrate that treatment of F0- and F1-stage patients is no less medically\nnecessary—though perhaps less urgent—than treatment for F2-, F3-, and F4-stage\npatients. I believe the District Court properly found that Plaintiffs presented evidence\nsufficient to show that treatment of F0- and F1-stage patients is necessary, and that\nwithholding necessary treatment based solely on cost demonstrates the Secretary acted\nwith more than gross negligence. In fact, testimony from the Secretary's own expert\ncompels this conclusion.[9]\nTo summarize, a review of this record, drawing all inferences in favor of the District Court's\nfactual and credibility determinations, see Fla. Int'l Univ. Bd. of Trs. v. Fla. Nat'l Univ., Inc.,\n830 F.3d 1242, 1253 (11th Cir. 2016), supports the District Court's finding of deliberate\nindifference. I would uphold the District Court's decision to require the Secretary provide F0-\nand F1-stage patients with DAA treatment.[10]\n1286\n\n*1286 The Secretary is here seeking to avoid paying for DAA treatment for a portion of\ncHCV-positive prisoners it is charged with caring for. But the Secretary should be required\nto fund this treatment because delaying it until the F2 stage, when a patient's condition has\ncertainly deteriorated from liver inflammation to scarring of the liver, is inconsistent with the\nEighth Amendment.\nC. THE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY APPLIED HARRIS V.\nTHIGPEN.\nFinally, the majority gives costs too large a role in determining whether the Secretary is\ndeliberately indifferent. See Maj. Op. at 1275-78. The rule is this: nothing precludes a prison\nfrom considering cost, but \"cost can never be an absolute defense to what the Constitution\notherwise requires.\" Id. at 1277. Based on what the Secretary has actually argued in this\ncase, it is not necessary for the majority to go to the lengths it does to emphasize the role\ncosts play in its analysis.\nThe Secretary argues that the District Court incorrectly applied Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d\n1495 (11th Cir. 1991), when it \"agree[d]\" with an advocacy statement from the Plaintiffs'\nbrief, which used the term \"per se deliberate indifference.\" In Harris, our Court rejected \"any\nsuggestion in the [district] court's reasoning that a state's comparative wealth might affect\nan HIV-infected prisoner's right to constitutionally adequate medical care.\" 941 F.2d at 1509.\nThe Harris court said it did \"not agree that financial considerations must be considered in\ndetermining the reasonableness of inmates' medical care to the extent that such a rationale\ncould ever be used... to deny a prisoner the minimally adequate care to which he or she is\nentitled.\" Id. (quotation marks omitted). To the extent the majority recognizes Harris as\nstanding for this principle, see Maj. Op. at 1277, I agree.\nContrary to the Secretary's argument, the District Court's analysis was in keeping with\nHarris. Although the District Court reordered the Harris analysis, it said that evidence\nsupported the finding that \"F0 and F1 inmates face substantial suffering and harm.\" The\nCourt then noted, as the Secretary claims is required by Harris, that FDOC did not provide\n\"any medical reason\" why, contrary to the experts' conclusions, F0 and F1 inmates should\nnot be treated. See Appellant's Br. at 18 (\"Properly understood, Harris establishes that a\nstate's inability to pay for constitutionally required care is not a defense to an Eighth\nAmendment violation.\"). Thus, the Secretary's argument that there is no precedent\nsupporting the idea that \"there is a per se Eighth Amendment prohibition\" against prison\nofficials \"considering cost\" does not address the findings actually made by the District Court.\nSee id. at 17.\nThe Secretary's cost justification raises the question of whether its actions amount to more\nthan gross negligence.[11] Again, the Secretary admits that the reason for delaying\n\n1287\n*1287 treatment of F0- and F1-stage patients is the cost of DAAs. See Ancata, 769 F.2d at\n704 (concluding prison was deliberately indifferent when \"necessary medical treatment has\nbeen delayed for non-medical reasons\"). This record contains no other medical reason for\ndelay.[12]\n* * *\nI understand this record to support the District Court's factual findings that the Secretary\nwas deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of F0- and F1-stage cHCV\npatients. I would therefore affirm the District Court's summary judgment order.\nII.\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PLRA\") \"imposes limits on the scope and\nduration of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\" Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637,\n650, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 2126, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004). These limits include a requirement\nthat, before issuing such relief,\n[t]he court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such\nrelief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the\nFederal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the\nFederal right.\n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1). The Secretary argues, and the majority holds, that the District\nCourt's order contained only a \"threadbare recitation\" of the PLRA's\nnarrowness-need-intrusiveness requirements, which is insufficient as a matter of law. See\nAppellant's Br. at 27; Maj. Op. at 1278. I believe this holding is flawed in two respects. First,\nI do not agree that the Secretary has properly challenged any prospective relief other than\nthe District Court's direction to treat F0- and F1-stage patients. Second, the record reflects\nthat the District Court did indeed balance the concerns for redressing the Secretary's\nconstitutional violation with the Secretary's authority to run the FDOC. I would therefore hold\nthat the District Court met the PLRA requirements.\nThe first step in examining whether the District Court properly made the\nnarrowness-need-intrusiveness findings is to determine what findings the Secretary is\nchallenging. We do not require the District Court to make particularized findings \"concerning\nany facts or factors about which there is no dispute\" or which the Secretary has conceded.\nCason v. Seckinger, 231 F.3d 777, 785 n.8 (11th Cir. 2000). Even though the majority\nopinion agrees that the Secretary doesn't challenge any of those additional items under the\nEighth Amendment, it vacates the entire injunction and instructs the District Court to make\n\nthe narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings on all relief ordered. See Maj. Op. at 1278,\n1279. And it does so without acknowledging Plaintiffs' argument that the Secretary\nconceded the District Court's findings satisfied the PLRA. The majority should have\nresolved this dispute first. Because it did not, the majority opinion is based on a flawed\npremise, and its resulting narrowness-need-intrusiveness analysis\n1288\n*1288 overturns findings the Secretary has conceded.\nTo properly analyze the Secretary's claim, we first must determine what findings the\nSecretary has properly challenged. See Cason, 231 F.3d at 785 n.8. The Secretary claims it\ndid not concede the District Court's findings satisfied the PLRA \"for any of the additional\nrelief\" ordered by the court at summary judgment. Appellant's Reply Br. at 17 n.17. The\nproblem with this assertion is that the Secretary does not specify what \"additional relief\" it is\nactually challenging. See Thomas, 614 F.3d at 1323 (upholding injunction because, in part,\n\"[t]he defendants d[id] not articulate any particular aspect of the injunction that they claim\nextends beyond the violation found by the district court\"). Indeed, the Secretary's arguments\nfocus only on whether it should be required to treat F0- and F1-stage patients. It has not\nreferenced its challenge to any other \"additional relief.\" It is thus clear from the Secretary's\nbriefing that its aim in this appeal is to get the F0 and F1 patient-directive reversed, and I\nwould analyze this claim as challenging only the portion of the order requiring the Secretary\nto treat F0- and F1-stage patients.\nI now move to the next step of the analysis. Our Court has read the PLRA \"as requiring\nparticularized findings, on a provision-by-provision basis, that each requirement imposed by\nthe [district court] satisfies the need-narrowness-intrusiveness criteria.\" Cason, 231 F.3d at\n785.[13] We may look to the entire record to determine whether a district court made these\nspecific findings. See Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 778 F.3d at 1228 (\"Neither the December 6\n[preliminary injunction] order nor any of the court's later orders contained specific\nfindings....\"). After reviewing the record, I believe the District Court made the findings\nrequired by the PLRA.\nAs this Court has previously recognized, a district court is \"keenly aware\" of the PLRA\nnarrowness-need-intrusiveness requirements when its order \"seemingly has fashioned a\nnarrow injunction\" targeting the constitutional violation. Thomas, 614 F.3d at 1323. In\nThomas, this Court found no flaw in the District Court's order because it discussed the\nbalance between \"redressing the constitutional violation and recognizing that it is primarily\ndefendants'\n1289\n*1289 job, and not the Court's, to run the prison system.\" Thomas v. McNeil, 2009 WL\n605306, at *1 (M.D. Fla. March 9, 2009) (unreported), aff'd sub nom. Thomas v. Bryant, 614\n\nF.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2010); see Thomas, 614 F.3d at 1323 (citing district court order). The\nDistrict Court in Thomas explained that it asked the defendants to submit a proposal for\ninjunctive relief and found their refusal \"puzzling\" because it thought the defendants \"would\nbe in the best position to suggest the least intrusive injunctive relief,\" and the Supreme\nCourt has strongly encouraged soliciting the defendants' views on the scope of relief. 2009\nWL 605306, at *1. Based on this discussion (and because the defendants did not point to\nany specific deficiency), our Court upheld the injunction imposed by the District Court in\nThomas. Id. Like that court, the District Court in this case made the appropriate\nnarrowness-need-intrusiveness findings.[14]\nHere, after the District Court explained why the permanent injunction requirements were\nmet, it summarized in one sentence that the injunction satisfied the PLRA \"because it is\nnarrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to effect the changes this Court\nconcludes are constitutionally required, and is the least intrusive means of effecting such\nchanges.\" But in its explanation preceding that summary language, the District Court\nconsidered the balance of requiring treatment for F0- and F1-stage patients in light of the\nmagnitude of the existing constitutional violations, the available remedial alternatives, and\nthe prison's interest in administering its own affairs. Our Court has endorsed the very\napproach employed by the District Court here. See Thomas, 614 F.3d at 1323-24. Other\ncourts have as well. See, e.g., Morales Feliciano, 378 F.3d at 54-55 (upholding injunction\nfashioned to remedy constitutional violations \"substantial in both scope and degree\" in light\nof the prison's \"abject failure\" to cure such violations).\nFirst, the District Court acknowledged that the Secretary was taking steps to treat the\nprisoners, but that over 2,200 prisoners still required treatment. The District Court thus\nconsidered that \"the level of improvement still falls well short of bringing serious violations\ninto constitutional compliance.\" See Morales Feliciano, 378 F.3d at 55.\nNext, the District Court considered the Secretary's past actions, as well as the fact that he\n\"continues to oppose relief\" the District Court found to be constitutionally required. See id. at\n54 (\"The constitutional violations.... have defied correction for more than two decades.\").\nBased on these considerations, the District Court found the Secretary was deliberately\nindifferent. In addressing the additional relief Plaintiffs asked for, the District Court found that\nsome forms of relief were not constitutionally required and denied them. The\n1290\n*1290 District Court therefore implicitly addressed the narrowness and intrusiveness of the\ninjunction when it fashioned the scope of the injunction. And, in granting the Plaintiffs\ncertain forms of relief, the District Court noted it was \"mindful of its role not to supervise\nprisons but to enforce the constitutional rights of prisoners,\" and gave the Secretary its\nchoice of two options in implementing a remedy. See id. at 55 (upholding choice of one of\nthree possible remedies when second was ineffective and third was undesirable).\n\nIn ordering the Secretary to treat F0- and F1-stage patients, the District Court found that not\ntreating those patients amounted to a constitutional violation. The Secretary's own expert\nnever testified that F0- and F1-stage patients should never be treated. Rather, the state's\nexpert recognized that such patients must be treated with DAAs \"eventually.\" In light of that\nfact, tailoring the remedy came down to timing: how quickly should F0- and F1-stage\npatients be treated? Plaintiffs proposed they be treated within two years, and the District\nCourt recognized that the Secretary never \"propose[d] an alternative date (other than\nnever).\" The District Court then weighed Plaintiffs' proposed timeline against the Secretary's\nprogress in treating prisoners to date—over 4,900 prisoners treated over a 15-month period\n—and found the two-year timeline to be reasonable.\nLike in Thomas, the order in this case reflects that the District Court was \"keenly aware\" of\nthe PLRA requirements. 614 F.3d at 1323. Rather than focusing on the District Court's\nsummary paragraph citing to the PLRA, we should more fairly look to the record to\ndetermine if it made the required findings. See Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 778 F.3d at 1228\n(scanning the entire record for evidence of PLRA findings). This circuit, like others,[15] has\nupheld orders of prospective relief where the narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings are\ninterwoven with the analysis of the facts and legal issues of the underlying case. See\nThomas, 614 F.3d at 1323. Based on this record, I would affirm the District Court's\ninjunction. This District Court did not \"simply state in conclusory fashion\" that the F0- and\nF1-stage treatment required by the injunction satisfied the PLRA requirements. See Cason,\n231 F.3d at 785. Rather, it made particularized findings and explained its reasons for\narriving at those conclusions. See Thomas, 614 F.3d at 1323.\nThe majority's holding poses practical problems by placing a rigid requirement on district\ncourts in this circuit. It says that \"if a district court's injunction grants 15 separate forms of\nrelief, the court must make—and explain—15 separate PLRA-related findings.\" Maj. Op. at\n1279. But district courts carry substantial caseloads and our district judges are quite busy.[16]\nImposing a formulaic requirement about how district judges must set out factual findings\nthat are not, in my view, required by the statute itself, forces courts to prioritize formalistic\nconcerns. I view the majority's holding as impractical and wasteful of precious judicial\nresources.\n* * *\n1291\n*1291 The evidence in this record shows cHCV is a progressive disease that inherently puts\nall patients at risk of liver complications. Even patients at the F0 and F1 stages are at a\nserious risk of harm without eventual treatment. The Secretary's challenge to the District\nCourt's finding of deliberate indifference, in an attempt to ultimately limit the scope of the\ninjunction, runs contrary to the medical testimony in this case and our precedent. Because\n\nthe majority opinion effectively allows the Secretary to withhold treatment indefinitely, I\ndissent.\nI also dissent from the majority's holding that the District Court did not make particularized\nfindings required under the PLRA. Although the District Court did not formulaically reference\nthe narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria, it performed the factual analysis our circuit and\nothers have upheld. The majority's holding to the contrary is impractically rigid and places\nan unnecessary burden on our hard-working district judges.\n[*]Honorable Bobby R. Baldock, United States CircuitJudge for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n[1]We review the district court's decision to grantsummary judgment de novo,Ellis v. England,432 F.3d1321, 1325\n(11th Cir. 2005),and its decision to enter an injunctionfor abuse of discretion,Prison Legal News v. Sec'y,Fla. Dep't\nof Corr.,890 F.3d 954, 964 (11th Cir. 2018). \"A districtcourt by definition abuses its discretion when itmakes an error\nof law.\"Koon v. United States,518 U.S. 81, 100,116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).\n[2]We pause briefly to flag a tension within ourprecedent regarding the minimum standard for culpabilityunder the\ndeliberate-indifference standard. Although we haverepeatedly noted that \"a claim of deliberate indifferencerequires\nproof of more thangrossnegligence,\"e.g.,Townsendv. Jefferson Cty.,601 F.3d 1152, 1158 (11th Cir.2010)\n(emphasis added), another line of our cases favorsthe phrase \"more thanmerenegligence,\"McElligottv. Foley,182\nF.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir. 1999)(emphasis added).A panel of this Court recently suggested that \"the`more than\nmere negligence' standard inMcElligottis more consistentwith [Farmer v. Brennan,511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct.1970,\n128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)] than the `more than grossnegligence' standard inTownsend.\"Melton v. Abston,841 F.3d\n1207, 1223 n.2 (11th Cir. 2016). These competing articulations—\"gross\"vs. \"mere\" negligence—may well represent a\ndistinction without a difference because, as explainedbelow, the Supreme Court itself has likened the\ndeliberate-indifference standard to \"subjectiverecklessnessas used in the criminal law.\"Farmer,511 U.S. at839-40,\n114 S.Ct. 1970(emphasis added). Accordingly, no matterhow serious the negligence, conduct that can't fairlybe\ncharacterized asrecklesswon't meet the Supreme Court'sstandard.\n[3]First, a bit of housekeeping. Based on two straystatements in its summary-judgment motion, the plaintiffsassert\nthat the Secretary has \"conceded\" that the EighthAmendment requires DAA treatment for F0- and F1-levelinmates.\nBr. of Appellees at 29. We don't think so—seems tous like a game of gotcha. As for the first statement—thatthe\n\"present-day standard of care is to treat\" chronicHCV patients \"with DAAs as long as there are no contraindications\nor exceptional circumstances\" —the Secretary clarifiedon the very same page of the very same filingitsposition,\nwhich squares with Dr. Dewsnup's testimony, that \"[t]herehas been no showing that delaying treatment withDAAs for\ninmates with fibrosis scores of F0 or F1, until theyreach F2, will cause harm to those inmates.\" As forthe\nsecond—that \"[i]t is inappropriate to only treat thosewith advanced levels of fibrosis\"— the plaintiffs'argument simply\nmisunderstands the import of the word \"advanced.\"As Dr. Koziel herself explained, \"advanced fibrosis\"can be\ndistinguished from F2-level fibrosis, which is \"inthe middle of the spectrum.\" Notably, the districtcourt didn't rely on\nthis so-called \"concession\" in its summary-judgmentorder.\n[4]The Secretary disputes the upshot of Dr. Koziel'stestimony. In particular, the Secretary emphasizes(1) that all Dr.\nKoziel really said was that treating all HCV patientswith DAAs is the \"best possible management for Hepatitis\nC\"—not that doing so is the only permissible courseof action—and (2) that she acknowledged that sheonly \"really,\nreally start[s] to get agitated\" when a patient reachesF3.SeeBr. of Appellant at 20. In response, theplaintiffs (1)\nchallenge the Secretary's \"implication\" that Dr. Koziel'stestimony suggests \"that there is some other adequateform of\ntreatment that is not the `best'\"—which, they insist,\"is simply untrue\"—and (2) that the Secretary hastaken Dr.\nKoziel's \"agitat[ion]\" remark out of context. Br.of Appellees at 35. For present purposes, the parties'debate is beside\nthe point. We can simply assume for present purposesthat Dr. Koziel believes thatallHCV-positive inmatesshould\nbe treated with DAAs.\n[5]To be sure, our decisions have said—incanted,really—that \"a defendant who delays necessary treatmentfor\nnon-medical reasons may exhibit deliberate indifference.\"Bingham v. Thomas,654 F.3d 1171, 1176 (11th Cir.2011)\n(citingHill,40 F.3d at 1187). That rule, of course,isn't absolute. It seems to us inconceivable, forinstance, that the\n\nEighth Amendment could be read to disable prison administrators from refusing an inmate's treatment request (no\nmatter how medically sound) on the ground that itwould threaten institutional security. To take justone example,\nwould the Constitution require prison authoritiesto allow an inmate with severe allergies to keep anEpiPen® in his\ncell? If only \"medical\" considerations counted, thenthe answer would have to be yes—but of course theanswer is no.\nIn any event, none of our decisions has ever formallyimposed a burden on prison officials to prove a medicalreason\nfor delaying or withholding an inmate's preferredtreatment, let alone suggested that the failure todischarge that\nburden is fatal.\n[6]Cf. alsoWoodall v. Foti,648 F.2d 268, 272 (5thCir. Unit A 1981) (holding that in deciding whetherdenial or\ndeferral of medical treatment constitutes deliberateindifference, a court should \"take into account anumber of\ncompeting considerations,\" among them \"the seriousnessof the prisoner's illness [and] the need for immediate\ntreatment\" and the \"availability and expense\" of therequested care, keeping in \"mind[ ] that the essentialtest is one\nof medical necessity and not simply of desirability\").\n[7]We respectfully disagree with our dissenting colleague,seeDissenting Op. at 1287-88, that the Secretaryhas in\nany way \"conce[ded]\" or \"stipulate[ed]\" that the districtcourt's injunction satisfies the PLRA's narrowness,necessity,\nand non-intrusiveness requirements.SeeCason v. Seckinger,231 F.3d 777, 785 n.8 (11th Cir. 2000). In the district\ncourt, the Secretary vigorously (if largely unsuccessfully)challenged all 15 forms of additional relief thatthe plaintiffs\nsought on summary judgment. The fact that the Secretaryhas narrowed his merits appeal to the question whether\nthe Eighth Amendment requires DAA treatment of all F0- and F1-level inmates does not mean that he mustforgo his\nseparate argument that the district court's injunction—even as it pertains to other issues—violates thePLRA.\n[8]Contrary to our dissenting colleague's contention,Thomas v. Bryant,614 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2010),does not\nsuggest otherwise.SeeDissenting Op. at 1288-91.Nor could it, as the court there expressly declinedto consider the\nquestion whether the injunction at issue satisfiedthe PLRA's particularized-findings requirement.See614 F.3d at\n1323 n.33(\"[T]he defendants do not specifically arguethat the district court erred by not making the required\nparticularized findings that the proposed injunctionsatisfies the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness\nrequirement.... Because this issue is abandoned, weneed not decide whether the district court's ordersatisfied our\ncircuit's interpretation of § 3626(a)(1)(A).\").\nIn response to our dissenting colleague's objectionthat enforcement of the PLRA's explicit findingsrequirement is\n\"formalistic,\"seeDissenting Op. at 1290-91, we cansay only (1) that the Act requires what it requiresand (2) that the\nstatute's formalism serves one of its principal (andundisputed) purposes— namely, to require districtcourts to dot\ntheir i's and cross their t's before issuing or maintaininginjunctions that interfere with prison administration.Cf.\nHarrington v. Richter,562 U.S. 86, 102, 131 S.Ct.770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)(observing that if 28U.S.C. § 2254's\nstringent standard for habeas corpus relief \"is difficultto meet, that is because it was meant to be\").\nOne final point: The PLRA's narrowness, necessity,and non-intrusiveness requirements also defeat theplaintiffs'\nalternative argument that a district court can grantan injunction broader than necessary to correct anEighth\nAmendment violation. Whatever \"substantial flexibility\"district courts may enjoy to fashion Eighth Amendmentrelief,\nBrown v. Plata,563 U.S. 493, 538, 131 S.Ct. 1910,179 L.Ed.2d 969 (2011),it does not countenance violationof the\nPLRA's explicit requirements.\n[1]HCV is a viral infection, which is spread by exposureto blood or blood products. \"The most common wayof\ncontracting HCV is through intravenous drug use, buta person can also get infected through tattooingor blood\ntransfusions.\" R.

Op. at 1266-67.\n[2]See, e.g.,Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1286-89,1294 (11th Cir. 2020)(overturning the District Court's\nconclusion that prison officials were deliberatelyindifferent to serious risk of harm posed by COVID-19and vacating\npreliminary injunction);Keohane v.

See Maj. Op. at 1271 n.3. This view is apparentlybased on the Secretary's \"clarifi[cation]\" that \"therehas\nbeen no showing that delaying treatment with DAAsfor inmates with fibrosis scores of F0 or F1, untilthey reach F2,\nwill cause harm to those inmates.\" Id. (quotationmarks omitted and alteration adopted). To supportthis position, the\nSecretary points to the purported lack or insignificanceof symptoms experienced by F0- and F1-stage patients.But I\ncannot square either the Secretary's arguments orthe majority's conclusion with the concessions theSecretary made\nin this case. While it may be true that some of thesymptoms experienced by F0- and F1-stage patients,alone, may\nnot rise to the level of a serious medical need requiringtreatment, the Secretary has acknowledged that cHCV—\nwhich presents various symptoms that do not necessarilycorrelate with the seriousness of the underliningcondition\nand risk to the health of the patient—is itself aserious medical condition. See R. 270 at 17 (\"[T]heCourt has\nconcluded that cHCV constitutes a serious medicalneed. Defendant does not dispute this.\").\n[6]See R. 465 at 7-8 (\"This Court previously foundthat chronic HCV is a serious medical need. Defendantdoes not\ndispute that finding.... This Court also previouslyfound that Defendant was deliberately indifferentto Plaintiffs' serious\nmedical needs. Defendant does not dispute that either.\"(citations omitted)).\n[7]These \"HCV Guidelines\" refer to the report publishedby the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease\nand Infectious Disease Society of America, entitled\"HCV Guidance: Recommendations for Testing, Managing,and\nTreating Hepatitis C,\" and available at https://www.hcvguidelines.org/contents.\n[8]The majority views Dr. Dewsnup's testimony asmeaning that treatment will eventually be requiredas a matter of\ndisease progression, such that \"many inmates who arecurrently at F0 or F1 will, if they remain incarceratedlong\nenough, `eventually' progress to F2 and need DAA treatment.\"See Maj. Op. at 1275. This conclusion is not\nsupported by the record. Dr. Dewsnup never testifiedthat F0- and F1-stage patients should never be treated.And,\nwhile it might be true that many F0- and F1-stagepatients may progress to the F2 stage slowly, neitherexpert said\nwithholding treatment until a patient's conditiondeteriorates is appropriate. And, importantly, theexperts did not\nrecommend treating only F0- and F1-stage patientssentenced to longer prison terms.\n[9]When asked if \"it's not that big of deal\" forpatients at less-progressed stages to wait for medicaltreatment, Dr.\nDewsnup responded, \"I wouldn't put it exactly thatway ... a medical way that we could put it [is] ...,look, I've got to\ntreat the sickest first. You're not the sickest, butwe're watching you. We're looking at your labs. Weare going to do it\nas soon as possible.... We'll treat you as soon aswe can.\" He further stated that, \"to the extent that[the HCV\nGuidelines] can be applied, if we had the money andwe have the system capacity, I agree with them. However,in\nStage 0 and Stage 1, ... I think those people don'tneed to be treated immediately.\" This testimony doesnot, as the\nmajority seems to believe, establish that the Secretary'sexpert thought that denying DAA treatment to F0-and\nF1-stage patients is a medically acceptable practice.I also disagree with the majority's comparison ofF0- and\nF1-stage cHCV patients to people in the early stagesof hearing loss. See Maj. Op. at 1273. The majorityreasons\nthat withholding treatment to F0- and F1-stage patientsis like accommodating an individual with early hearingloss by\nspeaking up. Id. Setting aside the gravity of initialhearing loss, the majority's analogy fails becausePlaintiffs have\nestablished, and the Secretary admits, that cHCV isa \"serious medical need\" deserving of treatment.\n[10]Affirming the District Court's findings of factis especially warranted in this case, where the Secretarysought to\nget a final judgment by, among other things, askingthe court to convert the preliminary injunction intoa permanent\ninjunction. The Secretary disputed none of the findingsof facts made by the District Court at the preliminaryinjunction\nstage. See Fla. Int'l Univ. Bd. of Trustees,830 F.3dat 1253(applying deferential standard of reviewto resolution of\ncross-motions for summary judgment when \"the partiesintended to submit the case to the district courtfor final\nresolution\").\n[11]The majority says that because Plaintiffs arenot entitled to treatment \"in the best of all possibleworlds,\" the\nSecretary's actions do not rise to the level of \"subjectiverecklessness as used in the criminal law.\" See Maj.Op. at\n\n1271-72 (quotation marks omitted). Even accepting the majority's formulation of the level of negligence required to\nshow deliberate indifference, the Secretary's costjustification and lack of other evidence to supportwithholding\ntreatment rises above what is required to prove anEighth Amendment violation.\n[12]To the extent the Secretary suggests Dr. Dewsnuptestified about medical reasons for delaying treatment,that\nview misconstrues the record. As discussed above,Dr. Dewsnup testified about the practical reasonsfor prioritizing\npatients according to capacity and resources. Whilesuch a consideration is appropriate with respectto fashioning the\nscope of the remedy, it is not a medical reason thatprecludes a deliberate indifference finding. SeeThomas v. Bryant,\n614 F.3d 1288, 1324 (11th Cir. 2010)(\"[T]he injunctionappropriately balances respect for the DOC's administrationof\nits own affairs with the need to ensure that [plaintiff]is not further subjected to [constitutional violations].\").\n[13]Cason applied § 3626(b)(3) of the PLRA, whichdescribes the standards for terminating prospectiverelief.231\nF.3d at 785. However, this Court extended the Casonparticularity requirement to the term \"finds\" in§ 3626(a)(1),\nwhich sets forth the standards for granting prospectiverelief, i.e., the standard that must apply in thiscase. See\nUnited States v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 778 F.3d1223, 1228 (11th Cir. 2015); see alsoJohnson v.Breeden, 280\nF.3d 1308, 1326 (11th Cir. 2002)(same).\nI question the viability of this extension. Basedon my reading of the statute, § 3626(a)(1) does noton its face require\n\"written findings\" in the way that § 3626(b)(3) does.Beyond that, most other circuits only apply the\nnarrowness-need-intrusiveness findings requirementwhen there is a motion to terminate prospective reliefunder §\n3626(b)(3). SeeGates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 336 n.8(5th Cir. 2004)(rejecting the conclusion that §3626(a)(1)\nrequires particularized written findings);MoralesFeliciano v. Rullan, 378 F.3d 42, 54-55 (1st Cir.2004)(denying\nmotion to terminate because \"[t]he need for continuedprospective injunctive relief is patent\");Jones-Elv. Berge, 374\nF.3d 541, 545 (7th Cir. 2004)(\"So long as the underlyingconsent decree remains valid—and the defendants here\nhave not (yet) made a § 3626(b) motion to terminateor modify the decree— the district court must beable to enforce\nit.\"). However, we are bound to follow Cason underour prior precedent rule. SeeUnited States v. Archer,531 F.3d\n1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008)(\"[A] prior panel's holdingis binding on all subsequent panels unless and untilit is\noverruled or undermined to the point of abrogationby the Supreme Court or by this court sitting enbanc.\").\n[14]As the majority points out, the Thomas courtnoted that the defendants did not argue that the PLRAfindings were\nnot particularized enough. Maj. Op. at 1279 n.8. InThomas, the defendants made conclusory argumentsthat the\ninjunction was too broad: \"The defendants do not articulateany particular aspect of the injunction that theyclaim\nextends beyond the violation found by the districtcourt or is overly intrusive.\"614 F.3d at 1323.A panel of this Court\nreviewed the scope of the injunction anyway and upheldit. Id. In contrast to the way the majority framesthe\nSecretary's arguments here, see Maj. Op. at 1278 n.7,the Secretary does not articulate any particularaspect of the\ninjunction that is too broad. And this is the sameas was done by the defendants in Thomas. I say theSecretary's\nframing of the argument matters. In light of its \"failureto articulate any specific deficiency,\" togetherwith the findings\nthe District Court did make here (as explained below),the record does not support a finding that the DistrictCourt\nabused its discretion in fashioning the injunctiverelief. SeeThomas, 614 F.3d at 1323.\n[15]See, e.g.,Morales Feliciano, 378 F.3d at 55(\"In 2003, the district court was keenly aware ofits duty to ensure\nthat prospective remediation complies with the PLRA'srequirements.\" (citingMorales Feliciano v. CalderonSerra,\n300 F. Supp. 2d 321, 331 (D.P.R. 2004))); see alsoArmstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1071(9th Cir.\n2010)(\"[W]e have upheld as sufficient under the PLRAoverall statements by the district court that the\nneed-narrowness-intrusiveness standard has been met....\").\n[16]For example, for the year ending March 31, 2020,there were over 95,000 filings in the district courtsin this\ncircuit.",

      "text": "Case 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 214   Filed 01/31/18   Page 1 of 7\n   \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nTALLAHASSEE DIVISION \n   \nCARL HOFFER, et al., \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n \nv.                 Case No. 4:17cv214-MW/CAS \n \nJULIE L. JONES, in her official \ncapacity as Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of \nCorrections, \n \nDefendant. \n__________________________/ \n \nORDER MODIFYING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nDefendant moves for a modification of this Court’s Order \nEntering a Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 185 (“Preliminary \nInjunction”). ECF No. 211. For the reasons that follow, Defendant’s \nmotion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nI. First Modification \n  In  the  Preliminary  Injunction,  this  Court  held  that  the \nFlorida  Department  of  Corrections  (“FDC”)  “must  stage  and \nevaluate the 2,500 inmates who have the lowest albumin levels no \nlater than February 28, 2018.” ECF No. 185, at 4. The reason for \nthat directive was to “ensure that inmates with the most advanced \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 214   Filed 01/31/18   Page 2 of 7\n   \n \nliver disease are staged and evaluated first.” Id. at 4, n.4. However, \nDefendant argues that the “use of albumin levels alone is not an \neffective way to determine which patients are the sickest.” ECF \nNo. 211, at 5. Indeed, Defendant’s medical expert, Dr. Dewsnup, \nasserts that a better method to identify the sickest patients is to \n“use  albumin  in  conjunction  with  the  predictive  scoring  index \n(FibroSURE), other lab tests on the spreadsheet, and also the \nabdominal ultrasound.” ECF No. 211-1, at 3. This Court accepts \nDr.  Dewsnup’s  statements  on  this  issue,  and  will  modify  the \nPreliminary Injunction accordingly. If Plaintiffs disagree, they are \nfree  to  file  a  motion  for  modification  and  explain  why  using \nalbumin alone (or any other method) would be preferable, and this \nCourt will set an evidentiary hearing on the matter. \nII. Second Modification \n  In the Preliminary Injunction, this Court held that “FDC \nmust initiate treatment for all known chronic HCV inmates, who \nare  eligible  for  treatment,  and  who  have  fibrosis  stage  3,  by \nDecember 31, 2018.” ECF No. 185, at 4. Similarly, this Court also \nheld that “FDC must initiate treatment for all known chronic HCV \ninmates, who are eligible for treatment, and who have fibrosis \nstage 2, by December 31, 2018.” Id. Although Defendant believes \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 214   Filed 01/31/18   Page 3 of 7\n   \n \nthat FDC is capable of treating the F3 inmates by December 31, \n2018, Defendant does not believe that FDC will be able to treat the \nF2  inmates  by  then.  See  ECF  No.  211,  at  7–15.  Accordingly, \nDefendant asks this Court to modify the Preliminary Injunction \nand give FDC an extra year to treat the F2 inmates. Id. at 14–15. \n  As Dr. Dewsnup notes, “the safest course is to treat F2s and \nF3s within one year.” ECF No. 211-2, at 3. Indeed, in a perfect \nworld, this Court would wave a magic wand, and everyone would \nbe treated immediately. Unfortunately, this world is not perfect, \nand this Court does not have a magic wand. As such, this Court is \ncognizant of reality and understands FDC’s difficulties in meeting \nthe deadlines. \n  While not embraced by everyone, this Court actually values \nscientific  evidence.  And  Dr.  Dewsnup  explains  that  “the  best \nscientific evidence indicates that it is more likely than not just as \nsafe to treat F2s within 24 months as it is to treat F3s within 12 \nmonths.” Id. at 3–4.  That is, “an extension of treatment for F2s \ninto the 12-24 month time period does not raise their mortality risk \nor risk of ELSD to a level beyond that which has been already \ndeemed acceptable for F3 patients by the Court.” Id. at 5. As such, \nDr. Dewsnup opines that “an up to 12-month treatment delay in \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 214   Filed 01/31/18   Page 4 of 7\n   \n \nsome F2 patients is acceptable in the light of the temporary issues \nrelated to acquisition of funding, and large-scale system expansion \nproblems that Centurion is trying to cope with.” Id. at 6.  \n  Again, this Court accepts Dr. Dewsnup’s statements on this \npoint, and will modify the Preliminary Injunction accordingly. This \nCourt understands that Plaintiffs may have different feelings on \nthis issue. Once again, Plaintiffs are free to file their own motion \nfor modification (along with their own expert testimony) if they \nwish  to  convince  this  Court  that  a  12-month  extension  is \ninappropriate, and this Court will set an evidentiary hearing on \nthe matter. \nIII. Third Modification \n  In  the  Preliminary  Injunction,  this  Court  held  that \nDefendant  must  file  monthly  status  reports  “reflecting  FDC’s \nprogress in complying with this Court’s injunction.” ECF No. 185, \nat 5. This Court further held that the status reports must detail \n“[t]he total number of inmates in FDC custody who have been \nscreened/tested  for  HCV.”  Id.  at  6.  Defendant  argues  that  the \nrequirement to list inmates that have been screened/tested should \nbe removed because Plaintiffs were not harmed by FDC’s HCV \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 214   Filed 01/31/18   Page 5 of 7\n   \n \ntesting protocols and therefore have no standing to warrant such \na remedy. See ECF No. 211, at 15–17. \n  Defendant’s argument is patently absurd. It is clearly within \nthis Court’s purview to ensure that a preliminary injunction is \ncomplied with. Defendants could easily avoid their obligation to \ntreat  HCV-infected  inmates  by  simply  not  testing  inmates  for \nHCV. That is, FDC could willfully remain blind to the number of \ninmates who have HCV, not treat the inmates it doesn’t know \nabout, and feign compliance with its obligations.1 By monitoring \nthe  number  of  inmates  that  are  screened/tested,  this  Court  is \npreventing precisely that type of behavior. \nIV. Final Note \n  Victoria Love, the “Regional Vice President of Operations for \nFlorida  for  Centurion  of  Florida,  LLC”  stated  in  her  signed \ndeclaration that “it will be difficult if not impossible to initiate \ntreatment of all the F4s by the end of May.” ECF No. 211-3, at 1, \n6. Yet, Defendant alleges that “FDC is complying with the Court’s \norder related to the treatment of inmates with fibrosis stage 4.” \nECF No. 211, at 14. Moreover, Defendant has not moved for a \n                                           \n1 Considering FDC’s history of HCV treatment, this type of behavior is \ncertainly not beyond the realm of possibility. See ECF No. 153. \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 214   Filed 01/31/18   Page 6 of 7\n   \n \nmodification with respect to its obligation to treat F4 patients. \nSomething is wrong. Either FDC is complying with its obligations \nor it is not. FDC cannot pretend that everything is ok and wait \nuntil the last minute to explain why it won’t be able to meet the \ndeadlines. If it appears that FDC won’t be able to meet the May \ndeadline  for  F4  patients,  then  Defendant  should  move  for  a \nmodification (just like she did here) and justify why this Court \nshould modify the deadline. To reiterate, “none of the dates in th[e] \ninjunction are ‘goals’—the dates are adopted as deadlines that \nmust be complied with.” ECF No. 185, at 2, n.2. \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  Defendant’s  motion  for  modification,  ECF  No.  211,  is \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \n2.  The Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 185, is modified as \nfollows: \na.  Paragraph  1(b)  is  modified  to  read:  “FDC  must \ninitiate  treatment  for  all  known  chronic  HCV \ninmates, who are eligible for treatment, and who \nhave fibrosis stage 2, by December 31, 2019.” \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 214   Filed 01/31/18   Page 7 of 7\n   \n \nb.  Paragraph 1(d) is modified to read: “Of the ~7,500 \ninmates FDC knows have chronic HCV, FDC must \nstage and evaluate the 2,500 inmates with the most \nimmediate  needs  (as  determined  by  evaluating \nalbumin levels in conjunction with the predictive \nscoring index (“FibroSURE”), other lab tests on the \nspreadsheet, and abdominal ultrasounds) no later \nthan February 28, 2018.” \nSO ORDERED on January 31, 2018. \n        s/Mark E. Walker     \n          United States District Judge \n7 \n ",

(sdw) \n(Entered: 04/18/2019) \n04/18/2019  465 VACATED per ORDER 556 :ORDER ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR \n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT. The parties' cross-motions for summary \njudgment, ECF No. 270 and ECF No. 342 , are GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part, as described in this order. The preliminary injunction \nentered in this case, ECF No. 185 , which was subsequently modified and \nrenewed, see, e.g., ECF No. 437 , is hereby dissolved. No later \nthan 5/20/2019, the parties must confer and file a jointly proposed briefing \nschedule regarding the entitlement to and determination of attorney's fees \nand costs. The Clerk is directed to provide a copy of this order to inmate \nSteven A. McLeod. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment stating: a. \nDefendant must ensure that the Florida Department of Corrections \n\n(\"FDC\"), FDC's employees, and FDC's agents comply with FDC's \nHepatitis C Virus (\"HCV\") policy, HSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3, as it is \nrevised. b. Defendant must ensure that FDC's HCV policy, HSB 15.03.09 \nSupplement #3, is not modified absent this Court's instruction. c. \nDefendant must ensure that, no later than May 20, 2019, FDC's HCV \npolicy, HSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3, is modified as follows: i. The \npolicy must be modified to reflect that treatment must be initiated for F0 \nand F1 inmates within two years of staging. ii. A section must be added to \nthe policy requiring an explanation to anyone who refuses staging or \ntreatment of, at least, (1) the consequences of HCV, (2) the availability, \nlack of side effects, and efficacy of the new medications, (3) the staging \nprocess, and (4) whether and when they will receive treatment. iii. The \npolicy must be modified to reflect that (1) patients must be initially staged \nusing a FibroSure test within 30 days of confirming they have chronic \nHCV; (2) patients who need ultrasounds must receive an ultrasound \nwithin 90 days of confirming they have chronic HCV; (3) if a patient \nneeds to be restaged as a result of an ultrasound, the restaging must take \nplace within 5 days of receiving the ultrasound results; and (4) staff must \nrely on the test, exam, or study indicating the highest fibrosis level for \nstaging. iv. The policy must be modified to reflect that deadlines are \nmandatory. v. The policy must be modified to reflect that staff have the \ndiscretion to restage inmates sooner than scheduled. vi. The exclusion for \ntime remaining on an inmate's sentence must be modified such that (1) it \nno longer refers to \"pre-treatment evaluation\"; (2) it no longer refers to \n\"post treatment SVR assessment\"; (3) it no longer includes a \"12-18 \nmonths\" estimate; and (4) it reflects that an inmate-who has already been \nstaged and evaluated-simply needs to have \"sufficient\" time remaining on \ntheir sentence to complete a course of treatment. vii. The exclusion for \nhigh-risk behaviors must be modified to reflect that (1) high-risk \nbehaviors only warrant a delay if there is a \"medical reason\" to delay \ntreatment and (2) it only provides for temporary ineligibility, not \npermanent exclusion. viii. Section J.3., which refers to \"chronic \ndisciplinary issues,\" must be amended to reflect that chronic disciplinary \nissues, in and of themselves, are not sufficient to render an inmate \nineligible for treatment; rather, treatment may only be delayed for medical \nreasons. ix. Section P, which governs referrals for liver transplants, must \nbe modified as follows: (1) decompensation must be defined as \"the \npresence of encephalopathy, ascites, bleeding varices, or jaundice\"; (2) it \nmust be clarified to reflect that patients will be referred if they have any \none of the listed items; (3) referrals must be initiated within 30 days of \nany one of the triggering events; (4) it must provide that FDC must \npromptly comply with the transplant center's request for records and other \ninformation, and to promptly transport the inmate to and from the \ntransplant center; and (5) it must be clarified that for individuals who have \nbeen scheduled to receive DAA medication, are undergoing DAA \ntreatment, or who have finished DAA treatment, a referral must be made \n\nonly if the post-treatment MELD score is over 15. x. Section A.2., which \nrefers to risk factors, must be modified to include \"being born between \n1945 and 1965, previous incarceration, and HIV\" as risk factors. d. \nDefendant must ensure that FDC initiates treatment for all known chronic-\nHCV inmates who are currently staged F0 or F1 within two years of the \ndate of this order. e. Defendant must ensure that FDC either (1) adopts a \nsystem of opt-out testing along with an aggressive notice campaign or (2) \nadopts a system of opt-in testing paired with peer education. FDC must \nmake its choice and Defendant must inform this Court of FDC's decision \nno later than 5/20/2019. f. Defendant must ensure that FDC forms a \ndefinite plan to make elastography available to its medical staff within a \nreasonably immediate timeframe. Defendant must file its proposed plan \nwith this Court no later than 5/20/2019. g. Defendant must ensure that-for \ninmates who were known to have chronic HCV in December 2017, who \nhave fibrosis stage 2, and who are eligible for treatment-FDC initiates \ntreatment no later than December 31, 2019. Beginning on 6/3/2019, and \non the first day of each month thereafter, Defendant must file with this \nCourt a status report reflecting FDC's progress in complying with this \nCourt's injunction. That status report must include: i. A certification \nregarding FDC's compliance with the applicable deadlines for prisoners \nknown to have chronic HCV in December 2017. ii. Information regarding \nthe total number of inmates who: 1. have been screened/tested for HCV, \n2. have been identified as having chronic HCV, 3. have been identified as \nhaving chronic HCV and have been staged (which must be further broken \ndown by stage, including F0, F1, F2, F3, F4, decompensated cirrhosis, \nand those with HIV), 4. have been submitted to the Hepatitis C \nCommittee for evaluation (which must be further broken down by stage, \nincluding F0, F1, F2, F3, F4, decompensated cirrhosis, and those with \nHIV), 5. have begun treatment with DAAs, 6. have completed treatment \nwith DAAs, 7. have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR), 8. \nhave not achieved SVR, and 9. have been deemed (temporarily or \npermanently) ineligible for treatment with DAAs along with the specific \nreason for ineligibility.

Case No. 4:17cv214-MW/CAS \nJULIE L. JONES, in her official \ncapacity as Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of \nCorrections, \nDefendant. \n__________________________/ \nORDER ENTERING A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nThis  Court  previously  granted  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction as to the treatment being provided by the \nFlorida Department of Corrections (“FDC”) to inmates infected \nwith the Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”). ECF No. 153. In doing so, \nhowever, this Court noted that it was “only providing overarching \nguidance of how it believes FDC should address HCV treatment \ngoing forward.” Id. at 31. This Court did that because Defendant \nspecifically requested to “prepare a plan in light of this Court’s \ndirections” before this Court entered a preliminary injunction. Id. \n1 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 2 of 31\n   \n \nSince then, Defendant filed her proposed plan. ECF No. 175. \nThis Court noted a number of deficiencies with Defendant’s plan \nand asked the parties to provide comments in light of this Court’s \nfindings. ECF No. 178. The parties have now filed their comments. \nECF  No.  180;1  ECF  No.  181.2  Having  considered  the  parties’ \ncomments, and in light of this Court’s findings in its order granting \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, this Court orders \nDefendant to comply with her plan with some modifications. \n                                           \n1 Plaintiffs identified several shortcomings with Defendant’s plan. Some \nof those shortcomings need to be fixed, and are accordingly addressed in this \ninjunction. Other alleged shortcomings (such as Plaintiffs’ concern for the \n“vague” standards that make an inmate ineligible for treatment) need not be \naddressed at this stage. This Court may revisit those issues at the conclusion \nof the case or upon a motion for modification. Indeed, “[n]othing prevents the \nplaintiffs from seeking further relief from the district court if [defendant] fail[s] \nto comply in good faith with the requirements of the injunction and the \napplicable federal standards.” Ga. Ass’n of Retarded Citizens v. McDaniel, 716 \nF.2d 1565, 1581 (11th Cir. 1983), vacated on other grounds by Bd. of Pub. Educ. \nfor City of Savannah & Cty. of Chatham v. Ga. Ass’n of Retarded Citizens, 468 \nU.S. 1213 (1984). Moreover, it should be obvious that FDC may not circumvent \nthis Court’s injunction by attempting to do indirectly what it may not do \ndirectly.  Cf.  Feikema v. Texaco,  Inc.,  16  F.3d  1408,  1419  (4th  Cir.  1994) \n(Murnaghan, J., concurring) (“[W]e would not allow the plaintiffs to gain \nindirectly . . . what we have expressly prevented them from gaining directly \nthrough an injunction . . . .”). In other words, this Court does not expect FDC \nto  avoid  its  obligation  to  treat  inmates  by  unjustifiably  finding  inmates \nineligible  for  treatment.  This  Court  and  Plaintiffs  can  be  sure  of  this \nexpectation because Defendant will be filing monthly status reports of FDC’s \nprogress. Like President Ronald Reagan, this Court will “trust, but verify.” \n  \n2 Defendant addressed some of this Court’s concerns, but not all of them. \nIn  fact,  Defendant  created  further  concerns  by  stating  that  some  of  the \ndeadlines she had promised to comply with in her plan were “potentially \nambitious.” ECF No. 181-1, at 5. To be clear, none of the dates in this injunction \nare “goals”—the dates are adopted as deadlines that must be complied with. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 3 of 31\n   \n \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  Defendant must ensure that FDC, FDC’s employees, and \nFDC’s  contractors  comply  with  Defendant’s  Plan  of \nTreatment  for  Chronic  Hepatitis  C,  ECF  No.  175-1, \n(attached as Exhibit A to this order)3 as modified below: \n                                           \n3 The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that “[e]very order \ngranting an injunction . . . must . . . describe in reasonable detail—and not by \nreferring to the complaint or other document—the act or acts restrained or \nrequired.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65(d)(1)(C)  (emphasis  added).  As  some  have \nrecognized, \n \n[e]ven though the express language of Rule 65(d) appears to \nprohibit incorporation by reference, it is undesirable to . . . set \nout long and verbose findings that may be found in another \ndocument  since  the  injunction  or  restraining  order  should \nfurnish defendant with a direct and succinct statement of the \nacts  that  have  been  enjoined  or  the  conduct  that  must  be \nundertaken by the defendant. \n \n11A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE § 2955 \n(3d ed. & Apr. 2017 update). “Thus, some courts have looked to the purpose of \nthe rule, which is to assure adequate notice to defendants of the act or acts \nprohibited, and have interpreted it less restrictively than the literal text of the \nrule might suggest is appropriate.” Id. See also, e.g., California v. Campbell, \n138 F.3d 772, 783 (9th Cir. 1998); United States v. Sarcona, 457 F. App’x 811, \n811–12 (11th Cir. 2012) (unpublished). Given that Defendant drafted her own \nplan, Defendant should have no qualms with this Court’s incorporation of that \nplan.  Cf.  Balla  v.  Idaho  Bd.  of  Corr.,  No.  CV81-1165-S-BLW,  2009  WL \n1574454, at *5 (D. Idaho May 28, 2009) (“Here, Defendants drafted the plans \nthat would govern their own actions, satisfying the notice requirement.”). If \nDefendant disagrees, then she is welcome to move this Court for modification \nand/or clarification of this injunction. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 4 of 31\n   \n \na.  FDC must initiate treatment for all known chronic \nHCV inmates, who are eligible for treatment, and \nwho have fibrosis stage 3, by December 31, 2018. \nb.  FDC must initiate treatment for all known chronic \nHCV inmates, who are eligible for treatment, and \nwho have fibrosis stage 2, by December 31, 2018. \nc.  FDC  must  evaluate  and  stage  all  of  the  ~7,500 \ninmates it knows have chronic HCV no later than \nApril 30, 2018. For all other inmates, FDC must \nevaluate  and  stage  inmates  within  60  days  of \nconfirming that the inmates have chronic HCV. \nd.  Of the ~7,500 inmates FDC knows have chronic \nHCV,  FDC  must  stage  and  evaluate  the  2,500 \ninmates  who  have  the  lowest  albumin  levels  no \nlater than February 28, 2018.4 \n                                           \n4 This order is consistent with Dr. Dewsnup’s recommendation in light \nof this Court’s questioning at the preliminary-injunction hearing. ECF No. 158, \nat 176–79. Specifically, it will ensure that inmates with the most advanced \nliver disease are staged and evaluated first. See id. FDC might already be \nemploying a similar methodology, but there is no indication (or guarantee) in \nFDC’s plan that FDC is doing so. If Defendant has a different method in mind \nfor identifying the inmates that should be evaluated and staged first, then \nDefendant is welcome to move this Court for a modification. Either way, \nevaluating and staging the worst 2,500 inmates (i.e., 1/3 of the ~7,500) by \nFebruary 28 should not be an onerous task given that FDC already planned to \nevaluate all 7,500 by April 30. \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 5 of 31\n   \n \n2.

Defendant  must  ensure  that  FDC’s  HCV-treatment \npolicy,  HSB  15.03.09  Supplement  #3,  is  modified  as \nfollows: \na.  The  policy  must  make  clear  that  treatment \ndeadlines (e.g., the 0–6 month deadline for priority \nlevel 1) begin to run from the date that an inmate \nis staged at a particular fibrosis level. \nb.  The  policy  must  make  clear  that  FDC  must \nevaluate  and  stage  inmates  within  60  days  of \nconfirming that the inmates have chronic HCV.6 \n4.  Beginning on January 1, 2018, and on the first day of each \nmonth thereafter, Defendant shall file with this Court a \nstatus report reflecting FDC’s progress in complying with \nthis Court’s injunction. That status report must detail: \n                                           \n5 The most recent version of this document is attached as Exhibit B to \nthis order. \n \n6 The other timeframes in this plan trump the policy.

Jones, sued in her official capacity as Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of Corrections (“FDC”), submits this plan of treatment for \ninmates with chronic hepatitis C, and in response to this court’s Order Granting \nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction (“Order”) [D.E. 153]: \nA.  INTRODUCTION \n  On November 17, 2017, this court entered an order that granted the \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and required FDC to file a plan that \nwas consistent with the court’s directions, and that included specific timetables \n[D.E. 153, page 32].  During final argument on November 1, 2017, FDC offered to \nPage 1 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 10 of 31\nsubmit such a plan, but noted that in participating in the process of plan \nsubmission, FDC was not waiving the right to either further contest liability, or to \nchallenge the scope of any court ordered remedy. \nB.  POLICY REVISIONS \n  FDC’s medical providers are mandated to follow its health services bulletins \nfor the care of inmates who have hepatitis C, specifically HSB 15.03.09, \nSupplement No. 3 (“Supplement 3”).  Prior to the evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ \nmotions, Supplement 3 was revised in October 2017.  In its order, the Court \nrequired the FDC to update Supplement 3 so that there is a clear plan for doctors to \nfollow [D.E. 132, page 21 and 29]. \n  Attached as Exhibit A is FDC’s revised Supplement 3.1  Generally, \nSupplement 3 now includes specific direction to providers regarding the steps to be \ntaken in screening inmates for both the presence of hepatitis C (“HCV”) and the \npresence of fibrosis (pages 5-6).  Additionally, once inmates are found to have \nchronic hepatitis C (“cHCV”), Supplement 3 contains detailed directions for their \nevaluation and testing, along with time periods for that (pages 6-8).  With respect \nto treatment with direct-acting antiviral medication (“DAA” or “DAAs”), \nSupplement 3 now contains two priority levels for treatment with DAAs, as well as \n                                                 \n1 This needs to be reviewed by the Correctional Medical Authority (CMA), pursuant to Sec. 945.603, Florida \nStatutes. \nPage 2 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 11 of 31\ndirections regarding the time periods for DAA treatment (pages 8-9).  There is also \ndirection for regular monitoring of the third priority level, those individuals who \nare at fibrosis stages F1 and FO (page 9).  The new, comprehensive descriptions \nof tests, treatment, and time standards are consistent with the expert testimony of \nDr. Dan Dewsnup at the evidentiary hearing, and this court’s direction. \n  Timetable:  Complete. \nC.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF INMATES WHO ARE \nKNOWN TO HAVE CHRONIC HEPATITIS C \n \n  FDC has begun the process of evaluating and staging all inmates known to \nhave cHCV, and will complete this process for all current cHCV inmates by April \n30, 2018.  This process will be ongoing for all newly discovered cHCV inmates.  \nInmates with cHCV will be enrolled in the Gastrointestinal Clinic (“GC”) where \ntheir monitoring and evaluation will include an examination every six months, and \nthey will receive proprietary indices and/or elastography every six months, and an \nabdominal ultrasound every six months if they are at fibrosis stages 2-4 \n(Supplement 3, pages 6-8).  For those who are at fibrosis stages 0-1, they will \nreceive an examination every 6-12 months in the GC, as well as laboratory testing \nevery six months, and the proprietary indices and/or elastography every 12 months \n(Supplement 3, pages 6-8).  \n  It is important to recognize that, based on existing information, the GC will \nhave a patient load of approximately 7,500 inmates.  Hence, FDC is prepared to \nPage 3 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 12 of 31\nsignificantly surpass the previously suggested evaluation rate of 100 inmates per \nmonth that the court found to be deficient [D.E. 132, page 30]. \n  Moreover, all those with cHCV will receive counseling regarding the \ndisease, including the staging of treatment with DAAs, and the availability of peer-\nto-peer counseling (Supplement 3, page 8).   \n  Timetable:  This began in November 2017, and will be complete for \ncurrently known cHCV inmates by April 30, 2018.  The process will be ongoing \nfor newly discovered cHCV inmates. \nD.  TREATMENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE DECOMPENSATED \nCIRRHOSIS WITH DIRECT-ACTING ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION \n \n  All cHCV inmates who are known to have decompensated cirrhosis will be \noffered treatment with DAAs (Supplement 3, page 8). \n  Timetable: FDC began treating inmates with decompensated cirrhosis in \nAugust 2017, and will have initiated treatment for all known cHCV inmates with \ndecompensated cirrhosis by December 31, 2017.  This will be ongoing for newly \ndiscovered cHCV inmates with decompensated cirrhosis. \nE.  TREATMENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS \nWITH DIRECT-ACTING ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION \n \n  All cHCV inmates who are known to have compensated cirrhosis will be \noffered treatment with DAAs within three to six months (Supplement 3, page 8). \nPage 4 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 13 of 31\n  Timetable:  FDC will begin initiating treatment for cHCV inmates with \ncompensated cirrhosis in December 2017, and will have initiated treatment for all \ncurrent cHCV inmates with compensated cirrhosis by May 2018.  This will be \nongoing for newly discovered cHCV inmates. \nF.  TREATMENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE FIBROSIS STAGE 3 WITH \nDIRECT-ACTING ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION \n \n  All cHCV inmates who are known to have fibrosis stage 3 will be offered \ntreatment with DAAs within 12 months (Supplement 3, page 8). \n  Timetable: FDC will begin initiating treatment for cHCV inmates who have \nfibrosis stage 3 by no later than April 1, 2018, and will have initiated treatment for \nall current cHCV inmates who have fibrosis stage 3 by March 31, 2019.  This will \nbe ongoing for newly discovered cHCV inmates. \nG.  TREATMENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE FIBROSIS STAGE 2 WITH \nDIRECT-ACTING ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION \n \n  All cHCV inmates who are known to have fibrosis stage 2 will be offered \ntreatment with DAAs within 24 months (Supplement 3, page 9).  The timetable for \ntreatment is directly impacted by the fact that the current number of inmates who \nare in fibrosis stage 2 is presently unknown.  The FDC is actively evaluating the \n6,500 inmates referenced in the Order to determine the fibrosis scores of 0, 1, and \n2. [D.E. 153, p. 30-31].  Additionally, every year the FDC receives approximately \n30,000 newly incarcerated inmates; thus, the number of inmates in fibrosis stage 2 \nPage 5 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 14 of 31\nis likely to increase by an unknown magnitude over the court’s proposed timetable \nfor treatment. \n  Timetable:  All 6,500 inmates referenced in the Order will be evaluated and \nstaged on or before April 1, 2018. FDC will begin initiating treatment for cHCV \ninmates who have fibrosis stage 2 by no later than May 1, 2018, and will have \ninitiated treatment for all current cHCV inmates who have fibrosis stage 2 by April \n30, 2020.  This will be ongoing for newly discovered cHCV inmates. \nH.  STANDING ORDERS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF EPCLUSA, \nMAVYRET, AND RIBAVIRIN \n \n  Dr. Dan Dewsnup has issued standing orders for the administration of \nEpclusa and Mavyret, which are two commonly used DAAs, along with Ribavirin, \nwhich needs to be utilized in conjunction with DAAs in certain circumstances.  \nThe current versions of those standing orders are attached hereto as composite \nExhibit B.  It should be noted that the content of standing orders may need to be \nadjusted from time-to-time to reflect provider feedback, adjustments in \nadministration, or new information.  \n  Timetable:  Ongoing. \nI.  MONITORING THOSE WHO HAVE FIBROSIS STAGES 0-1 \n \n  All cHCV inmates who are known to be in fibrosis stages 0-1 will be \nmonitored regularly with both labs and proprietary indices for re-staging at least \nannually into a higher priority level (Supplement 3, page 9). \nPage 6 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 15 of 31\n  Timetable:  Ongoing. \n \nJ.  EXPANSION OF SYSTEM CAPACITY \n \n  The FDC’s medical contractor, Centurion, will be adding a specialty \nphysician to assist with identification, evaluation, and staging for treatment with \nDAAs.  Also, Centurion will be adding eleven infection control nurses whose \nduties are anticipated to include ordering tests and coordinating medication \nadministration.  In addition, the FDC will hire a specialty physician as a project \nconsultant to assist with oversight and administration of this program.  Moreover, \nexisting health services staff from Centurion who are located at prisons will \nundergo additional HCV training, and shift responsibilities as necessary to \nparticipate in the screening, monitoring, testing, and medication administration. \n  Timetable:  By January 31, 2018. \nK.  TRACKING OF INMATES WHO HAVE CHRONIC HEPATITIS C \n \n  FDC has significantly enhanced its ability to identify and track those inmates \nwho have HCV.  For example, new computer codes have been created for HCV \ninmates that will indicate whether they have acute hepatitis or, instead, cHCV, and \nalso indicate whether they have been treated with DAAs, and have achieved cure, \ni.e., a Sustained Viral Response (“SVR”).  \n  Timetable:  Complete. \nPage 7 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 16 of 31\n \n \nL.  TRACKING OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION \n \n  FDC has begun to produce weekly pharmacy reports that would indicate the \ninmates who are receiving DAA medication.  Medical administration of DAAs will \nalso be tracked at the patient level by virtue of Medication Administration Records \n(MARs).  \n  Timetable:  Ongoing. \nM.  REFERRAL FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTS \n \n  In accordance with Supplement 3, the FDC will determine the MELD score \nfor all patients with decompensated cirrhosis.  If the score meets the \nlisting/eligibility criteria maintained by the liver transplant centers in Florida, the \npatient will be referred to the transplant center.  Thereafter, co-management as \ndirected by the transplant center will be instituted if the patient is listed for \ntransplant.  (Supplement 3, page 12). \n  Timetable:  January 31, 2018, while referrals are ongoing. \n \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n            PAMELA JO BONDI \n            ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \n \nPage 8 of 9 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 17 of 31\nEXHIBIT B \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 18 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 1 of 14 \n \n  \nMANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS C \n \n \n  This guideline describes departmental recommendations for the screening, evaluation, \ntreatment, and monitoring of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV).  \n \n \nA.  GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING HEPATITIS C  \n   \n1.  Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) which is found in \nthe blood of persons who have this disease.  HCV is spread by contact with the blood of \nan infected person.   \n \n2.  Risk factors for infection may include, but are not limited to, injection drug use, \ntransfusion with HCV-infected blood or blood products, tattooing, vertical transmission \nfrom mother to child, and massive exposure to HCV-infected blood during fighting or \nother trauma. \n \n3.  The average incubation period is six to nine weeks, with a range from two weeks to six \nmonths.  Therefore, acute HCV infection usually is established within 3-6 months of \nthe contact with the infected blood. \n \n4.  Those individuals who spontaneously clear hepatitis C usually do so within the first six \nmonths of being infected.  Many patients have no symptoms of acute hepatitis. \n \n5.  Approximately 50-80% of individuals infected with hepatitis C will not spontaneously \nclear the virus.  For them, the infection becomes chronic.  \n \n6.  Chronic hepatitis C (sometimes abbreviated as “cHCV”) is characterized by the \npersistent presence of HCV-RNA detectable in blood/serum, i.e., the HCV viral load \n(HCV-VL).  Those patients who are HCV-VL+ in the context of the correctional setting \nusually have chronic HCV disease.   \n \n7.  The principal consequence of cHCV is infection of the liver, which causes \ninflammation that may, in turn, result in scarring of the liver, which is known as \n“fibrosis.”  The amount of liver scarring a patient has is usually measured on the \nMETAVIR scale.  On this scale, a person can be classified as F0 (inflammation, but no \nfibrosis), F1 (mild fibrosis), F2 (moderate fibrosis), F3 (severe fibrosis), or F4 \n(cirrhosis).   \n \n8.  Liver scarring can significantly impair liver function, and can place a patient at risk for \nseveral serious symptoms/complications, as well as liver failure or liver cancer. \n \n9.  For a depiction of the natural history of HCV, see Diagram 1, below. \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 19 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 2 of 14 \n \n \n \nReproduced with permission from UpToDate, Inc. www.uptodate.com. Copyright © 2017. \n \nB.  THE PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS \n \n1.  Progression of cHCV to fibrosis and cirrhosis may take years in some patients and \ndecades in others, or, in some cases, may not occur at all.  The rate at which patients \nprogress along the METAVIR scale, and can progress toward serious \nsymptoms/complications differs among the population, and can be influenced by a \nvariety of factors. \n \n2.  Patients with cirrhosis may develop decompensated cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular \ncarcinoma over time.  Factors associated with rapid progression or death (less than 20 \nyears from infection to cirrhosis) can include, but are not limited to, ALT elevation \n(especially if ALT>200, or “ALT flare”), active alcohol and drug abuse, grade 3 \ninflammation (Batts and Ludwig classification) on liver biopsy, presence of bridging \nfibrosis (Batts and Ludwig S3+/Metavir F3+) on liver biopsy, genotype 3 infection, HIV \nco-infection, HBV co-infection (those with HIV+HBV +HCV co-infection and \ndetectable viremia of both HIV+HBV are at highest risk), hepatic steatosis and NASH, \ndiabetes and insulin resistance, obesity, daily use of marijuana, and uncontrolled \nunderlying liver disease.  HCV risk behaviors that occur 10 or more years prior to the \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 20 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 3 of 14 \n \ncHCV diagnsosis, the male gender, and whether an individual is age 40 or more at the \ntime of infection, are also associated with a rapid progression, but are less significant in \nmultivariate analysis. \n \n3.  The rapid accumulation of data since 2013 regarding hepatic fibrosis and progression to \nend stage liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma or \nprimary liver cancer) has indicated that the risk for rapid progression within one year \nbegins to be measurable when the patient reaches F2. There is an ~0.5% and ~1.0% one-\nyear risk of progressing to hepatocellular carcinoma and decompensated cirrhosis, \nrespectively, once the patient can be staged as F2 (Whether this is due to \nunderestimation of the actual stage with present staging methods or represents very rapid \nprogression of hepatic fibrosis is unknown).  The best data continues to indicate that \nrisks of progression in one year to hepatocellular carcinoma or decompensated cirrhosis \nin the patient with F3 and F4 fibrosis is 1%, 2% or 1.5-2%, 4%, respectively. \n \n4.  On the other hand, the factors associated with non-progression of hepatic fibrosis are not \nfully understood at this time, and may be less well-studied due to treatment bias. Non \nprogression is more likely in patients with the following characteristics: female sex, age \n<40yrs, BMI<30, Batts and Ludwig inflammation Grade 0-1, Batts and Ludwig S0-\n1/Metavir F0-1, IL28B genotype (with C/C and C/T genotypes less likely to be \nassociated with advanced hepatic fibrosis), and normal ALT ( ≥75% do not have \nadvanced hepatic fibrosis). African-American race (slower progression/histology less \nsevere in black patients), patients whose HCV risk behaviors have happened in the \nrecent past (usually <5-10yrs), and those without an alcohol abuse history also have less \nrisk. \n \n5.  The contribution of sobriety/cessation of injection drug use to slowing the progression of \nhepatic fibrosis is also highly significant in terms of positive lifestyle behaviors \nassociated with improved quality and length of life, especially if the patient achieves a \nsustained viral response (SVR), which is considered to be a cure.  Additionally, statin \nuse has been associated with a lower progression rate, and coffee (caffeinated only) \nconsumption has been demonstrated in both retrospective and prospective trials to be \nassociated with reduced hepatic fibrosis.  \n \n6.  For a depiction of the progression of cHCV, and priority for treatment, see Diagram 2, \nbelow. \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 21 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 4 of 14 \n \n \n \n \nC.  THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE HCV TREATMENT, NOT JUST VIRAL \nERADICATION \n \n1.  Identifying patients who need treatment sooner than others, and would benefit most, is a \ncomplex task requiring evaluation of multiple and diverse factors.  The positive outcomes \nof increased survival and improved quality of life associated with successful viral \neradication and a sustained viral response (SVR) are dependent upon sobriety and \npositive lifestyle change.1   \n \n2.  Patients have a responsibility to learn from past behaviors and interact with society \npositively. Evaluation and treatment of chronic health problems such as chronic HCV and \nsubstance abuse play a crucial role in patients establishing trust and developing healthy \nbehaviors, thereby reducing their rates of substance abuse relapse and correctional \nrecidivism. \n \n                                                           \n1  For example, a long-term Danish study demonstrated an 18.2-fold increased mortality risk among younger patients \nwith chronic HCV that was not due to their liver disease but, instead, was due to unnatural death: i.e., mortality \nassociated with untreated mental illness and substance abuse associated suicide, homicide, and trauma. Liver related \nmortality only becomes more prevalent as the population ages.  Therefore, sobriety is key to an overall harm \nreduction. (Clin Gastro and Hepatology 2011; 9:71-78). \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 22 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 5 of 14 \n \n3. The benefits of evaluation and treatment of cHCV go beyond the immediate goal of viral \neradication in the individual. cHCV treatment is one part of a multi-part strategy to promote \nhealthy lifestyles, which in turn benefits the patient, his/her family, and society. \n \n4.  Any patients interested in cHCV evaluation should understand that further laboratory testing, \nliver biopsy, imaging, or another method for staging hepatic fibrosis may be required prior \nto and during therapy. The risk and side effects of evaluation, the proposed treatment \nregimen and the need for monitoring must be fully discussed with the patients.  \n \n5.  If there is reasonable documented concern about a patient’s ability to adhere to and benefit \nfrom a standardized treatment regimen, and these concerns are not able to be resolved \nthrough a cooperative treatment plan, treatment should not be initiated. Patients will be re-\nevaluated for treatment compliance in accordance with their Gastrointestinal Clinic (GC) \nscheduling.  \n \n6.  Behavioral risk reduction and substance abuse counseling is an integral part of cHCV \ntreatment.  The use of peer educators has been shown to potentially have the greatest impact \nin this area.  Patients should have pro-sobriety attitudes assessed and documented in the \nmedical record.  Patients with high propensity for relapse may need more extended time \nperiods of sobriety prior to treatment as deemed appropriate by the clinical care committee \nor equivalent.  Unfortunately, there is no evidence at this time that institutionally-mandated \nsubstance abuse programs improve outcomes over incarceration alone.  However, patient-\ndriven substance abuse treatment such as Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous \ngroups with peer educators and sponsors have demonstrated improved outcomes and \ndecreased substance abuse relapse rates post-release.  Patients should be encouraged to \nparticipate in these programs.  \n \nD.  EDUCATION FOR NEWLY INCARCERATED INMATES REGARDING HCV \n \nAll newly incarcerated patients should be provided with educational information regarding \nprevention, transmission, risk factors, and screening of HCV.   The form for this should \ninclude peer-to-peer education. \n \nE.  MONITORING OR TREATMENT FOR ACUTE HEPATITIS   \n \n1.  HCV-VL shall be monitored at 6 months after the date of first diagnosis.  If viremia \npersists after that time, continue to monitor and manage the case as a chronic infection.  \n \n2.  In some cases when acute HCV infection superimposes on patients with established \ncirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, there may be a compelling reason to treat the acute \ninfection as a chronic infection in order to prevent severe complications.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 23 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 6 of 14 \n \nF.  SCREENING OF PATIENTS FOR THE PRESENCE OF cHCV, AND THE AMOUNT \nOF FIBROSIS \n \n Screening for cHCV will be offered to all patients, regardless of risk factors, at multiple \nopportunities throughout incarceration.  Patients may request screening as well.  Screening \nshould include the following components:   \n \n1.  The preferred screening test for HCV infection is an immunoassay that detects the \npresence of antibodies to HCV antigens (referred to as HCV-Ab, or Anti-HCV).  \n \n2.  If there is the presence of HCV-Ab, the specimen should be automatically analyzed for \nHCV-RNA (the HCV viral load, or HCV-VL) to immediately establish the presence or \nabsence of chronic HCV.   \n \n3.  In patients with a detectable viral load (HCV-VL), the specimen will also then be \nanalyzed by a proprietary predictive index (e.g. FibroSURE), to initially assess the \namount of fibrosis (liver scarring).  Note: Proprietary indices that predict hepatic fibrosis \nstage such as FibroSURE, Fibrometer™ or FibroSPECT™ utilize a combination of age, \nsex, and a battery of laboratory parameters to predict the fibrosis score (F0-F4). \nProprietary indices are widely utilized in the U.S. correctional system and in some \ncommunities in combination with ultrasound liver imaging to estimate the stage of \nhepatic fibrosis, especially in areas which are resource or access challenged, which would \nmake routine elastography or other imaging very difficult. \n \n4.  HCV-VL+ patients who have been diagnosed to have F2, F3, or F4 will be reviewed and \nan abdominal ultrasound ordered to rule out  the presence of portal hypertension \n(indicative of advanced hepatic fibrosis). \n  \nG.  EDUCATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE FOUND TO BE INFECTED WITH cHCV \n \nOnce patients are found to be infected with chronic HCV, they  should be counseled by a \nclinician during the initial visit regarding the natural history of the infection, measures to \nassess the progress of cHCV, potential treatment options, and specific measures to prevent \ntransmitting the HCV infection to others.  \n \nH.  EVALUATION AND MONITORING IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL CLINIC  \n \n1. The following patients will be enrolled in the Gastrointestinal Clinic (“GC”)  for  \nevaluation and monitoring: (a) those with active cHCV who are not being treated with \ndirect-acting antiviral medication, (b) those who have had HCV treatment failure, and (c) \nthose who have had a relapse of HCV infection or reinfection.   \n \n2.  In the GC clinic, the patient will receive  the following: (a) a baseline history and \nphysical examination; (b) labs and other tests (see below), including a proprietary \npredictive index, if not previously provided, and an abdominal ultrasound, if not \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 24 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 7 of 14 \n \npreviously provided; (c) an assessment and discussion with the patient of the results of \nthe proprietary predictive index and abdominal ultrasound; (d) an evaluation and \nassessment of the need for preventive health interventions such as vaccines and \nscreenings for other conditions; and (e) counseling on cHCV infection.  \n \n3.  Patients who are fibrosis stage 4 (F4), or stage 3 (F3) shall be seen every six (6) months \nor sooner, if indicated, shall receive laboratory testing every 3-6 months, and shall \nreceive an abdominal ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCa) surveillance every \nsix (6) months.  \n \n4. Patients who are fibrosis stage 2 (F2), stage 1 (F1) or stage 0 (F0) shall be seen every six \n(6) months, and shall receive laboratory testing every six (6) months, and the proprietary \npredictive indices and/or elastography every twelve (12) months. \n \n5.  Each patient’s fibrosis stage will be recorded as F0-F4.  If available, the patient’s Child-\nTurcotte-Pugh score will be recorded as well.  In particular, consider the following: \n \n(a)  The history and physical examination: Focus on signs and symptoms of liver \ndisease, prior alcohol consumption, and risk behaviors for acquiring HCV infection. \nBased on this information and the period in which the patient engaged in injection \ndrug use or other risk behaviors, attempt to estimate earliest possible date of \ninfection.  Evaluate for other possible causes of liver disease, including alcoholism, \nnon- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), iron overload (hemochromatosis), and auto-\nimmune hepatitis. Inquire about prior treatment for HCV infection, specific \nmedications used, dosages and duration of treatment, and outcomes, if known.  \n  \n  (b)  Laboratory and Other tests:  \n \n(1) This will include a complete blood count (CBC); Prothrombin time (PT) with \nInternational Normalization Ratio (INR); and a comprehensive metabolic panel \n(CMP).   \n \n(2) Laboratory testing consistent with cirrhosis may include elevated bilirubin, \ndecreased albumin, and prolonged INR, but these tests are only used to quantify \ncirrhosis.  Use of predictive indices uses laboratory markers to predict the state \nof hepatic fibrosis. \n \n(3) Elastography methods (using either ultrasound or MRI) may be critical in \ndetermining the fibrosis stage. Imaging studies may also identify cirrhosis, and \nnot require further staging. 2 \n \n                                                           \n2 A recent review of the use of liver imaging and biopsy in clinical practice (Use of Liver Imaging and Biopsy in \nClinical Practice; Tapper EB and S.-F. Lok, NEJM 377:8:756-768) indicates that present non-invasive elastography \nmodalities have been shown to be reliable in detecting advanced hepatic fibrosis, are cheaper, easily repeated for \nserial monitoring, and thus long-term outcomes may be accurately predicted. \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 25 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 8 of 14 \n \n(4)  A liver biopsy is no longer required unless otherwise clinically indicated. \n \n(5) Abdominal imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scan may identify findings \nconsistent with or suggestive of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or hepatocellular \ncarcinoma (HCC).  \n \nCTP calculators are available at:  http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/page/clinical-\ncalculators/ctp \n \n(c)  Screening for other conditions: There should be screening for the Hepatitis A \nantibody (HAV-Ab), and the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), unless these were \nalready known from a prior Hepatitis Panel, and also testing for the HIV antibody \n(HIV- Ab). If risky behavior occurred after previously negative testing, repeat the \ntesting.  An anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and ferritin should be ordered as screening \nfor auto-immune hepatitis and hepatic iron overload. \n \n(d)  Counseling: Patients should be counseled regarding the progression of cHCV, the \nstaging of treatment with direct acting antiviral medication (DAAs), other potential \ntreatment options, the availability of peer-to-peer counseling, and specific measures \nto prevent transmitting HCV infection to others. \n \nI.  PRIORITIZATION FOR TREATMENT WITH DAAs    \n \n1.  Although many patients with chronic HCV infection may benefit from treatment with \ndirect-acting antiviral medication (DAAs), certain cases are at higher risk for \ncomplications or disease progression and require more urgent consideration.   \n \n2.  Eligibility for DAA treatment should be established via concordance between laboratory, \nimaging (abdominal ultrasound, and elastography if available), and predictive scoring \n(proprietary indices). Resource challenged systems may use the combination of \nproprietary indices and abdominal ultrasound to assess for the presence of F2-F4 hepatic \nfibrosis. \n \n3.  Within the eligible group of patients, the following priority criteria have been established \nto ensure that those with the greatest need are treated first. \n  \n(a)  PRIORITY LEVEL 1 - Highest Priority for Evaluation and Treatment  \n  The following individuals should receive DAA treatment within 0-6 months \n(subject to paragraph K, below):  \n \n(1) Fibrosis Stage 4, decompensated cirrhosis, including both symptomatic patients \n(e.g., with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, etc.) and \nasymptomatic patients with CTP scores greater than or equal to 7. \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 26 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 9 of 14 \n \n(2) Fibrosis Stage 4, compensated cirrhosis, with CTP scores greater than 5 and less \nthan 7. \n \n(3) Liver transplant candidates or recipients in consultation with and co-managed by \na transplant hepatologist. \n \n(4) Hepatocellular carcinoma in consultation with a hepatologist for correct timing. \n \n(5) Comorbid medical conditions associated with HCV, including cryoglobulinemia \nwith renal disease or vasculitis, certain types of lymphomas, hematologic \nmalignancies or metabolic abnormalities. \n \n(6) Continuity of care for those entering custody already on treatment.  \n \n(7) Patients taking immunosuppressant medications for a comorbid medical condition \nwhich may cause rapid progression of hepatic fibrosis. \n \n(8) HIV co-infection. \n \n(9) HBV co-infection. \n \n(b)  PRIORITY LEVEL 2 - Intermediate Priority for Evaluation and Treatment  \nThe following individuals should receive DAA treatment within 12 months \n(subject to paragraph J, below): \n \n(1) Fibrosis stage 3 (F3) \n \n(2)  Fibrosis stage 2 (F2).  \n \n(3)  Comorbid liver disease (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis,  \n steatohepatitis). \n \n(4)  Chronic Kidney Disease with proteinuria.  \n \n(5)  Diabetes Mellitus. \n \n(6)  Patients previously staged as F0, but who advanced in staging to F1 within 1-4  \nyears are considered to have progressive hepatic fibrosis, and should be treated in \nthis priority group. \n \n(c) PRIORITY LEVEL 3 – Active Monitoring for DAA Treatment  \nThe following individuals should be monitored regularly with labs and \nproprietary predictive indices for re-staging at least annually into a higher \npriority level: \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 27 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 10 of 14 \n \n(1)  Fibrosis stage 1 (F1). \n \n(2)  Fibrosis stage 0 (F0).  \n \n \nJ.  OTHER CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE TREATMENT WITH DIRECT-\nACTING ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION  \n \n1.  In addition to meeting the above criteria for Priority Level 1 and Priority Level 2, \npatients being considered for treatment of cHCV infection should 1) have no \ncontraindications to, or significant drug interactions with, any component of the \ntreatment regimen, 2) have sufficient time remaining on their sentence in the \nDepartment of Corrections to complete pre-treatment evaluation, a course of treatment, \nand post treatment SVR assessment at 8-24 weeks, in order for patient education and \nsystem efficiencies to be evaluated (generally, this requires approximately 12-18 \nmonths), 3) have a life expectancy sufficient to achieve benefit from HCV viral \neradication, and 4) demonstrate willingness and an ability to adhere to a rigorous  \ntreatment regimen and to abstain from high risk behaviors while incarcerated.  \n \n2.  A cHCV patient’s attitude, functional ability to thrive within the system, and optimal \ntreatment of mental health issues are critical for good outcomes.  Patients who have \nchronic disciplinary issues within the system have very high substance abuse relapse \nrates upon release, with newer evidence indicating higher re-infection rates.  Patients \nshould be counseled and observed on a case-by-case basis, and involvement of mental \nhealth professionals is critical. It is also critical to remember that patients who have \nchronic behavioral management issues, common in jails/prisons, are rarely able to \nestablish and maintain a therapeutic provider-patient relationship which results in \ncompletion of treatment and an SVR. \n \n3.  Patients who are Priority Level 1 or Priority Level 2, but who (1) are unable to \ndemonstrate a willingness and an ability to adhere to a rigorous treatment regimen, (2) \ndo not abstain from high risk behaviors while incarcerated, (3) have chronic disciplinary \nissues, or (4) have chronic behavioral management issues may not be eligible for \ntreatment until those issues are considered to be resolved.  A patient should be willing to \nparticipate in any available counseling or treatment in order to achieve the \nsobriety/behavior change before treatment with DAAs is initiated.  \n \nK.  RECOMMENDED TREATMENT REGIMENS  \n \n1.  Recommendations for HCV treatment regimens continue to evolve, and are changing \nrapidly as new agents become available and as evidence of the most effective ways to \nutilize the DAAs accumulates.  Usually 8-12 week regimens are preferred due to \nimproved adherence, lower toxicity, and cost-effectiveness.   \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 28 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 11 of 14 \n \n2.  The AASLD/IDSA/IAS3 website, which is found at hcvguidelines.org, presents reliable \nsummaries of drug treatment data and should be used to direct most treatment.   \n \n3.  Expert consultation is required in patients eligible for liver transplantation.   \n \n4.  Treatment of chronic HCV during pregnancy is presently not recommended due to the \nlack of safety data. \n \nL.  TREATMENT FAILURE FOLLOWING DAA TREATMENT  \n \n1.  Treatment failure is defined as a detectable HCV-VL 12 weeks following completion of \ntherapy.   \n \n2.  If the HCV-VL is <50 copies/ml or in the “non-quantifiable” range then the test should \nbe repeated in 4 weeks as this situation usually represents lab error or very slow clearance \nof virus; the repeat testing will usually be “not detected.”   \n \n3.  In the case of true failure, the medical record should be reviewed for non-adherence, \nsystem failure in drug dispensing (e.g., omissions in directly observed therapy, not \nproviding refills on time, etc.), possible drug-drug interactions, and the patient should be \ninterviewed for illicit drug use and the ingestion of other acid-lowering medications or \nsupplements.   \n \n4.  If no interfering risk factors are identified, the possibility of viral mutation causing drug \nresistance (Resistance-Associated Substitutions) should be considered.   \n \n5.  Further resistance testing and a secondary treatment regimen should be selected \naccording to the principle and treatment recommendations contained in \nhcvguidelines.org. \n \nM.  TREATMENT MONITORING   \n \n1.  The patient will have an outpatient clinic visit at 2-4 weeks after starting therapy in order \nto establish adherence to the prescribed regimen, and assess for side effects and the need \nfor treatment modification.  DAA regimens usually do not require routine lab \nmonitoring, unless clinical symptoms of increased fatigue or other side effects occur.  \n \n2.  A CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) equivalent may be drawn at 4 weeks \nto rule out transaminase elevation due to autoimmune hepatitis or HBV reactivation. The \nCMP may also be used to reassure the patient that there is evidence of efficacy and \nencourage further adherence and program compliance.    \n                                                           \n3 AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases); IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America); \nIAS (International Aids Society) \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 29 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 12 of 14 \n \n \n3.  Progressive increases in the ALT may require more frequent monitoring or early \ndiscontinuation.   \n \n4.  For regimens containing RIBAVIRIN: a CBC and CMP should also be drawn 2 weeks \nafter starting therapy, then at 4 weeks, then monthly or more frequently as clinically \nindicated.  A Ribavirin dosage adjustment may be required.  Mild (1-3x upper limit of \nnormal) elevation of the total bilirubin may be expected as a consequence of Ribavirin-\ninduced oxidative stress and RBC Lysis. Pregnancy testing is required prior to treatment \nwith ribavirin-containing regimen, and thereafter as risk behavior for pregnancy occurs. \n \nN.  POST-TREATMENT MONITORING   \n \n1.  A post-treatment quantitative HCV-VL assessment will be drawn at 12 weeks after \ncompletion of treatment; and if HCV is undetectable, that defines a sustained viral \nresponse (SVR).   \n \n2.  A patient who sustains SVR may be removed from the Gastrointestinal Clinic (GC), so \nlong as the patient has no cirrhosis, complications, or related comorbidities.  \n \n \nO. OTHER HEALTH CARE INTERVENTION RECOMMENDED FOR CIRRHOSIS \n \n1.  All patients with cirrhosis shall have additional consultative co-management as follows: \n \n(a)  At first identification of a F4 diagnosis the Platelet/Spleen diameter ratio shall be \ncomputed (example: 112,000/131 (mm) = 855).  All patients with values <905 shall \nbe referred for EGD for diagnosis of esophageal varices.  If varices are present, non-\nselective beta-blockers to prevent variceal bleeding shall be initiated.  Alternatively, \nsome selected patients may require banding of varices; however, beta-blocker \nprophylaxis is preferred and recommended in accordance with AASLD \nrecommendations. \n \n(b) Patients with decompensated cirrhosis shall be co-managed by a gastroenterologist or \nhepatologist.  Decisions for co-management including ongoing variceal surveillance, \nantibiotic prophylaxis if risk factors are present for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, \noptimized diuretic therapy for ascites, and optimized therapy for hepatic \nencephalopathy shall be addressed during the consultation.  \n \n2.  In general, NSAIDs should be avoided in advanced liver disease/cirrhosis and \nMETFORMIN should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis. Other resources should be \nconsulted for more specific recommendations related to management of cirrhosis. \n \nP. REFERRAL FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTS FOR PATIENTS WITH \nDECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-00214-MW-CAS   Document 185   Filed 12/13/17   Page 30 of 31\nHSB 15.03.09 Supplement #3 – Revised 12/6/17 \n            Hepatitis C Virus Infection Management \nPage 13 of 14 \n \n \nA determination of the UNOS MELD score will be made for all patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis.  If the score meets the listing/eligibility criteria maintained by \nthe liver transplant centers in Florida, the patient will be referred to the transplant center.  \nThereafter, co-management as directed by the transplant center will be instituted if the \npatient is listed for transplant. \n \n \nQ. HCV TREATMENT APPROVAL PROCESS \n \nTreatment of all genotypes will be coordinated through the Regional Medical Director and if \napplicable, the Hepatitis C Program Director in order to determine site and mode of therapy.  \nPatients previously unsuccessfully treated may be considered for treatment on a case by case \nbasis.  \n \nR. REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION AND DATA ENTRY \n \nIn accordance with HSB 15.03.05 Appendix #8, patients with chronic liver disease should be \nenrolled in Gastrointestinal Clinic (GC) with baseline information completed prior to start of \ntreatment using DC4-770GG-Gastrointestinal Baseline History and Procedures. \n \nDocumentation of evaluation of treatment should be entered on form DC4-701F (Chronic \nIllness Clinic).   The encounter should be entered in the OFFENDER-BASED \nINFORMATION SYSTEM (OBIS) as a GC appointment using the appropriate diagnosis code \nas shown below. \n \n1.  GH08 – Front Page. Add the following codes as determined: \n \n(a)  For Acute hepatitis C - use ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code B17.1  \n(Note: Per Section E.1. above, if viremia persists at 6 months after the date of \nfirst diagnosis, continue to monitor and manage the case as a chronic \ninfection.  This requires a change in OBIS code in accordance with R.1.b. If \nviremia does not persist at 6 months, remove code B17.1, but continue to \nmonitor for other health issues.)      \n \n  (b)  For Chronic viral hepatitis C – use ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code B18.2  \n  \n \n2.
