          "description": "MINUTE ENTRY. Teleconference held before the Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey on July 26, 2019. Mr. Morgan stated that the Attorney General will file his amicus brief in opposition to the proposed consent judgment today. Mr. Morgan asked the Court to stay consideration of the proposed consent judgment pending his appeal of the Court's order denying the Attorney General's motion to intervene. The Court struck the trial setting and will consider the arguments raised in the briefing regarding whether the Court should approve the proposed consent judgment. If the proposed consent judgment is entered, the Court would stay its operation pending appeal. Mr. Rothert and Mr. Mermelstein requested an opportunity to be heard regarding the stay if the consent judgment is entered. Appearances: Plaintiffs by Anthony Rothert, Jason Williamson, Gillian Wilcox and Amy Breihan. Defendants by Greg Mermelstein. Missouri Attorney General by Jeremiah Morgan. Courtroom Deputy: Renea Matthes Mitra. Court Reporter: Katie Wirt (Text entry only.) To order a transcript of this hearing please contact Katie Wirt, 816-512-5608, katie_wirt@mow.uscourts.gov.

    "summary": "<p>On March 9, 2017, the plaintiffs filed this class action suit challenging the adequacy of the Missouri State Public Defender (MSPD) on behalf of all indigent adults and juveniles who were charged with any offense that carries the potential for incarceration as a penalty and who are eligible to be represented by MSPD. The complaint was originally filed in Circuit Court of Cole County but defendants removed it to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri on April 7, 2017. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the MacArthur Justice Center sued the State of Missouri along with its governor under 42 &sect;U.S.C &sect;1983, alleging a violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel also guaranteed by the Missouri Constitution Art. I, &sect; 18(a) and the Missouri Criminal and Juvenile Codes. The plaintiffs also alleged a violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments right to due process, also guaranteed by the Missouri Constitution Art. I, &sect; 10. The lawsuit asked the court to declare Missouri&rsquo;s public defense system unconstitutional and to order the defendants to take the steps &ldquo;necessary to bring the system into compliance with federal and state law.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that the State of Missouri had failed \"to provide the resources required to adequately represent poor people accused of crime in Missouri, leading to the actual and constructive denial of counsel for, and ineffective representation of, indigent defendant across the State.&rdquo; Moreover, it stated that the budget for indigent defense was &ldquo;shockingly inadequate\" and alleged that attorneys had little time to spend on each case, causing poor defendants to needlessly sit in jail for prolonged periods until their public defender has time to work on their case. The complaint stated that there was a lack of attorneys at arraignments and bond hearings, and that many appointed attorneys were unprepared to effectively advocate for a client.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Nanette Laughrey and was also included in Missouri's Mediation and Assessment Program with Magistrate Judge Matt J. Whitworth assigned to be the mediator. On April 21, 2017, the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On June 6, 2017, the case was reassigned to an outside mediator.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs requested the court to certify their class on June 8, 2017. The proposed class consisted of \"all indigent persons who are now or who will be during the pendency of this litigation, under formal charge before a state court in Missouri of having committed any offense the penalty for which includes the possibility of</p>\r\n<p>confinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or detention (regardless of whether</p>\r\n<p>actually imposed), and who are eligible to be represented by MSPD.\"</p>\r\n<p>On July 5, 2017 the court held oral argument on the defendants' motions to dismiss, and on July 24, 2017 Judge Laughrey granted the defendant's motion to dismiss in part as to one of the plaintiffs who lacked standing to sue. 268 F.Supp.3d 992. The court denied the motion as to the other plaintiffs. Regarding the state of Missouri, the court found that the state had waived sovereign immunity by removing the case to federal court. The court also denied the motion to dismiss as it related to the governor of Missouri, finding that the plaintiffs had alleged that the governor had a sufficient connection to the challenged conduct to place him squarely within the <em>Ex Parte Young</em> exception to sovereign immunity.</p>\r\n<p>On August 18, 2017, two Defendants, the state of Missouri and its Governor, appealed to the Eighth Circuit their denied motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. (Docket No. 17-2857). Arguments were held on April 10, 2018,</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the district court, the parties began discovery until, on January 18, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to stay the case pending resolution of the appeal to the Eighth Circuit. The same day, the defendants filed a motion to realign the MSPD defendants as plaintiffs. The plaintiffs submitted an opposition to the realignment on January 31, contending that there was no legal basis to realign the MSPD defendants as plaintiffs and that there were actual and substantial conflicts between the two groups. On February 9, both parties filed their respective motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs sought summary judgment on all of their declaratory and injunctive claims and an order requiring the defendants to propose a plan to provide adequate representation to all indigent criminal defendants in Missouri within 30 days. The defendants contended that the Eleventh Amendment immunity barred all claims to the state, that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing, and that the plaintiffs failed to state plausible constitutional claims. On the same day, the defendants filed a motion to strike the designation of plaintiffs&rsquo; experts and exclude the testimony of the experts at trial. The plaintiffs submitted an opposition to the motion to strike on March 2. The motions to realign the MSPD defendants, the parties&rsquo; motions for summary judgment, and the motion to strike the plaintiffs&rsquo; experts were all denied on April 17, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>In an opinion written by Judge Benton, the Eighth Circuit reversed the judgment of the district court in favor of the defendants on January 10, 2019. 913 F.3d 736. Regarding the state of Missouri, the Eighth Circuit held that sovereign immunity is broader than Eleventh Amendment immunity and in the absence of an express statutory exception or a recognized common law exception, sovereign immunity is the rule and applies to all suits against public entities. The Eighth Circuit also reversed the district court's holding regarding the governor, rebutting point by point how the <em>Ex Parte Young</em> exception did not apply in this case.</p>\r\n<p>The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The plaintiffs&rsquo; claims against the state of Missouri and the governer were denied on February 26, 2019, and Judge Laughrey also denied the plaintiffs' class certification. 2019 WL 954982. The defendants&rsquo; motion to stay was also denied as moot.</p>\r\n<p>District Judge Laughrey, in light of the Eighth Circuit decision, ordered parties to proceed with mediation on March 1, 2019. The parties submitted a joint motion to enter a consent judgment, proposing a variety of obligations to MSPD on May 13. Specifically, the consent judgment proposed that the MSPD must ensure public defenders argue for release at every client&rsquo;s initial appearance, implement a caseload standard on individual public defenders, and provide for a monitor to ensure compliance.</p>\r\n<p>The following day, the Attorney General filed a motion to intervene as a defendant and sought a temporary stay on the litigation. The Attorney General contended that despite their right to participate in litigation concerning the state&rsquo;s interest, the proposed consent judgment did not adequately consult the Attorney General in the mediation process. The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the two motions on May 28.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2019, the motion to intervene was denied but the court permitted the Attorney General to submit an amicus brief addressing whether the proposed consent judgment comported with Missouri law, as well as other concerns on public safety and welfare. 2019 WL 3069856. On July 26, the Attorney General submitted the amicus brief and appealed the intervention decision to the Eighth Circuit with a motion to stay pending appeal. (Docket No. 19-2584). The district court partially granted the motion to stay and decided to stay the consent order pending resolution of the ruling.</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2020, the parties&rsquo; joint motion for consent judgment was denied by the district court. Judge Laughrey determined that the rigid caseload capacity ceiling would impose an impossible constraint upon the public defenders in trying to comply with the consent decree and court orders to defend indigent clients. 2020 WL 420833.</p>\r\n<p>The parties engaged in a teleconference before the court on May 8, 2020. There, Judge Laughrey told the plaintiffs that they must either dismiss the case without prejudice or proceed to a bench trial. The plaintiffs opted for a bench trial, and Judge Laughrey noted that discovery was closed but permitted the parties to participate in consensual discovery. In another teleconference hearing held on May 19, the Defendants argued that only one plaintiff still had standing and therefore any remedy must be tailored to her specific case.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2020, the parties notified the court that they had reached a resolution. The case was dismissed without prejudice on June 15, 2020. On June 16, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the pending appeal before the Eighth Circuit as moot given that the district court case concluded. On June 18, the Attorney General agreed to dismissal. The Eighth Circuit granted the motion on July 8, 2020 and remanded to the district court with orders to vacate the July 12, 2019 order denying the Attorney General&rsquo;s motion to intervene. On August 4, the district court did so. This case is now closed.</p>",

Parson,  in His Official Capacity as \n[1]\nGovernor of the State of Missouri, Defendants-Appellants 737*737 \nMichael Barrett; H. Riley Bock; Charles R. Jackson; Craig Chval; A. \nCrista Hogan, Defendants \nNo. 17-2857. \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. \nSubmitted: April 10, 2018. \nFiled: January 10, 2019. \nAppeal from United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri — Jefferson \nCity. \n741*741 Counsel who presented argument on behalf of the appellants was D. John Sauer, of \nJefferson City, MO. The following attorneys appeared on the appellant brief; Michael \nMartinich-Sauter and Joshua M. Divine of Jefferson City, MO. \nCounsel who presented argument on behalf of the appellees was Matthew R. Shahabian, of \nWashington, DC. The following attorneys also appeared on the appellee brief; Anthony E. \nRothert and Jessie M. Steffan, of Saint Louis, MO., Jason D. Williamson, of New York, NY., \nGillian R. Wilcox, of Kansas City, MO., Amy E. Breihan, of Saint Louis, MO., Aaron \nScherzer, Robert L. Sills and Camille J. Rosca of New York, NY., Easha Anand, Evan \nRose, and Will Melehani of San Francisco, CA., James Maune of Irvine, CA., Marnee R. \nRand of Washington, DC., and Anthony Tartaglio and Annie Prasad of Menlo Park, CA. \nBefore GRUENDER, MELLOY, and BENTON, Circuit Judges. \n740*740 BENTON, Circuit Judge. \nThis is a class action against the State and governor of Missouri, the director of the Missouri \nState Public Defender office, and the commissioners of the Missouri State Public Defender \nCommission. The plaintiffs alleged that the State \"has failed to meet its constitutional \nobligation to provide indigent defendants with meaningful representation.\" Invoking \nsovereign immunity, the State and governor moved to dismiss. The governor also invoked \nlegislative immunity. The district court denied the motion. Church v. Missouri, 268 \nF.Supp.3d 992 (W.D. Mo. 2017). The director and commissioners do not appeal. Having \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 through the collateral order doctrine,  this court \n[2]\nreverses and remands. \n \n\n \n \nI. \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees indigent defendants in criminal cases the right to \nappointed counsel. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344-45, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d \n799 (1963). Because the right to counsel is \"fundamental and essential to a fair trial,\" it is \n\"protected against state invasion by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\" Id. at 341-42, 83 S.Ct. 792. \nThe State usually provides counsel through the Missouri State Public Defender. See State \nex rel. Missouri Pub. Def. Comm'n v. Pratte, 298 S.W.3d 870, 875 (Mo. banc 2009) \n(indigent defense is \"a duty which constitutionally is the burden of the State,\" and \"[w]hen a \ndefendant is found to be indigent in Missouri, the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to \ncounsel is usually met by the judge appointing the `Office of State Public Defender'\") \n(citation omitted). Here, the plaintiffs \"were all charged with crimes in Missouri state court \nand, as a result of their indigency, were entitled to representation by the MSPD.\" They bring \nthis lawsuit \"on behalf of themselves and a putative class of all indigent defendants in \ncriminal and juvenile proceedings in Missouri who are eligible for representation by the \nMSPD.\" The putative class does not include individuals seeking post-conviction \nrelief. See Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035(e), 29.15(e) (requiring appointment of counsel for all pro \nse, indigent, post-conviction movants). \nThe plaintiffs allege: \"The State's indigent defense budget is shockingly \ninadequate.... 742*742 Without sufficient funding, overstretched and under-resourced \n[MSPD] attorneys are forced to handle far too many cases and to devote far too few hours \nto each case.\" They argue they \"have suffered and continue to suffer the denial of adequate \ncounsel at critical stages of their criminal cases due to these systemic caseload problems \namong MSPD attorney.\" They seek \"a declaratory judgment stating that their right to \ncounsel is being violated and an order enjoining the ongoing violation of their rights and \nrequiring Defendants to propose a remedial plan to the court.\" \nII. \nThe State of Missouri invokes sovereign immunity for itself. \"This court reviews de novo \nquestions of sovereign immunity.\" Fryberger, 889 F.3d at 473. \"Sovereign immunity is the \nprivilege of the sovereign not to be sued without its consent.\" Virginia Office for Prot. & \nAdvocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 253, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011). The \nEleventh Amendment is \"one particular exemplification of that immunity.\" Federal Mar. \nComm'n v. South Carolina State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 753, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 \nL.Ed.2d 962 (2002). The State removed this case to federal court, waiving its Eleventh \nAmendment immunity. See Lapides v. Board of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 535 U.S. 613, \n624, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002) (\"We conclude that the State's action joining \nthe removing of this case to federal court waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity\"). \nBut \"[s]tates also enjoy a broader sovereign immunity, which applies against all private \nsuits, whether in state or federal court.\" Beaulieu v. Vermont, 807 F.3d 478, 483 (2d Cir. \n2015), citing Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 \n \n\n \n \n(1999) (\"We have ... sometimes referred to the States' immunity from suit as `Eleventh \nAmendment immunity.' The phrase is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, \nfor the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of \nthe Eleventh Amendment.\"). The Supreme Court \"has repeatedly held that the sovereign \nimmunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh \nAmendment.\" Fed. Mar. Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 754, 122 S.Ct. 1864. \n\"The preeminent purpose of state sovereign immunity is to accord States the dignity that is \nconsistent with their status as sovereign entities.\" Id. at 760, 122 S.Ct. 1864. Developed at \ncommon law, \"immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the \nStates enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution.\" Alden, 527 U.S. at 713, 119 S.Ct. \n2240. See also Nevada v.

Missouri's state sovereign immunity applies unless \"it is \nwaived or a statutory or recognized common law exception, such as consent, is \napplicable.\" Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer Dist. v. City of Bellefontaine Neighbors, 476 \nS.W.3d 913, 914 (Mo. banc 2016). The plaintiffs assert both a waiver and a common-law \nexception, contending that sovereign immunity does not apply in Missouri when a plaintiff \nseeks prospective equitable relief to enforce the State's affirmative duty or obligation. \nA. \nCourts \"give effect\" to a state's waiver of sovereign immunity \"only where stated by the most \nexpress language or by such overwhelming implication from the text as [will] leave no room \nfor any other reasonable construction.'\" Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. \n299, 305, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 109 L.Ed.2d 264 (1990), quoting Atascadero State Hosp. v. \nScanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 239-40, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985). Express language \ndoes appear in section 537.600, RSMo 2016, which \"carve[s] out limited exceptions [for \nnegligent operation of motor vehicles and dangerous conditions of public property] to a \ngeneral rule of immunity.\" Bellefontaine, 476 S.W.3d at 921. \nEmphasizing two Missouri Court of Appeals opinions, the plaintiffs argue that sovereign \nimmunity does not bar a claim for equitable relief to enforce the State's affirmative \"duty or \nobligation.\" In Wyman v. Missouri Department of Mental Health, 376 S.W.3d 16, 23 (Mo. \nApp. 2012), the court of appeals said it \"found no case which applies § 537.600 to a claim \n \n\n \n \nseeking only equitable relief.\" The Court of Appeals then stated that \"sovereign immunity \ndoes not necessarily bar a claim for injunctive relief which seeks to reverse a state agency's \nprior violation of its statutory obligations, or to prevent future violations.\" Wyman, 376 \nS.W.3d at 23. In 2018, the Court of Appeals-citing the district court's decision here-quoted \nand followed Wyman. Missouri State Conf. of NAACP v. State, 563 S.W.3d 138, 147, 2018 \nWL 5492832, at *6 (Mo. App. Oct. 30, 2018). \nBoth the Wyman and NAACP opinions fail to address the abundant contrary Missouri \nauthority on sovereign immunity. In 2016 and 2017, the Supreme Court of Missouri stated: \n\"Sovereign immunity is the rule, not the exception.\" Bellefontaine, 476 S.W.3d at \n914; Newsome v. Kansas City Mo. Sch. Dist., 520 S.W.3d 769, 775 (Mo. banc 2017). Of \ncritical importance here, the Missouri Supreme Court held that \nin the absence of an express statutory exception to sovereign immunity, or a recognized \ncommon law exception such as the proprietary function and consent exceptions, sovereign \nimmunity is the rule and applies to all suits against public entities. \nBellefontaine, 476 S.W.3d at 921-22 (emphasis added). Because—except for statutory and \ncommon-law exceptions—sovereign immunity bars all suits against the State, it bars suits \nfor prospective equitable relief. \nThe plaintiffs claim that Bellefontaine covers only suits for damages because that is all the \nplaintiff there sought. To the contrary, Bellefontaine follows the long-established Missouri \nprecedent on sovereign immunity. Granting injunctive relief against an unconstitutional law \nin 1908, the Missouri Supreme Court held: \nThat the sovereign state may not be sued is a truism.... But defendants.... ministerial \nofficers, charged to be about to do irreparable injury.... are 744*744 not beyond the strong \narm of a court of equity. \nMerchants' Exchange of St. Louis v. Knott, 212 Mo. 616, 111 S.W. 565, 574 (Mo. banc \n1908) (agreeing with the Ex parte Young doctrine for state injunction cases just two months \nafter the United States Supreme Court's decision). The Missouri Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly followed this approach. \nThe amenability of respondents as executive or administrative officers of the State to the \nrestrictive power of the courts in a proceeding of this character has been frequently \ndeclared in a number of cases.... It is not to be understood from these cases that the state \nitself can be enjoined; but, when its officers act in an unconstitutional or illegal manner they \nare not to be regarded as acting for the state, and they may be enjoined. \nCarson v. Sullivan, 284 Mo. 353, 223 S.W. 571, 571 (Mo. banc 1920) (citing several cases \nincluding Merchants' Exchange and Ex parte Young). See, e.g., Nacy v. Le Page, 341 Mo. \n1039, 111 S.W.2d 25, 25-26 (Mo. banc 1937) (\"because the state may not be sued without \nits consent\" and because a garnishment \"seeks to compel action on the part of the state,\" a \nstate court may not require the State to submit to a legal writ of garnishment) (changed by § \n525.310, RSMo 1943); State ex rel. Eagleton v. Hall, 389 S.W.2d 798, 801 (Mo. banc 1965) \n \n\n \n \n(a will-contest suit affecting residuary estate left to state is a suit against the state, thus \nbarred by sovereign immunity), quoted in Bellefontaine, 476 S.W.3d at 921; Garland v. \nRuhl, 455 S.W.3d 442, 446 (Mo. banc 2015) (even when a statute authorizes award of \nattorney fees against the state, sovereign immunity prevents ordering the state to do so, \ndue to strict construction of the statute). \nBecause the two Court of Appeals opinions have a limited consideration of controlling \nMissouri Supreme Court cases and fail even to address contrary authority, \nthe Wyman and NAACP cases are not instructive as to how the Missouri Supreme Court \nwould decide the sovereign immunity issue in this case. See United Fire & Cas. Co. v. Titan \nContractors Serv., Inc., 751 F.3d 880, 885 n.2 (8th Cir. 2014). \nThe plaintiffs cite five cases where the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed injunctions directed \nat the State. See Weinschenk v. State, 203 S.W.3d 201, 205 (Mo. banc 2006); Brooks v. \nState, 128 S.W.3d 844, 851 (Mo. banc 2004); Rolla 31 Sch. Dist. v. State, 837 S.W.2d 1, \n7 (Mo. banc 1992); Pohl v. State Highway Comm'n, 431 S.W.2d 99, 107 (Mo. banc \n1968); Koplar v. State Tax Comm'n, 321 S.W.2d 686, 697 (Mo. 1959). These five cases, \nplaintiffs assert, show it is \"perfectly ordinary\" to enjoin the State itself to force compliance \nwith its obligations. \nFirst, in the three most recent cases, state officials-subject to Missouri's Ex parte \nYoung doctrine-were also named as defendants. Weinschenk, 203 S.W.3d at 204 \nn.1 (secretary of state); Brooks, 128 S.W.3d at 846 (attorney general); Rolla, 837 S.W.2d at \n2 & n. 2 (naming the \"various state officials\" who were defendants). The Pohl case is an \n\"injunction suit by taxpayers.\" Pohl, 431 S.W.2d at 100. See Manzara v. State, 343 S.W.3d \n656, 658-59 (Mo. banc 2011) (reviewing history of taxpayer suits since 1873 and holding \n\"when a public interest is involved and public monies are being expended for an illegal \npurpose, taxpayers have the right to enjoin the action\" so \"government officials conform to \nthe dictates of the law\"). The Koplar case is a judicial review of administrative decisions \nunder the Missouri Administrative Procedure Act-specifically held to be a \"waiver of \nsovereign immunity.\" 745*745 See St. Louis County v. State, 424 S.W.3d 450, 454 n.3 (Mo. \nbanc 2014) (statute authorizing judicial review of administrative decisions is a waiver of \nsovereign immunity). As a result, none of these five cases even hint at the threshold \nquestion presented here: whether Missouri's sovereign immunity covers suits for \nprospective equitable relief. \"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to \nthe attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so \ndecided as to constitute precedents.\" Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Aviall Servs., Inc., 543 U.S. \n157, 170, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004). See also Byrne & Jones Enters., Inc. v. \nMonroe City R-1 Sch. Dist., 493 S.W.3d 847, 855 (Mo. banc 2016) (\"Judicial decisions must \nbe construed with reference to the facts and issues of the particular case, and that the \nauthority of the decision as a precedent is limited to those points of law which are raised by \nthe record, considered by the court, and necessary to a decision.\") (citation omitted). \nSecond, adopting the plaintiffs' view creates a judicial exception to sovereign immunity. \nBut Bellefontaine rejects that, explaining it would \"not judicially create an exception to the \ncommon law rule of sovereign immunity\" to address the specific situation there because the \nissue presented \"policy concerns ... for the legislature.\" Bellefontaine, 476 S.W.3d at 923. \n \n\n \n \nThe legislature—not the judiciary— must waive sovereign immunity. Id. at 921 (\"This Court \ncannot read into the statute an exception to sovereign immunity or imply waivers not \nexplicitly created in the statute.\"). See also Winston v. Reorganized Sch. Dist. R-2, \nLawrence Cnty., 636 S.W.2d 324, 328 (Mo. banc 1982) (\"[W]e are mindful of the oft \nrepeated principle that, within constitutional limits, a sovereign may prescribe the terms and \nconditions under which it may be sued, and the decision to waive immunity, and to what \nextent it is waived, lies within the legislature's purview.\"). The parties have not cited a \nMissouri statute that waives sovereign immunity for prospective equitable relief. The five \ncases they cite, Wyman/NAACP, or other states' decisions cannot serve as a substitute. \nTrue, Bellefontaine does not address the precise issue here. But it says that sovereign \nimmunity \"is the rule—not the exception—even in the absence of prior cases specifically \naddressing this issue.\" Bellefontaine, 476 S.W.3d at 922. \"When there is no state supreme \ncourt case directly on point, our role is to predict how the state supreme court would rule if \nfaced with the [same issue] before us.\" Blankenship v. USA Truck, Inc., 601 F.3d 852, 856 \n(8th Cir. 2010) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). See also Craven v. University of \nColo. Hosp. Auth., 260 F.3d 1218, 1231 (10th Cir. 2001) (applying the same rule to a \nsovereign immunity issue). This court predicts that the Missouri Supreme Court would \napply Bellefontaine's long-established principles to cases involving prospective equitable \nrelief. Missouri does not have a waiver of sovereign immunity for prospective equitable relief \n\"stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implication from the text as \n[will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\" Feeney, 495 U.S. at 305, 110 \nS.Ct. 1868. \nB. \nPlaintiffs also assert a recognized common law exception to sovereign \nimmunity. See Bellefontaine, 476 S.W.3d at 921-22 (stating sovereign immunity applies to \nall suits, in the absence of a recognized common law exception). The Bellefontaine case \nnotes two such exceptions, consent and \"proprietary function\" (of municipalities). Id. Neither \nof these apply here. \n746*746 Citing Blackstone, law review articles, a common-law case, and other state courts, \nthe plaintiffs argue that \"even at common law, courts of equity enforced the Crown's \nobligations.\" See generally Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 135 \nS.Ct. 1378, 1384, 191 L.Ed.2d 471 (2015) (\"It is true enough that we have long held that \nfederal courts may in some circumstances grant injunctive relief against state officers who \nare violating, or planning to violate, federal law.... The ability to sue to enjoin \nunconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity, and \nreflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.\") \n(emphasis added), citing Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 150-51, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 \n(1908) (other citations omitted). \nThe State counters, with arguments based on the \"law or equity\" phrase in the Eleventh \nAmendment and the Supreme Court's words in an Eleventh Amendment case that \n \n\n \n \nsovereign immunity applies regardless of whether a private plaintiff's suit is for monetary \ndamages or some other type of relief. See [Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, \n58, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996)] (\"[W]e have often made it clear that the relief \nsought by a plaintiff suing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit is barred by \nthe Eleventh Amendment\"). \nFed. Mar. Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 765-66, 122 S.Ct. 1864 (emphasis added). \nThese expertly briefed arguments are beside the point. The Missouri Supreme Court is the \n\"custodian\" of the common law in Missouri. Townsend v. Townsend, 708 S.W.2d 646, 649-\n50 (Mo. banc 1986). That Court has rejected that \"the state itself can be \nenjoined.\" Carson, 223 S.W. at 571, following Merchants' Exchange, 111 S.W. at 574. A \nrecognized common law exception to Missouri's sovereign immunity does not apply here. \nIII. \nThe plaintiffs argue that even if sovereign immunity bars prospective injunctive relief, the \nState \"can be sued directly for equitable relief for failing to comply with a federal \nconstitutional obligation, here, the Sixth Amendment.\" They stress First English Evangelical \nLutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 \n(1987), and Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106, 115 S.Ct. 547, 130 L.Ed.2d 454 (1994). \nIn First English, the Supreme Court stated it \"has frequently repeated the view that, in the \nevent of a taking, the compensation remedy is required by the Constitution.\" First \nEnglish, 482 U.S. at 316, 107 S.Ct. 2378. It footnoted: \nThe Solicitor General urges that the prohibitory nature of the Fifth Amendment, combined \nwith principles of sovereign immunity, establishes that the Amendment itself is only a \nlimitation on the power of the Government to act, not a remedial provision. The cases cited \nin the text, we think, refute the argument of the United States that \"the Constitution does \nnot, of its own force, furnish a basis for a court to award money damages against the \ngovernment.\" \nId. at 316 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2378 (citations omitted). In Reich, the Court explained that \"a long \nline of cases\" establishes that \"due process requires a `clear and certain' remedy for taxes \ncollected in violation of federal law,\" and that \"a denial by a state court of a recovery of \ntaxes exacted in violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States by compulsion is \nitself in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, the sovereign immunity States \ntraditionally 747*747 enjoy in their own courts notwithstanding.\" Reich, 513 U.S. at 108, 109-\n110, 115 S.Ct. 547 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nAccording to the plaintiffs, these cases (particularly the footnote in First English) mean that \n\"where the Constitution places an affirmative obligation on the State itself, the State cannot \nrely on state sovereign immunity to defeat a suit that aims to force it to comply with that \nobligation.\" But that is too broad a reading. Instead, the cases mean that \"where the \nConstitution requires a particular remedy, such as through the Due Process Clause for the \n \n\n \n \ntax monies at issue in Reich, or through the Takings Clause as indicated in First \nEnglish, the state is required to provide that remedy in its own courts, notwithstanding \nsovereign immunity.\" DLX, Inc. v. Kentucky, 381 F.3d 511, 528 (6th Cir. 2004) (emphasis \nadded). For the situation at issue here, the Constitution does not require a \"particular\" or \n\"clear and certain\" remedy. \nCongress may also abrogate state sovereign immunity by providing an enforcement \nmechanism for constitutional violations: \nWe have held also that in adopting the Fourteenth Amendment, the people required the \nStates to surrender a portion of the sovereignty that had been preserved to them by the \noriginal Constitution, so that Congress may authorize private suits against nonconsenting \nStates pursuant to its § 5 enforcement power. By imposing explicit limits on the powers of \nthe States and granting Congress the power to enforce them, the Amendment \nfundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution. \nWhen Congress enacts appropriate legislation to enforce this Amendment, federal interests \nare paramount, and Congress may assert an authority over the States which would be \notherwise unauthorized by the Constitution. \nAlden, 527 U.S. at 756, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). See \nalso United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 \n(2006) (\"insofar as Title II [of the ADA] creates a private cause of action for damages \nagainst the States for conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II \nvalidly abrogates state sovereign immunity.\"). No statutory enforcement mechanism exists \nhere. \nIV. \nThe governor asserts sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs argue that sovereign immunity does \nnot shield the governor because he is an Ex parte Young defendant. \"Under the Ex Parte \nYoung doctrine, a private party can sue a state officer in his official capacity to enjoin a \nprospective action that would violate federal law.\" 281 Care Committee v. Arneson, 638 \nF.3d 621, 632 (8th Cir. 2011). The doctrine \"rests on the premise—less delicately called a \n`fiction'—that when a federal court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain \nfrom violating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign-immunity \npurposes.\" Stewart, 563 U.S. at 255, 131 S.Ct. 1632 (internal citation omitted). See \nalso Hutchinson, 803 F.3d at 957 (\"Enforcement of unconstitutional legislation `is simply an \nillegal act upon the part of [the] state official,' and the State may not immunize officials from \nsuit for such violations of the Constitution.\"), quoting Young, 209 U.S. at 159, 28 S.Ct. 441. \n\"In determining whether this exception applies, a court conducts `a straightforward inquiry \ninto whether [the] complaint alleges [1] an ongoing violation of federal law and [2] seeks \nrelief properly 748*748 characterized as prospective.'\" 281 Care, 638 F.3d at \n632, quoting Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Maryland, 535 U.S. 635, \n645, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002) (alterations added). On the first inquiry, the \nofficial must have \"some connection to the enforcement of the challenged laws.\" Calzone v. \n \n\n \n \nHawley, 866 F.3d 866, 869 (8th Cir. 2017), citing Young, 209 U.S. at 157, 28 S.Ct. 441. See \nalso 281 Care, 638 F.3d at 632. \"Without that connection, the officer would be sued merely \n`as a representative of the state' in an impermissible attempt to `make the state a \nparty.'\" Hutchinson, 803 F.3d at 960, quoting Young, 209 U.S. at 157, 28 S.Ct. 441. \"[T]hat \nconnection does not need to be primary authority to enforce the challenged law.\" 281 \nCare, 638 F.3d at 632. \"Nor does the [state officer] need to have the full power to redress a \nplaintiff's injury in order to have `some connection' with the challenged law.\" Id. at 633. \nRuling that the governor is an Ex parte Young defendant, the district court identified three \nconnections to the enforcement of the State's Sixth Amendment obligation to provide \nindigent defendants with adequate counsel. \nA. \nThe district court noted the governor's general-enforcement authority. The Missouri \nConstitution says, \"The supreme executive power shall be vested in a governor,\" and \"The \ngovernor shall take care that the laws are distributed and faithfully executed, and shall be a \nconservator of the peace throughout the state.\" Mo. Const. art. IV, §§ 1-2. The district court \nalso cited a Missouri statute: \"When directed by the governor, the attorney general, or one \nof his assistants, shall aid any prosecuting or circuit attorney in the discharge of their \nrespective duties in the trial courts and in examinations before grand juries....\" § 27.030, \nRSMo. \nThe district court concluded that these provisions make the Missouri governor like the \nGeorgia governor in Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir. 1988). There, indigent \ndefendants sought injunctive relief against a governor to remedy Sixth Amendment \nviolations. Luckey, 860 F.2d at 1013. The Eleventh Circuit held that Georgia's governor had \n\"some connection\" and was an \"appropriate part[y] against whom prospective relief could \nbe ordered\" because: \nAccording to the Georgia constitution, the governor is responsible for law enforcement in \nthat state and is charged with executing the laws faithfully. The governor further has the \nresidual power to commence criminal prosecutions, and has the final authority to direct the \nAttorney General to \"institute and prosecute\" on behalf of the state. \nId. at 1016 (internal citations omitted). \nThe governor here argues that this court's Calzone decision \ntrumps Luckey. The Calzone plaintiff sought an injunction against the Missouri governor in a \nchallenge to the constitutionality of a state statute. Calzone, 866 F.3d at 869. This court \nheld that neither the statute nor the Missouri Constitution's general-enforcement provision \nmake the governor an Ex parte Young defendant: \nNo provision in Chapter 304 or the statutes defining his executive authority specifically \nauthorizes the governor to enforce the vehicle inspection statutes. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § \n26.010-.225. The Missouri Constitution confers upon the governor the duty to \"take care \n \n\n \n \nthat the laws are distributed and faithfully executed,\" Mo. Const. art. IV, § 2, but such a \ngeneral executive responsibility is an insufficient connection to the enforcement of a statute \nto avoid the Eleventh 749*749 Amendment. See Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U.S. 516, 530, 19 \nS.Ct. 269, 43 L.Ed. 535 (1899). \nId. at 870. \nThe plaintiffs try to distinguish Calzone because the statute there \"delegated enforcement \nexclusively to the superintendent of the highway patrol,\" meaning \"[t]he Governor was not a \nproper defendant because he has no connection to the statute.... Unlike the statute \nin Calzone, the State's constitutional obligation to provide adequate counsel—and the \nGovernor's role in its failure to do so—cannot be delegated exclusively to the MSPD.\" \nAlthough Calzone is factually distinguishable, its guidance on the Missouri governor's \ngeneral-enforcement authority is consistent with this court's \nprecedent. See Hutchinson, 803 F.3d at 961; Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 455 \nF.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006), abrogated on other grounds by Obergefell v. Hodges, ___ U.S. \n___, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015). \nIn Bruning, the Nebraska governor and attorney general were Ex parte Young defendants in \na suit to enjoin enforcement of a state constitutional amendment. Bruning, 455 F.3d at 864. \nThis court found a sufficient connection to the enforcement of the amendment because \"the \nGovernor and the Attorney General have broad powers to enforce the State's Constitution \nand statutes.\" Id. The Hutchinson decision clarifies that statement from Bruning: \n[T]he court's statement [in Bruning] must be read in context. In Bruning, the \"broad powers\" \nof the officials included authority to enforce the constitutional amendment at issue. The \nNebraska attorney general has power to enforce the Nebraska Constitution by bringing suit \nfor a declaratory judgment that a state statute is unconstitutional, or for an injunction \nprohibiting the enforcement of a state statute on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. The \nNebraska governor has some connection to the enforcement of the Nebraska Constitution \nbecause he may direct the attorney general to file suit to enjoin application of an \nunconstitutional state statute. That sort of enforcement authority is lacking with respect to \n[the] statute [at issue in Hutchinson] that provides only for private civil enforcement. \nHutchinson, 803 F.3d at 961 (internal citations omitted). \nThe Bruning and Hutchinson decisions mean that a governor's general-enforcement \nauthority is \"some connection\" if that authority gives the governor methods of enforcement. \nThe governor in Bruning had a method of enforcement because he could direct the attorney \ngeneral to seek equitable relief. But the governors in Calzone and Hutchinson did not have \na comparable enforcement mechanism. \nNor does the governor here. The district court's reliance on section 27.030 is insufficient \nbecause that provision covers aiding prosecution, not defense. The governor's general-\nenforcement authority is not \"some connection\" to enforcement of the State's Sixth \nAmendment obligation. See Calzone, 866 F.3d at 870. See also Air Evac EMS, Inc. v. \n \n\n \n \nTexas, Dep't of Ins., Div. of Workers' Comp., 851 F.3d 507, 517 (5th Cir. 2017) (\"[A] state \ngovernor with a broad duty to uphold state law is not a proper defendant.\"); Los Angeles \nCnty. Bar Ass'n v. Eu, 979 F.2d 697, 704 (9th Cir. 1992) (\"[A] generalized duty to enforce \nstate law or general supervisory power over the persons responsible for enforcing the \nchallenged provision will not subject an official to suit.\"); Shell Oil Co. v. Noel, 608 F.2d 208, \n211 (1st Cir. 1979) (\"The mere fact that a governor is under a general 750*750 duty to \nenforce state laws does not make him a proper defendant in every action attacking the \nconstitutionality of a state statute.\"). \nB. \nThe district court ruled the governor had \"some connection\" because he \"appoints all seven \nmembers of the MSPD Commission.\" Church, 268 F.Supp.3d at 1013, citing § 600.015.1, \nRSMo (\"The commission shall be composed of seven members... appointed by the \ngovernor with the advice and consent of the senate.\"). The district court cited the Ninth \nCircuit's decision in Eu, where a bar association sued a governor to challenge a state \nstatute that limited the number of judges in a county. Eu, 979 F.2d at 699. The governor had \n\"a duty to appoint judges to any newly-created judicial positions,\" which the Ninth Circuit \nconsidered to be \"a specific connection to the challenged statute,\" placing the governor \nwithin Ex parte Young's scope. Id. at 704. \nInvoking Eu, the plaintiffs argue: \"although the Governor alone cannot solve the indigent \ndefense crisis in this state, his role in the ongoing violation of those Sixth Amendment rights \nthrough his appointment of MSPD Commissioners, in addition to his ability to profoundly \naffect MSPD caseload, is sufficient for Ex parte Young purposes.\" The governor counters \nwith this court's decision in Balogh v. Lombardi, 816 F.3d 536 (8th Cir. 2016). \nIn Balogh, a Missouri statute gave a private right of action against anyone who, without the \napproval of the Director of Corrections, knowingly discloses the identity of an execution-\nteam member. Balogh, 816 F.3d at 539. The statute also gave the director authority to \nselect those members. Id. This court ruled that the director's selection authority is only \n\"administrative or ministerial,\" and not \"some connection\" to the statute's enforcement: \nAlthough the director's authority to delineate the members of the execution team does affect \nwho might have a private right of action against [someone disclosing the identity of \nexecution team members], it has nothing to do with an execution team member's potential \nprosecution of such an action. Selection of the execution team constitutes implementation \nof the statute in an administrative or ministerial sense and is not analogous to enforcing the \nstatute's non-disclosure provision through a civil or criminal prosecution. The director's \nauthority to define the members of the execution team is not an enforcement action within \nthe meaning of Ex Parte Young and its progeny. \nId. at 546. \nLike in Balogh, appointing members of the MSPD Commission is an administrative \nact. See State ex rel. Sikes v. Williams, 222 Mo. 268, 121 S.W. 64, 65 (Mo. banc 1909) \n \n\n \n \n(\"The confirmations by the Senate of appointments made by the Governor are not \nlegislative acts.... Such acts by the Governor concerning appointments are merely \nadministrative....\"). It does not give the governor some connection to the State's Sixth \nAmendment obligation. The Balogh decision, not Eu, binds this court. \nC. \nThe district court concluded the governor met the \"some connection\" requirement because \nof his appropriation-reduction authority: \nGovernor Greitens's predecessor, Governor Nixon, affirmatively used his executive \nauthority to withhold roughly $7 million in funding allocated by the Missouri Legislature to \nthe MSPD, thereby demonstrating an even more direct 751*751 \"connection\" to the \nchallenged conduct. Governor Greitens has since upheld Governor Nixon's withholding of \nfunds allocated to the MSPD. \nChurch, 268 F.Supp.3d at 1012-13 (internal citation omitted). In addition to arguing that his \nappropriation-reduction authority is not \"some connection\", the governor asserts legislative \nimmunity. \n\"[S]tate legislators enjoy common-law immunity from liability for their legislative \nacts.\" Supreme Court of Va. v. Consumers Union of U. S., Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 732, 100 \nS.Ct. 1967, 64 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980). \"[O]fficials outside the legislative branch are entitled to \nlegislative immunity when they perform legislative functions.\" Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 \nU.S. 44, 55, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998). \"Whether an act is legislative turns on \nthe nature of the act, rather than on the motive or intent of the official performing it.\" Id. at \n54, 118 S.Ct. 966. The act must be legislative \"in substance,\" bearing \"all the hallmarks of \ntraditional legislation,\" and \"in form,\" involving \"integral steps in the legislative \nprocess.\" Id. at 55, 118 S.Ct. 966. \nThe district court suggested that the governor's \"withholding of funds is a legislative function \nentitled to legislative immunity.\" Church, 268 F.Supp.3d at 1020. It emphasized Abbey v. \nRowland, 359 F.Supp.2d 94, 100 (D. Conn. 2005): \nNothing could be more integral to the legislative process than [proposing a budget]. The \nGovernor's choices of exactly how to cut the budget may have been discretionary, but they \nwere policy choices of broad import. The fact that any budget reduction would necessarily \nhave an adverse impact on some employment does not change the budgetary decision \nfrom a legislative to an administrative function. \nIndeed, the Supreme Court has said that a \"discretionary, policymaking decision implicating \nthe budgetary priorities of the [government] and the services the [government] provides to \nits constituents\" is a \"hallmark[] of traditional legislation.\" Bogan, 523 U.S. at 55-56, 118 \nS.Ct. 966. And in Missouri, \"the budget process ... begins and ends with the Governor,\" \nmaking the governor's appropriation reduction legislative in form. See Missouri Health Care \nAss'n v. Holden, 89 S.W.3d 504, 508 (Mo. banc 2002). The Missouri Constitution \"does not \n \n\n \n \npermit the state to spend money it does not have\" and \"broadly authorizes the Governor to \nbalance the state's budget in the event that state revenues fall below the revenue \nexpectations.\" Id. at 506-07, citing Mo. Const. art. IV, § 27. A Missouri governor's \nappropriation reduction is a legislative act. \nThe district court, however, ruled that it was premature to apply legislative immunity \n\"because it is unclear what the terms of any injunction entered would include.... That finding \nis subject to change should the Plaintiffs request any remedies that would violate Gov. \nGreitens' immunity from acts `integral' to the legislative process.\" Church, 268 F.Supp.3d at \n1020. By that rationale, the remedy—not the challenged act—guides whether legislative \nimmunity applies. \nThe governor counters: \"legislative immunity is an immunity from suit, not merely an \nimmunity from the award of certain types of relief. The district court's rationale would \nenable any plaintiff to defeat legislative immunity merely by making a vague and indefinite \nrequest for `injunctive and declaratory relief.'\" \nThe Supreme Court's decision in Consumers Union addresses this issue. There, the \nSupreme Court of Virginia, in addition to its inherent authority, used its \nstatutory 752*752 authority to promulgate a professional ethics code. Consumers Union, 446 \nU.S. at 721, 100 S.Ct. 1967. The Virginia legislature \"vested in the court virtually its entire \nlegislative or regulatory power over the legal profession.\" Id. at 722, 100 S.Ct. 1967. The \ncourt also had the power to enforce its professional ethics code. Id. at 722-24, 100 S.Ct. \n1967. \nThe plaintiffs believed that the code's provision on attorney advertisement violated the First \nAmendment. Id. at 726, 100 S.Ct. 1967. They sued the Virginia Court and its chief justice in \nhis personal and official capacity under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking a declaration that the \nprovision was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement. Id. at 725-26, 100 \nS.Ct. 1967. The chief justice and the court asserted legislative immunity. Id. at 730, 100 \nS.Ct. 1967. The Supreme Court concluded (1) the Virginia court's promulgation of the \nprofessional ethics code was a legislative act, (2) \"the Virginia Court and its members are \nimmune from suit when acting in their legislative capacity,\" and (3) legislative immunity \napplies to suits for equitable relief. Id. at 731-32, 734, 100 S.Ct. 1967. \nThe Supreme Court, however, did not apply legislative immunity: \"If the sole basis for \nappellees' § 1983 action against the Virginia Court and its chief justice were the issuance \nof, or failure to amend, the challenged rules, legislative immunity would foreclose \nsuit against appellants.\" Id. at 734, 100 S.Ct. 1967 (emphasis added). But the Court \nconcluded that the Virginia court's enforcement authority was a non-legislative act: \"the \nVirginia Court performs more than a legislative role with respect to the State Bar Code. It \nalso hears appeals from lower court decisions in disciplinary cases, a traditional \nadjudicative task; and in addition, it has independent enforcement authority of its \nown.\" Id. \"For this reason the Virginia Court and its members were proper defendants in a \nsuit for declaratory and injunctive relief.\" Id. at 736, 100 S.Ct. 1967. \n \n\n \n \nUnder Consumers Union, the \"basis\" for suit governs whether legislative immunity \n\"foreclose[s] suit.\" The Second Circuit, however, has a different interpretation of Consumers \nUnion: legislators \"must still show, before they are afforded the protections of legislative \nimmunity as to claims for injunctive relief, that the requested relief would enjoin them in their \nlegislative capacities.\" State Employees Bargaining Agent Coal. v. Rowland, 494 F.3d 71, \n93 (2d Cir. 2007). According to the Second Circuit, the Consumers Union decision \napplied legislative immunity to bar plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief insofar as the relief \nsought would compel the defendants to perform a legislative act—the repeal or amendment \nof the state's bar code to conform with constitutional requirements. The Court concluded, \nhowever, that legislative immunity did not bar claims for injunctive relief that would enjoin \nthe defendant justices from committing a distinctly non-legislative act—independent \nenforcement of the unconstitutional provisions of the bar code against particular individuals. \nId. at 88, citing Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 733-36, 100 S.Ct. 1967. The Second Circuit \nassumed that the Consumers Union plaintiffs sought \"declaratory and injunctive relief that \nwould have forced the Supreme Court [of Virginia] to amend or repeal the code.\" Id. at 83-\n84. Through that assumption, the Second Circuit appears to interpret Consumers Union's \nenforcement discussion to mean that if the suit sought only amendment or repeal, then that \nsuit would have been barred by legislative immunity. Id. By the Second Circuit's reading of \nthe case, the suit also 753*753 sought an injunction against enforcement, meaning \nlegislative immunity was not a bar in Consumers Union. \nBut Consumers Union does not say that the plaintiffs there sought to amend or repeal the \ncode. The Court's only reference to amendment or repeal was as a \"basis\" for suit—the \nVirginia court's \"issuance of, or failure to amend, the challenged rules.\" Consumers \nUnion, 446 U.S. at 734, 100 S.Ct. 1967. True, the Consumers Union plaintiffs did seek an \ninjunction against enforcement. But the Virginia's court's enforcement of the professional \nethics code also was a basis for suit: \"[M]ere enforcement authority does not create a case \nor controversy with the enforcement official; but in the circumstances of this case, a \nsufficiently concrete dispute is as well made out against the Virginia Court as an \nenforcer....\" Id. at 736, 100 S.Ct. 1967 n.15. In other words, the Virginia court's \nenforcement—in addition to its promulgation—of the professional ethics code was a non-\nlegislative act that violated the First Amendment, providing a separate basis for suit not \nbarred by legislative immunity. See Alia v. Michigan Supreme Court, 906 F.2d 1100, 1107 \n(6th Cir. 1990) (Wellford, J., dissenting) (analyzing Consumers Union and concluding \"to the \nextent the individual justices acted in a rulemaking capacity, they are entitled to legislative \nimmunity, but to the extent they acted in an enforcement capacity, they are not entitled to \nclaim legislative immunity\") (underlines added). \nIn the end, these ambiguities do not impact the result here. In Consumers Union, the \nSupreme Court states: \"If the sole basis for appellees' § 1983 action against the Virginia \nCourt and its chief justice were the issuance of, or failure to amend, the challenged rules, \nlegislative immunity would foreclose suit against appellants.\" Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at \n734, 100 S.Ct. 1967 (emphasis added). In the complaint here, the plaintiffs allege: \n \n\n \n \nAs chief executive of the State, Governor Greitens bears ultimate responsibility for the \nprovision of constitutionally mandated services, including indigent defense, to the people of \nMissouri. The Governor of Missouri appoints the members of the Missouri State Public \nDefender Commission, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Governor has \nclaimed the authority to withhold money budgeted to the Missouri State Public Defender's \nOffice and has exercised that claimed authority in recent years, including fiscal year 2017. \nAs discussed above, to the extent the plaintiffs claim that the governor's general-\nenforcement authority and appointment authority are non-legislative acts that lead to a \nconstitutional violation, the governor is subject to sovereign immunity for those acts \nbecause they do not satisfy Ex parte Young. \nThat leaves as \"the sole basis\" for the plaintiffs' action against the governor his \nappropriation reduction—a legislative act—meaning legislative immunity \"foreclose[s] suit\" \nagainst him. See id. at 734, 100 S.Ct. 1967. The Supreme Court used the word \"suit,\" not \n\"remedy.\" This approach is consistent with how the Supreme Court treats sovereign \nimmunity: \"Sovereign immunity does not merely constitute a defense to monetary liability or \neven to all types of liability. Rather, it provides an immunity from suit.\" Fed. Mar. \nComm'n, 535 U.S. at 766, 122 S.Ct. 1864 (emphasis added). \nEven if the governor's appropriation-reduction authority is not shielded by sovereign \nimmunity through Ex parte Young, legislative immunity, a separate defense, forecloses suit \nagainst the governor. See Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 734, 100 S.Ct. 1967. See \nalso Tolman v. Finneran, 171 F.Supp.2d 31, 37-38 (D. Mass. 2001) (\"Short of the \nexceptional 754*754 case, it is unlikely that Ex Parte Young is broad enough to abrogate \nlegislative immunity and authorize suit against a legislator acting in a purely legislative \ncapacity.\").  \n[3]\n* * * * * * * \nThe judgment is reversed, and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this \nopinion.  \n[4]\n[1] While this appeal was pending, Eric R. Greitens resigned as governor of Missouri. His successor, Michael L. \nParson, is automatically substituted under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2). See Digital Recognition \nNetwork, Inc. v. Hutchinson, 803 F.3d 952, 952 n.1 (8th Cir. 2015). \n[2] See Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d \n605 (1993); Fryberger v. University of Ark., 889 F.3d 471, 473 (8th Cir. 2018); McDonough Assocs., Inc. v. \nGrunloh, 722 F.3d 1043, 1048 (7th Cir. 2013); Scott v. Taylor, 405 F.3d 1251, 1253 (11th Cir. 2005). \n[3] The plaintiffs argue that legislative immunity is a personal defense that does not apply to official-capacity suits, like \nthe one here. They cite Roach v. Stouffer, 560 F.3d 860 (8th Cir. 2009), quoting a Second Circuit decision: \"immunity, \neither absolute or qualified, is a personal defense that is available only when officials are sued in their individual \ncapacities; the immunities officials enjoy when sued personally do not extend to instances where they are sued in \ntheir official capacities.\" Roach, 560 F.3d at 870, quoting Almonte v. City of Long Beach, 478 F.3d 100, 106 (2d Cir. \n2007). But under Consumers Union, legislative immunity applies to official-capacity suits. Consumers Union, 446 U.S. \nat 725-26, 734, 100 S.Ct. 1967. See also Scott v. Taylor, 405 F.3d 1251, 1254 n.4, 1255 (11th Cir. \n2005) (analyzing Consumers Union and Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 \n(1985), and \"hold[ing] that the legislator defendants in the instant official capacity suit for prospective relief are entitled \n \n\n \n \nto absolute immunity.\"). The Second Circuit-recognizing the tension between Almonte and Consumers Union-\nlimited Almonte to \"claims against local-level officials, rather than state officials.\" Rowland, 494 F.3d at 86, 88 (\"claims \nfor injunctive relief against defendant state officials, sued in their official capacities, may be barred by the doctrine of \nlegislative immunity\"). To the extent Roach conflicts with Consumers Union, this court is bound by Consumers Union. \n[4] This court grants the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a sur-reply. In reaching this decision, this court considered \nthe sur-reply attached to the motion. \n \n ",

Case No. 2:17-cv-04057-NKL \n   \nMichael BARRETT, et al.,   \n   \n  Defendants.   \n \n \nORDER \nThe Missouri Attorney General moves to intervene as a defendant in this action.  Doc. 222.  \nFor the following reasons, the Attorney General’s motion to intervene is denied. \nI.  Background \nOn March 9, 2017, Plaintiffs initiated this case in state court as a putative class action \nagainst the State of Missouri and the Governor (the “State Defendants”) as well as the Director \nand Commissioners of the Missouri State Public Defenders (the “MSPD Defendants”).  Doc. 1-2 \n(Petition).  Plaintiffs allege that Missouri “has failed to meet its constitutional obligation to provide \nindigent defendants with meaningful representation,” largely because the MSPD is underfunded \nand overworked.  Id. at p. 2.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief that provides “indigent \ncriminal defendants and juvenile respondents with constitutionally adequate legal representation.”  \nId. at 52.   \nOn April 7, 2017, the State Defendants, through the Attorney General of the State of \nMissouri, removed the case to federal court.  Doc. 1 (Notice of Removal).  On removal, the case \nwas included in the Western District of Missouri’s Mediation and Assessment Program (“MAP”) \nand assigned to an outside mediator.  Doc. 4 (Notice of Inclusion for MAP); Doc. 48 (Amended \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 1 of 19\n\nNotice of Inclusion for MAP).  The Court set a discovery deadline of December 15, 2017, and trial \nwas set for May 14, 2018.  Doc. 35 (Scheduling Order).  Shortly after removal, however, the State \nDefendants—both represented by the Attorney General—filed a motion to dismiss arguing that \nthe State and Governor are shielded by sovereign immunity.  Doc. 18 (State Defendants’ Motion \nto Dismiss).  The Court denied the motion.  Doc. 69 (Order on Motion to Dismiss).  The State \nDefendants filed a notice of appeal.  Doc. 70 (Notice of Appeal).  \nWhile the appeal was pending, the Court extended the discovery deadline, and the parties \nconducted  substantial  discovery.    The  parties,  including  the  State  Defendants,  who  were \nrepresented  by  the  Attorney  General,  also  participated  in  mediation.    Doc.  225-2  (Letter \nScheduling Mediation).  Trial was rescheduled for May 29, 2018.  Doc. 86.   \nAfter discovery was complete, the State Defendants, through the Attorney General, moved \nto stay the case pending appeal and to realign the MSPD Defendants with Plaintiffs.  Doc. 133 \n(Motion to Stay); Doc. 134 (Motion to Realign MSPD Defendants as Plaintiffs).  The MSPD \nDefendants  and  Plaintiffs  opposed  the  motion  to  realign,  citing  divergent  interests  and  the \nuntimeliness of the motion.  Doc. 140 (MSPD Defendants’ Suggestions in Opposition to Motion \nto Realign); Doc. 143 (Plaintiffs’ Suggestions in Opposition to Motion to Realign).  The motion \nwas denied without prejudice; the trial was twice continued, and later struck entirely pending the \nappeal.   \nOn January 10, 2019, the Eighth Circuit reversed the Court’s decision on sovereign \nimmunity.  See Doc. 206; Church v. Missouri, 913 F.3d 736 (8th Cir. 2019).  After the mandate \nwas issued, the Court dismissed the State Defendants, Doc. 211, and denied Plaintiffs’ motion for \nclass certification, Doc. 212.  On March 1, 2019, the remaining parties—Plaintiffs and the MSPD \nDefendants—were ordered to proceed to mediation within 30 days, and to submit a proposed \n2 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 2 of 19\n\nscheduling order.  The parties proceeded to the Court-ordered mediation on March 15, 2019, and \ntrial was set for August 19, 2019.  \nOn March 27, 2019, while mediation efforts were underway, the MSPD Defendants wrote \nto the Attorney General to request coverage by the state legal expense fund.  See 225-3, p. 1.  In \nresponse, the Attorney General sought information concerning the MSPD Defendants’ “plans \nregarding defense of the case, trial plan, etc.,” but the MSPD Defendants, citing the State \nDefendants’ motion to realign (which had asserted the existence of a conflict between the State \nDefendants and the MSPD Defendants) and the confidential nature of the mediation, declined to \nshare such details.  Id. at pp. 3–6.   \nOn May 13, 2019, the parties filed a joint motion for entry of a consent judgment.  Doc. \n221.  The proposed consent judgment states that Plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits based \non “overwhelming admissible evidence” showing that MSPD is “grossly overburdened, and that \nthe burden under which [MSPD] operates routinely and systematically harms indigent criminal \ndefendants by depriving them of competent counsel.”  Exhibit 1 (Proposed Consent Judgment), § \nIII(j).  The proposed consent judgment requires that the MSPD take certain actions to ensure \nconstitutionally adequate representation for Plaintiffs and other indigent defendants.  Id. at §§ IV–\nXVI.  It also provides for the appointment of a monitor with reporting obligations, establishes a \nrubric by which the MSPD would determine when an individual public defender has reached \ncapacity, and requires the MSPD to ensure that public defenders do not exceed the workload \ncapacity established by the proposed consent judgment.  Id. at §§ XVII–XIX.  Finally, it provides \na mechanism for dispute resolution, id. at § XX, and permits enforcement by a defined group of \nthird-party beneficiaries.  Id. at § XXI. \n3 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 3 of 19\n\nOn May 14, 2019, the day after the parties moved for entry of the proposed consent \njudgment, the Attorney General filed a motion to intervene, Doc. 222 (Attorney General’s Motion \nto Intervene), and a motion to stay the case pending resolution of the motion to intervene, Doc. \n224 (Attorney General’s Motion to Stay). \nII.   Discussion \nA.  Timeliness \nWhen a party seeks to intervene—whether as of right or otherwise—“the motion must be \ntimely.”  ACLU of Minn. v. Tarek ibn Ziyad Acad., 643 F.3d 1088, 1093 (8th Cir. 2011).  \nTimeliness is “determined by considering all the circumstances of the case,” Mille Lacs Band of \nChippewa Indians v. Minnesota, 989 F.2d 994, 998 (8th Cir. 1993), including: (1) how far the \nlitigation has progressed at the time of the motion for intervention; (2) the prospective intervenor’s \nprior knowledge of the pending action; (3) the reason for the delay in seeking intervention; and (4) \nwhether the delay in seeking intervention may prejudice the existing parties, U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n \nv. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 765 F.3d 867, 869 (8th Cir. 2014). \nIt is undisputed that the Attorney General has known of this suit since at least April 2017, \nwhen, on behalf of the State Defendants, he removed the case from state court to federal court.  \nDoc. 1.  Thereafter, the Attorney General actively litigated this case for nearly two years as counsel \nfor the State Defendants.  On April 21, 2017, the Attorney General moved for dismissal of both \nState Defendants, and on February 26, 2019, he succeeded.  The Attorney General was fully aware \nthat  the  dismissal  would  leave  the  MSPD  Defendants—whom  the  Attorney  General  had \ncharacterized as having legal interests that “mirror those of the Plaintiffs”, Doc. 134, p. 1—as the \nsole defendants in this case.   \n4 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 4 of 19\n\nIf the Attorney General wanted the State to have an active role in opposing the Plaintiffs’ \nclaims and any settlement between the Plaintiffs and the MSPD Defendants, he should not have \nsought immediate dismissal of the State as a defendant.  See In re Living Hope Sw. Med. Servs., \nLLC, No. 13-04055, 2014 WL 3368191, at *4 (W.D. Ark. July 10, 2014) (“If [defendant] believed \nthat his interests would be implicated in the proceeding such that he should be allowed to litigate \nthose interests, he should not have agreed to be dismissed as a defendant.”), aff’d, 598 F. App’x \n467 (8th Cir. 2015).  Further, given that the Attorney General knew from the outset the nature of \nthe relief sought and had previously expressed concern that the MSPD Defendants did not share \nthe State’s interests, he should have sought to intervene to protect the State’s interests, at the latest, \nright after securing dismissal of the State Defendants in late February 2019.1  See Chamness v. \nBowen, 722 F.3d 1110, 1121–22 (9th Cir. 2013) (affirming denial of intervention as untimely when \nmovant had two to four weeks’ prior notice of potential impairment and litigation was near its \nend); R & G Mortg. Corp. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 584 F.3d 1, 8–9 (1st Cir. 2009) \n(affirming finding that two-and-a-half-month delay made motion to intervene untimely, especially \nwhen parties had reached a settlement). \nTo the extent that the Attorney General seeks to intervene in his individual capacity, to \nprotect interests unique to the Attorney General and his office, the Attorney General  was in a \nposition to move to intervene at an even earlier date—at the outset of this case in 2017; following \nthe Court’s denial of the motion to realign the MSPD Defendants with Plaintiffs on April 17, 2018, \nDoc. 190; shortly after dismissal of the State Defendants on February 26, 2019, Doc. 211; or \nfollowing referral of the case to mediation on March 1, 2019, Doc. 213.   \n                                                            \n1 Indeed, the Attorney General knew of the risk on January 10, 2019, when the Eight Circuit Court \nof Appeals issued its opinion that the State Defendants must be dismissed and would no longer be \nparties in the case. \n5 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 5 of 19\n\nThe Attorney General did not, however, seek to intervene until a day after the motion for \nentry of the consent judgment was filed, on May 14, 2019.  Doc. 222.  The Attorney General argues \nthat he did not intervene sooner because he did not know until he saw the proposed consent \njudgment that the parties would enter into a settlement agreement that would be adverse to the \nState and its Attorney General.  But the relevant question is when he would have been on notice \nthat there was a risk that his interests would not be adequately protected by the MSPD Defendants.  \nSee Floyd v. City of New York, 770 F.3d 1051, 1059 (2d Cir. 2014) (reasoning that notice of \npotential resolution did not justify prior delay when movant “should have known that [its] \n‘interests might not be adequately represented’ far in advance of any indication that the [parties] \nmight settle the dispute” (citation omitted)); see also Harris v. Pernsley, 113 F.R.D. 615, 619–20 \n(E.D. Pa. 1986) (finding that “the [DA] was not entitled to wait for ‘official notice’ of a proposed \nsettlement to attempt to intervene” but rather, “was required to move to intervene as soon as he \nknew or should have known that his interests were no longer adequately protected”), aff’d, 820 \nF.2d 592 (3d Cir. 1987). \nFurther, if the Attorney General felt that he was entitled to a seat at the table during \nmediation in order to protect his interests or the interests of the State generally, he was at liberty \nto move to intervene shortly after the Court ordered the parties to proceed to mediation on March \n1, 2019.  Doc. 213.   See Sokaogon Chippewa Cmty. v. Babbitt, 214 F.3d 941, 948 (7th Cir. 2000) \n(“[I]f [the movant] was concerned about settlement negotiations not taking its interests into \naccount, it should have moved to intervene at such a time when it would have been able to \nparticipate in them.”).    \nIn short, given the Attorney General’s knowledge of the case for a “significant period of \ntime,” prior involvement in mediation and resultant familiarity with the relief sought by Plaintiffs, \n6 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 6 of 19\n\nand  early  concern  (dating  back  to  January  2018)  that  its  interests  may  not  adequately  be \nrepresented by the MSPD Defendants, the Attorney General’s delay in seeking to intervene is \nunjustified.  See In re Wholesale Grocery Prods. Antitrust Litig., 849 F.3d 761, 767 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(noting that would-be intervenor’s knowledge of the litigation “often weighs heavily in cases \nwhere the would-be intervenor was aware of the litigation for a significant period of time before \nattempting to intervene”); Arrow v. Gambler’s Supply, Inc., 55 F.3d 407, 409 (8th Cir. 1995) \n(affirming denial of motion to intervene as untimely when movant “monitored [the] suit . . . for \nnearly two years and then moved to join the litigation when the parties reached a settlement \nagreement one month before the trial date”).  \nMoreover, the parties would be prejudiced by the Attorney General’s late intervention in \nthis case.  The parties have engaged in extensive written discovery, conducted more than fifteen \ndepositions, disclosed three experts along with their written reports, engaged in time-consuming \nsettlement discussions, and ultimately, through the MAP, reached an agreement that is satisfactory \nto each party.  The parties have invested significant work to avoid the uncertainties of trial.  To \npermit the Attorney General to enter the case as a party at this late juncture would be a substantial \nburden on the parties that did their work in a timely fashion as ordered by the Court.  See U.S. \nBank Nat. Ass’n, 765 F.3d at 870 (concluding “[i]t was reasonable for the [district] court to think \nthe parties could be prejudiced by having to cover the same ground again”); R & G Mortg. Corp., \n584 F.3d at 9 (reasoning that when “proposed intervention [is] aimed at disrupting [a] settlement, \nthe harm that intervention would have worked to the original parties [is] manifest”).  Tardy \nintervention after the parties have reached a resolution of their differences and on the cusp of trial \n7 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 7 of 19\n\nis prejudicial.2 \nThus, in light of the Attorney General’s two-year knowledge of the action and failure to \nprovide a reasonable explanation for the delay in seeking intervention, the advanced stage of this \nlitigation, and the substantial risk of prejudice to the existing parties who have reached an amicable \nresolution, the Court finds that the Attorney General’s motion to intervene is untimely.   \nB.  Intervention as of Right \nEven if the Attorney General’s motion to intervene had been timely, the Court would deny \nthe motion to intervene as a matter of right because the Attorney General has failed to demonstrate \na “cognizable interest in the subject matter of the litigation” that “might be impaired by the \ndisposition of the case.”  Chiglo v. City of Preston, 104 F.3d 185, 187 (8th Cir. 1997).  Although \nRule 24 is “liberally construed with all doubts resolved in favor of the proposed intervenor,” an \napplicant must nonetheless demonstrate that (1) he has a “cognizable interest in the subject matter \nof the litigation,” (2) the interest may be “impaired” as a result of the litigation, and (3) the interest \n“is not adequately protected by the existing parties to the litigation.” South Dakota ex rel. Barnett \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 317 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir. 2003) (citing Chiglo, 104 F.3d at 187); see \nalso Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).   \n1.  Interest \nFor the purposes of Rule 24(a)(2), an asserted interest must be “significantly protectable,” \nDonaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 531 (1971), which has been interpreted to mean “legally \n                                                            \n2 “[E]ven absent any prejudice, the district court [i]s free to conclude that given the progress of the \nlitigation, the [would-be intervenors’] knowledge of it, and the [would-be intervenor’s] failure to \nadequately explain the delay, the motion was untimely.”  Tarek ibn Ziyad Acad., 643 F.3d at 1095 \n(affirming denial of motion to intervene as untimely in the absence of prejudice); Arrow, 55 F.3d \nat 409 (reasoning that even if intervention would not prejudice existing parties, the progress of the \nlitigation and intervenors’ knowledge of it permitted the district court to find motion untimely). \n8 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 8 of 19\n\nprotectable,” United States v. Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d 829, 839 (8th Cir. 2009) \n(citing New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 732 F.2d 452, 464 (5th Cir. \n1984)).  In other words, Rule 24(a)(2) requires more than a “generalized interest” or stake in the \nlitigation.  Id. (“[A]n undifferentiated, generalized interest in the outcome of an ongoing action is \ntoo porous a foundation on which to premise intervention as of right” (quoting Pub Serv. Co. v. \nPatch, 136 F.3d 197, 205 (1st Cir. 1998))). \na.  The Capacity in Which the Attorney General Seeks to Intervene \nThe nature of the Attorney General’s interest is circumscribed by the capacity in which he \nseeks to intervene.  As the discussion of timeliness above indicates, the capacity in which the \nAttorney General seeks to intervene is not clear.  The Attorney General states that he seeks to \nintervene in his “official capacity,” but not as counsel for the State or other state entities.  Doc. \n231, p. 1; see also Doc. 236 (Oral Argument Transcript), p. 4.  However, this assertion appears \ninconsistent with longstanding jurisprudence that a lawsuit against a state official in his or her \nofficial capacity “is no different from a suit against the State itself.”  Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State \nPolice, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); see also Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991) (“Suits [naming] \nstate officials in their official capacity . . . should be treated as suits [naming] the State.”).3   \n                                                            \n3 Oral argument did not clarify the Attorney General’s position: \nThe Court:  I want to know specifically who is seeking to intervene and in what \ncapacity. \nMr. Morgan:  The Attorney General is seeking to intervene in his official capacity \nas the Attorney General. \n. . . \nThe Court: “Official capacity is when [the Attorney General is] representing the \nstate, he is the state, he’s acting as a state actor.  Or are you saying he is \nentering . . . in his capacity as the Attorney General, not on behalf of the \n \n9 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 9 of 19\n\nTo the extent that the Attorney General seeks to intervene in his official capacity, as the \nState, the State forfeited that right when it sought and obtained its dismissal based on sovereign \nimmunity.  “The law of the case doctrine prevents the relitigation of a settled issue in a case and \nrequires courts to adhere to decisions made in earlier proceedings.”  KPERS. v. Blackwell, Sanders, \nMatheny, Weary & Lombardi, L.C., 114 F.3d 679, 687 (8th Cir. 1997).  On the State’s motion and \nappeal, which the Attorney General brought, the Eighth Circuit concluded that Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst the State are barred by sovereign immunity.  See generally Church, 913 F.3d 736.  \nAccordingly, the law of this case—indeed the law of the Eighth Circuit—is that the State cannot \nbe held liable on Plaintiffs’ claims.  As the State was granted dismissal on the basis of sovereign \nimmunity and cannot be liable for Plaintiffs’ claims, intervention by the Attorney General on \nbehalf of the State is not proper.   \nInsofar as the Attorney General seeks to intervene on behalf of the MSPD Defendants, see \nDoc. 223, p. 10 (“The Attorney General will assert the defense that Defendants have [provided \nconstitutionally-adequate representation to criminal defendants].”), he has failed to articulate any \nlegal basis for doing so.  Under Missouri law, the MSPD is an “independent department” of \nMissouri’s  judicial  branch  vested  with  the  responsibility  of  providing  counsel  to  indigent \ndefendants facing incarceration.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 600.019.1; see also State ex rel. Mo. Pub. Def. \nComm’n v. Pratte, 298 S.W.3d 870, 875–76 (Mo. banc 2009) (discussing history of MSPD).  The \n                                                            \nState, not in any way on behalf of the State as an entity or on behalf of the \ngovernment or on behalf of any other state actor, solely as the Attorney \nGeneral of the State of Missouri? \nMr. Morgan: “The Attorney General.  Yeah, your Honor, it’s solely as the Attorney \nGeneral. . . . Certainly he is entering in his . . . constitutional and statutory \ncapacity as the Attorney General.” \nDoc. 236, 5:17–6:22. \n10 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 10 of 19\n\nAttorney General, in contrast, has no legal duties or powers with regard to the provision of legal \nrepresentation for indigent defendants.  It is the MSPD Defendants, not the Attorney General, that \nwould incur liability if the MSPD’s representation of the Plaintiffs were found to violate the \nConstitution.  As a legally independent government entity, it is the MSPD that is vested with the \nright and authority to litigate on its own behalf, as it has done at various times in recent years and \nthroughout this case.4  Thus, the Attorney General does not have authority to intervene to assert \ndefenses on the MSPD Defendants’ behalf over their objections. \nb.  The Interests of the Attorney General \nThe Attorney General provides only vague descriptions of the “broad interests” allegedly \nat stake for him individually in this litigation.5  Doc. 231, p. 1.  The Attorney General asserts \ninterests in “protect[ing] the interests of the State and all of its citizens,” Doc. 223 (Suggestions in \n                                                            \n4 See, e.g., Pratte, 298 S.W.3d at 872 (MSPD represented by counsel Mermelstein, among others); \nState ex rel. Mo. Pub. Def. Comm’n v. Waters, 370 S.W.3d 592, 596 (Mo. banc 2012) (same); \nBarrett v. Greitens, 542 S.W.3d 370, 374 (Mo. Ct. App. 2017) (MSPD Director represented by \ncounsel Mermelstein).   \n5 The Attorney General’s failure to file a proposed pleading, as required by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 24(c), only compounds the issue, as the Court is unable to look to the Attorney General’s \nproposed answer or counterclaim for context in identifying the alleged interest at stake or how he \nplans to protect that interest in this litigation.  United Fire & Cas. Co. v. Titan Contractors Serv., \nInc., No. 10-2076, 2012 WL 3065517, at *6 (E.D. Mo. July 27, 2012) (“The proposed intervenors \nhave not, however, complied with Rule 24(c) which requires a motion to intervene to ‘be \naccompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.’  \nTherefore, the exact parameters of the proposed intervention are not known.” (quoting Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 24(c)); see also United Fire & Cas. Co. v. Titan Contractors Serv., Inc., No. 10-2076, 2014 WL \n4851801, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Sept. 29, 2014) (denying intervention in part because the movants “ha[d] \nnot complied with the requirements of Rule 24(c), and d[id] not seek to assert their own individual \nclaims or defenses against either party”).  This is more than a mere formality.  St. Charles Tower, \nInc. v. Cty. of Franklin, Mo., No. 09-987, 2009 WL 3852462, at *1 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 17, 2009) \n(“This requirement is not merely a procedural formality, but is integral to the Court’s necessary \nanalysis of the legal rights asserted by the intervenor, and concomitant issues such as standing and \njurisdiction.”).  A pleading is essential for an analysis of the Rule 24 factors, especially given the \nunusual procedural posture of this case.  Further, neither during nor after oral argument did the \nAttorney General seek to clarify his defenses or counterclaims.   \n11 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 11 of 19\n\nSupport of Motion to Intervene), p. 2; “the state’s criminal justice and prosecution system,” id. at \n4;  “enforcement  of  the  General  Assembly’s  statutory  purposes,”  id.;  “ongoing  criminal \nproceedings,” id. at 5; “ensur[ing] that the rule of law is upheld,” id. at 7; “protecting public safety, \npromoting the public welfare, and ensuring the integrity of a criminal prosecution.” id. at 8; \n“health, safety, and welfare of all Missourians,” Doc. 231, p. 3; and “the overall functioning of the \njustice system,” id.  The Attorney General also speaks generally about the “state’s police power to \nprotect its people,” and his interest “[a]cting on behalf of the State” as “the state’s chief lawyer \nand law enforcement officer.”  Doc. 223, p. 3.   \nThe Attorney General cites the fact that both common law and Mo. Rev. Stat. § 27.010 et \nseq. confer upon him the “broad authority,” Doc. 231, p. 3, to, “[w]hen directed by the governor . \n. . aid any prosecuting or circuit attorney in the discharge of their respective duties in the trial \ncourts and in examinations before grand juries,” id. § 27.030, “appear on behalf of the state in the \ncourt of appeals and in the supreme court,” id. § 27.050, and to  \ninstitute, in the name and on the behalf of the state, all civil suits and \nother proceedings at law or in equity requisite or necessary to protect \nthe rights and interests of the state, and enforce any and all rights, \ninterests or claims against any and all persons, firms or corporations \nin whatever court or jurisdiction such action may be necessary; and \nhe  may  also  appear  and  interplead,  answer  or  defend,  in  any \nproceeding or tribunal in which the state’s interests are involved.  \nid. § 27.060.  The Attorney General argues that Mo. Rev. Stat § 27.060, as interpreted by the \nMissouri Supreme Court in Dunivan v. State, 466 S.W.3d 514, 518 (Mo. 2015), gives him the \nunconditional statutory right to intervene.  However, Dunivan considered whether Section 27.060 \nprovided  absolute  authority  to  intervene  under  Missouri  Rule  52.12(a)(1),  which  permits \nintervention as of right “when a statute of th[e] state confers an unconditional right to intervene.”  \nBut the Attorney General removed this case to federal court, so whether the Attorney General’s \nlegal duties under Missouri law are sufficient for intervention as of right is a question of federal \n12 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 12 of 19\n\nlaw.  Harris v. Pernsley, 820 F.2d 592, 597 n.7 (3d Cir. 1987); New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc, 732 \nF.2d at 466 n.29 (“[A]s this is a suit in federal court, federal law governs the requirements for \nintervention, standing and real party in interest status, including the character of interest which is \nnecessary for such purposes.”).  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a federal, rather than \na state, statute to confer an unconditional right to intervene, Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(1), and the \nAttorney General has not pointed to any such statute.   \nMoreover, the authorities the Attorney General cites as conferring a right to intervene in \nfederal  court  contemplate  interests  more  specific  than  those  articulated  here  and  involved \nintervention on a more limited basis than the Attorney General proposes.  See, e.g., Pfizer Ireland \nPharm. v. Albers Med., Inc., 225 F.R.D. 591, 592–93 (W.D. Mo. 2004) (granting the Government \nleave to intervene for the limited purpose of seeking a stay of discovery when continuation of civil \ndiscovery would put overlapping criminal investigation at risk). \n2.  Risk of Impairment and Adequacy of Representation \nEven affording the Attorney General the benefit of any doubt and assuming, for the purpose \nof this motion, that the interests articulated by the Attorney General can be legally protectable in \nfederal court, the Court cannot find on the record presented that the Attorney General’s interests, \neven  liberally  construed,  may  be  impaired  by  this  litigation.    A  proposed  intervenor  must \n“demonstrate that the subject matter of the action affects its interests in a direct rather than \ntangential way.”  Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d at 839.  Intervention is not appropriate \nwhen any impact on the claimed impairment is “‘contingent upon the occurrence of a sequence of \nevents’” beyond the litigation.  Id. at 840 (quoting Standard Heating & Air Conditioning Co. v. \nCity of Minneapolis, 137 F.3d 567, 571 (8th Cir. 1998)).   \n13 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 13 of 19\n\nThe Attorney General asserts that requirements in the consent judgment that the MSPD \n“take certain actions in criminal trials and appeals,” including “conducting discovery under certain \ntimelines, requesting hearings, filing briefs, and seeking oral argument,” will affect his work in \n“routinely appear[ing] on the other side of a party represented by a public defender.”  Doc. 223, \npp. 5–6.  However, the Attorney General does not articulate how a change in the MSPD’s litigation \nstrategies would impair his own interests.  Indeed, the actions described would likely improve the \nquality of the litigation and therefore would advance the Attorney General’s interest in avoiding \npostconviction motions based on constitutionally defective representation.  Further, any suggestion \nthat the proposed consent judgment will somehow result in an increase of appeals or habeas \nproceedings in which the Attorney General is required to appear is purely hypothetical.  The \nproposed  consent  judgment  does  not  concede  that  the  MSPD  has  provided  constitutionally \ninadequate representation, and how much weight may be ascribed to the consent judgment in future \nchallenges to the MSPD’s prior legal representation is purely speculative.  In short, the Attorney \nGeneral has not shown that this lawsuit is likely to affect the Attorney General’s interests in any \ndirect way.    \nThe Attorney General also asserts that, under the consent judgment, “prosecutors may be \nasked to eliminate incarceration as a possible sentence in criminals proceedings”; “courts may be \nrequired to entirely dismiss criminal cases”; and “[i]ndividuals accused of some of the most serious \nfelonies in Missouri—rape, kidnapping, armed robbery—may walk free without undergoing a trial \nbecause a public defender’s office will refuse to take any cases that will require an attorney to \nwork more than 40 hours per week.”  Doc. 223, p. 6.6  This, in turn, the Attorney General argues, \n                                                            \n6 The Attorney General takes specific issue with the portion of the proposed consent judgment that \n“provid[es] for dismissal of a case ‘in lieu of processing additional indigence applications when \n \n14 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 14 of 19\n\nwill hamper his ability to protect the public safety, promote the public welfare, and ensure the \nintegrity of criminal prosecutions.   \nHowever, these outcomes are contingent on multiple factors beyond the disposition of this \ncase, and the Attorney General has not established, or even argued, that these contingencies are \nlikely.  Moreover, the proposed consent judgment does not appear to alter, or prevent the Attorney \nGeneral from performing, any of his duties.  It does not obligate the Attorney General to take or \nrefrain from taking any action, nor could he be held in contempt for violating the proposed consent \njudgment.  Thus, while the proposed consent judgment may have some indirect effects on the \nAttorney General’s enforcement function, any such effects would not create the kind of direct, \nsubstantial impairment that permits intervention as of right.  See Harris, 820 F.2d at 600 (denying \nintervention  in  case  involving  unconstitutional  prison  conditions  despite  district  attorney’s \nargument that a cap on prison inmates could hinder his ability to prosecute crimes because the \n                                                            \n[the 40 hour-per-week] standard has been reached.’”  Doc. 223, p. 7 (quoting Exhibit 1, p. 29).  \nBut the proposed consent judgment merely requires that the MSPD:  \nnotif[y] the circuit court that the caseload standard has been reached in order to \npromptly allow the court to: (1) appoint private counsel pursuant to State ex rel. \nWolff v. Ruddy, 617 S.W.2d 64 (1981) and Willamson v. Vardeman, 674 F.2d 1211 \n(1982); (2) engage with the prosecutor regarding the elimination of incarceration \nas a possible sentence for the offense(s) charged, thus eliminating the constitutional \nright to an attorney pursuant to Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 373-74 (1979); \n(3) dismiss the case per the requirements set forth in Ruddy and Williamson; or \n(4) take any other actions  that are consistent with the constitutions of the United \nStates and Missouri, and that do not violate the requirements and limitations of this \nConsent Judgment.   \nExhibit 1, pp. 29–30.  Dismissing the case per the requirements set forth in Ruddy and Williamson \nis only one of several options left to the criminal court’s discretion.  The relevant language in the \nconsent judgment does not purport to require the criminal court or the prosecutor to do anything \nat all.  Id. \n15 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 15 of 19\n\ndistrict attorney had “no function in the administration of the prisons” and could not be held liable \nfor any unlawful conditions).   \nThe Attorney General also asserts that the consent judgment implicates his interest in \n“ensur[ing] that the rule of law is upheld” because it “undermines statutes that address the \nworkload and resources of Missouri public defenders.”  Doc. 223, pp. 6, 7.  However, the Attorney \nGeneral has not established that the interest might be impaired or inadequately protected absent \nhis  intervention.    “‘[I]f  an  existing  party  to  the  suit  is  charged  with  the  responsibility  of \nrepresenting the intervenor’s interests, a presumption of adequate representation arises’” that is \n“‘not overcome’” by “‘[a] difference of opinion concerning litigation strategy or individual aspects \nof a remedy.’”  F.T.C. v. Johnson, 800 F.3d 448, 452 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Chiglo, 104 F.3d at \n187  and  Jenkins  ex  rel.  Jenkins  v.  Missouri,  78  F.3d  1270,  1275  (8th  Cir.1996)).    Thus, \nnotwithstanding any conflict of interest between the MSPD Defendants and the Attorney General, \nthe MSPD’s own interest in ensuring that it operates in accordance with state law creates the \npresumption  of  adequate  representation.    Moreover,  the  Court  is  required  to  independently \nevaluate whether the proposed consent judgment is consistent with the Constitution, statutes, and \njurisprudence, and it cannot approve a consent judgment that is contrary to law.  See St. Charles \nTower, Inc. v. Kurtz, 643 F.3d 264, 268 (8th Cir. 2011) (“While parties can settle their litigation \nwith consent decrees, they cannot agree to ‘disregard valid state laws.’” (quoting Perkins v. City \nof Chicago Heights, 47 F.3d 212, 216 (7th Cir. 1995))).  Thus, while the Attorney General has an \ninterest in upholding the rule of law in the State of Missouri, he cannot show that the interest will \n16 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 16 of 19\n\nbe unprotected here, because the interest is shared by both the MSPD and the Court.  Insofar as \nthe consent judgment violates the law, the Court will not enter it.7 \nC.  Permissive Intervention \nThe Court also finds that permissive intervention is unwarranted.  Under Rule 24(b)(1), a \ncourt may grant a party permission to intervene in a case if the party “has a claim or defense that \nshares with the main action a common question of law or fact.”8  In determining whether to permit \nintervention, courts consider whether: (1) “the motion to intervene is timely”; (2) “the movant’s \nclaim shares a question of law or fact in common with the main action”; and (3) “intervention will \nunduly delay or prejudice adjudication of the original parties’ rights.”  Franconia Minerals (US) \nLLC v. United States, 319 F.R.D. 261, 266 (D. Minn. 2017).  “The principal consideration in ruling \non a Rule 24(b) motion is whether the proposed intervention would unduly delay or prejudice the \nadjudication of the parties’ rights.”  Barnett, 317 F.3d at 787. \nAs discussed above, intervention by the Attorney General as a full-party defendant at this \nstage in the case would result in substantial delay and prejudice to the adjudication of the parties’ \nrights.  The parties to this case have reached a resolution which, according to them, will end the \nMSPD Defendants’ practice of creating waiting lists and that aims to ensure that the MSPD \n                                                            \n7 As explained below, the Court will permit the Attorney General to submit an amicus brief to \nassist the Court in its determination of whether the proposed consent judgment is consistent with \nthe law. \n8 Although the Attorney General cites Rule 24(b)(2) as grounds for permissive intervention in his \nmotion, Doc. 222, the entirety of his argument in the Suggestions in Support, Doc. 223, and Reply, \nDoc. 231, is premised on and specifically cites only Rule 24(b)(1)(B).  Additionally, the Attorney \nGeneral did not highlight in a separate pleading any provision he is charged with administering \nthat is implicated in this case because no pleading was filed.  In any event, Rule 24(b)(3) requires \na court to consider delay and prejudice regardless of whether intervention is sought under Rule \n24(b)(1) or (b)(2), the following analysis would apply under Rule 24(b)(2) as well. \n \n17 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 17 of 19\n\nDefendants provide Plaintiffs with attorneys who will have time to provide constitutionally \nadequate representation.  The Attorney General’s request that the Court now undo the work of the \nparties and MAP mediator in reaching a settlement, and instead make a “reasonable adjustment to \nthe scheduling order” to permit “additional discovery”9 in a case that is over two years old, is \nunjustified.  Doc. 223, p. 9.   \nMoreover, denial of permissive intervention is appropriate where a would-be intervenor’s \nproposed pleading fails to raise any claim or defense that is “different from those of the existing \nparties.”  Standard Heating & Air Conditioning Co., 137 F.3d at 573; see also Oklahoma ex rel. \nEdmondson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 619 F.3d 1223, 1233 (10th Cir. 2010) (noting that the “relevant” \ninterests  of  a  would-be  intervenor  “are  the  interests  pursued  in  its  proposed  complaint  in \nintervention”).  Here, because the Attorney General did not file a proposed answer or counterclaim, \nthe Court is unable to assess whether the Attorney General’s proposed claims or defenses differ \nfrom those of the parties.  This problem is compounded by the Attorney General’s failure to \narticulate how he would be directly and concretely injured if intervention is denied. \nFor the above reasons, permissive intervention is denied. \nD.  Amicus Brief \nAlthough the Court finds that the Attorney General has not made a showing sufficient to \nwarrant intervention, in light of the Court’s obligation to consider whether the proposed consent \njudgment comports with applicable law, the Court will permit the Attorney General to submit an \namicus brief concerning whether the proposed consent judgment is consistent with Missouri law \n                                                            \n9 He does not specify how much or what additional discovery would be needed, or whether \nadditional hearings also would be needed.  At oral argument, the Attorney General also expressed \nan intent to file dispositive motions.  Doc. 236, p. 21:16–18.   \n18 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 238   Filed 07/12/19   Page 18 of 19\n\nand whether the proposed consent judgment will unavoidably and adversely affect public safety \nand welfare in a concrete and particularized way.  \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Attorney General’s motion to intervene, Doc. 222, is \ndenied.  The Attorney General’s related motion to stay these proceedings, Doc. 224, is denied as \nmoot.  However, the Attorney General may, within two weeks of the date of this Order, file an \namicus brief not exceeding 25 pages that addresses whether the proposed consent judgment \ncomports with Missouri law and whether it will unavoidably and adversely affect public safety \nand welfare in a concrete and particularized way.  Plaintiffs and the MSPD Defendants will each \nhave two weeks after the filing of the amicus brief to file a response. \n \ns/ Nanette K. Laughrey \nNANETTE K.

More than 50 years ago, the Supreme Court, in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 \n(1963), held that the United States Constitution requires every State to provide counsel for \ncriminal defendants who are unable to afford an attorney.  As the Supreme Court has since \nexplained, “Lawyers in criminal cases are necessities, not luxuries. . . .  Without counsel, the \nright to a trial itself would be of little avail.”  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 653 (1984) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \n2. But the constitutional right to counsel is not merely the right to a warm body licensed to \npractice law at one’s side once trial begins.  The right attaches well before trial, because “certain \npretrial events may so prejudice the outcome of the defendant’s prosecution that, as a practical \nmatter, the defendant must be represented at those events in order to enjoy genuinely effective \nassistance at trial.”  Rothgery v. Gillespie Cty., Tex., 554 U.S. 191, 217 (2008).  And the right \nencompasses more than “counsel in name only,” see State ex rel. Missouri Pub. Def. Comm’n v. \nWaters, 370 S.W.3d 592, 597 (Mo. 2012), because unless a lawyer provides meaningful \nassistance, “there has been a denial of Sixth Amendment rights that makes the adversary process \nitself presumptively unreliable.”  Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659.    \n3. Despite these well-established and long-standing principles, the State of Missouri has \nfailed to meet its constitutional obligation to provide indigent defendants with meaningful \nrepresentation.  For more than two decades, Defendants have failed to provide the resources \nrequired to adequately represent poor people accused of crimes in Missouri, leading to the actual \nand constructive denial of counsel for, and ineffective representation of, indigent defendants \nacross the State. \n2 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n4. The State’s indigent defense budget is shockingly inadequate.  At an average of only \n$356 per case, Missouri ranks 49th out of 50 states in per capita indigent defense funding.   \n5. Without sufficient funding, overstretched and under-resourced Missouri State Public \nDefender (MSPD) attorneys are forced to handle far too many cases and to devote far too few \nhours to each case.  Public defenders average just 8.7 hours on the most serious non-homicide \nfelonies, amounting to less than 20 percent of the minimum time recommended by the American \nBar Association (ABA).  Overall, they are forced to devote fewer than the minimum hours \nrecommended by the ABA in more than 97 percent of their cases.   \n6. The consequences for indigent criminal defendants such as Plaintiffs—who must wait, \noften in jail, while their public defenders scramble to find even minimal time to devote to their \ncases—are devastating.  An MSPD attorney told Plaintiff Shondel Church that his case was \nwinnable but that Mr. Church would have to sit in jail for six months before the attorney would \nhave time to prepare the case.  Even though Mr. Church decided to take an unjustified plea, he \nhad to wait in jail for nearly three months before he was able to enter the plea—months of \nincarceration for which he will now be required to pay over $2,600.  The MSPD attorney \nrepresenting Plaintiff Randall Lee Dalton did not meet with him or return his sister’s desperate \nphone calls for weeks, and so did not know the extent of his client’s mental impairment or need \nof medication.  Plaintiff Dorian Samuels’ lawyer seemed entirely unprepared to advocate for a \nbond reduction or to cross-examine a crucial prosecution witness, at least in part because he did \nnot have time for a substantive conversation with Mr. Samuels in advance of the hearing.  \nPlaintiff Viola Bowman has been incarcerated for more than two years as her attorney seeks \ncontinuance after continuance to buy time to adequately investigate her case while he \nsimultaneously manages his district’s entire office.  Hearings in Plaintiff Brian Richman’s case \n3 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nhave repeatedly occurred in front of the judge but without Mr. Richman present; Mr. Richman’s \nattorney waived Mr. Richman’s constitutional right to appear on his own behalf at those hearings \nwithout even consulting with Mr. Richman. \n7. As the experiences of Plaintiffs indicate, despite the best efforts of MSPD’s dedicated \nattorneys and support staff, MSPD’s crushing workloads result in indigent defendants throughout \nthis state being actually or constructively denied their right to counsel at critical stages of their \ncases.   \n8. Indigent defendants are frequently denied any representation whatsoever at \narraignments and other initial hearings, leaving them to fend for themselves when bond \ndeterminations and other critical decisions are made.   \n9. Even when a public defender is present, she is often ill-equipped to advocate effectively \nfor her client.  Public defenders have little time to meet and consult with their clients, and this \nlack of consultation precludes indigent defendants from participating meaningfully in their own \ndefense.  It also impedes public defenders from investigating their clients’ family and community \nties in order advocate for pretrial release and to develop alternatives to detention.  Plaintiff \nSamuels, for instance, did not even meet with his public defender before his re-arraignment—\nwhich occurred more than two months after Mr. Samuels’ arrest—meaning that the public \ndefender did not have any information with which to argue for a bond reduction.  Plaintiff \nDalton’s sister ultimately interceded in an effort to obtain a furlough on his behalf because his \npublic defender did not have time to investigate Mr. Dalton’s history of mental health issues, let \nalone seek out alternative placements. \n10. Public defenders’ unmanageable workloads force them to triage, performing too little \ninvestigation too late to effectively identify exculpatory evidence, reviewing discovery only as \n4 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \ntime allows, rarely taking advantage of defendants’ statutory right to depositions, and seeking \ncontinuance after continuance of their clients’ trial dates.  For example, Plaintiff Bowman’s trial \ndate has been continued for over two years as her attorney struggles to find the time to \nadequately investigate her case. \n11. Because of these deficiencies, indigent criminal defendants who might otherwise be \nreleased on bond remain in pretrial detention unnecessarily.  This leads many defendants to plead \nguilty just to get out of jail, irrespective of the merits of the State’s case against them.  For \nexample, though Plaintiff Church was told his was a winnable case, he felt compelled to plead \nguilty just to avoid remaining in jail for months awaiting trial.  \n12. When they exercise their right to a trial, defendants frequently cannot present their \ndefenses effectively, because MSPD attorneys have not had the time to investigate potential \ndefenses, interview key witnesses, review discovery materials, or even communicate consistently \nwith their clients.  After trial, indigent defendants are more likely to receive harsher sentences \nthan the facts of their case warrant, given their lawyer’s inability to explore and advocate for \nreduced sentences or alternatives to imprisonment.  \n13. Taken separately, any one of these consequences would indicate that public defenders \nare not equipped with the tools necessary to fulfill their role as zealous advocates.  Together, \nthese deficiencies ensure that the meaningful adversarial testing on which the just operation of \nour legal system depends—and which the United States and Missouri Constitutions demand—is \noften absent in Missouri criminal courts.   \n14. Defendants and their predecessors have been on notice for decades that, starved of \nnecessary resources, training, and supervision, MSPD cannot provide constitutionally adequate \nlegal representation to Missouri’s indigent criminal defendants.  But, despite every opportunity \n5 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nto do so, Defendants have failed to rectify the grave problems in Missouri’s public defender \nsystem. \n15. The same problems that plague the indigent criminal defense system also infect \nMissouri’s juvenile court system.  Although the Supreme Court has declared that a juvenile \n“requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him,” In re Gault, \n387 U.S. 1, 36 (1967), Missouri’s indigent juveniles are often left without the meaningful \nguidance that the Constitution demands, again due to lack of resources for MSPD and resulting \nhigh workloads.  Indeed, according to a recent report from the United States Department of \nJustice, a staggering 60 percent of juveniles accused of crimes in Missouri proceed without \nappointed counsel.  When MSPD attorneys do represent juveniles, they spend an average of just \n4.6 hours on each case, less than one quarter of the minimum time recommended by the ABA.  \nAs a result, indigent juvenile respondents often have no effective advocate standing between \nthem and detention, or at the very least, a record that could follow them into adulthood. \n16.  The lack of funding for MSPD has created an environment in which no public defender \nin this State can provide constitutionally adequate representation for all of their clients, including \nPlaintiffs. \n17.  The State of Missouri faces an urgent constitutional crisis.  As demonstrated by the \ncases of each of the named Plaintiffs, that crisis will only worsen until MSPD attorneys are \nequipped with the tools and resources they need to provide indigent defendants with the level of \nrepresentation to which they are constitutionally entitled. \n18. Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated persons, seek to \nvindicate their constitutional and statutory rights to be guided by competent counsel at all critical \nstages of their criminal and juvenile delinquency proceedings, as required by the Fifth, Sixth, and \n6 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nFourteenth Amendments, the United States Supreme Court’s decisions in Gideon, Cronic, Gault,\nand their progeny, and all applicable state constitutional and statutory provisions.  Plaintiffs ask \nthis Court to issue a judgment declaring Missouri’s public defense system unconstitutional, and \nto order Defendants to take whatever steps are necessary to bring the system into compliance \nwith federal and state law.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19. This Court maintains original subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under Sections \n526.030 and 527.010 of the Missouri Revised Statutes and Missouri Rule of Civil Procedure \n87.01. \n20. Venue is proper in this Court because Governor Eric R. Greitens maintains an office in \nCole County, Missouri. \nPARTIES \nA. Plaintiffs  \n21. Plaintiff SHONDEL CHURCH is a resident of Kansas City, Missouri.  Mr. Church was \narrested on or about July 19, 2016, and charged with felony theft.  Mr. Church was deemed \nindigent following his arrest and was therefore entitled to representation by MSPD.  Mr. Church \npled guilty to misdemeanor theft on November 21, 2016, after approximately four months’ pre-\ntrial incarceration.  He received two years’ probation and a suspended six-month jail sentence.    \n22. Plaintiff RANDALL LEE DALTON was arrested on or about January 30, 2017, and \ncharged with felony possession of a controlled substance.  Mr. Dalton was deemed indigent \nfollowing his arrest, and was therefore entitled to representation by MSPD.  Mr. Dalton was \nbriefly released on a furlough from pretrial detention, only to be returned to jail after his \n7 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nalternative placement fell through.  He currently remains in pretrial detention awaiting resolution \nof his criminal case.  During this time, he lost his residence in Laurie, Missouri. \n23. Plaintiff DORIAN SAMUELS is a resident of Joplin, Missouri.  Mr. Samuels was \narrested on or about May 30, 2016, and charged with second-degree assault.  Mr. Samuels was \ndeemed indigent following his arrest, and was therefore entitled to representation by MSPD.  Mr. \nSamuels remains in pretrial detention on $20,000 cash bond.  \n24. Plaintiff VIOLA BOWMAN lived in Warsaw, Missouri, before her arrest.  Ms. \nBowman was arrested on or about January 6, 2015, and charged with first-degree murder and \narmed criminal action.  Ms. Bowman was deemed indigent following her arrest and was \ntherefore entitled to representation by MSPD.  Ms. Bowman remains in pretrial detention on \n$1,000,000 cash bond.   \n25. Plaintiff BRIAN RICHMAN is a resident of Ozark, Missouri.  Mr. Richman was \narrested on or about June 26, 2016, and charged with a series of felony drug offenses.  Mr. \nRichman was deemed indigent following his arrest, and was therefore entitled to representation \nby MSPD.  Mr. Richman remains in pretrial detention on a bond of over $100,000.   \nB. Defendants\n26. Defendant STATE OF MISSOURI has violated and continues to violate the Missouri \nand United States Constitutions, which require it to ensure that adequate representation is \nprovided to indigent defendants across the State.   \n27. Defendant ERIC R. GREITENS is sued in his official capacity as Governor of the State \nof Missouri.  As chief executive of the State, Governor Greitens bears ultimate responsibility for \nthe provision of constitutionally mandated services, including indigent defense, to the people of \nMissouri.  The Governor of Missouri appoints the members of the Missouri State Public \n8 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nDefender Commission, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The Governor has claimed the \nauthority to withhold money budgeted to the Missouri State Public Defender’s Office and has \nexercised that claimed authority in recent years, including fiscal year 2017.  \n28. Defendant MICHAEL BARRETT is sued in his official capacity as Director of the \nMissouri State Public Defender Office.  In his capacity as Director of MSPD, Defendant Barrett \nmaintains responsibility for ensuring the adequate provision of indigent defense services across \nthe State of Missouri.    \n29. Defendant H. RILEY BOCK is sued in his official capacity as Chair of the Missouri \nState Public Defender Commission.  The Commission governs the Missouri State Public \nDefender system by, among other things, promulgating rules needed for the administration of the \nsystem, monitoring the performance of the Public Defender Office, and receiving complaints \nfrom MSPD clients.  The Commission also has the authority to appoint and remove MSPD’s \nDirector and Deputy Director.  Defendant Bock was appointed to the Commission in January \n2014 and is currently Chair of the Commission.   \n30. Defendant CHARLES R. JACKSON is sued in his official capacity as Vice Chair of the \nMissouri State Public Defender Commission.  Defendant Jackson was appointed to the \nCommission in July 2014 and is currently Vice Chair of the Commission. \n31. Defendant CRAIG CHVAL is sued in his official capacity as Secretary of the Missouri \nState Public Defender Commission.  Defendant Chval was appointed to the Commission in July \n2014. \n32. Defendant A. CRISTA HOGAN is sued in her official capacity as a Member of the \nMissouri State Public Defender Commission.  Defendant Hogan was appointed to the \nCommission in July 2014. \n9 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nGENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nIndigent Defense in Missouri \n33.  The State of Missouri relies almost exclusively on local MSPD offices to provide \nindigent defense services in all 114 counties and St. Louis City. \n34.  MSPD comprises three distinct parts: the Trial Division, subdivided into 33 district \noffices across the State; the Appellate/Post-Conviction Division, subdivided into six offices; and \nthe Capital Division, subdivided into three offices.  State of Missouri Public Defender \nCommission Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Report 5, attached as Ex. 1. \n35. MSPD employs approximately 376 attorneys—including approximately 313 in the Trial \nDivision—and approximately 200 administrative staff, support staff, paralegals, and \ninvestigators to represent indigent defendants in more than 100,000 cases each year, counting \nboth newly opened cases and cases carried over from previous years.  Ex. 1 at 5. \n36. Since the establishment of MSPD in its current form in 1989, there have been at least 10 \nindependent evaluations of Missouri’s public defense system that put state officials on notice that \na constitutional crisis was looming.1\nChronic Underfunding of MSPD \n37.  MSPD is funded almost exclusively from Missouri’s general revenue.  The level of \nfunding provided by the State, however—less than one half of one percent of the State’s general \n1  These include assessments conducted in 1993 (The Spangenberg Group); 2005 (The Spangenberg Group); 2006 \n(Missouri Senate Interim Committee); 2009 (The Spangenberg Group and the Center for Law, Justice, and Society \nat George Mason University); 2010 (U.S. Department of Justice – Bureau of Justice Statistics); 2010 (American Bar \nAssociation); 2013 (National Juvenile Defender Center); 2014 (American Bar Association and RubinBrown); 2015 \n(U.S. Department of Justice); and 2016 (Sixth Amendment Center). \n10 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nrevenue—has long been insufficient to allow MSPD to satisfy the State’s constitutional \nobligation to provide effective assistance of counsel to every indigent criminal defendant. \n38. In fiscal year 2016, for example, the MSPD Trial Division alone handled more than \n75,000 cases—which, given the State’s abysmal funding for indigent defense, equated to an \naverage of only $356 per case.  Ex. 1 at 14, 23. \n39. In August 2015, Defendant Michael Barrett wrote to then-Governor Jay Nixon, \npleading for additional funds.  Barrett noted that, “[f]or years, the Missouri State Public \nDefender (MSPD) has warned that the rights of poor Missourians are being violated throughout \nthe state because MSPD’s resources are too few and the caseloads too high,” but nothing had \nbeen done to rectify the situation.  Letter from M. Barrett to Hon. Nixon, at 1 (Aug. 7, 2015), \nattached as Ex. 8.  He pointed to recent reports by the National Juvenile Defender Center (NJDC) \nand the ABA making clear that existing funding was “woefully inadequate to guarantee the \nconstitutional rights of indigent[ ]” defendants in Missouri.  Id. at 2.  As such, Barrett requested a \n$10 million supplemental budget to provide some of the resources that MSPD urgently needed to \n“meet[] its obligations to its citizens under the U.S. and Missouri Constitutions.”  Id. at 3.  His \nrequest was denied.   \n40. In 2016, a study conducted by the Sixth Amendment Center determined that Missouri’s \nper capita spending on indigent defense is approximately one-third of the average of the 35 states \nthe Center surveyed.  According to the study, in fiscal year 2015, Missouri spent just $6.20 per \nresident for indigent defense services, compared to an average of $18.41 per capita among the \nother States in the study. \n41. It is not surprising, then, that Missouri currently ranks 49th among the 50 states in \nfunding for indigent defense and that “a stark discrepancy” exists between the work that is \n11 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nnecessary to provide the “proper defense of constitutional liberty” and what MSPD is currently \nable to do with the “limited resources on hand.”  Ex. 1 at 1, 17. \n42. Moreover, even when the legislature has taken steps to increase funding, these attempts \nhave been thwarted by the Governor.  In 2015, for example, the legislature approved an \nadditional $3.4 million in funding to MSPD.  Id. at 7. Then-Governor Nixon vetoed the funding.  \nId.  The legislature overrode that veto.  Id.  Governor Nixon nevertheless withheld the funds \nfrom MSPD.  Id.\n43. Likewise, when the legislature approved $4.5 million in additional funding for caseload \nrelief in fiscal year 2017, Governor Nixon directed that all but $1 million of those funds be \nwithheld from MSPD.  Id.\n44. In January 2017, Missouri’s new governor, Defendant Greitens, pledged to restore an \nadditional $2.5 million in the next budget, for a total of $3.5 million, still short of the prior year’s \nallocation of an additional $4.5 million, and far shorter still of the amount necessary to bring \nMissouri up to the constitutionally required minimum standard for indigent defense. \n45.  Upon information and belief, the vast majority of the proposed additional funding, if \ngranted, will go toward hiring private attorneys to represent defendants in cases where MSPD \nattorneys are conflicted out (for example, in cases involving indigent codefendants).  Such \nprivate attorneys are generally paid a low, flat fee.  This means that these attorneys have little \nincentive to devote sufficient resources to the case, making it unlikely that they will provide \nconstitutionally adequate representation for their indigent clients.  For the vast majority of \nindigent defendants, who have no codefendants, that funding will barely move the needle in \nbringing Missouri into compliance with its constitutional obligation to provide counsel. \n12 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n46. Upon information and belief, it would take an additional $20 million or more per year \nfor MSPD to meet the constitutional floor of providing minimally adequate representation to \nindigent defendants.   \nExcessive Workloads\n47. The chronic underfunding of and lack of support for MSPD has led to a staffing crisis \nthat means that MSPD attorneys typically operate at more than double the maximum workload \ncapacity that would allow for the consistent provision of constitutionally adequate representation. \n48. Plaintiffs distinguish between caseloads, which refer only to the raw number of cases on \na public defender’s docket, and workloads, which provide a broader and more accurate view of a \npublic defender’s competing responsibilities.  As the U.S. Department of Justice noted in 2013, \n“caseload limits are no replacement for a careful analysis of a public defender’s workload, a \nconcept that takes into account all of the factors affecting a public defender’s ability to \nadequately represent clients, such as the complexity of cases on a defender’s docket, the \ndefender’s skill and experience, the support services available to the defender, and the defender’s \nother duties.”  Statement of Interest of the United States at 9, Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, \nNo. C11-01100, Dkt. 322 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 14, 2013) (emphasis added), attached as Ex. 2.   \n49. These extraordinarily high workloads have characterized indigent defense in Missouri \nfor decades.  In 1993, the Missouri State Public Defender Commission sought the assistance of \nThe Spangenberg Group (TSG) in studying the internal operations of the Missouri public defense \nsystem, including issues related to budgeting, staffing, and allocation of resources.  TSG’s report \nwas damning.  It concluded that MSPD “lack[ed] the necessary resources to provide competent \nrepresentation,” and that “[t]he legal staff needs to be increased as soon as possible.”  A Report \n13 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \non the Operation of the Missouri State Public Defender, The Spangenberg Group, 6 (June 1993), \nattached as Ex. 3.  \n50. Despite the report’s warning of a “near-crisis situation in the [public defender] system,” \nid. at 8, the State failed to address the systemic problems plaguing MSPD and thus failed to \nmitigate the serious harm being inflicted upon indigent defendants in Missouri. \n51. More than a decade later, the Missouri Bar Association formed a Public Defender Task \nForce to work in conjunction with the Missouri State Public Defender Commission in an effort to \naddress those deficiencies.  In 2005, the task force commissioned TSG to conduct another study \ninto the state of MSPD. \n52. Again, TSG’s findings were bleak.  TSG’s report warned that Missouri’s public \ndefender system was on the verge of collapse and that, despite the best efforts of MSPD’s \nattorneys, many public defenders were routinely failing to comply with MSPD’s Public Defender \nGuidelines for Representation and the Missouri Rules of Professional Conduct.  Assessment of \nthe Missouri State Public Defender System, The Spangenberg Group, 3 (Oct. 26, 2005), attached \nas Ex. 4. \n53. In January 2007, an interim committee of the Missouri Senate released its report on \nMSPD.  The committee found that the caseloads of public defenders were “too large,” and \nrecommended that “caseloads . . . be reduced, support staff be increased, the number of public \ndefenders be increased . . . [and] the base salary of public defenders be[ ] increased.”  Corrected \nReport of the Senate Interim Committee on the Missouri State Public Defender System (Jan. \n2007), attached as Ex. 5.  \n54. In 2009, TSG was again retained by the Missouri Bar Association to assess the State’s \npublic defender system.  In its 2009 report, TSG concluded that public defender workloads had \n14 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nonly worsened since its 2005 report and, as a result of those workloads, public defenders were \nfailing to (1) conduct prompt interviews of their clients following arrest, (2) spend sufficient time \ninterviewing and counseling their clients, (3) advocate effectively for pretrial release, (4) conduct \nthorough investigations of their cases, (5) pursue formal and informal discovery, (6) file \nappropriate and essential pleadings and motions, (7) conduct necessary legal research, and (8) \nprepare adequately for pretrial hearings, trial, and sentencing.  Assessment of the Missouri State \nPublic Defender System, The Spangenberg Group (Oct. 2009), attached as Ex. 6.  \n55. In other words, MSPD lawyers—even the best among them—did not have time to \nperform even the most basic representational duties for their clients.  Despite this clear indication \nthat the State was still falling short of its constitutional obligations, Missouri again failed to take \nthe necessary action to remedy the situation. \n56. In June 2014, the ABA, in collaboration with the prominent accounting firm \nRubinBrown LLP, released the most comprehensive study to date of Missouri’s public defender \nsystem.  The study included an in-depth assessment of public defender workloads for both adult \nand juvenile matters.  SeeThe Missouri Project: A Study of the Missouri Public Defender System \nand Attorney Workload Standards (June 2014), attached as Ex. 7.  \n57. ABA and RubinBrown researchers calculated the minimum number of hours (excluding \ncourt time, travel, and administrative tasks) that an attorney would need to devote to a range of \ndifferent types of cases in order to provide constitutionally adequate representation.  The study \ndetermined that a constitutionally adequate attorney would need to spend a minimum of 106.6 \nhours on a non-capital murder/homicide case; at least 47.6 hours on an A/B felony; at least 25.0 \nhours on a C/D felony; at least 63.8 hours on a felony sex offense; at least 11.7 hours on a \n15 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nmisdemeanor; at least 9.8 hours on a probation violation; and at least 19.5 hours on a juvenile \ncase.  Ex. 7 at 6. \n58. But because MSPD attorneys are forced to take on workloads well above what any \nattorney could reasonably handle, those attorneys are unable to spend anywhere near the \nrequisite number of hours on each case.  In 2015, for example, unreasonably high workloads \nmeant that MSPD attorneys were able to spend, on average, only 84.5 hours on each non-capital \nmurder/homicide case; 8.7 hours on each A/B felony; 4.4 hours on each C/D felony; 25.6 hours \non each felony sex offense; 2.3 hours on each misdemeanor; 1.4 hours on each probation \nviolation; and 4.6 hours on each juvenile case.  Ex. 7 at 15. \n59. Thus, in 2015, under the ABA’s empirical analysis, “attorneys in the St. Louis County \noffice [were] at 265% workload capacity,” and throughout the state, MSPD attorneys were \nsimilarly overworked: “239% capacity for the Springfield office, 254% for Jefferson City, and \n254% for Farmington, to name just a few.”  Ex. 8 at 1. \n60. As demonstrated by the average case-related hours recorded by MSPD attorneys in \n2015, MSPD attorneys are forced to triage their cases, paying especially short shrift to cases in \nwhich defendants face what their attorneys deem to be relatively less serious charges.  Thus, \nwhile MSPD attorneys were able to spend the minimum of 106.6 hours in just one-fifth of the \nnon-capital murder/homicide cases to which they were assigned in 2015, the numbers were far \nworse for non-homicide felonies.  That same year, MSPD Trial Division attorneys were able to \ndevote the minimum required hours to only 2.4% of all A/B felony cases (or 97 out of 4,127 total \nA/B felony cases) and 1.4% of C/D felony cases (or 311 out of 21,491 total C/D felony cases).  \nLetter from J. Shipma to J. Williamson, at 2-4 (July 25, 2016), attached as Ex. 10. \n16 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n61. With so little time to spend on each case, it is virtually impossible for MSPD attorneys \nto provide even basic elements of constitutionally effective assistance.  And with their public \ndefenders overextended by extremely heavy workloads, indigent defendants like Plaintiffs often \nappear before the court unrepresented during initial hearings, including those in which bond is \nset; cannot communicate effectively or confidentially with their attorneys; are forced to make \nimportant decisions about their cases—including whether to enter into a plea agreement—\nwithout the benefit of advice from an attorney who is fully apprised of the relevant facts and the \nstrength of the State’s case; do not receive the benefit of pretrial motions, including motions to \nsuppress illegally obtained evidence; and go to trial without their attorney having thoroughly \nreviewed the available discovery, taken necessary depositions, or obtained all relevant evidence, \nincluding any exculpatory evidence. \n62. In February 2017, Defendant Michael Barrett testified before the state legislature that \nMSPD would need 333 more lawyers to provide even minimally adequate representation to \nindigent defendants. \n63. The State has ignored the recommendations put forward by study after study over the \npast decade.  Many public defenders have felt compelled to resign rather than continue to work \nin these untenable conditions.  This has only further exacerbated an already desperate situation.  \nAnd while MSPD would still be grossly understaffed if it were able to fill all of its recent \nattrition-related vacancies, lack of adequate funding has prevented it from doing even that. \n64. In 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court, in State ex rel. Missouri Public Defender \nCommission v. Waters, 370 S.W.3d 592 (Mo. 2012), upheld the validity of a rule promulgated by \nthe Missouri Public Defender Commission that “permit[ted] a district defender office to decline \n17 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nadditional appointments when it ha[d] been certified as being on limited availability after \nexceeding its caseload capacity for at least three consecutive calendar months.”  Id. at 597. \n65. Upon information and belief, in the immediate aftermath of Waters, public defenders \nwho attempted to turn away cases faced tremendous resistance from prosecutors, judges, and \nlegislators.  In some circuits, MSPD agreed not to assign attorneys to cases where prosecutors \npromised that defendants would face no jail time, only to find that these no-jail-time agreements \nwere routinely ignored.  In other circuits, cases that were turned away were assigned to non-\nMSPD attorneys with no criminal defense experience who were not compensated for their time.  \nFor example, in Boone County, approximately 100 cases were assigned to attorneys who worked \nfor state agencies or had ties to other state officials, putting additional political pressure on \nMSPD to stop turning away cases.  None of those attorneys specialized in criminal law.  These \nattorneys lacked the resources, experience, or wherewithal to represent clients zealously. \n66. On information and belief, MSPD attorneys in nearly all circuits faced disapproval for \neven attempting to turn away cases.  The then-head of MSPD was told that if local offices \ncontinued to turn away cases, the legislature would pass a bill to privatize the entire system.  And \nwithin months of the Waters decision, the legislature passed Missouri Revised Statutes \n§ 600.062, which prevents the director of MSPD or the Missouri State Public Defender \nCommission from “limit[ing] the availability of a district office or any division director, district \ndefender, deputy district defender, or assistant public defender to accept cases based on a \ndetermination that the office has exceeded a caseload standard.”  Under section 600.062, MSPD \n“may not refuse to provide representation” unless it receives “prior approval from a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction.”  \n18 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n67. Upon information and belief, since the legislature’s enactment of section 600.062, no \nMSPD office has refused cases in any consistent or systematic way.  MSPD attorneys are \nunderstandably worried about what will happen to their clients if they are turned away, as \nDefendants have put in place no plan for providing meaningful representation to indigent \ndefendants turned away by MSPD.  Moreover, some MSPD offices fear reprisals if they turn \naway cases, including further budget cuts. \nLack of Representation at Critical Stages \n68. In 2008, the United States Supreme Court, in Rothgery v. Gillespie County, Texas, \nreaffirmed that the right to counsel attaches when “formal judicial proceedings have begun.”  \n554 U.S. 191, 211.  For a person who is arrested, the beginning of formal judicial proceedings is \nat the “criminal defendant’s initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the \ncharge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction.”  Id. at 213.  “Once attachment occurs, \nthe accused at least is entitled to the presence of appointed counsel during any ‘critical stage’ of \nthe post-attachment proceedings.”  Id. at 212 (footnote omitted).  \n69. In Missouri, however, attorneys are routinely unavailable to represent each eligible \nindigent defendant at every critical stage of the criminal process—including at their arraignment, \nwhere bond is determined—resulting in the actual denial of counsel to indigent defendants across \nthe State.  \n70. Public defenders routinely do not meet their clients until several weeks after the client’s \narrest and arraignment.  As a result, bond determinations, which normally occur at the \ndefendant’s initial appearance before the court, are almost always made without the benefit of \nadvocacy from counsel.  Without that advocacy, bond may be set based on inappropriate factors, \nor the court may make its bond determination without the benefit of facts critical to such a \n19 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \ndetermination.  In many cases, overworked public defenders waive the preliminary hearing \naltogether, sometimes without discussing the decision with their client. \n71. Unrepresented indigent defendants are therefore often forced to remain in jail simply \nbecause they are unable to advocate effectively on their own for release on their own \nrecognizance or a reasonable reduction in their bond amount. \n72. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that an attorney must be present \nat any post-arraignment lineup because such a “confrontation compelled by the State between the \naccused and the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification evidence is peculiarly \nriddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, \nderogate from a fair trial.”  United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 228 (1967).  But defendants in \nMissouri are routinely placed in lineups after arraignment without the benefit of counsel, even \nthough the prejudice that results from an improper lineup cannot be cured later in the criminal \nprocess.  See id. at 236-37. \nUnnecessary Delays and Prolonged Pretrial Detention \n73. Excessively high workloads also result in unnecessary and needlessly prolonged \ndetention prior to trial. \n74. As discussed supra,because indigent defendants are often unrepresented at critical bond \ndeterminations, they may remain in jail for extended periods of time, unable to effectively \nadvocate for themselves at their bond determinations. \n75. In addition, because MSPD attorneys’ workloads require them to “triage” cases, they \nare often forced to seek multiple or extended continuances in cases they deem less urgent, or \nwhen they need additional time to prepare adequately for more serious cases.  Because of these \ndelays, irrespective of the merits of the case against them, defendants are often forced to choose \n20 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nbetween either consenting to the continuances, thereby waiving their right to a speedy trial and \nremaining in jail for an extended period of time, or taking their chances at trial with an attorney \nwho has had little or no time to prepare.  \nGuilty Pleas Are Not Fully Knowing or Voluntary \n76. The vast majority of defendants in Missouri plead guilty.  Many of these are MSPD \nclients, but MSPD attorneys are unable to ensure that those who plead guilty do so knowingly \nand voluntarily.  \n77. Excessive pretrial detention—often due to public defenders’ inability to represent \ndefendants at bond hearings or their need for repeat continuances—put virtually unbearable \npressure on many defendants to plead guilty merely to get out of jail and avoid losing a job or \ntheir housing, or to resume meaningful contact with their children and families.  \n78. Many other defendants, like Plaintiff Church, plead guilty in spite of a valid and \npotentially effective defense because a public defender is unable to adequately evaluate or \ninvestigate that defense, or simply because it will take months or even years for their public \ndefender to be ready for trial. \n79. Many MSPD clients who plead guilty do so without a full understanding of the \nstrengths and weaknesses of their case, and absent counseling regarding the serious \nconsequences that may attend even a misdemeanor plea.  In particular, public defenders are \nunable to advise their clients of the immigration consequences of their plea because MSPD does \nnot have the resources to provide any training in the intersection of criminal law and immigration \nlaw. \n21 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nLack of Investigation \n80. The ability to thoroughly prepare for a case is crucial to MSPD attorneys’ ability to \neffectively advocate on their clients’ behalf; yet MSPD attorneys do not have the time or \nresources to investigate adequately the charges against their clients.  \n81. Because of the lack of sufficient resources, most MSPD attorneys do not conduct \nappropriate discovery and are rarely able to analyze the discovery they do receive early enough \nin the proceedings to make important investigative decisions, including which key witnesses to \ndepose and whether or not an expert witness is necessary for the client’s defense.  \n82. Defendants’ inadequate funding of MSPD means that investigators are not staffed on \nevery case—or even every serious felony—to which an office is assigned.  Rather, individual \ndefenders, regardless of their level of experience, are asked to use their discretion in selecting \nwhich cases will be formally investigated and which will not.   \n83. Even when an attorney determines that investigation is necessary, investigators often do \nnot have time to review discovery or gather other background information on the cases that they \ndo investigate.  And given their overwhelming workloads, the attorneys themselves have little \ntime to conduct any in-depth investigation on their own.  \n84. MSPD attorneys also frequently do not have the time to identify experts or conduct \nexpert consultations.  Even when MSPD attorneys identify the need for an expert, they are often \nunable to secure the resources necessary to retain an appropriate expert.  MSPD’s grossly \ninadequate budget is supposed to cover not only attorney and support staff salaries but also the \ncost of experts, investigations, and any other costs associated with a case.  Ex. 1 at 9.  Instead, it \ncannot even cover salaries for a sufficient number of attorneys, let alone adequately cover the \nother costs associated with a case. \n22 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n85. Time constraints also mean attorneys are often unable to meet with witnesses or take \nother important investigatory steps to prepare adequately for trial or to negotiate a more \nfavorable plea bargain.  With no option but to triage and cut corners, MSPD attorneys are forced \nto make strategic decisions without a complete understanding of the nature and strength of the \ncase against their clients. \n86. For example, many defenders take depositions in just a small fraction of their cases, \nthus leaving on the table the valuable information that is likely to be gleaned from such \ndepositions—information that, at the very least, would help counsel and their clients better \nevaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the State’s case, as well as the reasonableness of any \nplea offer from the government. \n87. MSPD attorneys are rarely able to file suppression motions because they lack the \ninvestigative resources to identify unconstitutional police conduct, the time to review pertinent \ndiscovery, and the resources and experience to conduct appropriate legal research.  As a result, \nevidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments can be used against \ndefendants at trial or to extract guilty pleas. \n88. At sentencing, because MSPD attorneys are unable to gather or prepare mitigating \nevidence, their clients often receive harsher sentences than might be warranted. \nLack of Attorney-Client Communication\n89. A defendant’s right to consult with his attorney is an integral component of the right to \nassistance of counsel.  See Geders v. United States, 425 U.S. 80, 88-91 (1976).  But MSPD \nattorneys’ excessive workloads mean that they are unable to meet with clients on a regular basis.  \nIn some instances, MSPD attorneys are only able to have a substantive meeting with a client for \nthe first time a few weeks before trial. \n23 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n90. Confidential, two-way communication between the accused and his attorney is a critical \npredicate for counsel’s meaningful participation in the adversarial process, as well as the indigent \ndefendant’s meaningful participation in his own defense.  But because MSPD attorneys are often \ntoo busy to adequately consult with clients, they are simply unable to provide that meaningful \nassistance. \n91. Without their clients’ input, it is impossible for MSPD attorneys to investigate their \nclients’ cases adequately or properly prepare for trial, plea negotiations, or sentencing.  Nor is it \npossible, under such circumstances, for indigent defendants to participate meaningfully in their \nown defense.  \n92. Moreover, many defendants are ill-equipped to understand the inner workings of the \ncriminal justice system without a lawyer’s guidance.  The principles of due process and \nindividual dignity are violated when an individual is deprived of life or liberty by means of a \nprocess he does not adequately comprehend.  See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 834 \n(1975) (noting society’s interest in avoiding a criminal justice system that leads a defendant “to \nbelieve that the law contrives against him.”).  The lack of resources provided to MSPD leaves \nmany defendants without this critical guide. \nLack of Training and Supervision \n93. Given the overwhelming volume of work faced by MSPD attorneys, even the most \nexperienced public defender is unable to engage in the basic requirements of effective \nrepresentation.  But MSPD’s high rate of attrition—a turnover rate of almost 15 percent in 2016, \nEx. 1 at 8, due to low salaries and crushingly high workloads—means that few experienced \npublic defenders continue to work at MSPD for any extended period of time.  On those occasions \nwhere MSPD can even afford to hire new attorneys to replace those who have left, those \n24 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \npositions are often filled by recent law school graduates with little to no experience in criminal \nlaw, juvenile law, or trial practice.  Indeed, in some districts the large majority of defenders are \nrecent law school graduates or lawyers with little, if any, experience with criminal defense.   \n94. To make matters worse, time and resource constraints mean that inexperienced junior \nattorneys are unable to receive the critical training they need to do their jobs effectively.  For \nexample, even though the Supreme Court has made clear that counseling regarding the \nimmigration consequences of a plea or conviction is an integral part of the right to counsel, see \nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010),MSPD attorneys receive no training in immigration \nlaw and its potential implications for their clients. \n95. Due to the intolerable workloads faced by MSPD attorneys and the lack of sufficient \nstaff to meet those workloads, supervising attorneys in district offices are forced to take on an \nactive docket of cases in addition to their administrative and supervisory responsibilities, leaving \nthose supervisors unable to provide adequate mentoring and oversight to the inexperienced \nattorneys under their supervision. \n96. The combination of lack of experience and lack of training, coupled with the enormous \nvolume of cases that MSPD attorneys are forced to take on, leaves defenders ill-equipped to \nperform even the most basic tasks necessary to provide adequate representation.  \nJuvenile Defense \n97. Like indigent adult criminal defendants, minors in juvenile delinquency proceedings are \nentitled to meaningful representation.  See In re Gault,387 U.S. 1 (1967). \n98. Following the Supreme Court’s recognition of the right to counsel for juvenile \ndefendants in Gault, the Missouri legislature amended the Juvenile Code to provide children with \na statutory right to representation in juvenile court proceedings.  Ultimately, Missouri codified \n25 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nthis right to representation in Missouri Revised Statutes § 211.211, which provides indigent \nyouth with the right to court-appointed counsel “prior to the filing of a petition” and “for all \nstages of the proceedings” thereafter.   \n99. The Missouri Supreme Court also promulgated specialized Rules of Practice and \nProcedure in Juvenile Courts and Family Court Divisions.  These rules reflected the notion that, \nbecause children are particularly vulnerable, they need representation throughout all stages of the \njuvenile process. See, e.g.,Mo. R. Juv. Pro. 116.01 (effective through 2010). \n100. In 1997, Missouri created a Youth Advocacy Unit within MSPD to provide the \nconstitutionally required zealous representation for court-involved minors in St. Louis City and \nSt. Louis County.  Missouri: Justice Rationed, National Juvenile Defender Center, at 25 (Spring \n2013), attached as Ex. 9.  A similar unit, based in Kansas City, began serving several other \ncounties a few years later.  The Youth Advocacy Unit was staffed by public defenders well-\ntrained in adolescent development and other issues unique to juvenile prosecutions, including \nchild interrogations and the law governing certifying juveniles as adults.  Id., at 36. \n101. In 2007, however, due to funding cuts, the Youth Advocacy Unit was dismantled.  \nJuvenile cases in St. Louis City and St. Louis County, as well as cases previously handled by the \nKansas City Youth Advocacy Unit, were lumped in with MSPD’s general adult workload.  Still \nmore juveniles therefore joined the ranks of defendants to whom Missouri has not met its \nconstitutional obligations as a result of its overextended public defenders.   \n102. In 2013, the National Juvenile Defender Center (NJDC) deployed a dozen experts in to \nMissouri to study its juvenile court system and assess the extent and quality of representation \nbeing provided to children in the State. \n26 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n103. The NJDC report concluded that, after “endur[ing] at least two decades of crushing \ncaseloads and inadequate resources to provide its mandated services,” Missouri’s juvenile \nindigent defense system is “broken” and is improperly “forced to ration services.”  Ex. 9 at 7. \n104. The NJDC report found that juvenile respondents throughout the State have \nsystematically been denied counsel and have therefore been left on their own to negotiate the \njuvenile court process.  The report concluded that approximately 60 percent of court-involved \nchildren in Missouri do not receive appointed counsel.  Ex. 9 at 35. \n105. For example, in Fiscal Year 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court reported a total of 4,631 \nnew juvenile delinquency and status offense petitions statewide.  Ex. 9 at 34.  But MSPD \nattorneys were assigned only 1,923 of those cases, and only 24 cases were contracted out to \nprivate counsel.  As its funding has declined, the number of cases MSPD has taken on has \nhalved, from 3,380 juvenile cases in Fiscal Year 2007 to only 1,677 juvenile cases in Fiscal Year \n2016.  Ex. 1 at 6. \n106. The NJDC report further concluded that even when Missouri children are represented \nby public defenders, they receive only “rationed” assistance of counsel.  Ex. 9, at 55.  For \nexample, the Report noted that detention hearings are largely overlooked by court actors as a \ncritical stage in the proceedings.  Like their adult counterparts, youths accused of crimes often go \nwithout any representation during their first hearings before the court—hearings at which the \ndecision to detain a respondent is made and thus at which the respondent’s liberty is at stake.   \n107. In addition, the NJDC report found that juveniles’ public defenders frequently were \nunable to adequately investigate cases prior to adjudication, file motions to challenge charges or \nevidence, develop meaningful dispositional advocacy presentations, or continue to represent their \n27 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nclients after disposition during probation review hearings or in seeking an appeal.  See generally \nid.\n108. In 2015, following an in-depth investigation of the St. Louis County Family Court \nsystem, the DOJ determined that the constitutional rights of indigent children were routinely \nbeing violated in that county’s juvenile delinquency proceedings.   Investigation of the St. Louis \nCounty Family Court, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S. Dep’t of Justice Civil Rights Division (July 31, \n2015), attached as Ex. 11.  The report found that these violations were due at least in part to “the \nstaggering caseload of the sole public defender assigned to handle all indigent juvenile \ndelinquency cases” in St. Louis County.  Id. at 2. \n109. In 2014, that lone defender handled nearly 400 juvenile cases.  Id. at 9.  Given these \noverwhelming numbers, it is not surprising that DOJ further found that during the same period \nthe public defender’s office in St. Louis County appeared to engage in little investigation, \nresolved 277 of the cases but took only three to trial, filed just seven pretrial motions, never \nchallenged probable cause during detention hearings, never called a defense witness other than, \nin one instance, the child respondent, and did not hire a single expert witness.  Id. at 15-18. \n110. On December 14, 2016, the DOJ’s investigative work culminated in a Memorandum of \nAgreement between the DOJ and the St. Louis County Family Court.  The Agreement sought to \naddress in St. Louis some of the very deficiencies that are also plaguing juvenile respondents in \ncounties across the State.  Among other things, the Agreement requires prompt appointment of \ncounsel, particularly for children who are detained; specific and ongoing training for juvenile \ndefenders “addressing matters of best practices and procedures for juvenile delinquency \ndefense”; and an assurance that the St. Louis County Family Court will “secure the equivalent of \nat least two publicly-funded full-time juvenile defense counsel for the Court’s delinquency \n28 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \ncases.”  Memorandum of Agreement Between DOJ and St. Louis County Family Court, at 6-7 \n(Dec. 14, 2016), attached as Ex. 12. \n111. In addition, the Agreement requires the St. Louis County Family Court to monitor \njuvenile defender caseloads; make efforts to ensure that juveniles accused of crimes receive \nrepresentation at their initial detention hearing; and provide ample notice and opportunity for \nattorney-client meetings to be held in advance of initial detention hearings.  Id. at 9.  Even with \nthis Agreement in place, however, juveniles in St. Louis County are still not receiving the \nconstitutional minimum of adequate representation. \n112. St. Louis County is not an outlier.  The same issues that led the DOJ to conclude that \nthe constitutional rights of indigent juvenile respondents were being violated in St. Louis County \nare currently occurring in juvenile courts across the State.  \n113. In some instances, this results in MSPD attorneys without any training whatsoever in \njuvenile defense handling juvenile delinquency matters of all kinds, including those involving \ncomplex, juvenile-specific legal issues.   \n114. Children who are certified to adult court frequently fall into a no-representation zone for \nseveral weeks while the juvenile court public defender ends representation and the child must \nseek adult court representation anew.  This leaves these children—who are housed in adult \njails—vulnerable to interrogation, inadvertent or inappropriate waivers of their rights, and other \ndangers that adequate representation would mitigate. \n115. Accordingly, 50 years after Gault, indigent children who have been charged with crimes \nin Missouri are being deprived of meaningful legal representation in violation of the state and \nfederal constitutions, as well as state statutory law. \n29 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nHARM TO NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n116. All of the above-mentioned issues have combined to cause tremendous harm to \nPlaintiffs and to the Class as a whole. \nShondel Church \n117. On or about July 19, 2016, Plaintiff Shondel Church was arrested in Kansas City for \nallegedly stealing a generator and tool box from the property of his stepmother, Ms. Sharon \nChurch, who resides in Lafayette County.   \n118. Mr. Church was subsequently charged with Class C felony theft, under R.S. Mo. \n570.030, which carries a maximum sentence of up to seven years in prison. \n119. On or about July 22, 2016, Mr. Church was transferred to the Lafayette County Jail. Mr. \nChurch did not see a judge or speak to a lawyer before his transfer. \n120. Following his arrest and transfer to Lafayette County, Mr. Church appeared before the \ncourt on two occasions without an attorney—first, for his arraignment on July 27, 2016, during \nwhich his bond was set at $5,000 cash or surety, and second, for a subsequent hearing on August \n3, 2016. \n121. Because Mr. Church was without counsel at his July 27, 2016 hearing, had no legal \ntraining of his own, and received no explanation from the court or prosecutor as to how the bond \nprocess worked, he was unable to argue for a bond reduction at his arraignment.  Because Mr. \nChurch could not afford to pay his bond, he remained in custody following his arraignment.  \n122. At his July 27, 2016 hearing, Mr. Church was provided a form to seek representation \nfrom the public defender. He filled it out and returned it to a guard at the Lafayette County Jail \nlater that same day. \n30 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n123. At his hearing on August 3, 2016, while he was still without counsel, Mr. Church was \ninformed that he was eligible for a public defender.  His case was then continued again to \nSeptember 7, 2016. \n124. On August 8, 2016, nearly a month after Mr. Church was arrested, Assistant Public \nDefender Matthew Gass first entered his appearance on behalf of Mr. Church.       \n125. Mr. Church did not meet his attorney, Mr. Gass, until his September 7, 2016 hearing.  \nMr. Church did not have a conversation with Mr. Gass about his case until after the hearing, \nwhen Mr. Gass visited Mr. Church at the Lafayette County Jail on September 8, 2016.  By that \ntime, Mr. Church had already spent more than 40 days in custody without ever communicating \nwith an attorney. \n126. During their meeting, Mr. Gass indicated to Mr. Church that he was frustrated with the \nfact that, as a public defender, he was unable to do his job effectively because of his \noverwhelming workload.  Mr. Gass indicated that Lafayette County had a workload that required \nat least three or four public defenders, and Mr. Gass was currently the only attorney serving that \ncounty.  Mr. Gass informed Mr. Church that he might not continue working as a public defender \nfor much longer because of these impossible working conditions.   \n127. At their meeting on September 8, 2016, Mr. Gass told Mr. Church that, after reviewing \nMr. Church’s file, Mr. Gass believed he could win his case, but that fighting the charges could \nmean Mr. Church would spend another six months in jail awaiting trial, since Mr. Gass would \nneed additional time to investigate the case and prepare for trial.  Mr. Gass also told Mr. Church \nthat, instead of going to trial, he could likely get a misdemeanor plea deal and Mr. Church could \nbe released and return to his family in a much shorter amount of time.  At the end of the meeting, \n31 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nand particularly because he had already spent nearly six weeks in custody, Mr. Church concluded \nthat entering a plea was the best option for him and his family at the time.   \n128. Mr. Church lives with his wife and four children.  At the time of his arrest and \nincarceration in July 2016, his wife was not working and he was the primary breadwinner for his \nfamily. \n129. Mr. Church also asked his attorney to file a motion to reduce his bond amount.  Mr. \nGass indicated that he would look into a bond reduction, but no such motion was ever filed. As a \nresult, Mr. Church remained incarcerated. \n130. Soon after the first meeting between Mr. Gass and Mr. Church, Mr. Gass resigned from \nthe public defender’s office and did not speak with Mr. Church before resigning.  Though Mr. \nGass told Mr. Church he would resolve the case before leaving, Mr. Church never spoke to Mr. \nGass again after their first and only meeting.  \n131. On October 5, 2016, Mr. Church was transported to his next pretrial hearing, at which \nhe expected to see Mr. Gass.  Instead, because Mr. Gass had resigned, Mr. Church was \nrepresented by a new public defender, Max Mitchell.  Mr. Mitchell never entered a formal \nappearance on behalf of Mr. Church and appeared in court on his behalf only at the October 5, \n2016 hearing.  Mr. Church was not given the opportunity to discuss the case—or communicate in \nany meaningful way at all—with Mr. Mitchell. \n132. Although Mr. Mitchell did not speak to Mr. Church at the October 5, 2016 hearing, Mr. \nChurch did hand Mr. Mitchell a list of the various reasons he believed that the State’s case was \nwithout merit.  Mr. Mitchell accepted the list from Mr. Church, but did not discuss it with him.  \nThe prosecutor immediately requested that a preliminary hearing be set, and Mr. Mitchell turned \nhis attention to the next client.  A preliminary hearing was set for November 16, 2016. \n32 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n133. Before the October 5, 2016 hearing, Mr. Church believed he was going to enter a plea \nand be released that day.  Instead, Mr. Mitchell did not speak to Mr. Church at all, a preliminary \nhearing was set, and Mr. Church was returned to jail without further explanation from his \nattorney or the court.  \n134. On October 11, 2016, Mr. Gass filed a motion to withdraw, and Bradley Taylor entered \nhis appearance as Mr. Church’s newly assigned public defender. \n135. Mr. Taylor did not meet with Mr. Church before his next hearing.  In fact, Mr. Church \nnever had a conversation longer than 30 seconds with Mr. Taylor during the course of Mr. \nTaylor’s representation of Mr. Church.  Mr. Taylor never visited Mr. Church in jail and spoke to \nhim only briefly in court directly before his hearings. \n136. On November 16, 2016, Mr. Church appeared for his preliminary hearing.  Mr. Taylor \nappeared on his behalf at the hearing but spoke to Mr. Church only briefly before the hearing to \ninform him that he would try to talk to Mr. Church’s former attorney (Mr. Gass) about his case. \n137. Also at the November 16, 2016 hearing, Mr. Church was able to speak directly to the \njudge while his lawyer was speaking with the prosecutor.  Mr. Church informed the judge that he \nhad now spent over 100 days in jail on a charge that he believed should never have been filed.  \nAfter Mr. Church’s uncounseled conversation with the judge, the case was transferred to a \ndifferent court and a hearing was set for the following week, on November 21, 2016. \n138. November 21, 2016, was just a few days before Thanksgiving, and Mr. Church was \nworried that he would remain in jail through Thanksgiving and perhaps Christmas if he did not \naccept a plea deal.   \n139.  Therefore, on November 21, 2016, after spending five months in pretrial detention, and \nafter losing hope that his case would be appropriately investigated or litigated in a timely \n33 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nfashion, Mr. Church pled guilty to misdemeanor theft and was sentenced to two years of \nprobation, with a suspended jail term of six months.  While this plea was entered approximately \nten weeks after Mr. Church’s meeting with Mr. Gass on September 8, 2016, it is the same deal \nthat Mr. Gass indicated would be available to Mr. Church in September and that Mr. Church \nthought he was going to enter at his October 5, 2016 hearing. \n140. Although Mr. Church has been released, he remains on probation, with a six-month \nsuspended jail sentence that will be executed should he violate the terms of his probation.  Mr. \nChurch understands his probation terms to include repaying a bill of $2,605.94 to cover the cost \nof his pretrial detention. \nRandall Lee Dalton \n141.  Until January 2017, Randall Lee Dalton, a physically disabled, mentally impaired man, \nwas living at a nursing home in Laurie, Missouri.  He had been there for several months under \nthe supervision of staff and medical professionals, who provided care and counseling and \nprescribed medication to ensure Mr. Dalton’s stability and daily functioning. \n142.  On January 30, 2017, law enforcement officials entered Mr. Dalton’s nursing home \nfacility to investigate the alleged overdose of another resident.  While there, they allegedly found \nMr. Dalton in possession of a single pill of Lorazepam (Ativan), arrested him, forcibly removed \nhim from the facility, transported him to the Morgan County Detention Center, and charged him \nwith felony possession of a controlled substance, a D felony. \n143. In processing Mr. Dalton, law enforcement learned that Mr. Dalton had an outstanding \nwarrant for failing to appear in court after allegedly passing a bad check for $73.48 at the Jiffy \nStop Food Mart in May 2016.   \n34 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n144.  In addition, after his arrest, Mr. Dalton—who had been convicted of misdemeanor \nsexual contact in 1994 and initially granted a suspended imposition of sentence—was further \ncharged on February 1, 2017, with the Class D felony of failing to register as a sex offender \nwithin his county of residence.  \n145.  On January 31, 2017, although Mr. Dalton had not yet seen a judge or a public \ndefender, an order was entered holding him on $30,000 bond in each of his felony matters.  \nWhile incarcerated, he was unable to access his medication, and he was both confused and \nscared.  \n146. On February 7, 2017, an attorney from the Public Defender’s Office ultimately entered \nher appearance on behalf of Mr. Dalton.  She appeared in court on his behalf on February 15, \n2017, waived his appearance, and reset his case until March.  Mr. Dalton was entirely unaware of \nthis court date. \n147.  Following Mr. Dalton’s arrest, his sister, a retired Juvenile Court probation officer, also \ntried repeatedly to contact Mr. Dalton’s public defender.  She was desperate to learn about his \ncase and to share information with the public defender regarding Mr. Dalton’s limited \nfunctioning, ongoing mental health issues, and immediate need for medication. \n148.  After leaving many messages that went unreturned by Mr. Dalton’s public defender, \nhis sister found a new residential treatment program on her own that would accept her brother as \nan alternative to confinement.  Mr. Dalton’s sister also contacted the prosecutor’s office directly \nto advocate on Mr. Dalton’s behalf. \n149. In March 2017, Mr. Dalton was finally brought to court for the first time.  It was also \nthe first time he saw his public defender, who did not speak to him until he was brought into the \n35 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \ncourt room.  Prior to his delivery to court for his March court date, Mr. Dalton had not been \ncontacted by counsel to inform him of the court date. \n150. In court, Mr. Dalton’s assigned public defender did not seem familiar with his case.  \nInstead, Mr. Dalton’s sister asked to approach the bench to make a bond application for him, \nwhich was ultimately joined by the public defender and prosecutor. \n151. Without any meaningful assistance from the public defender system, Mr. Dalton’s \nfamily was able to obtain a furlough on his behalf enabling him to enter a residential treatment \nfacility while his case was pending.  Unfortunately, Mr. Dalton’s placement at the residential \ntreatment facility subsequently fell through and he was returned to jail, where he currently awaits \nresolution of his case.  \nDorian Samuels\n152.  Plaintiff Dorian Samuels was arrested in Joplin, Missouri, on or about May 30, 2016, \nand charged with first-degree assault, exposing him to as much as 30 years in prison if convicted.  \nUpon arrest, Mr. Samuels was transported to the Joplin City Jail, where he was held in custody \nfor the next two days. \n153.  Shortly after arriving at the Joplin City Jail, Mr. Samuels was interviewed, without \ncounsel present, by Detective Justin Ellison of the Joplin Police Department.  According to a \npolice report, Detective Ellison read Mr. Samuels his Miranda rights and presented him with a \ncorresponding written waiver form, which Mr. Samuels allegedly signed prior to the interview.  \nMr. Samuels was intoxicated at the time the alleged waiver was signed and has no recollection of \nthis initial interview by Detective Ellison.  As such, Mr. Samuels was unable to provide a \nvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his right to an attorney or his right to remain silent.  \n36 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nNevertheless, upon information and belief, Mr. Samuels subsequently spoke with Detective \nEllison in detail regarding the incident that ultimately lead to his arrest.  \n154.  Mr. Samuels was transferred from the Joplin City Jail to the Jasper County Jail on or \nabout June 1, 2016. \n155. On June 2, 2016, Mr. Samuels appeared before the court by video from the Jasper \nCounty Jail, without counsel, and was informed that his bond had been set at $20,000 cash.  \nWithout the guiding hand of counsel, Mr. Samuels was unable to advocate effectively for a \nreduction in his bond or address the Miranda violation that occurred when he was improperly \ninterrogated.  Since he was unable to afford bond, Mr. Samuels has remained in pretrial detention \nsince his arrest more than nine months ago.  \n156.  Mr. Samuels’ case was initially assigned to Assistant Public Defender Craig Lowe, \nwho entered his appearance in the case on June 8, 2016, and was scheduled to represent Mr. \nSamuels at his subsequent preliminary hearing on June 15, 2016. Prior to the June 15 court \nproceeding, Mr. Lowe visited Mr. Samuels at the Jasper County Jail and met with him for \napproximately 10 minutes to discuss the hearing set for later that day.  Ultimately, the \npreliminary hearing was rescheduled for the following week.     \n157. Upon information and belief, between June 8, 2016, when Mr. Lowe filed his notice of \nappearance, and June 22, 2016, Mr. Samuels’ attorney did not engage in any investigation and \nfailed to file any pretrial motions—including any motion for bond reduction or motion for \ndiscovery—and spoke with Mr. Samuels privately on just one occasion, during his visit to the \njail on June 15, 2016. \n158. On June 22, 2016, Mr. Lowe withdrew from the case at the request of Mr. Samuels, \nwho expressed frustration about his inability to communicate in any meaningful way with Mr. \n37 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nLowe, as well as his lawyer’s failure to begin investigating the case.  The court granted Mr. \nLowe’s request to withdraw and continued the proceedings to the following week, thereby \nfurther delaying Mr. Samuels’ preliminary hearing.  \n159.  Mr. Samuels was subsequently assigned a new public defender, J.D. Hatcher, who he \nmet for the first time in court on June 29, 2016, shortly before his preliminary hearing was \nscheduled to begin.  Because Mr. Hatcher had not had time to meet with Mr. Samuels, or \notherwise prepare, in advance of the hearing, he sought a continuance from the court.  That \nrequest was denied, however, and the hearing went forward.  \n160. During Mr. Samuels’ preliminary hearing, the State called just two witnesses to testify \nagainst him: the alleged victim and Detective Ellison, who had interviewed Mr. Samuels—in the \nabsence of counsel and while Mr. Samuels was intoxicated—at the Joplin City Jail soon after his \narrest.  Mr. Hatcher failed to question Detective Ellison regarding the nature, scope, and \npropriety of the interview at the jail, because, upon information and belief, he had been unable to \nprepare for the hearing in any meaningful way.  Following the testimony, the court found \nprobable cause to proceed with felony charges against Mr. Samuels and bound his case over to \ncircuit court. \n161. On August 1, 2016, Mr. Samuels appeared by video and was re-arraigned—this time \nwith his public defender, Mr. Hatcher, present in the courtroom.  Due at least in part to the fact \nthat he was unable to meet with Mr. Samuels at any point between his preliminary hearing and \nre-arraignment, Mr. Hatcher was unprepared to advocate for any bond reduction on his client’s \nbehalf. \n162.  Since he first met Mr. Hatcher on June 29, 2016, Mr. Samuels saw Mr. Hatcher on only \nfour occasions, all of which were immediately following pretrial court proceedings on October \n38 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n17, 2016; November 21, 2016; December 5, 2016; and January 9, 2017.  None of those meetings \nlasted more than a few minutes.  On at least three of those occasions, Mr. Hatcher appeared \nbefore the court alone and requested a continuance, while Mr. Samuels remained in a holding \ncell near the courtroom.  Mr. Hatcher did not meet with Mr. Samuels prior to any of these \nhearings to discuss his plan for the hearing or request Mr. Samuels’s permission to seek a \ncontinuance.  In fact, Mr. Hatcher did not even notify Mr. Samuels that he planned to seek a \ncontinuance at these hearings.  Instead, following each of those proceedings, Mr. Hatcher \ninformed Mr. Samuels that the case had been continued, but engaged in no substantive \ndiscussion about the status of the case or his investigation of the facts surrounding Mr. Samuels’ \narrest. \n163. Mr. Hatcher never visited Mr. Samuels in jail, nor did he ever speak with him by phone.  \nUpon information and belief, this was due to Mr. Hatcher’s overwhelming workload and \ncompeting responsibilities to other clients. \n164.  In his most recent motion for continuance, dated January 6, 2017, less than a week \nbefore Mr. Samuels’ scheduled trial date, Mr. Hatcher stated that, since he began representing \nMr. Samuels on June 29, 2016, “the number and effectiveness of attorney-client communications \nhas been limited for multiple reasons that are outside of Mr. Samuels’ control.”  Motion for \nContinuance (Jan. 6, 2017), attached as Ex. 13.  As such, he asked that Mr. Samuels’ trial date be \nrescheduled for a fourth time.   \n165. Mr. Hatcher also stated in his motion that he received certain electronic discovery from \nthe State in late December 2016, including “audio and visual recordings of client interviews, \ncommunications with emergency dispatch, and other photographic images—that require the \nmaking of special accommodations in order to be viewed by Mr. Samuels at the Jasper County \n39 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \njail.”  Id.  As of the filing of this petition, however, Mr. Samuels has yet to be given the \nopportunity to review these electronic discovery materials, and his public defender has not had \nthe time to take the steps necessary to ensure that his client is able to do so. \n166. Finally, Mr. Hatcher stated that he is seeking a continuance in part because he was \nrepresenting another defendant who had invoked their right to a speedy trial.  Because that trial \nwas set for January 12, 2017, the motion noted that “it is improbable that Mr. Hatcher will be \nable to adequately prepare for both trials simultaneously.”  The motion thus highlights the \ninherent conflict of interest that arises when public defenders face overwhelming workloads and \nare forced to prioritize some of their clients at the expense of others.  \n167. Upon information and belief, Mr. Hatcher recently resigned from the public defender’s \noffice and now works as a prosecutor in Jasper County. \n168. On March 1, 2017, Mr. Samuels was appointed yet another public defender, Richard \nKing, the third attorney assigned to his case since his arrest in May 2016.  On or about March 6, \n2017, Mr. King visited Mr. Samuels in jail and presented Mr. Samuels with a letter stating that \nhe would be unable to represent Mr. Samuels due to his overwhelming workload, which includes \nmore than 200 cases.  Mr. King indicated that his workload would make it impossible for him to \ninvestigate adequately or otherwise prepare the case.  As of the filing of this petition, however, \nMr. King remains the attorney of record on Mr. Samuels’ case. \n169. Mr. Samuels is currently scheduled for trial on June 1, 2017, a full year after his arrest.    \nViola Bowman \n170. Plaintiff Viola Bowman was arrested on or about January 6, 2015, in Clay County, and \ncharged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action for killing her husband.  Ms. \nBowman has maintained her innocence since her arrest.  \n40 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n171. On January 15, 2015, Ms. Bowman appeared before the court for her arraignment, \nwithout counsel.  Her bond had been set at $1,000,000 and, because she was not accompanied by \ncounsel, Ms. Bowman was unable to advocate for a reduction in her bond amount.  Records \nreflect that bond had been set before her first appearance.  Because Ms. Bowman is indigent and \ncould not possibly post the required bond, she has been sitting in jail since her arrest over two \nyears ago.  \n172. A week after her arraignment, on January 22, 2015, Ms. Bowman appeared before the \ncourt again, this time with a public defender, and was re-arraigned.  The public defender who \nrepresented Ms. Bowman at this proceeding, however, did not continue her representation of Ms. \nBowman beyond this hearing and did not do any substantive work on the case at that stage, \nincluding any investigation or motion practice. \n173. On January 28, 2015, Ms. Bowman’s current attorney, Anthony Cardarella, entered his \nappearance in the case.  Mr. Cardarella is the District Defender for MSPD’s District 7 office, \nwhich includes Clay County.  Despite his many management responsibilities as District \nDefender, Mr. Cardarella took Ms. Bowman’s case because none of the public defenders in his \noffice with sufficient experience to handle a first-degree murder case had any more time to \ndevote to the case than did Mr. Cardarella. \n174. Mr. Cardarella met with Ms. Bowman for the first time the same week as her next \nhearing, which was on February 19, 2015, more than one month after her arrest.  The meeting \nlasted approximately ten minutes.  Ms. Bowman was shocked at how short the meeting was.  \nBecause the meeting was so short, Mr. Cardarella did not have time to explain very much about \nthe case to Ms. Bowman.  Mr. Cardarella did inform Ms. Bowman that his office was very busy \nand that he was the lead attorney for the district. \n41 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n175. Since taking over the case, other responsibilities, including other cases, have prevented \nMr. Cardarella from remaining in consistent contact with Ms. Bowman.  Over the course of the \nmore than two years Ms. Bowman has been in pretrial detention, she has met with her attorney \nan average of once every two months for approximately 10-15 minutes per meeting.    \n176.  Since January 2015, the public defender’s office has asked the court to continue Ms. \nBowman’s case on at least 10 occasions, and to continue the scheduled trial date twice, due at \nleast in part to Mr. Cardarella’s inability to prepare adequately for trial and other proceedings.  \nThis has led to Ms. Bowman remaining in pretrial detention for over two years. \n177. Additionally, while Mr. Cardarella has been Ms. Bowman’s attorney since January \n2015, he has had other attorneys from his office appear on his behalf for at least nine of the 27 \nhearings that have occurred to this point.  Upon information and belief, none of those other \nattorneys have had sufficient time to familiarize themselves adequately with Ms. Bowman’s \ncase, in which she faces a potential sentence of life imprisonment. \n178. Ms. Bowman’s trial was first set for June 20, 2016.  On May 11, 2016, pursuant to Mr. \nCardarella’s request, the trial was continued to January 23, 2017.  The continuance was \nrequested in large part due to Mr. Cardarella’s other administrative and managerial job \nresponsibilities.  On September 29, 2016, the trial was again continued at Mr. Cardarella’s \nrequest to June 5, 2017.  In his motion for a continuance, Mr. Cardarella again noted his many \nresponsibilities related to administrative tasks and managing the district office.   \n179. Ms. Bowman’s case involves a voluminous amount of discovery and the need for \nextensive investigation and case preparation.  Upon information and belief, very little of that \nwork occurred during the first year after her arrest. \n42 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n180. Ms. Bowman believes that her case is often not considered a priority for Mr. Cardarella \nbecause of his overwhelming caseload and the seriousness and complexity of her charges.  Ms. \nBowman is frustrated because her meetings with her attorney are often very short and she does \nnot feel that her questions are answered in a meaningful way, leaving more questions for the next \nvisit. \n181. Additionally, because of the many continuances in her case, she has now been \nincarcerated in the Clay County jail for over 800 days pretrial.   \nBrian Richman \n182. Plaintiff Brian Richman has been incarcerated at the Christian County Detention Center \nsince his arrest on or about June 26, 2016, on a series of felony drug charges exposing him to \nmany years in prison.  \n183. Mr. Richman’s bond was set at over $100,000.  Because he was unable to afford bond, \nMr. Richman has remained in pretrial detention since his arrest more than eight months ago.    \n184. Mr. Richman’s public defender has never visited him at the Christian County Detention \nCenter.   \n185. In fact, there is not even a room for MSPD public defenders to conduct attorney-client \nvisits at the Christian County Detention Center.  Rather, the jail’s general practice is to shackle \ndefendants to a rail in a public area and allow attorneys to briefly stand and talk with clients \nthere, surrounded by jail officials and other detainees.  Upon information and belief, Christian \nCounty’s public defenders have not attempted to challenge the jail’s policy or arrange for an \nalternative venue because they do not have the resources to do so, given their overwhelming \ncaseload and lack of funding. \n43 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n186. The first time Mr. Richman saw his assigned public defender was in court, on or about \nJune 28, 2016, when his attorney waived Mr. Richman’s preliminary hearing without \nmeaningfully consulting with Mr. Richman.   \n187. To date, no preliminary hearing has been held in Mr. Richman’s Christian County \ncases, and no indictment has been delivered by a grand jury to support the charges against Mr. \nRichman.  He remains incarcerated on a bond of over $100,000. \n188. Since July 14, 2016, Mr. Richman has only seen his attorney on a handful of occasions.  \nThese visits have always occurred at the courthouse, involved rushed conversations, and \ntranspired in a public courtroom where other persons were present and confidentiality was not \nassured. \n189. On some occasions, hearings in Mr. Richman’s case have occurred in front of the judge \nwithout Mr. Richman present.  Mr. Richman’s public defender unilaterally waived Mr. \nRichman's constitutional right to appear on his own behalf at those hearings and participated in \nthem without obtaining Mr. Richman’s consent to do so. \n190. Mr. Richman has found it to be nearly impossible to get in contact with his public \ndefender; upon information and belief, this lack of communication is due to his public defender’s \noverwhelming workload.  \n191. Given his inability to communicate consistently and confidentially with his attorney, as \nwell as the fact that his public defender has neither conducted any meaningful investigation on \nhis case nor filed critical motions on his behalf, Mr. Richman has felt the need over the last \nseveral months to write letters to the judge presiding over his case.  He has done so both to \nadvocate for himself in the context of his cases and to make the court aware of the deplorable \nconditions at the Christian County Detention Center.   \n44 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nDEFENDANT LIABILITY\n192. Defendants have not provided Plaintiffs, or those similarly situated, with the \nrepresentation to which they are constitutionally and statutorily entitled.  Plaintiffs have been \ndenied representation altogether at some critical stages of their proceedings, have been \nconstructively denied counsel at others because MSPD’s excessive workloads would hamstring \neven the best of lawyers, and have not received the basic investigation and counseling that the \nSixth Amendment demands. \n193. Upon information and belief, absent this Court’s intervention, Defendants will continue \nto fail to provide Plaintiffs with the representation to which they are entitled. \n194. The representation provided to the named Plaintiffs is illustrative and typical of the \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants throughout the State of Missouri and results from \nthe lack of sufficient funding, inflated workloads, and structural deficiencies that have been \nidentified repeatedly by every entity that has assessed Missouri’s public defender system over \nthe last 25 years. \n195. As a result of the State’s failure to remedy this workload problem, public defenders are \nunable to prepare for and attend every critical stage of their clients’ proceedings.  As such, many \ndefendants unnecessarily spend prolonged periods of time in pretrial detention or feel coerced \ninto pleading guilty to charges against which they have a valid and potentially effective defense, \nmerely to get out of jail and avoid losing a job or meaningful contact with their children and \nfamilies.   \n196. As a result of their crushing workloads and lack of support, MSPD attorneys do not \nhave the time or resources to communicate with their clients consistently and effectively, making \n45 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nit difficult, if not impossible, for indigent defendants to participate actively in their defense or \nmake sound strategic decisions with respect to their case. \n197. The excessive workloads also have made it impossible for MSPD attorneys to \ninvestigate and otherwise prepare all of their cases thoroughly and effectively.  This, in turn, \nharms indigent defendants by stripping them of any chance they may have had to secure helpful \nwitnesses, collect valuable evidence, establish an alibi, or otherwise contest the charges against \nthem or obtain lighter or alternative sentences.  \n198. Defendants have been on notice for decades that the State’s public defender system is \nfailing to provide constitutionally sufficient representation.  Numerous studies, reports, and \nrecommendations have been presented to state officials over the years; the Missouri Supreme \nCourt’s decisions in State ex rel. Missouri Pub. Def. Comm’n v. Waters, 370 S.W.3d 592 (Mo. \n2012), and State ex rel. Missouri Pub. Def. Comm’n v. Pratte, 298 S.W.3d 870 (Mo. 2009), \nraised serious concerns about Missouri’s public defender system; and Defendant Michael Barrett \nand former Governor Nixon have corresponded directly in recent months about MSPD’s dire \nneeds. \n199. Despite being on notice of the many deficiencies plaguing Missouri’s indigent defense \nsystem, Defendants have failed to take sufficient action to remedy the deficiencies. \n200. Defendants’ failure to take sufficient steps to remedy the deficiencies of Missouri’s \nindigent defense system is the proximate cause of the harm suffered by indigent criminal \ndefendants throughout Missouri—including the named Plaintiffs and the Class they seek to \nrepresent. \n46 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n201. Plaintiffs file this class action lawsuit pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 52.08 \non behalf of all indigent persons who are now, or who will be during the pendency of this \nlitigation, under formal charge before a state court in Missouri of having committed any offense, \nthe penalty for which includes the possibility of confinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or \ndetention (regardless of whether actually imposed), and who are eligible to be represented by \nMSPD. \n202. Plaintiffs in this case represent a Class, and this action should be certified as a class \naction under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 52.08.  \n203. Every day, hundreds of individuals who are unable to afford an attorney and who \ndepend on MSPD to provide them with effective legal representation are criminally prosecuted \nin this State.  As such, the Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical. \n204. There are important questions of law and fact raised in this case that are common to the \nClass, including: \na. Whether Defendants are required under the United States and Missouri Constitutions \nand under Missouri law to provide indigent defendants with effective legal \nrepresentation; \nb. Whether Defendants have systemically denied Plaintiffs actual representation at \ncritical stages of their trial; \nc. Whether Defendants have created circumstances such that even where counsel is \nnominally available, “the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, \ncould provide effective assistance is small,” constructively depriving Plaintiffs of \ncounsel in violation of United States v. Cronic; \n47 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \nd. Whether MSPD is able to adequately communicate with clients, investigate cases, \nand counsel clients regarding guilty pleas; \ne. Whether Defendants have violated the United States and Missouri Constitutions, as \nwell as Missouri law, by failing to implement, administer, and oversee an adequate \npublic defense system; and \nf. Whether Defendants’ failure to adequately fund the delivery of public defense \nservices impedes the provision of effective legal representation to indigent \ndefendants. \n205. The claims of the Class representatives are typical of the claims of the Class as a whole.  \nLike all of the Class members, the Class representatives are being denied their right to counsel, \nin violation of the federal and state constitutions, as well as Missouri statutes, as a direct result of \nDefendants’ ongoing failure to adequately fund, supervise, and administer public defense \nservices in Missouri. \n206. The Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  \nThe interests of the Class representatives are not in conflict with the interests of any other \nindigent defendant, and the Class representatives have every incentive to pursue this litigation \nvigorously on behalf of themselves and the Class as a whole.   \n207. The Class representatives are being represented by experienced, well-resourced counsel \nin this matter, including the national American Civil Liberties Union’s Criminal Law Reform \nProject, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, the MacArthur Justice Center at St. \nLouis, and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, each of whose attorneys possess extensive \nlitigation experience.  The attorneys for the Class representatives have substantial expertise in \nlitigating class action lawsuits generally and in public defense reform litigation in particular. \n48 \n\nCLASS ACTION PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n208. The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would create a \nrisk of adjudications with respect to individual Class members that, as a practical matter, would \nbe dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications.  \n209. Defendants have failed to adequately administer indigent defense services in Missouri, \nthereby violating the rights of indigent defendants across the State.  As such, these Defendants \nhave acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class, thereby making \nit appropriate for this Court to issue final declaratory and injunctive relief for all Class members. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim for Relief \nViolation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n (Right to Counsel) \n210.

Case No. 2:17-cv-04057-NKL \n   \nMICHAEL BARRETT, et al.,  \n \n      Defendants. \n \n \nORDER \n  Before the Court is the joint motion by Plaintiffs Randall Lee Dalton, Viola Bowman, \nBrian Richman, and Dorian Samuels, and Defendants Michael Barrett, H. Riley Block, Craig \nChval, A. Crista Hogan, and Charles R. Jackson, members of the Missouri State Public Defender \nCommission, for entry of their proposed consent judgment.  Doc. 221.  For the reasons discussed \nbelow, the joint motion is denied.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \na.  Missouri Indigent Defense1 \nThe State of Missouri relies extensively on local Missouri State Public Defender (MSPD) \noffices to provide indigent defense services in all its 114 counties and St. Louis City.  MSPD \nemploys approximately 376 attorneys and 200 administrative staff, support staff, paralegals, and \nInvestigators, and represents indigent defendants in over 100,000 cases each year.  \nSince the establishment of MSPD in its current form in 1989, there have been at least ten \nindependent evaluations of Missouri’s public defense system. A 1993 study by The Spangenberg \n                                                 \n1 These are the facts as described in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, Doc. 1-2, and the exhibits attached \nthereto, Doc. 1-3, 1-4.  \n1 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 1 of 12\n\nGroup (TSG) concluded that MSPD “lack[ed] the necessary resources to provide competent \nrepresentation” and that the “legal staff needs to be increased as soon as possible.”  Doc. 1-3, pp. \n86–105.  A second TSG study in 2005, commissioned by the Missouri Bar Association Public \nDefender Task Force, determined Missouri’s public defense system was “on the verge of \ncollapse.”  Doc. 1-3, pp. 111-138.  In 2007, an interim committee of the Missouri Senate released \na report finding that public defenders’ caseloads were too large and needed to be reduced.  Doc. \n1-3, pp. 140-50; 1-4, pp. 1–4.  A third TSG study in 2009, again commissioned by the Missouri \nBar Association, concluded that the workloads had increased since 2005 and that public \ndefenders were unable to adequately meet with clients following arrest, advocate for pretrial \nrelease, thoroughly investigate cases, pursue discovery, file appropriate pleadings and motions, \nconduct necessary research, or prepare for hearings, trial, and sentencing.  Doc. 1-4, pp. 6–73.  In \n2014, the American Bar Association released results of a commissioned report indicating that \npublic defenders across the state were operating well over capacity, including working at 265% \ncapacity in the St. Louis County Office, 254% capacity in the Jefferson City office, and 239% \ncapacity in the Springfield office.  Doc. 1-4, pp. 124–26.  A 2016 study by the Sixth Amendment \nCenter determined that Missouri’s per capita spending on indigent defense is approximately one-\nthird of the average of 25 states surveyed, at $6.20 per resident as compared to the $18.41 \naverage.  Doc. 1-4.  In 2015, Defendant MSPD Director Michael Barrett requested additional \nfunding from then-Governor Nixon to no avail, and when the legislature subsequently approved \nadditional funding, the funding was vetoed and withheld.   \nPlaintiffs’ factual allegations illustrate the potential consequences of an inundated public \ndefense system.  Ms. Bowman was arrested in January 2015, and her public defender, who was \nalso a District Defender of a MSPD District office and therefore had other administrative and \n2 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 2 of 12\n\nmanagerial job responsibilities in addition to a 228-case caseload, requested over thirty \ncontinuances, including multiple continuances of Ms. Bowman’s trial, resulting in her spending \nover 1,500 days in pre-trial detention.  After being arrested in May 2016, Mr. Samuels cycled \nthrough three public defenders over the next year who repeatedly requested continuances without \nconsulting Mr. Samuels while Mr. Samuels remained in jail.  The last of these public defenders \nindicated his workload of over 200 cases was making it impossible for him to adequately prepare \nfor the case.  Also in 2016, Mr. Richman was arrested, yet over the next year he only met with \nhis attorney on a handful of occasions and always at the courthouse, all while Mr. Richman \nremained in pre-trial detention without any preliminary hearing.  In 2017, Mr. Dalton, a \nphysically disabled and mentally impaired man, was held in jail for over a month without \nconsulting with counsel.  When he finally did meet his public defender, it was in the courtroom \nat his hearing.  At this proceeding, because the public defender did not seem familiar with the \ncase, Mr. Dalton’s sister requested to approach the bench and she, rather than the public \ndefender, had to make a bond application for her brother.  \nb.  The Current Litigation  \nOn March 9, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit in Missouri state court seeking \ninjunctive and declaratory relief from Defendants in their official capacities as members of the \nMSPD Commission, as well as against the State of Missouri and then-Governor Eric R. Greitens.  \nPlaintiffs alleged Defendants had failed to meet their constitutional obligation to provide indigent \ndefendants with meaningful representation.  Plaintiffs and the putative class claimed to “have \nbeen denied representation altogether at some critical stages of their proceedings, have been \nconstructively denied counsel at others because MSPD’s excessive workloads would hamstring \n3 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 3 of 12\n\neven the best of lawyers, and have not received the basic investigation and counseling that the \nSixth Amendment demands.”  Doc. 1-2, p. 45.   \nOn April 7, 2017, the Defendants removed the action to federal court.  Shortly thereafter \non April 21, 2017, the State of Missouri and then-Governor Greitens moved to dismiss, arguing \nthat the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred all claims against these two Defendants, that \nlegislative immunity barred all claims against Defendant Greitens, and that Plaintiffs lacked \nArticle III standing, had adequate alternative legal remedies, and failed to state plausible \nconstitutional claims.  Doc. 18, Doc. 20.  The Court denied these motions.  Order, Doc. 69.  \nRelevant here, the Court found that Missouri was not entitled to sovereign immunity for this suit \nseeking prospective equitable relief, and that then-Governor Greitens was subject to suit under \nthe Ex Parte Young doctrine permitting declaratory and injunctive relief against state officers.  \nId.   \nOn appeal, the Eighth Circuit determined the Governor and the State of Missouri should \nbe dismissed.  Church v. Missouri, 913 F.3d 736 (8th Cir. 2019).  With respect to the Governor, \nthe Eighth Circuit held that the Ex Parte Young doctrine did not apply, because the Governor’s \ngeneral enforcement authority, appointment of all MSPD Commissioners, and appropriation-\nreduction authority did not constitute “some connection” to the State’s Sixth Amendment \nobligation, and therefore the Governor was shielded from suit and liability under sovereign \nimmunity and legislative immunity.  Id. at 753.  Further, the Eighth Circuit found that Missouri’s \nstate sovereign immunity did apply, barring all suits against the State, including those seeking \nprospective equitable relief.  Id. at 745–46.  In finding that no common law exception to \nMissouri’s sovereign immunity applied here, the Eighth Circuit cited the Missouri Supreme \n4 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 4 of 12\n\nCourt’s rejection of the possibility that “the state itself can be enjoined.”  Id. at 746 (citing \nCarson v, Sullivan, 284 Mo. 353, 223 S.W. 571, 571 (Mo. banc 1920)).  \nOn February 26, 2019, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  Order, \nDoc. 212.  The parties entered mediation, which resulted in a settlement and their proposed \nconsent judgment, which was filed on May 13, 2019.  Doc. 221.   \nOn May 14, 2019, the Attorney General of Missouri moved to intervene.  Doc. 222.  \nThough the Court denied this motion, Order, Doc. 238, the Attorney General was permitted to \nfile an amicus brief concerning their position on the proposed consent judgment, which they did \non July 26, 2019.  Doc. 247.   \nc.  The Proposed Consent Judgement \nThe terms of the proposed consent judgment impose a variety of obligations on MSPD \nspanning from the time a defendant applies for public defender services through the appeals \nprocess.  For example, MSPD must ensure public defenders argue for release at every client’s \ninitial appearance and/or for a bail amount that the client can afford to pay, Part VI(e); spend \nsufficient time meeting with clients prior to a bail hearing, and if bail is set at an amount a client \ncannot afford and they remain detained,  prioritize these clients with motions for a speedy trial \nunless there is good cause to refrain from doing so, Part VII(c),(f); answer all client \ncorrespondence within ten days of receipt and all phone messages within two days of receipt, \nPart VIII(b); appropriately pursue discovery and train public defenders in proper pre-trial \ninvestigation and pre-trial motion practice Part XI, XII; request and review all discovery in the \ncase and conduct any further investigation prior to advising any client to plead guilty, Part XIII.   \nThe proposed consent judgment also provides for a monitor, who on an ongoing basis \nwould assess the extent to which MSPD is complying with the terms of the consent judgment, \n5 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 5 of 12\n\nand a reporting mechanism whereby MSPD must provide the monitor and Plaintiffs’ counsel \nwith quarterly data demonstrating compliance.  As another enforcement mechanism, indigent \npersons who are or should be represented by MSPD, yet who have not received counsel at a \ncritical stage or who have been placed on a waiting list for representation, may seek as third-\nparty beneficiaries to enforce the consent judgment.  Part XXI(c).  \nThe cornerstone of the entire agreement is the caseload capacity standard.  See Part \nXVIII.  Using data and analysis by the accounting firm RubinBrown, the proposed consent \ndecree imposes a caseload standard on individual public defenders.  The caseload standard \noperates from a baseline of forty available work hours per week, fifty-two available work weeks \nper year, with no time allotted for vacation, sick time, training, administrative functions, or \nholidays.  Using RubinBrown data estimating workload averages per type of case (e.g. \nMurder/Homicide, A/B Felony, Misdemeanor, etc.), MSPD must ensure that, over the course of \nany given calendar month period, public defenders are not assigned more than 173.3 hours’ \nworth of cases.  The proposed consent judgment provides that “if accepting an additional case \nwould mean requiring any public defender’s assigned caseload to exceed the MSPD caseload \nstandard, the MSPD office in question shall not accept any additional cases, and shall not process \nany further indigence applications, until an appropriately experienced public defender with a \ncaseload that falls under the cap becomes available. To do otherwise . . . would violate this \nConsent Judgment.”  Part XVIII(k).  The proposed consent judgment further provides,  \n“In lieu of processing additional indigence applications when this standard has \nbeen reached and placing such defendants on a wait list for public defender \nservices, the MSPD shall ensure that the relevant District Defender promptly \nnotifies the circuit court that the caseload standard case been reached in order to \npromptly allow the court to: (1) appoint private counsel pursuant to State ex rel. \nWolff v. Ruddy, 617 S.W.2d 64 (1981) and Willamson v. Vardeman, 674 F.2d \n1211 (1982); (2) engage with the prosecutor regarding the elimination of \nincarceration as a possible sentence for the offense(s) charged, thus eliminating \n6 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 6 of 12\n\nthe constitutional right to an attorney pursuant to Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, \n373-74 (1979); (3) dismiss the case per the requirements set forth in Ruddy and \nWilliamson; or (4) take any other actions  that are consistent with the constitutions \nof the United States and Missouri, and that do not violate the requirements and \nlimitations of this Consent Judgment.   \n \nPart XVIII(l).   \nII.

DISCUSSION \nThe Missouri Attorney General raises several arguments in his amicus brief as to why the \nCourt should reject the proposed consent judgment.  The Attorney General asserts that the \n8 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 8 of 12\n\nagreement violates Missouri state law provisions § 600.0622 and § 600.063,3 that it grants MSPD \nauthority that it does not have under Missouri law to supervise county jails, that the judgment \nwould likely have a deleterious effect on public safety in Missouri, and that the judgment in \neffect would provide class-wide relief when the Court has already denied Plaintiffs’ motion for \nclass certification.  See Doc. 247.  However, even if the Court were to find in Plaintiffs’ and \nMSPD’s favor on each of the state’s arguments, the Court would still deny the parties’ request \nfor the consent decree they propose.  \n                                                 \n2 § 600.062 provides: “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 600.017 and 600.042 to the \ncontrary, neither the director nor the commission shall have the authority to limit the availability \nof a district office or any division director, district defender, deputy district defender, or assistant \npublic defender to accept cases based on a determination that the office has exceeded a caseload \nstandard. The director, commission, any division director, district defender, deputy district \ndefender, or assistant public defender may not refuse to provide representation required under \nthis chapter without prior approval from a court of competent jurisdiction.”  Mo. Rev. Stat. § \n600.062.   \n3 § 600.063 provides, in relevant part:  \n(1) Upon approval by the director or the commission, any district defender may file \na motion to request a conference to discuss caseload issues involving any individual \npublic defender or defenders, but not the entire office, with the presiding judge of \nany circuit court served by the district office. The motion shall state the reasons \nwhy the individual public defender or public defenders will be unable to provide \neffective assistance of counsel due to caseload concerns. When a motion to request \na conference has been filed, the clerk of the court shall immediately provide a copy \nof the motion to the prosecuting or circuit attorney who serves the circuit court.  \n(2) If the presiding judge approves the motion, a date for the conference shall be set \nwithin thirty days of the filing of the motion. The court shall provide notice of the \nconference date and time to the district defender and the prosecuting or circuit \nattorney.  \n(3) Within thirty days of the conference, the presiding judge shall issue an order \neither granting or denying relief. If relief is granted, it shall be based upon a finding \nthat the individual public defender or defenders will be unable to provide effective \nassistance of counsel due to caseload issues . . .  \n(5) Nothing in this section shall deny any party the right to seek any relief \nauthorized by law nor shall any provisions of this section be construed as providing \na basis for a claim for post-conviction relief by a defendant. \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 600.063.   \n9 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 9 of 12\n\nThe most crucial provision of the proposed consent judgment is the caseload capacity \nstandard.  In order for MSPD to meet the numerous other requirements contained in the \nagreement, including those concerning client communication and visitation, investigation, \nmotion practice, and appearances, public defenders must have the time do so.  The studies and \nallegations reviewed above repeatedly link MSPD’s caseload size to the ability to provide \nadequate counsel.  Thus, MSPD’s ability to reduce public defenders’ current caseload and \nmaintain the specified caseload standard is critical to the operation of the proposed consent \njudgment as a whole.  The importance placed on the caseload standard is demonstrated by the \nmandatory language used in the proposed consent judgment, including that MSPD “shall not \naccept any additional cases and shall not process any further indigence applications, until an \nappropriately experienced public defender with a caseload that falls under the cap becomes \navailable. To do otherwise . . . would violate this Consent Judgment.”  Part XVIII(k).  Given this \nlanguage, Plaintiffs or a third-party beneficiary would be permitted to bring a contempt motion \nin this Court against MSPD for failing to adhere to the caseload capacity standard, or for failing \nto adhere to any of the other obligations imposed by the proposed consent agreement.  Such a \nmotion, however, could also affect the MSPD in state court, because the current record suggests \nthere will not be enough public defenders to permit the MSPD to both comply with the consent \ndecree and to comply with Missouri state court orders assigning indigent defendants to the \nMSPD.  \nUnder Missouri law, Missouri circuit courts assign indigent defendants to the MSPD.  \nSee, e.g., Mo. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 10-3.010(1)(B) (“Upon motion by either party, the court in \nwhich the case is pending shall have authority to determine whether the services of the public \ndefender may be utilized by the defendant.”)  Both Plaintiffs and MSPD agree that if entered, the \n10 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 10 of 12\n\nconsent judgment would not require “prosecutors or judges, none of whom are parties to this \ncase, to take any specific action in any specific case,” Doc. 228, p. 9, and indeed the Court “may \nnot enter a consent decree that imposes obligations on a party that did not consent to the decree,”  \nLocal No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 529.  Thus, the consent decree in this Court \nwould not prevent a state court from ordering the MSPD to represent an indigent defendant even \nif such representation violates the consent decree.  The MSPD would then have to choose \nbetween being subject to contempt for violating the consent decree in this Court or being subject \nto a penalty for failing to represent an indigent defendant as ordered by the state court.  Viewed \nfrom this enforcement perspective, the proposed consent decree appears illusory because the \nMSPD is caught between conflicting judicial decrees and there is no practical remedy.   Further, \nto hold otherwise, would seriously implicate federalism concerns,4 and the Eighth Circuit’s \nimmunity findings in this case.  See Church, 913 F.3d at 742–47.   \nFinally, the consent decree does not “come within the general scope of . . . the \npleadings.”  E.E.O.C.. 666 F.3d at 1172.  There is no class certified in this case; the pleadings are \nlimited to the rights of the named Plaintiffs.  Yet the remedy proposed covers all indigent \npersons who are or should be represented by the MSPD, yet have not received counsel at a \ncritical stage or who have been placed on a waitlist.  The parties have not explained how such an \n                                                 \n4 “The underlying idea is that a federal injunction of ongoing state proceedings is likely to breed \nresentment and hostility in the state judiciaries and even risk disobedience of the federal court’s \norders.  Therefore, avoiding injunctions of state courts is a way of limiting friction between state \nand federal courts.”  Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 766 (6th ed. 2012).  See also \nO’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 500 (refusing to enter an injunction against state courts where \nplaintiffs sought “an injunction aimed at controlling or preventing the occurrence of specific \nevents that might take place in the course of future state criminal trials . . . This seems to us \nnothing less than an ongoing federal audit of state criminal proceedings which would indirectly \naccomplish the kind of interference that Younger v. Harris . . . and related cases sought to \nprevent.”) \n11 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 261   Filed 01/27/20   Page 11 of 12\n\nexpansive remedy is needed to address the rights of the named Plaintiffs or how as a practical \nmatter such a consent decree applicable to so many indigents in the state criminal justice system \ncould effectively be enforced.    \nThe Court is sympathetic to the difficult position the MSPD system and its attorneys are \nin.  Ultimately, the staffing problems identified in the record may result in specific state criminal \nconvictions being set aside because of Sixth Amendment violations and/or additional ethics \ncomplaints against public defenders, even though the public defenders are not at fault for the \nstaffing problems.  Nonetheless, the proposed consent decree is not the vehicle to ensure that the \nMSPD and the State of Missouri meet their legal obligation to provide constitutionally adequate \nrepresentation to indigent defendants.  \nIV.

The Attorney General, as Missouri’s constitutional officer charged with \nrepresenting the interests of all Missourians, upholding and defending Missouri law, \nand protecting public safety, strongly urges the Court to reject the proposed consent \njudgment for several reasons. \nFirst, Missouri law expressly prohibits the Missouri State Public Defender \n(“MSPD”) system from limiting the availability of an attorney to accept cases based \non a determination that a public defender’s office has exceeded a caseload standard.  \nHowever, the proposed consent judgment imposes a caseload standard on every \nattorney and office in the public defender system.  The proposed consent judgment \nprohibits the MSPD from assigning cases to an attorney that might result in an \nattorney working more than 2,080 hours per year, or 40 hours per week.  This \ncircumvents the necessity of making individualized determinations, and would be \n1 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 1 of 20\n\nmade without the opportunity to receive evidence or testimony on the development of \nthis caseload standard.  And if the Court enters the proposed consent judgment, it \nnever will.   \nSecond, the proposed consent judgment directly contravenes or undermines \nthe  legislative  intent  of  other  Missouri  statutes  and  rules  governing  the \nrepresentation of criminal defendants.  And the proposed consent judgment will \nrequire public defenders to take certain actions in litigation that may run afoul of an \nattorney’s obligations under the Missouri Rules of Professional Responsibility.  \nThird, the proposed consent judgment is likely to have a deleterious effect on \npublic safety in Missouri.  If this Court enters the proposed consent judgment, \nMissouri judges will be unable to consider the caseloads, capabilities, skills, and \nexperiences of individual MSPD attorneys.  Instead, the District Defender leading a \nregional MSPD office must only notify the appropriate Missouri trial court judge that \nthe caseload standard has been breached.  At that point, the judge’s only practical \noptions  will  be  to  dismiss  a  case,  work  towards  eliminating  incarceration  as  a \nsanction, or appoint private counsel.  Untold numbers of indigent defendants may be \nreleased from jail or not sentenced at all, regardless of the severity of their charged \ncrimes. \nFinally, the proposed consent judgment is wholly attenuated from any live \nissues present with the four remaining plaintiffs in this case.  When this case was \nfiled,  it  was  about  five  plaintiffs  and  whether  they  are  being  provided  with \nconstitutionally adequate representation by the Missouri State Public Defender’s \n2 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 2 of 20\n\noffice.  Just months before trial, the remaining parties have asked this Court to enter \na proposed consent judgment that expressly disclaims any finding that Defendants \nviolated  any  criminal  defendant’s  constitutional  rights  (Doc.  222-1,  Consent \nJudgment, Section II(n)).  Instead, the proposed consent judgment provides relief on \na class-wide basis to all current and future indigent criminal defendants and to the \nentire MSPD system.  This Court has already declined to certify this case as a class \naction.    Entering  the  proposed  consent  judgment  would  undermine  this  Court’s \nprevious ruling. \nI.  The proposed consent judgment contravenes Missouri statutes \ngoverning  the  appointment  of  public  defenders  to  indigent \ncriminal defendants. \n \nA.  Missouri law prohibits imposing a brightline caseload standard \non public defenders based on hours worked. \n \nSection  600.062,  RSMo,  expressly  prohibits  the  MSPD  from  limiting  the \navailability  of  any  public  defender  office  or  individual  attorney  “based  on  a \ndetermination that the office has exceeded a caseload standard.”  In spite of this clear \nMissouri  law,  the  proposed  consent  judgment  requires  the  MSPD  to  limit  the \navailability of its attorneys based on a caseload standard.  The proposed consent \njudgment provides that “the MSPD shall ensure that public defenders not exceed the \nMSPD caseload standard.”  (Consent Judgment, Section XVIII(e)).  The proposed \nconsent judgment fixes the caseload standard at 173.3 hours’ worth of cases on a \nmonthly basis.  (Consent Judgment, Section V(f)).  This amount was calculated to \n“equal 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.”  (Consent Judgment, Section XVIII(f)).  The \ncaseload  standard  in  the  proposed  consent  judgment  will  drive  the  MSPD’s \n3 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 3 of 20\n\nassignment of cases to its attorneys, directly contravening the unambiguous bar in \n§ 600.062, RSMo, against implementing caseload standards.   \nWhat is more, the proposed consent judgment contains no provision for this \ncaseload standard to be reexamined or adjusted over the proposed consent judgment’s \nseven-year term.  The caseload standard in the proposed consent judgment is simply \nnot permitted by Missouri law.  And the basis for these numbers has not been briefed \nby the parties to the lawsuit or subjected to judicial scrutiny.  If the Court enters the \nproposed consent judgment, they never will be. \nThough the MSPD is statutorily prohibited from implementing a bright-line \nrule  based  on  hours  worked  for  assigning  cases,  Missouri  law  does  provide \nmechanisms for public defenders to obtain relief if their caseload is preventing them \nfrom providing effective assistance of counsel.  Under § 600.063, RSMo, an individual \nMSPD attorney can request a conference to discuss caseload issues with the presiding \njudge of the circuit court serving an MSPD district office.  The attorney must “state \nthe reasons why the individual public defender or defenders will be unable to provide \neffective assistance of counsel due to caseload concerns.”  § 600.063.1, RSMo.  After \nfiling  the  motion  and  conferring  with  the  court,  the  court  may  decide  that  the \nindividual attorney does not have a caseload preventing him from providing effective \nassistance of counsel, or the court may grant limited relief.  Section 600.063.2 allows \nthe  court  to  appoint  a  private  attorney,  place  a  case  on  a  waiting  list,  grant \ncontinuances, or take other actions.  \n4 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 4 of 20\n\nMSPD defenders have used this very provision throughout the State, but the \nMSPD  is  now  attempting  to  circumvent  it.    The  proposed  consent  judgment \nsubstitutes an individual attorney’s assessment of his own caseload with a caseload \nstandard—one that is expressly prohibited by § 600.062, RSMo.  Instead of filing a \nmotion with a circuit court to discuss caseload management issues and allowing the \ncircuit court to consider factors specific to that individual attorney, the proposed \nconsent judgment provides that an attorney shall “notif[y] the circuit court that the \ncaseload standard has been reached.”  (Consent Judgment, Section XVIII(l)).  Upon \nbeing notified, the circuit court may then appoint private counsel, dismiss the case, \nor engage with the prosecutor about eliminating incarceration as an offense.  (Id.).  \nSections  600.062  and  600.063,  RSMo,  only  allow  the  exemption  of  individual \nattorneys from taking cases.  The exemption cannot, under the statutes, be based \nexclusively on a caseload standard.  And the statutes only permit that exemption if \nthe circuit court approves the exemption based on a finding that the individual \nattorney  has  an  excessive  caseload  preventing  that  individual  attorney  from \nproviding effective assistance of counsel. \nThe proposed consent judgment robs Missouri state courts of their jurisdiction \nand responsibility to assess an individual attorney’s caseload, skills, experience, and \ncapabilities.  If this Court enters the proposed consent judgment, the mechanisms in \n§ 600.063, RSMo, become illusory.  Under the proposed consent judgment, a court will \nsimply be notified that a caseload standard has been reached.  If a court is so notified, \nthe court can provide only certain relief.  The court will be unable to engage in its \n5 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 5 of 20\n\njudicial function to truly analyze whether the attorney is able to provide effective \nassistance of counsel.  Whereas a court can conduct an individualized assessment \ntailored  to  the  specific  attorney  making  a  motion  under  §  600.063,  RSMo,  the \nproposed consent judgment establishes a universal rule applicable to all MSPD offices \nand attorneys.  The proposed consent judgment therefore replaces the court’s own \nindependent assessment of a matter, undermining the role of a judge and Missouri \nstatutes.   \nMSPD attorneys have pursued the judicial conferences under § 600.063, RSMo, \nand courts have rejected (although not in every instance) their arguments that their \ncaseloads prevent them from providing effective assistance of counsel.  In one recent \ncase, the Jackson County Circuit Court considered detailed information about the \ncaseload for the District 16 Public Defender’s Office.  In re: Area 16 Public Defender \nOffice III (Case No. 1716-MC14505, Circuit Court of Jackson County).  The Court \nnoted that during a 10-year period, while the number of attorneys in the office \nremained essentially consistent, the office saw a 63% reduction in the number of cases \nassigned to the office.  “Based on the specific information and data,” the Court noted, \n“it is not reasonable to conclude, under any standard or legal burden, that the District \n16 office has caseload issues.”  Id. at p. 15 (emphasis in original). \nSo, despite the MSPD’s efforts to convince Missouri courts that their caseloads \nprevent them from providing constitutionally adequate representation to indigent \ndefendants, the MSPD urges this Court to enter a proposed consent judgment as a \nbackdoor way of imposing a caseload standard throughout the entire MSPD system.  \n6 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 6 of 20\n\nThe proposed consent judgment has no appreciation for nuance of the capabilities, \nskills, or demands of individual MSPD attorneys or even regional MSPD offices.  \nInstead, the proposed consent judgment will impose a single standard, prohibited by \nMissouri law, on all MSPD attorneys and offices.  It effectively grants the MSDP—a \ndefendant to the lawsuit—class-wide relief.   \nGranting class-wide relief to the MSPD is especially unwarranted because \nMSPD attorneys have, in fact, successfully pursued caseload relief under § 600.063, \nRSMo.  See In re: Missouri State Public Defender District 21, St. Louis County Trial \nOffice (Case No. 18SL-CC00129, St. Louis County Circuit Court).  If an individual \npublic defender does have an excessive caseload preventing him or her from providing \neffective assistance of counsel, the statutory procedures have been proven to work.  \nSubjecting all MSPD attorneys to the 40-hour per week caseload standard forces all \npublic defenders to limit their representation, even if they are capable of providing \neffective assistance of counsel with a higher caseload.   \nB.  The proposed consent judgment will grant the MSPD authority \nthat it does not have under Missouri law. \n \nThe proposed consent judgment also grants the MSPD authority that it does \nnot have under Missouri law.  Section VIII(e) of the proposed consent judgment places \nthe MSPD in a supervisory authority over county jails’ provision of applications for \npublic defender services.  Specifically, the MSPD shall ensure that “county jails are \naware of and in compliance with all relevant laws regarding the provision of such \napplications.”  However, no Missouri law grants the MSPD authority to serve as a \ncompliance monitor for county jails.  Moreover, the proposed consent judgment does \n7 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 7 of 20\n\nnot address the consequences if a jail does not comply with this provision.  If the \nMSPD takes on an oversight role over county jails’ provision of applications for public \ndefender services, it is unclear whether the MSPD or the jail is ultimately liable if \nthe jail falls short of its obligation. \nSection VIII(e) of the proposed consent judgment requires the MSPD to “take \nappropriate legal steps to ensure that county jails and state prisons are in compliance \nwith  all  laws  and  rules  regarding  access  to  counsel  and  the  privacy  of  client \ncommunications.”  The terms do not make clear what “appropriate legal steps” the \nMSPD may take, but Missouri law already makes the Director of the Department of \nCorrections responsible for the operation of state prisons.  Under § 217.025.1, RSMo, \nthe  Director  of  the  Department  of  Corrections  is  entrusted  with  the  “general \nsupervision, management and control” of Missouri’s prison system.  No Missouri law \ngrants the MSPD supervisory authority over the state prison system.   \nFurthermore, none of the proposed findings of fact in the proposed consent \njudgment addresses issues with privacy of client communication and defendants’ \ncommunication with their attorneys inside Missouri’s prisons or jails.  This relief was \nnot sought in the plaintiffs’ Complaint, and the facts set forth in the proposed consent \njudgment do not support granting it.  The proposed consent judgment therefore \ngrants the MSPD—the defendants in this lawsuit—powers it does not have under \nMissouri law.  The expansion of the MSPD’s powers only reinforces the fact that the \nACLU and the MSPD are not truly adverse parties in this lawsuit. \n \n8 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 8 of 20\n\nC.  The proposed consent judgment is not premised on facts to support \na violation of federal law and thereby override Missouri law. \n \n“While parties can settle their litigation with consent decrees, they cannot \nagree to disregard valid state laws, and cannot consent to do something together that \nthey lack the power to do individually.”  Perkins v. City of Chicago Heights, 47 F.3d \n212, 216 (7th Cir. 1995) (internal citations omitted).  State entities, like the MSPD, \n“cannot enter into an agreement allowing them to act outside their legal authority, \neven if that agreement is styled as a ‘consent judgment’ and approved by a court.”  St. \nCharles  Tower,  Inc.  v.  Kurtz,  643  F.3d  264,  270  (8th  Cir.  2011).    If  a  consent \njudgment’s terms are not “narrowly tailored so as to infringe state sovereignty as \nminimally as possible,” the consent judgment is invalid and unenforceable.  Id. (citing \nPerkins).  In Kurtz, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court’s entry of a consent \njudgment that contravened Missouri law because the consent judgment’s remedy was \nnot “necessary to rectify a violation of federal law” and it was not narrowly tailored \nto minimize infringement on state sovereignty.  Id. at 270-71. \nThe  proposed  consent  judgment  clearly  contravenes  Missouri  law  and \nundermines the Missouri Supreme Court Rules, as discussed below.  The remedies \nprovided in the proposed consent judgment are simply not necessary to rectify any \nviolation of federal law.   \nFirst,  the  proposed  consent  judgment  expressly  disclaims  any  federal \nconstitutional violation.  In Section II(n), the proposed consent judgment states that \nthe “MSPD does not admit that the constitutional rights of any specific indigent \ndefendant or defendants, including plaintiffs, have been violated.”  The closest the \n9 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 9 of 20\n\nproposed consent judgment comes to finding a constitutional violation is speculation \nthat  “there  is  a  high  likelihood  that  Plaintiffs  would  be  able  to  prove  their \nconstitutional claims against the MSPD.”  (Consent Judgment, Section III(j)).  Absent \nany finding that any plaintiff’s constitutional rights have been violated, a consent \njudgment  that  contravenes  state  law  is  not  permitted  under  controlling  Eighth \nCircuit precedent. \nSecond, even if this Court were to interpret the proposed consent judgment as \nsupporting an actual violation of the Constitution by the MSPD, the relief granted by \nthe proposal is not necessary to rectify that violation.  As discussed below, only one \nof the remaining four plaintiffs in this case has standing to proceed with this lawsuit \nto trial.  And that plaintiff, Viola Bowman, has been represented by the same public \ndefender for over four years.  That public defender has not moved to withdraw from \nMs. Bowman’s case, and the Attorney General’s Office could not find record of him \nfiling a motion under § 600.063, RSMo.  Granting systemic relief to tens of thousands \nof current and future criminal defendants and to the entire MSPD system based on \nspeculation that one person’s federal constitutional rights might be violated is not \nnarrowly tailored to minimize intrusions into Missouri’s state sovereignty and the \nstatutory scheme of Chapter 600, RSMo. \nII.  The proposed consent judgment imposes on MSPD attorneys \ndifferent  ethical  standards  from  the  Missouri  Rules  of \nProfessional  Conduct,  and  it  will  supplant  several  Missouri \nSupreme Court Rules for criminal practice and procedure. \n \nIn a number of ways, the proposed consent judgment will require MSPD \nattorneys to take actions that may undermine or conflict with their ethical obligations \n10 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 10 of 20\n\nunder the Missouri Rules of Professional Conduct.  The proposed consent judgment \ncould have included a provision exempting MSPD from taking actions that conflict \nwith their ethical obligations.  Instead, the only instances in which the Rules of \nProfessional Conduct are mentioned in the proposed consent judgment are in the \nprovisions that talk about conflicts of interest created by excessive workloads.   \nFor example, Section VII(b) of the proposed consent judgment requires MSPD \nattorneys to promptly file a motion for a bail review hearing if the trial court declines \nto release a client pre-trial, or if a client is unable to post bail.  However, Rule 4-3.1 \nof  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  prohibit  Missouri  attorneys  from  making \nunmeritorious claims and contentions.  By requiring MSPD attorneys to file certain \nmotions in all cases, there is a reasonable likelihood that they will be put in a position \nwhere they will file a pleading in violation of Rule 4-3.1.   \nIn addition, by imposing a caseload standard on all MSPD attorneys and \noffices, the proposed consent judgment likely undermines Rule 4-1.1.  That Rule \nstates that Missouri attorneys shall provide competent representation to a client with \nthe appropriate “legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably \nnecessary for the representation.”  But the new caseload standard was developed by \nan accounting firm’s many-years-old study of the number of hours an attorney should \ndevote to a specific type of case.  While the proposed consent judgment does not \nexpressly prohibit an MSPD attorney from spending more time on a given case, the \ncaseload standard is inextricably linked with how many hours an attorney should \n11 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 11 of 20\n\nspend  on  a  case,  regardless  of  the  legal  knowledge,  skill,  thoroughness  and \npreparation necessary for the representation. \nFinally, the proposed consent judgment will affect the way that criminal cases \nare prosecuted and tried in Missouri, undermining the Missouri Supreme Court \nRules.    For  example,  Missouri  Supreme  Court  Rule  25.02(b)  requires  discovery \nrequests to be filed within 20 days of arraignment.  However, Section X(b) of the \nproposed  consent  judgment  drastically  reduces  this  to  only  two  days  after \narraignment  in  felony  cases,  contrary  to  Missouri  Supreme  Court  Rules.    The \nproposed consent judgment therefore substitutes the trial strategy and judgment of \nindividual public defenders, forcing them to propound discovery in 10% of the time \nthat the Missouri Supreme Court Rules allow.  In other places, too, the proposed \nconsent judgment substitutes the trial strategy of individual public defenders by \nmandating them to take certain actions in discovery, trial, and appeal that are not \nmandated by the Missouri Supreme Court rules, including filing motions, requesting \nhearings, filing briefs, and seeking oral argument.  (See generally Consent Judgment, \nSection X). \nIII.  The proposed consent judgment will adversely impact public \nsafety and limit the availability of public defenders to provide \nrepresentation to clients needing their services. \n \nThe proposed consent judgment will not only affect MSPD attorneys and the \nplaintiffs to this case, it will impact the entire criminal justice system.  As discussed \nin Part I above, the proposed consent judgment will substitute a circuit court’s \nassessment under § 600.063, RSMo, of an individual public defender’s workload.  \n12 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 12 of 20\n\nInstead, under the proposed consent judgment, all a public defender has to do is notify \na trial court that his caseload has exceeded 173.3 hours’ worth of cases.  After \nreceiving  this  notification,  a  court’s  options  are  limited.    These  options  include \nentirely dismissing a case or eliminating incarceration as an offense, regardless of \nthe severity of the charged crime.  (Consent Judgment, Section XVIII(l)).  Nothing in \nMissouri law authorizes courts to take these actions based entirely on an individual \npublic defender’s workload.  The proposed consent judgment, on the other hand, does \njust that, providing for dismissal of a case “in lieu of processing additional indigence \napplications when this standard has been reached.”  (Id.). \nIndividuals accused of some of the most serious felonies in Missouri—rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery—may walk free without undergoing a trial because a \npublic defender’s office will refuse to take any cases that will require an attorney to \nwork more than 40 hours per week.  And that threshold may be even lower, because \nthe proposed consent judgment allows the MSPD to seek downward adjustments in \nthe caseload standard.  (Consent Judgment, Section XVIII(o)).  Upon notification that \nan  attorney’s  caseload  standard  has  been  met,  courts  may  also  eliminate \nincarceration as a possible penalty for a charged offense.  The relief sought in the case \nand in the proposed consent judgment will cause grave risks to public safety in a \nconcrete and particularized way.   \nAnd critically, the proposed consent judgment will limit the availability of \npublic defenders to represent indigent defendants—the very people they should be \nrepresenting.  By indiscriminately limiting the number of hours worked per public \n13 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 13 of 20\n\ndefender, it is entirely likely that many indigent defendants will not be able to gain \naccess to a lawyer at all.  The proposed consent judgment acknowledges that the \nMSPD currently maintains a waitlist of indigent defendants awaiting public defender \nservices.  “During their time on a waitlist, indigent defendants have no access to legal \nrepresentation whatsoever.”  (Consent Judgement, Section II(m)).  It is unclear if the \nMSPD will continue to maintain a waitlist, because the proposed consent judgment \nstates that “in lieu of . . . placing such defendants on a wait list for public defender \nservices, the MSPD shall ensure that the relevant District Defender promptly notifies \nthe court that the caseload standard has been reached.”  (Consent Judgment, Section \nXVIII(l)).  Even if the MSPD continues placing defendants on a waitlist, more and \nmore indigent defendants will be prosecuted without being provided access to a public \ndefender.  \nThe  United  States  and  the  Missouri  Constitutions  require  that  criminal \ndefendants receive adequate assistance of counsel.  But instead of ensuring that an \nindividual defendant is receiving adequate counsel, the proposed consent judgment \nflips the focus from the defendant to the public defender.  There is no guarantee that \nlimiting the caseloads of the entire MSPD system ensures that any current or future \ndefendant charged with a crime will receive adequate assistance of counsel.  If \nanything,  the  proposed  consent  judgment  limits  the  availability  of  attorneys  to \nprovide counsel.   \n \n14 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 14 of 20\n\nIV.  The proposed consent judgment inappropriately grants class-\nwide relief, and it will be enforceable by untold numbers of \ncriminal defendants. \n \nThe  proposed  consent  judgment  makes  as  third-party  beneficiaries  “all \nindigent persons who are now, or who will be, under formal charge before a state \ncourt in Missouri . . . and who are represented by MSPD, or should be represented by \nMSPD[.]”  These third parties, representing an untold number of present and future \ncriminal defendants, can sue to enforce the terms of the proposed consent judgment.  \nHowever, this Court has already refused plaintiffs’ motion—notably unopposed by \nthe MSPD—to certify this case as a class action. \nIn  its  order  denying  class  certification,  the  Court  rejected  the  plaintiffs’ \nargument that this case “requires an analysis of MSPD at the system-wide level, and \ndoes not depend on the particular circumstances of individual cases.”  [Doc. 212, p. \n8].  The Court reasoned: \nNone of the questions that Plaintiffs present are apt to \ngenerate common answers, and instead the answers may \nvary  depending  upon  any  one  of  a  number  of  factors, \nincluding  the  Plaintiffs’  location  and  type  of  criminal \ncharge,  and  may  even  vary  among  individual  MSPD \nattorneys. For instance, the Plaintiffs cannot establish the \nanswer to “whether the State has met its obligation to \nprovide counsel,” without providing evidence from each of \nMSPD’s forty-two offices and three divisions. The answer \ncould quite conceivably be yes in one MSPD office, but no \nin another. \n \n[Id.].  The Court found that the 10,000+ indigent criminal defendants in Missouri do \nnot share common questions of law and fact.   The plaintiffs could not “’bridge the \nconceptual  gap’  between  their  contention  that  the  MSPD  is  underfunded  and \n15 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 15 of 20\n\noverworked, and their allegation that every putative class member has suffered a \ncommon injury of inadequate counsel.”  [Id. at p. 9]. \n  The consent judgment would without a doubt grant class-wide relief to “all \nindigent persons who are now, or who will be, under formal charge before a state \ncourt in Missouri,” (Consent Judgment, Section XXI(c)), flouting this Court’s order \ndenying  class  certification  just  a  few  short  months  ago.    This  is  especially \ninappropriate because only one of the four plaintiffs in this lawsuit is currently on \ntrial.  Each of the four plaintiffs are, or were, actually represented by counsel in their \ncriminal cases.  See Case Nos. 15CT-CR02237-01; 16CT-CR1306-01; 15CY-CR00043; \n16AO-CR00722-01; 17MG-CR00068-1.   \nAs of the date of this brief, plaintiffs Randall Lee Dalton, Dorian Samuels, and \nBrian Richman have pleaded guilty.  These three plaintiffs were represented by \ncounsel during their plea proceedings.  By pleading guilty, they have waived any \nclaims they may have for ineffective assistance of counsel, unless the claim is limited \nto how an attorney’s conduct affected the guilty plea.  Worthington v. State, 166 \nS.W.3d 566, 573 (Mo. banc 2005) (By pleading guilty, a defendant “waived any claim \nthat  counsel  was  ineffective  except  to  the  extent  that  the  conduct  affected  the \nvoluntariness and knowledge with which the plea was made.”).  Any claims they may \nhave  at  this  point  regarding  effective  assistance  of  counsel  are  moot  and  not \njusticiable.  See id.; see also Tolen v. State, 934 S.W.2d 639, 643 (Mo. App. E.D. 1996) \n(Where a guilty plea is “both counselled and voluntary, claims of failure to investigate \n16 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 16 of 20\n\nfactual issues are subsumed and rendered moot by the guilty plea.”) (citations and \nediting marks omitted). \nAnd because they have pleaded guilty, they should be dismissed from this \nlawsuit.  Notably, the MSPD—who, as a self-interested defendant, will immensely \nbenefit  from  a  reduction  in  the  hours  worked  by  its  attorneys—has  not  sought \ndismissal of these three plaintiffs.  This Court has previously dismissed the original \nlead plaintiff to this case, Shondel Church, after Mr. Church pleaded guilty.  [Doc. \n69].  Just as this Court held that Mr. Church lacked standing to be a plaintiff after \nhis guilty plea, Plaintiffs Dalton, Samuels, and Richman, too, lack standing and \nshould be dismissed. \nThat leaves one plaintiff left to shoulder the burden for obtaining class-wide \nrelief on behalf of thousands of indigent non-party criminal defendants and the entire \nMSPD system.  Viola Bowman was charged with first-degree murder and armed \ncriminal  action,  and  her  case  is  set  for  trial  in  October  2019.    She  has  been \nrepresented by the same MSPD attorney since shortly after her arraignment in \nJanuary 2015.  That attorney has not sought to withdraw from her case, and the \nAttorney General’s Office has not found record of him filing a motion or obtaining \nrelief under § 600.063, RSMo.  And Ms. Bowman does not appear to have requested \nthat the court appoint her a new attorney in her criminal case.  Because her case is \nongoing, she can raise any claims for ineffective assistance of counsel during her trial \nor on appeal.  Missouri Supreme Court Rules 24.035 and 29.15 provide for post-\nconviction relief in the event she claims ineffective assistance of counsel. \n17 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 17 of 20\n\nIn addition, the proposed consent judgment raises substantial questions about \nenforcement.    As  third-party  beneficiaries  with  enforcement  rights  (Consent \nJudgment, Section XXI(c)), presumably any future indigent criminal defendant can \nseek relief in this Court if the MSPD does not comply with the judgment’s terms.  \nGiven the breadth of the terms—e.g., an attorney’s hours worked, communication \nwith a public defender’s clients, filing of motions, and serving of discovery—this Court \nmay be faced with countless motions to enforce the consent judgment.  Those motions \nto enforce would typically, and appropriately, be addressed during the course of a \ncriminal defendant’s prosecution.  But if a criminal defendant’s public defender does \nnot propound discovery within two days of an indictment, respond to a client’s phone \nmessage within two days of receipt, or provide a client with a copy of a motion within \nfive days of filing, the defendant is presumably authorized to file a civil motion to \nenforce the consent judgment in this Court. \nFurthermore, the proposed consent judgment vests significant authority in a \ncourt-appointed Monitor to oversee the MSPD’s compliance with the terms of the \nconsent  judgment.    The  dispute  resolution  procedures  provide  that  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel—the ACLU—must bring to the Monitor’s attention any issues about the \nMSPD’s compliance with the consent judgment.  (Consent Judgment, Section XX).  \nNotably,  the  proposed  consent  judgment  does  not  authorize  the  plaintiffs \nthemselves—the only parties truly entitled to relief in this lawsuit—to bring these \nissues to the Monitor’s attention.  Rather, the ACLU, who may not represent any \nfuture criminal defendants affected by the MSPD’s counsel in a criminal case, is \n18 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 18 of 20\n\ngranted authority to serve as a check on the MSPD system.  Granting Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel such expansive rights, completely untethered to the representation given to \nan individual criminal defendant, is extraordinary and unwarranted.   \n  The proposed consent judgment will make monumental changes to the way \nthat  criminal  defendants  are  prosecuted,  tried,  and  represented  by  counsel  in \nMissouri.  These changes will based on one plaintiff who has been represented by the \nsame public defender for over four years and who does not appear to have raised any \nclaims for ineffective assistance of counsel in her criminal case.  This Court should \npreside over this case at trial, and the MSPD should defend the adequacy of its \nrepresentation  given  to  the  individual  plaintiffs  in  this  lawsuit.    Public  policy, \nMissouri law, and this Court’s own prior decisions in this case dictate that this Court \nshould not grant class-wide relief and open the floodgates to untold numbers of \nmotions or lawsuits by current and future criminal defendants, who already have \nrecourse under state law.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  stated,  the  Court  should  not  enter  the  proposed  consent \njudgment. \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 247   Filed 07/26/19   Page 19 of 20\n\nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nERIC S.

Background1 \nThis lawsuit challenges the adequacy of the Missouri State Public Defender (MSPD), \nwhich provides legal representation to all indigent citizens accused or convicted of crimes in \nMissouri state court. Plaintiffs filed this putative class action alleging Missouri “has failed to \nmeet  its  constitutional  obligation  to  provide  indigent  defendants  with  meaningful \nrepresentation.” Plaintiffs filed for injunctive and declaratory relief in Missouri state court. \nDefendants removed this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§1331, 1441, and 1446. \n \n                                                            \n1   The facts are found in Plaintiffs’ Class Action Petition for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.  \n[Doc. 1-2.]   For purposes of deciding the Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss, the Court accepts the \nPlaintiffs’ factual allegations as true and construes them in the light most favorable to them.  See Stodghill \nv. Wellston Sch. Dist., 512F.3d 472, 476 (8th Cir. 2008).   \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 1 of 48\n\nA. Missouri Indigent Defense Overview  \nThe  State  of  Missouri  relies  almost  exclusively  on  local  MSPD  offices  to  provide \nindigent defense services in all 114 counties and St. Louis City. MSPD comprises three distinct \nparts: the Trial Division, subdivided into 33 district offices across the State; the Appellate/Post-\nConviction Division, subdivided into six offices; and the Capital Division, subdivided into three \noffices.  MSPD  employs  approximately  376  attorneys—including  roughly  313  in  the  Trial \nDivision—and  approximately  200  administrative  staff,  support  staff,  paralegals,  and \ninvestigators.  The  MSPD  represents  indigent  defendants  in  over  100,000  cases  each  year, \ncounting new cases and cases carried over from previous years.  \n1. Funding \n  MSPD  is  funded  almost  exclusively  from  Missouri’s  general  revenue.  The  level  of \nfunding provided by the State is less than one half of one percent of the State’s general revenue. \nIn fiscal year 2016, the MSPD Trial Division handled more than 75,000 cases; with its funding, \nthe MSPD spent an average of $356 per case.  \nSince the establishment of MSPD in its current form in 1989, there have been at least ten \nindependent evaluations of Missouri’s public defense system, including assessments conducted \nby The Spangenberg Group in 1993 and 2005; the Missouri Senate Interim Committee in 2006; \nThe  Spangenberg  Group  and  the  Center  for  Law,  Justice,  and  Society  at  George  Mason \nUniversity in 2009; the U.S. Department of Justice – Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2010; the \nAmerican  Bar  Association  in  2010;  the  National  Juvenile  Defender  Center  in  2013;  the \nAmerican Bar Association and RubinBrown in 2014; the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015; \nand the Sixth Amendment Center in 2016.2  \nThe Sixth Amendment Center’s study determined that Missouri’s per capita spending on \n                                                            \n2   The reports from those studies are in the record at [Docs. 1-3, 1-4].  \n2 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 2 of 48\n\nindigent defense is approximately one-third of the average of the 35 states surveyed. According \nto the study, in fiscal year 2015 Missouri spent $6.20 per resident for indigent defense services, \ncompared to an average of $18.41 per capita among the other States in the study. Missouri \ncurrently ranks 49th among the 50 states in funding for indigent defense.  \nIn  August  2015,  Defendant  Michael  Barrett—Director  of  MSPD—wrote  to  then-\nGovernor Jay Nixon requesting additional funds. Barrett noted that, “[f]or years, the Missouri \nState Public Defender (MSPD) has warned that the rights of poor Missourians are being violated \nthroughout the state because MSPD’s resources are too few and the caseloads too high.” Barrett \npointed to recent reports by the National Juvenile Defender Center (NJDC) and the ABA making \nclear that existing funding was “woefully inadequate to guarantee the constitutional rights of \nindigent[]” defendants in Missouri. As such, Barrett requested a $10 million supplemental budget \nto provide some of the resources that MSPD urgently needed to “meet[] its obligations to its \ncitizens under the U.S. and Missouri Constitutions.” His request was denied. \n  In 2015, the Missouri legislature approved an additional $3.4 million in funding to \nMSPD.  Then-Governor  Nixon  vetoed  the  funding.  The  legislature  overrode  that  veto,  but \nGovernor Nixon nevertheless withheld the funds from MSPD. The legislature approved $4.5 \nmillion in additional funding for caseload relief in fiscal year 2017, but Governor Nixon directed \nthat the MSPD receive only $1 million.  \n  Plaintiffs estimate it would take an additional $20 million or more per year for MSPD to \nmeet  the  constitutional  floor  of  providing  minimally  adequate  representation  to  indigent \ndefendants.  \n2. Workloads  \n  In 1993, the Missouri State Public Defender Commission sought the assistance of The \n3 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 3 of 48\n\nSpangenberg Group (TSG) in studying the internal operations of the Missouri public defense \nsystem, including issues related to budgeting, staffing, and allocation of resources. TSG’s report \nconcluded that MSPD “lack[ed] the necessary resources to provide competent representation,” \nand that “[t]he legal staff needs to be increased as soon as possible.”  [Doc. 1-3, pp. 86–106 of \n150].  \nIn 2005, the Missouri Bar Association formed a Public Defender Task Force to work in \nconjunction  with  the  MSPD  Commission  to  address  those  deficiencies.  The  task  force \ncommission TSG to conduct another study into the MSPD. The report warned that Missouri’s \npublic defender system was “on the verge of collapse” and that, despite the best efforts of \nMSPD’s attorneys, many public defenders were routinely failing to comply with MSPD’s Public \nDefender Guidelines for Representation and the Missouri Rules of Professional Conduct.  [Doc. \n1-3, pp. 111–138 of 150].  \nIn January 2007, an interim committee of the Missouri Senate released its report on \nMSPD. The committee found that the caseloads of public defenders were “too large,” and \nrecommended that “caseloads . . . be reduced, support staff be increased, the number of public \ndefenders be increased . . . [and] the base salary of public defenders be[ ] increased.”  [Docs. 1-3, \npp. 140–150 of 150; 1-4, pp. 1–4 of 290]. \nIn 2009, the Missouri Bar Association retained TSG for another report. TSG concluded \nthat public defender workloads had worsened since its 2005 report and, as a result of those \nworkloads,  public  defenders  were  failing  to  (1)  conduct  prompt  interviews  of  their  clients \nfollowing arrest, (2) spend sufficient time interviewing and counseling their clients, (3) advocate \neffectively for pretrial release, (4) conduct thorough investigations of their cases, (5) pursue \nformal and informal discovery, (6) file appropriate and essential pleadings and motions, (7) \n4 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 4 of 48\n\nconduct necessary legal research, and (8) prepare adequately for pretrial hearings, trial, and \nsentencing. [Doc. 1-4, pp. 6–73 of 290].  \nIn June 2014, the ABA and accounting firm RubinBrown released a study of Missouri’s \npublic defender system, which included an assessment of public defender workloads for both \nadult and juvenile matters. [Doc. 1-7]. The researchers calculated the minimum number of hours \n(excluding court time, travel, and administrative tasks) that an attorney would need to devote to \ndifferent types of cases in order to provide constitutionally adequate representation. The study \ndetermined that a constitutionally adequate attorney would need to spend a minimum of 106.6 \nhours on a non-capital murder/homicide case; at least 47.6 hours on an A/B felony; at least 25.0 \nhours on a C/D felony; at least 63.8 hours on a felony sex offense; at least 11.7 hours on a \nmisdemeanor; at least 9.8 hours on a probation violation; and at least 19.5 hours on a juvenile \ncase. [Doc. 1-4, pp. 75–121 of 290]. \nIn 2015, MSPD attorneys were able to spend, on average, 84.5 hours on each non-capital \nmurder/homicide case; 8.7 hours on each A/B felony; 4.4 hours on each C/D felony; 25.6 hours \non each felony sex offense; 2.3 hours on each misdemeanor; 1.4 hours on each probation \nviolation; and 4.6 hours on each juvenile case. Id. Under the ABA’s analysis, “attorneys in the \nSt.  Louis  County  office  [were]  at  265%  workload  capacity,”  and  throughout  the  state,  for \nexample: “239% capacity for the Springfield office, 254% for Jefferson City, and 254% for \nFarmington.” [Doc. 1-4, pp. 124–126 of 290]. MSPD Trial Division attorneys were able to \ndevote the minimum required hours to only 2.4% of all A/B felony cases (or 97 out of 4,127 total \nA/B felony cases) and 1.4% of C/D felony cases (or 311 out of 21,491 total C/D felony cases). \n[Doc. 1-4, pp. 189–199 of 290]. \nIn February 2017, Defendant Barrett testified before the state legislature that MSPD \n5 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 5 of 48\n\nwould  need  333  more  lawyers  to  provide  minimally  adequate  representation  to  indigent \ndefendants. \nIn 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the validity of a rule promulgated by the \nMissouri Public Defender Commission that “permit[ted] a district defender office to decline \nadditional  appointments  when  it  ha[d]  been  certified  as  being  on  limited  availability  after \nexceeding its caseload capacity for at least three consecutive calendar months.” State ex rel. \nMissouri Public Defender Commission v. Waters, 370 S.W.3d 592, 597 (Mo. 2012). After that \ndecision, however, public defenders who attempted to turn away cases faced resistance from \nprosecutors, judges, and legislators. In some circuits, cases that were turned away were assigned \nto non-MSPD attorneys with no criminal defense experience who were not compensated for their \ntime.  \nThe then-head of MSPD was told that if local offices continued to turn away cases, the \nlegislature would pass a bill to privatize the entire system. The legislature passed Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 600.062, which prevents the director of MSPD or the MSPD Commission from “limit[ing] the \navailability of a district office or any division director, district defender, deputy district defender, \nor assistant public defender to accept cases based on a determination that the office has exceeded \na caseload standard.” Under section 600.062, MSPD “may not refuse to provide representation” \nunless it receives “prior approval from a court of competent jurisdiction.” Since the legislature’s \nenactment of 600.602, no MSPD office has refused cases in any consistent or systematic way. \n3. Representation    \n  As a result of funding deficiency and resulting workloads, Plaintiffs point to deficiencies \nin representation at several stages throughout a case: lack of representation at arraignment and \nbond determinations, prolonged pretrial detention, guilty pleas that are not fully knowing or \n6 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 6 of 48\n\nvoluntary, lack of investigation during discovery, and lack of attorney-client communication.  \nIn 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that the right to counsel attaches when \n“formal judicial proceedings have begun.” Rothgery v. Gillespie County, Texas, 554 U.S. 191, \n211. For a person who is arrested, the beginning of formal judicial proceedings is at the “criminal \ndefendant’s initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charge against him \nand his liberty is subject to restriction.” Id. at 213. “Once attachment occurs, the accused at least \nis entitled to the presence of appointed counsel during any ‘critical stage’ of the post-attachment \nproceedings.” Id. at 212.  \nIn Missouri, however, attorneys are often unavailable to represent each eligible indigent \ndefendant at every critical stage of the criminal process—including at their arraignment, where \nbond is determined. Public defenders routinely do not meet their clients until several weeks after \nthe client’s arrest and arraignment. As a result, bond determinations, which normally occur at the \ndefendant’s initial appearance before the court, are almost always made without the benefit of \nadvocacy from counsel. Unrepresented indigent defendants are therefore often forced to remain \nin jail simply because they are unable to advocate effectively on their own for release on their \nown recognizance or a reasonable reduction in their bond amount. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has also ruled that an attorney must be present at any post-\narraignment lineup because such a “confrontation compelled by the State between the accused \nand the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification evidence is peculiarly riddled with \ninnumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a \nfair trial.” United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 228 (1967). However, defendants in Missouri \nare routinely placed in lineups after arraignment without the benefit of counsel, even though the \nprejudice that results from an improper lineup cannot be cured later in the criminal process. See \n7 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 7 of 48\n\nid. at 236-37. \nBecause indigent defendants are often unrepresented at critical bond determinations, they \nmay remain in jail for extended periods of time. MSPD attorneys’ workloads often require them \nto seek multiple or extended continuances in cases they deem less urgent, or when they need \nadditional  time  to  prepare  adequately  for  more  serious  cases.  Because  of  these  delays, \nirrespective of the merits of the case against them, defendants are often forced to choose between \neither consenting to the continuances, thereby waiving their right to a speedy trial and remaining \nin jail for an extended period of time, or taking their chances at trial with an attorney who has \nhad little or no time to prepare. \nThe vast majority of defendants in Missouri plead guilty. Many of these are MSPD \nclients, but MSPD attorneys are unable to ensure that those who plead guilty do so knowingly \nand  voluntarily.  Excessive  pretrial  detention—often  due  to  public  defenders’  inability  to \nrepresent  defendants  at  bond  hearings  or  their  need  for  repeat  continuances—put  virtually \nunbearable pressure on many defendants to plead guilty merely to get out of jail. Many MSPD \nclients who plead guilty do so without a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of \ntheir case. In particular, public defenders are unable to advise their clients of the immigration \nconsequences of their plea because MSPD does not have the resources to provide any training in \nthe intersection of criminal law and immigration law.  \nMost MSPD attorneys and unable to analyze the discovery they receive early enough in \nthe proceedings to make important investigative decisions, including which key witnesses to \ndepose and whether or not an expert witness is necessary for the client’s defense. Investigators \nare not staffed on every case—or even every serious felony—to which an office is assigned. \nRather, individual defenders, regardless of their level of experience, are asked to use their \n8 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 8 of 48\n\ndiscretion  in  selecting  which  cases  will  be  formally  investigated.  Even  when  an  attorney \ndetermines  that  investigation  is  necessary,  investigators  often  do  not  have  time  to  review \ndiscovery  or  gather  other  background  information  on  the  cases  that  they  do  investigate. \nAdditionally, MSPD attorneys also frequently do not have the time to identify experts or conduct \nexpert consultations. Even when MSPD attorneys identify the need for an expert, they are often \nunable to secure the resources necessary to retain an appropriate expert.  \nTime constraints also mean attorneys are often unable to meet with witnesses or take \nother  important  investigatory  steps  to  prepare  adequately  for  trial  or  to  negotiate  a  more \nfavorable plea bargain. Many MSPD attorneys take depositions in just a small fraction of their \ncases, thus leaving on the table the valuable information that is likely to be gleaned from such \ndepositions. MSPD attorneys are rarely able to file suppression motions because they lack the \ninvestigative resources to identify unconstitutional police conduct, the time to review pertinent \ndiscovery, and the resources and experience to conduct appropriate legal research. As a result, \nevidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments can be used against \ndefendants at trial or to extract guilty pleas. \nFinally, a defendant’s right to consult with his attorney is an integral component of the \nright to assistance of counsel. See Geders v. United States, 425 U.S. 80, 88-91 (1976). But \nMSPD attorneys’ excessive workloads mean that they are unable to meet with clients on a \nregular basis. In some instances, MSPD attorneys are only able to have a substantive meeting \nwith a client for the first time a few weeks before trial. Without their clients’ input, it is \nimpossible for MSPD attorneys to investigate their clients’ cases adequately or properly prepare \nfor trial, plea negotiations, or sentencing. Nor is it possible, under such circumstances, for \nindigent defendants to participate meaningfully in their own defense. \n9 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 9 of 48\n\n4. Juvenile Defense   \n  Minors in juvenile delinquency proceedings are entitled to meaningful representation. See \nIn re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967). Following Gault, the Missouri legislature amended the Missouri \nJuvenile Code to provide children with a statutory right to representation in juvenile court \nproceedings. This right is codified at Mo. Rev. Stat. § 211.211, which provides indigent youth \nwith the right to court-appointed counsel “prior to the filing of a petition” and “for all stages of \nthe proceedings” thereafter. The Missouri Supreme Court also promulgated specialized Rules of \nPractice and Procedure in Juvenile Courts and Family Court Divisions. These rules reflected the \nnotion that, because children are particularly vulnerable, they need representation throughout all \nstages of the juvenile process. See, e.g., Mo. R. Juv. Pro. 116.01.  \n  In 1997, Missouri created a Youth Advocacy Unit within MSPD to provide the required \nrepresentation for court-involved minors in St. Louis City and St. Louis County. A similar unit, \nbased  in  Kansas  City,  began  serving  several  other  counties  a  few  years  later.  The  Youth \nAdvocacy Unit was staffed by public defenders well trained in adolescent development and other \nissues unique to juvenile prosecutions, including child interrogations and the law governing \ncertifying juveniles as adults. In 2007, the Youth Advocacy Unit was dismantled due to funding \ncuts and previously handled by the Youth Advocacy Units were brought in with MSPD’s general \nadult workload. \n  In 2013, the National Juvenile Defender Center (NJDC) studied Missouri’s juvenile court \nsystem to assess the extent and quality of representation being provided to children in the State. \nThe NJDC report concluded that, after “endur[ing] at least two decades of crushing caseloads \nand inadequate resources to provide its mandated services,” Missouri’s juvenile indigent defense \nsystem is “broken” and is improperly “forced to ration services.” [Doc. 1-4, pp. 128–186 of 290]. \n10 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 10 of 48\n\nThe report concluded that approximately 60 percent of court-involved children in Missouri do \nnot receive appointed counsel. In Fiscal Year 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court reported a total \nof 4,631 new juvenile delinquency and status offense petitions statewide. MSPD attorneys were \nassigned only 1,923 of those cases, and only 24 cases were contracted out to private counsel. The \nreport  also  noted  deficiency  in  those  cases  that  do  include  representation  similar  to  those \ndiscussed above, specifically regarding lack of representation at detention hearings, lack of \ninvestigations, failure to file motions or challenge charges or evidence, and failure to represent \nclients after disposition during probation review or on appeal.  \n  In 2015, following an investigation of the St. Louis County Family Court system, the \nU.S. Department of Justice determined that the constitutional rights of indigent children were \nroutinely being violated in that county’s juvenile delinquency proceedings. The report found that \nthese violations were due at least in part to “the staggering caseload of the sole public defender \nassigned to handle all indigent juvenile delinquency cases” in St. Louis County. In 2014, that \nlone defender handled nearly 400 juvenile cases. The DOJ further found that during the same \nperiod the public defender’s office in St. Louis County appeared to engage in little investigation, \nresolved 277 of the cases but took only three to trial, filed just seven pretrial motions, never \nchallenged probable cause during detention hearings, never called a defense witness other than, \nin one instance, the child respondent, and did not hire a single expert witness. [Doc. 1-4, pp. \n201–259 of 290]. \n  B. Plaintiffs’ Factual Allegations \n    1. Shondel Church  \n  On July 19, 2016, Plaintiff Shondel Church was arrested in Kansas City for allegedly \nstealing  a  generator  and  tool  box  from  the  property  of  his  stepmother.  Mr.  Church  was \n11 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 11 of 48\n\nsubsequently charged with Class C felony theft under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 570.030, which carries a \nmaximum sentence of up to seven years in prison. Following his arrest and transfer to the \nLafayette County Jail, Mr. Church appeared before the court on two occasions without an \nattorney—first, for his arraignment on July 27, 2016, during which his bond was set at $5,000 \ncash or surety, and second, for a subsequent hearing on August 3, 2016. \nMr. Church received no explanation from the court or prosecutor as to how the bond \nprocess worked and he was unable to argue for a bond reduction at his arraignment. Because Mr. \nChurch could not afford to pay his bond, he remained in custody following his arraignment. At \nthat hearing, Mr. Church filled out the form to seek public defender representation and returned \nit to a guard at the Lafayette County Jail that same day. At his hearing on August 3, 2016, while \nhe was still without counsel, Mr. Church was informed that he was eligible for a public defender. \nHis case was then continued again to September 7, 2016. \n On  August  8,  2016,  Assistant  Public  Defender  Matthew  Gass  first  entered  his \nappearance on behalf of Mr. Church. By the time Mr. Church met with his attorney, he had \nalready spent more than 40 days in custody. During their meeting, Mr. Gass indicated that \nLafayette County had a workload that required at least three or four public defenders, but Mr. \nGass was currently the only attorney serving that county.  \nMr. Gass told Mr. Church that, after reviewing Mr. Church’s file, Mr. Gass believed he \ncould win his case, but that fighting the charges could mean Mr. Church would spend another six \nmonths in jail awaiting trial, since Mr. Gass would need additional time to investigate the case \nand prepare for trial. Mr. Gass also told Mr. Church that, instead of going to trial, he could likely \nget a misdemeanor plea deal and Mr. Church could be released and return to his family in a \nmuch shorter amount of time. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Church concluded that entering a \n12 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 12 of 48\n\nplea was the best option for him and his family at the time, as he was the primary breadwinner \nfor his wife and four children.  \nMr. Church also asked his attorney to file a motion to reduce his bond amount. Mr. Gass \nindicated that he would look into a bond reduction, but no such motion was ever filed. As a \nresult, Mr. Church remained incarcerated. Soon after the first meeting between Mr. Gass and Mr. \nChurch, Mr. Gass resigned from the public defender’s office and did not speak with Mr. Church \nbefore resigning. Though Mr. Gass told Mr. Church he would resolve the case before leaving, \nMr. Church never spoke to Mr. Gass again after their first and only meeting. \nOn October 5, 2016, Mr. Church was transported to his next pretrial hearing, at which he \nexpected to see Mr. Gass. Instead, Mr. Church was represented by a new public defender, Max \nMitchell. Mr. Mitchell never entered a formal appearance on behalf of Mr. Church and appeared \nin court on his behalf only at the October 5, 2016 hearing. Mr. Church was not given the \nopportunity  to  discuss  the  case—or  communicate  in  any  meaningful  way  at  all—with  Mr. \nMitchell. Mr. Church did give Mr. Mitchell a written list of the various reasons he believed that \nthe State’s case was without merit. Mr. Mitchell accepted the list from Mr. Church, but did not \ndiscuss it with him. A preliminary hearing was set for November 16, 2016. Mr. Church believed \nhe was going to enter a plea and be released that day. Instead, Mr. Mitchell did not speak to Mr. \nChurch at all, a preliminary hearing was set, and Mr. Church was returned to jail without further \nexplanation from his attorney or the court. \nOn October 11, 2016, Mr. Gass filed a motion to withdraw, and Bradley Taylor entered \nhis appearance as Mr. Church’s newly assigned public defender. Mr. Taylor did not meet with \nMr. Church before his next hearing. Mr. Taylor never visited Mr. Church in jail and spoke to him \nonly briefly in court directly before his hearings. \n13 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 13 of 48\n\nOn November 16, 2016, Mr. Church appeared for his preliminary hearing. Mr. Taylor \nappeared on his behalf at the hearing but spoke to Mr. Church only briefly before the hearing to \ninform him that he would try to talk to Mr. Church’s former attorney (Mr. Gass) about his case. \nAlso at the November 16, 2016 hearing, Mr. Church was able to speak directly to the \njudge while his lawyer was speaking with the prosecutor. Mr. Church informed the judge that he \nhad now spent over 100 days in jail on a charge that he believed should not have been filed. \nAfter Mr. Church’s uncounseled conversation with the judge, the case was transferred to a \ndifferent court and a hearing was set for the following week, on November 21, 2016. \nOn November 21, 2016, after spending five months in pretrial detention, Mr. Church pled \nguilty to misdemeanor theft and was sentenced to two years of probation, with a suspended jail \nterm of six months. While this plea was entered approximately ten weeks after Mr. Church’s \nmeeting with Mr. Gass on September 8, 2016, it is the same deal that Mr. Gass indicated would \nbe available to Mr. Church in September and that Mr. Church thought he was going to enter at \nhis October 5, 2016 hearing. Although Mr. Church has been released, he remains on probation \nwith a six-month suspended jail sentence that will be executed should he violate the terms of his \nprobation. Mr. Church understands his probation terms to include repaying a bill of $2,605.94 to \ncover the cost of his pretrial detention. \n    2. Randall Lee Dalton  \nUntil January 2017, Randall Lee Dalton, a physically disabled, mentally impaired man, \nwas living at a nursing home in Laurie, Missouri. He had been there for several months under the \nsupervision of staff and medical professionals, who provided care and counseling and prescribed \nmedication to ensure Mr. Dalton’s stability and daily functioning. On January 30, 2017, law \nenforcement  officials  entered  Mr.  Dalton’s  nursing  home  facility  to  investigate  the  alleged \n14 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 14 of 48\n\noverdose of another resident. While there, they allegedly found Mr. Dalton in possession of a \nsingle  pill  of  Lorazepam  (Ativan),  arrested  him,  forcibly  removed  him  from  the  facility, \ntransported  him  to  the  Morgan  County  Detention  Center,  and  charged  him  with  felony \npossession of a controlled substance, a D felony. \nIn processing Mr. Dalton, law enforcement learned that Mr. Dalton had an outstanding \nwarrant for failing to appear in court after allegedly passing a bad check for $73.48 at the Jiffy \nStop Food Mart in May 2016. In addition, after his arrest, Mr. Dalton—who had been convicted \nof  misdemeanor  sexual  contact  in  1994  and  initially  granted  a  suspended  imposition  of \nsentence—was further charged on February 1, 2017, with the Class D felony of failing to register \nas a sex offender within his county of residence. \nOn January 31, 2017, although Mr. Dalton had not yet seen a judge or a public defender, \nan  order  was  entered  holding  him  on  $30,000  bond  in  each  of  his  felony  matters.  While \nincarcerated, he was unable to access his medication. On February 7, 2017, an attorney from the \nPublic  Defender’s  Office  ultimately  entered  her  appearance  on  behalf  of  Mr.  Dalton.  She \nappeared in court on his behalf on February 15, 2017, waived his appearance, and reset his case \nuntil March. Mr. Dalton was entirely unaware of this court date. \nFollowing Mr. Dalton’s arrest, his sister tried repeatedly to contact Mr. Dalton’s public \ndefender to share information regarding Mr. Dalton’s limited functioning, ongoing mental health \nissues, and immediate need for medication. After leaving a number of messages that went \nunreturned by Mr. Dalton’s public defender, his sister found a new residential treatment program \non her own that would accept her brother as an alternative to confinement. Mr. Dalton’s sister \nalso contacted the prosecutor’s office directly to advocate on Mr. Dalton’s behalf. \nIn March 2017, Mr. Dalton was finally brought to court for the first time. It was also the \n15 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 15 of 48\n\nfirst time he saw his public defender, who did not speak to him until he was brought into the \ncourt room. Prior to his delivery to court for his March court date, Mr. Dalton had not been \ncontacted by counsel to inform him of the court date. Mr. Dalton’s assigned public defender did \nnot seem familiar with his case, so Mr. Dalton’s sister asked to approach the bench to make a \nbond application for him, which was ultimately joined by the public defender and prosecutor. \nMr. Dalton’s family was able to obtain a furlough on his behalf enabling him to enter a \nresidential treatment facility while his case was pending. However, this placement subsequently \nfell through and he was returned to jail, where he currently awaits resolution of his case. \n    3. Dorian Samuels  \n  Plaintiff Dorian Samuels was arrested in Joplin, Missouri, on or about May 30, 2016, and \ncharged with first-degree assault, exposing him to as much as 30 years in prison if convicted. \nUpon arrest, Mr. Samuels was transported to the Joplin City Jail.  \n  Shortly after arriving at the Joplin City Jail, Mr. Samuels was interviewed, without \ncounsel present, by Detective Justin Ellison of the Joplin Police Department. According to a \npolice report, Detective Ellison read Mr. Samuels his Miranda rights and presented him with a \ncorresponding written waiver form, which Mr. Samuels allegedly signed prior to the interview. \nMr. Samuels was intoxicated at the time the alleged waiver was signed and has no recollection of \nthis initial interview by Detective Ellison. As such, Mr. Samuels was unable to provide a \nvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his right to an attorney or his right to remain silent. \nNevertheless, Mr. Samuels subsequently spoke with Detective Ellison in detail regarding the \nincident that ultimately lead to his arrest. \n  On June 2, 2016, Mr. Samuels appeared before the court by video from the Jasper County \nJail, without counsel, and was informed that his bond had been set at $20,000 cash. Without \n16 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 16 of 48\n\ncounsel, Mr. Samuels was unable to advocate effectively for a reduction in his bond or address \nthe Miranda violation that occurred. Since he was unable to afford bond, Mr. Samuels has \nremained in pretrial detention since his arrest more than a nine months ago at the date of \nPlaintiffs’ filing. \n   Mr. Samuels’ case was initially assigned to Assistant Public Defender Craig Lowe, who \nentered his appearance in the case on June 8, 2016, and was scheduled to represent Mr. Samuels \nat his subsequent preliminary hearing on June 15, 2016. Prior to the June 15 court proceeding, \nMr. Lowe visited Mr. Samuels at the Jasper County Jail and met with him for approximately 10 \nminutes to discuss the hearing set for later that day. Ultimately, the preliminary hearing was \nrescheduled for the following week. Between June 8, 2016, when Mr. Lowe filed his notice of \nappearance, and June 22, 2016, Mr. Samuels’ attorney did not engage in any investigation and \nfailed to file any pretrial motions—including any motion for bond reduction or motion for \ndiscovery—and spoke with Mr. Samuels privately on just one occasion, during his visit to the \njail on June 15, 2016.  \n  On June 22, 2016, Mr. Lowe withdrew from the case at the request of Mr. Samuels, who \nexpressed frustration about his inability to communicate in any meaningful way with Mr. Lowe, \nas well as his lawyer’s failure to begin investigating the case. The court granted Mr. Lowe’s \nrequest to withdraw and continued the proceedings to the following week. \n  Mr. Samuels was subsequently assigned a new public defender, J.D. Hatcher, who he met \nfor the first time in court on June 29, 2016, shortly before his preliminary hearing was scheduled \nto begin. Because Mr. Hatcher had not had time to meet with Mr. Samuels, or otherwise prepare, \nin advance of the hearing, he sought a continuance from the court. That request was denied, \nhowever, and the hearing went forward. \n17 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 17 of 48\n\n  During the hearing, the State called just two witnesses to testify against him: the alleged \nvictim and Detective Ellison. Mr. Hatcher failed to question Detective Ellison regarding the \nnature, scope, and propriety of the interview at the jail. Following the testimony, the court found \nprobable cause to proceed with felony charges against Mr. Samuels and bound his case over to \ncircuit court. \n  On August 1, 2016, Mr. Samuels appeared by video and was re-arraigned—this time with \nhis public defender, Mr. Hatcher, present in the courtroom. He was unable to meet with Mr. \nSamuels at any point between his preliminary hearing and re-arraignment and Mr. Hatcher was \nunprepared to advocate for any bond reduction on his client’s behalf. \n  Since he first met Mr. Hatcher on June 29, 2016, Mr. Samuels saw Mr. Hatcher on only \nfour occasions, all of which were immediately following pretrial court proceedings. None of \nthose meetings lasted more than a few minutes. On at least three of those occasions, Mr. Hatcher \nappeared before the court alone and requested a continuance, while Mr. Samuels remained in a \nholding cell near the courtroom. Mr. Hatcher did not meet with Mr. Samuels prior to any of these \nhearings to discuss his plan for the hearing or request Mr. Samuels’s permission to seek a \ncontinuance. In his most recent motion for continuance, dated January 6, 2017, less than a week \nbefore Mr. Samuels’ scheduled trial date, Mr. Hatcher stated that, since he began representing \nMr. Samuels on June 29, 2016, “the number and effectiveness of attorney-client communications \nhas been limited for multiple reasons that are outside of Mr. Samuels’ control.”  \n  Mr. Hatcher recently resigned from the public defender’s office and now works as a \nprosecutor in Jasper County. On March 1, 2017, Mr. Samuels was appointed another public \ndefender, Richard King, the third attorney assigned to his case since his arrest in May 2016. On \nor about March 6, 2017, Mr. King visited Mr. Samuels in jail and presented Mr. Samuels with a \n18 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 18 of 48\n\nletter  stating  that  he  would  be  unable  to  represent  Mr.  Samuels  due  to  his  overwhelming \nworkload, which includes more than 200 cases. Mr. King indicated that his workload would \nmake it impossible for him to investigate adequately or otherwise prepare the case. As of the \nfiling of this petition, however, Mr. King remains the attorney of record on Mr. Samuels’ case. \nAt the time of Plaintiffs’ filing, Mr. Samuels was currently scheduled for trial on June 1, 2017.  \n    4. Viola Bowman  \n  Plaintiff Viola Bowman was arrested on or about January 6, 2015 in Clay County and \ncharged  with  first-degree  murder  and  armed  criminal  action  for  killing  her  husband.  Ms. \nBowman has maintained her innocence since her arrest. \nOn  January  15,  2015,  Ms.  Bowman  appeared  before  the  court  for  her  arraignment, \nwithout counsel. Her bond had been set at $1,000,000 and, unrepresented, Ms. Bowman was \nunable to advocate for a reduction in her bond amount. Ms. Bowman has remained in jail since \nher arrest over two years ago. \nA week after her arraignment, on January 22, 2015, Ms. Bowman appeared before the \ncourt again, this time with a public defender, and was re-arraigned. The public defender who \nrepresented Ms. Bowman at this proceeding, however, did not continue her representation of Ms. \nBowman beyond this hearing and did not do any substantive work on the case at that stage, \nincluding any investigation or motion practice. \nOn January 28, 2015, Ms. Bowman’s current attorney, Anthony Cardarella, entered his \nappearance in the case. Mr. Cardarella is the District Defender for MSPD’s District 7 office, \nwhich includes Clay County. Despite his responsibilities as District Defender, Mr. Cardarella \ntook Ms. Bowman’s case because none of the public defenders in his office with sufficient \nexperience to handle a first-degree murder case had any more time to devote to the case than did \n19 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 19 of 48\n\nMr. Cardarella. \nMr. Cardarella met with Ms. Bowman for the first time the same week as her next \nhearing, which was on February 19, 2015, more than one month after her arrest. The meeting \nlasted approximately ten minutes. Since taking over the case, other responsibilities, including \nother  cases,  have  prevented  Mr.  Cardarella  from  remaining  in  consistent  contact  with  Ms. \nBowman. Over the course of Ms. Bowman’s pretrial detention, she has met with her attorney an \naverage of once every two months for approximately 10-15 minutes per meeting. Since January \n2015, the public defender’s office has asked the court to continue Ms. Bowman’s case on at least \n10 occasions, and to continue the scheduled trial date twice.  \nMs. Bowman’s trial was first set for June 20, 2016. On May 11, 2016, pursuant to Mr. \nCardarella’s request, the trial was continued to January 23, 2017. The continuance was requested \nin large part due to Mr. Cardarella’s other administrative and managerial job responsibilities. On \nSeptember 29, 2016, the trial was again continued at Mr. Cardarella’s request to June 5, 2017. At \nthe time of Plaintiffs’ filing, Ms. Bowman has been incarcerated in the Clay County jail for over \n800 days pretrial.  \n    5. Brian Richman  \n  Plaintiff Brian Richman has been incarcerated at the Christian County Detention Center \nsince his arrest on or about June 26, 2016, on a series of felony drug charges exposing him to \nmany years in prison. Mr. Richman’s bond was set at over $100,000. Because he was unable to \nafford bond, Mr. Richman has remained in pretrial detention since his arrest more than eight \nmonths ago as of the date of Plaintiffs’ filing.  \nMr. Richman’s public defender has never visited him at the Christian County Detention \nCenter. There is not even a room for MSPD public defenders to conduct attorney-client visits at \n20 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 20 of 48\n\nthe Christian County Detention Center. Rather, the jail’s general practice is to shackle defendants \nto  a  rail  in  a  public  area  and  allow  attorneys  to  briefly  stand  and  talk  with  clients  there, \nsurrounded by jail officials and other detainees. Christian County’s public defenders have not \nattempted to challenge the jail’s policy or arrange for an alternative venue. \nThe first time Mr. Richman saw his assigned public defender was in court, on or about \nJune  28,  2016,  when  his  attorney  waived  Mr.  Richman’s  preliminary  hearing  without \nmeaningfully consulting with Mr. Richman. To date, no preliminary hearing has been held in Mr. \nRichman’s Christian County cases, and no indictment has been delivered by a grand jury to \nsupport the charges against Mr. Richman.  \nSince July 14, 2016, Mr. Richman has only seen his attorney on a handful of occasions. \nThese  visits  have  always  occurred  at  the  courthouse,  involved  rushed  conversations,  and \ntranspired in a public courtroom where other persons were present and confidentiality was not \nassured. On some occasions, hearings in Mr. Richman’s case have occurred in front of the judge \nwithout  Mr.  Richman  present.  Mr.  Richman’s  public  defender  unilaterally  waived  Mr. \nRichman’s constitutional right to appear on his own behalf at those hearings and participated in \nthem without obtaining Mr. Richman’s consent to do so. \nMr. Richman has found it to be nearly impossible to get in contact with his public \ndefender. Given his inability to communicate consistently and confidentially with his attorney, as \nwell as the fact that his public defender has neither conducted any meaningful investigation on \nhis case nor filed critical motions on his behalf, Mr. Richman has felt the need over the last \nseveral months to write letters to the judge presiding over his case. He has done so both to \nadvocate for himself in the context of his cases and to make the court aware of the conditions at \nthe Christian County Detention Center. \n21 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 21 of 48\n\n  C. Plaintiffs’ Claims for Relief \nPlaintiffs seek prospective relief on behalf of themselves and “on behalf of all indigent \npersons who are now, or who will be during the pendency of this litigation, under formal charge \nbefore a state court in Missouri of having committed any offense, the penalty for which includes \nthe possibility of confinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or detention (regardless of whether \nactually imposed), and who are eligible to be represented by” the MSPD.  \nPlaintiffs’  Class  Action  Petition  for  Injunctive  and  Declaratory  Relief,  [Doc.  1-2], \nincludes five claims for relief, as follows: (I) Violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the U.S. Constitution; (II) Violation of Article 1, Section 18(a) of the Missouri Constitution; \n(III) Violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; (IV) \nViolation of Article 1, Section 10 of the Missouri Constitution; and (V) Violation of Missouri \nCriminal and Juvenile Codes.  \nAs relevant to this Motion,3 Plaintiffs ask this Court to: “Declare that Defendants are \nobligated to provide constitutionally adequate representation to indigent criminal defendants and \njuvenile respondents, including at their initial appearances;” “Declare that the constitutional and \nstatutory rights of Missouri’s indigent criminal defendants and juvenile respondents are currently \nbeing violated by Defendants on an ongoing basis;” “Enjoin Defendants from continuing to \nviolate the rights of indigent defendants by providing constitutionally deficient representation;” \nand “Enter an injunction that requires Defendants to propose and implement, subject to this \nCourt’s approval and monitoring, a plan to ensure that all indigent criminal defendants and \njuvenile respondents in the State of Missouri are provided with constitutionally adequate legal \nrepresentation.” [Doc. 1-2, p. 52].  \nOn July 5, 2017, the Court held oral argument on Defendants’ Motions. The certified \n                                                            \n3   Plaintiffs also seek class certification. [Doc. 52]. That motion is currently pending. \n22 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 22 of 48\n\ntranscript is in the record, [Doc. 64].  \n \nII.  Discussion \nDefendants move to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction and under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted. Federal courts consider motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction under the same standard. Vankempen v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., \n923 F. Supp. 146 (E.D. Mo. 1996). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” \nZink v. Lombardi, 783 F.3d 1089, 1098 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009)). “A complaint must do more than allege labels and conclusions or a formulaic \nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action.” Zink, 783 F.3d at 1098 (quotations omitted). \nA. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss under 12(b)(1) \n \nDefendants moves to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction. Defendants argue three distinguishable bases for the motion: (1) the doctrine of \nsovereign immunity bar all claims against the State of Missouri and Governor Greitens; (2) \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable because it is speculative whether they will sustain future \ncognizable injuries; and (3) Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims because relief against \nDefendants would not redress their alleged injuries. [Doc. 19].  \n   1. Sovereign Immunity  \nSovereign immunity bars actions against a state or its agencies unless the state waives its \nimmunity, or it is abrogated by Congress. Will v. Michigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 \n(1989).  Both  Parties  distinguish  between  claims  against  Missouri  and  those  against  Gov. \n23 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 23 of 48\n\nGreitens in his official capacity. The State of Missouri can only be sued if it or Congress has \nabrogated sovereign immunity for claims of this nature. Conversely, exceptions may apply that \nallow a suit to proceed against state officials—including Gov. Greitens—even in the absence of \nabrogation.  \n      a. Missouri  \n“[A]n unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own \ncitizens as well as by citizens of another state.” Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, \n465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984) (internal quotation omitted). The U.S. Supreme Court has adopted a \nstrict standard to evaluate claims that Congress or a respective state has abrogated sovereign \nimmunity. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 305–06 (1990). “The Court \nwill give effect to a State’s waiver of . . . immunity only where stated by the most express \nlanguage or by such overwhelming implication from the text as will leave no room for any other \nreasonable construction.” Id. \nMissouri argues it has not consented to Plaintiffs’ suit. [Doc. 19, pp. 1–3]. If sovereign \nimmunity would have barred claims against the State in state court, then the State may still \ninvoke it in federal court after removal. See, e.g., Bergemann v. Rhode Island Dep’t of Envt’l \nMgmt., 665 F.3d 336, 342 (1st Cir. 2011); Stewart v. North Carolina, 393 F.3d 484, 489-90 (4th \nCir. 2005). Conversely, if a State has waived its immunity for state-law claims in state court, it \nordinarily cannot invoke immunity against those claims after removing the case to federal court. \nLapides v. Bd. of Regents, 535 U.S. 613, 617 (2002). \nPlaintiffs contend the claims would not be barred against Missouri in state court. In 1977, \nthe Missouri Supreme Court prospectively abrogated the common law doctrine of sovereign \nimmunity for tort actions.  Jones v. State Highway Comm’n, 557 S.W.2d 225 (Mo. banc 1977). \n24 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 24 of 48\n\nIn response, the Missouri Legislature enacted Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 537.600–.650 (1978), which \nreinstated portions of the doctrine. The issue here is whether, considering Jones and Mo. Rev. \nStat. § 537.600, Missouri has abrogated sovereign immunity for equitable relief. Defendants \nmaintain Mo. Rev. Stat. § 537.600 applies only to claims for damages and does not affect \ncommon law sovereign immunity, which Missouri argues bars claims even for injunctive relief. \nPlaintiffs contend “Missouri has no sovereign immunity under state law for claims seeking \nequitable relief, rather than damages.” [Doc. 44, pp. 2–3].4 \nPlaintiffs primarily rely on Wyman v. Mo. Dep’t of Mental Health, 376 S.W.3d 16, 23-24 \n(Mo. Ct. App. 2012). In Wyman, state employees filed suit in Missouri state court against the \nMissouri  Department  of  Mental  Health  and  one  state  official  alleging  that  the  defendants \nretaliated  against  the  plaintiffs  for  exercising  their  rights  under  Missouri’s  Workers’ \nCompensation  Law.  The  court  found  that  plaintiffs’  claims  for  damages  were  barred,  but \nconcluded “that sovereign immunity does not necessarily bar a claim for injunctive relief which \nseeks to reverse a state agency’s prior violation of its statutory obligations, or to prevent future \nviolations.” Id.  \nDefendants  argue  Wyman  is  inapplicable  because  “[t]he  sole  basis  on  which  the \n[defendant] moved for dismissal of the injunction claim was the sovereign immunity recognized \nin § 537.600.” [Doc. 49, p. 5] (citing Wyman, 376 S.W.3d at 23). Defendants contend Wyman \ndoes not support Plaintiffs’ argument that Missouri abrogated sovereign immunity from suits \n                                                            \n4   As Plaintiffs note, “many other jurisdictions hold that sovereign immunity does not apply when \nconstitutional violations are alleged, as a contrary rule would render constitutional rights meaningless.” \nTucker v. State, 394 P.3d 54, 61 (Idaho 2017) (citing Columbia Air Servs., Inc. v. Conn. Dep’t of Transp., \n293 Conn. 342, 977 A.2d 636, 645 (2009); Fla. Dep’t of Revenue v. Kuhnlein, 646 So.2d 717, 721 (Fla. \n1994); Corum v. Univ. of N.C. Through Bd. of Governors, 330 N.C. 761, 413 S.E.2d 276, 292 (1992); \nAshton v. Brown, 339 Md. 70, 660 A.2d 447, 463 (Md. Ct. App. 1995); Kilgo v. Ga. Dep’t of Corrs., 202 \nGa.App. 50, 413 S.E.2d 507, 508 (1991)). To the Court’s knowledge, Missouri has not adopted such a \npolicy. \n25 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 25 of 48\n\nseeking equitable relief generally, but rather recognized the legislature’s abrogation only within \nthe narrow context of Mo. Rev. Stat.  § 537.600. Id.  \nDuring oral argument, Defendants argued Mo. Rev. Stat. § 537.600 “doesn’t define the \nmetes  and  bounds  of  Missouri’s  sovereign  immunity  doctrine,”  which  “was  established  at \ncommon law.” [Doc. 64, p. 9]. Defendants contend that, when the legislature enacted § 537.600, \nit “overrule[d], basically, the [Missouri] Supreme Court . . . it only overruled what the court had \ndone, and the only thing the court had done was to abrogate sovereign immunity with respect to \ntort damages, but it didn’t abrogate any other sovereign immunity that existed at common law. \nAnd since immunity from suit for injunctive relief did exist at common law, it continues to exist \ntoday.” Id. at 11.  \nHowever, as Plaintiffs argue, Missouri “made the same arguments to the Missouri Court \nof Appeals in Wyman, and the Wyman court correctly rejected them.” Id. at 26. There, as here, \nMissouri argued that a claim for injunctive relief “is contrary to the fundamental principle of \nsovereign immunity and the State’s right to determine what types of lawsuits may be brought \nagainst the State. Fundamentally, sovereign immunity concerns the State’s ability to consent or \nrefuse to consent to sue or be sued.” Brief for Appellee-Respondant, Wyman v. Mo. Dep’t of \nMental Health, No. WD74062, 2011 MO App. Ct. Briefs (Dec. 27, 2011) [Doc. 44-3, p. 19]. \nNevertheless, the Missouri Court of Appeals explained that as long as the State violates some \n“duty and obligation,” a plaintiff may seek equitable relief against the State, “even though the \nState may not be subject to the ‘civil action for damages.’” Wyman, 376 S.W.3d at 24.  \nDefendants also argue that, under Carson v. Sullivan, 223 S.W. 571 (Mo. banc 1920), the \nState itself cannot be enjoined. [Doc. 49, p. 6]; [Doc. 64, pp. 9]. However, the defendants in \nCarson were Missouri state officers, not the state itself, and the Missouri Supreme Court upheld \n26 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 26 of 48\n\nthe availability of an injunction against them. Thus, as Plaintiffs argue, “the Carson court never \n[directly] addressed the scope of the State’s sovereign immunity. The only case that does is \nWyman, and Wyman holds there is no sovereign immunity.”  [Doc. 64, p. 26].  \nDefendants also cite to State ex rel. Kansas City Symphony v. State, 311 S.W.3d 272 \n(Mo. App. W.D. 2010) and Goines v. Department of Social Services, 364 S.W.3d 684 (Mo. App. \nW.D. 2012) for support. However, in Kansas City Symphony, the plaintiffs sought a declaration \nthat the State is required, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. § 143.183.5, to provide tax revenue funding \nand sought orders compelling the State and the Legislature to comply with the statute. Although \nthe court found that a declaratory judgment was barred by sovereign immunity, it did so by \nanalyzing § 143.183.5, which has no applicability here. Goines is likewise distinguishable; there, \nthe suit was brought under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 207.020, which relates to the Missouri Family \nSupport and Children’s Divisions. The court there found that sovereign immunity had been \nwaived by statute.  \nConversely, Plaintiffs cite cases in which the Missouri Supreme Court upheld injunctions \nagainst the State itself. [Doc. 64, p. 27] (citing Weinschenk v. State, 203 S.W.3d 201, 205 (Mo. \n2006) (affirming the trial court’s judgment enjoining enforcement of a voter–ID requirement); \nBrooks v. State, 128 S.W.3d 844, 847 (Mo. 2004), as modified on denial of reh’g (Mar. 30, 2004) \n(entering judgment enjoining the state of Missouri from enforcing a conceal-carry law because it \nconstituted “an unfunded mandate” in certain counties).  \nUnder Missouri law, the State is not entitled to sovereign immunity in this suit.  \n      b. Gov. Greitens  \nAlthough the State cannot be sued without its consent, “the failure of officials to perform \na duty [is not an act] of the state and proceedings seeking injunctive or other proper relief under \n27 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 27 of 48\n\nappropriate facts are considered not to be suits against the state within the principles of the \nimmunity of the sovereign from suit.” Kleban v. Morris, 363 Mo. 7, 16, 247 S.W.2d 832, 837 \n(1952). The doctrine of sovereign immunity “does not prohibit certain suits seeking declaratory \nand  injunctive  relief  against  state  officers.” Dakota,  Minn.  &  Eastern  R.R.  Corp.  v.  South \nDakota, 362 F.3d 512, 516 (8th Cir. 2004) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Under Ex \nparte Young and its progeny, “a private party may seek prospective injunctive relief in federal \ncourt against a state official, even if the state is otherwise protected by Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity.” Randolph v. Rodgers, 253 F.3d 342, 345 (8th Cir. 2001). A court “need only conduct \na ‘straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal \nlaw and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’” Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. \nComm'n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002) (quoting Coeur d'Alene, 521 U.S. at 296); see also \nMo. Child Care Ass'n v. Cross, 294 F.3d 1034, 1042 (8th Cir. 2002).  \nFor  Ex  Parte  Young  to  apply,  however,  the  named  state  official  “must  have  some \nconnection with the enforcement” of the challenged statute. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 157; see \nalso  Digital  Recognition  Network,  Inc.  v.  Hutchinson,  803  F.3d  952,  960  (8th  Cir.  2015). \nBecause  Plaintiffs  have  sued  Governor  Greitens  only  for  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief, \nwhether sovereign immunity bars their claims depends on whether the Governor has a sufficient \n“connection with” the challenged conduct to bring him within Ex Parte Young. Defendants argue \n“Governor Greitens lacks a sufficient connection to the challenged conduct,” [Doc. 19, p. 5], and \nthus contend sovereign immunity bars claims against him.  \nTo state a sufficient connection, the official “does not need to be primary authority to \nenforce the challenged law,” and the official need not “have the full power to redress a plaintiff’s \ninjury in order to have ‘some connection’ with the challenged law.” 281 Care Comm. v. Arneson, \n28 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 28 of 48\n\n638 F.3d 621, 632-33 (8th Cir. 2011). Where the law involved is an affirmative constitutional \nobligation of the State itself, a state official is a proper defendant under Ex parte Young if he has \na responsibility to “give[] effect” to the obligation. L.A. Cty. Bar Ass’n v. Eu, 979 F.2d 697, 704 \n(9th Cir. 1992). \nIn Luckey v. Harris, the Eleventh Circuit allowed indigent defendants bringing a Sixth \nAmendment claim to sue the governor of Georgia for prospective equitable relief. 860 F.2d \n1012, 1016 (11th Cir. 1988). The Eleventh Circuit held that the governor was a proper defendant \nbecause  “[a]ccording  to  the  Georgia  constitution,  the  governor  is  responsible  for  law \nenforcement in that state and is charged with executing the laws faithfully,” “has the residual \npower to commence criminal prosecutions,” and “has the final authority to direct the Attorney \nGeneral to ‘institute and prosecute’ on behalf of the state.” Id. at 1016 (citations omitted). \nDefendants cite a number of cases to support the argument that Governor Greitens does \nnot have a sufficient connection to the MSPD system to fall within Ex Parte Young. Each case is \neasily distinguishable. In McCoy v. Carter-Jones Timber Co., 352 F. App’x 119 (8th Cir. 2009), \nthe appellants sought redress from decisions from the Arkansas judicial branch; the Governor \ncould not effect the injunctive relief requested because he had no power to direct the courts to \nreverse their decisions or hold them in abeyance. In Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. \n2001), the challenged statute made abortion providers liable to patients in tort for any damage \noccasioned  by  abortions.  The  Fifth  Circuit  found  that  the  Governor  had  no  enforcement \nmechanism for this statute, which did not implicate a public duty undertaken on behalf of the \nstatute, but a private right of action in tort. In Gras v. Stevens, 415 F. Supp. 1148, 1151-52 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1976), the court found Ex Parte Young inapplicable because “[t]he Attorney General \nhas no interest in the outcome of a divorce suit and no duty to enforce any order made in it.” \n29 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 29 of 48\n\n(emphasis added). Although D.G. ex rel. Stricklin v. Henry, 591 F. Supp.2d 1186, 1190 (N.D. \nOkla. 2008), rejected the notion that the Governor could be a proper defendant “simply because \nhe is the head of the executive branch,” that is not all that Plaintiffs allege.  \nGovernor Greitens “is responsible for law enforcement . . . and is charged with executing \nthe laws faithfully,” “has the residual power to commence criminal prosecutions,” and “has the \nfinal authority to direct the Attorney General to ‘institute and prosecute’ on behalf of the state.” \nMo. Const. art. IV, §§1-2; Mo. Rev. Stat. § 27.030. Governor Greitens’s predecessor, Governor \nNixon, affirmatively used his executive authority to withhold roughly $7 million in funding \nallocated by the Missouri Legislature to the MSPD, thereby demonstrating an even more direct \n“connection” to the challenged conduct. [Doc. 1-2, ¶¶ 42-43]. Governor Greitens has since \nupheld Governor Nixon’s withholding of funds allocated to the MSPD. Id. ¶ 44; [Doc. 17 ¶ 45]. \nFinally, the Governor appoints all seven members of the MSPD Commission. See Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 600.015(1); Eu, 979 F.2d at 704 (holding California governor’s power to appoint judges was a \nsufficient “connection” to the challenged statute limiting the number of judges in Los Angeles \nCounty). \nPlaintiffs have alleged a sufficient connection regarding Gov. Greitens to place him \nsquarely within Ex Parte Young. As a result, claims against Gov. Greitens are not barred by \nsovereign immunity.  \n    2. Standing  \n“[I]f  a  plaintiff  lacks  standing,  the  district  court  has  no  subject  matter  jurisdiction. \nTherefore, a standing argument implicates Rule 12(b)(1).” Faibisch v. U. of Minnesota, 304 F.3d \n797, 801 (8th Cir. 2002) (internal citation omitted). The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears \nthe burden of establishing standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \n30 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 30 of 48\n\nThe burden corresponds with the degree of evidence required at the relevant stage of litigation. \nId. “At the pleading stage . . . general factual allegations of injury . . . may suffice.” Id.; Iowa \nLeague of Cities v. E.P.A., 711 F.3d 844, 869 (8th Cir. 2013).   \nThe determination of whether a particular plaintiff has standing is a two-part inquiry \ninvolving constitutional and prudential standing considerations. First, to demonstrate Article III \nstanding, a plaintiff must show: (1) he has “suffered an injury-in-fact”; (2) the injury is “fairly .  . \n. trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant”; and (3) it is “likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Balogh v. Lombardi, 816 \nF.3d 536, 541 (8th Cir. 2016) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 \n(1992)).  Second,  in  order  to  meet  the  prudential  limitations  on  standing,  a  plaintiff  must \nordinarily “assert his own legal interests rather than those of third parties.” Gladstone Realtors v. \nVill. of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100 (1979). \nDefendants argue Plaintiffs do not face an actual and imminent threat of sustaining a \nconcrete and particularized injury in fact and that relief against defendants would not redress any \nplaintiffs’ alleged injuries.  \n   a. Injury-in-fact \nTo obtain the prospective relief sought, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are “likely \nto suffer future injury from” the conduct that he seeks to have enjoined or declared unlawful. \nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983). The U.S. Supreme Court has “repeatedly \nreiterated that ‘threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact,’ and \nthat ‘allegations of possible future injury’ are not sufficient.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 \nS. Ct. 1138, 1147 (2013) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990)). \n      i. Plaintiff Church  \n31 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 31 of 48\n\nDefendants  first  argue  Plaintiff  Church—who  ultimately  pled  guilty  to  the  charges \nbrought against him—lacks standing because he does not face any pending criminal prosecution \nand is no longer subject to any ongoing deprivation of the right to effective counsel. [Doc. 19, p. \n7]. Plaintiff Church states he has standing because he “seeks to vindicate his right to counsel at \nany future proceeding seeking to revoke his probation and impose his suspended six-month \nsentence.” [Doc. 44, p. 18].  \nAny allegations surrounding Church’s prosecution and plea cannot provide injury-in-fact \nstanding for the prospective relief sought. See O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974) \n(“Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding \ninjunctive relief . . . .”); Adarand Constrs., Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 210-11 (1995) (“[T]he \nfact of past injury . . . does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that [the plaintiff] \nwould again suffer similar injury in the future.”) (quotation omitted). Likewise, the Court cannot \npresume Mr. Church will face another prosecution in the future. See Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. \n478, 482-83 (1982).  \nPlaintiffs distinguish Murphy from Mr. Church’s factual allegations. In Murphy, the U.S. \nSupreme Court found that the petitioner’s controversy over pretrial bail was moot once he was \nconvicted. In analyzing whether the case was “capable of repetition but evading review,” the \nSupreme Court noted: \nAll we know from the record is that Hunt has been convicted on three separate \noffenses and that his counsel was willing to stipulate that, for the purposes of \nHunt’s eligibility for bail, the proof of guilt was evident and the presumption \ngreat. Based on these two facts, we cannot say that there exists a “reasonable \nexpectation” or “demonstrated probability” that Hunt will ever again be in this \nposition. There is no reason to expect that all three of Hunt’s convictions will be \noverturned on appeal. \n \nId. at 483. In this case, “[t]he conditions of Mr. Church’s probation prohibit him from drinking \n32 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 32 of 48\n\nalcohol or associating with any person convicted of a felony or misdemeanor, and require him to \npay $200 per month, in restitution, $30 per month for the privilege of being supervised on \nprobation,  and  ‘court  costs,’  which  Mr.  Church  understands  to  include  repaying  a  bill  of \n$2,605.94 to cover the cost of his more than four months of pretrial detention.” [Doc. 44, p. 19] \n(citing [Doc. 1-2]). Thus, Plaintiffs argue “[i]n light of the trial court’s discretion to revoke Mr. \nChurch’s probation, the draconian conditions of his probation, and Mr. Church’s inability to pay \nthe massive fines associated with probation, Mr. Church has plausibly alleged a ‘credible threat’ \nof future imprisonment that is ‘sufficiently imminent’ to satisfy standing.” Id.    \n  For support, Plaintiffs cite Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2342 \n(2014). There, the U.S. Supreme Court noted that “[a]n allegation of future injury may suffice if \nthe threatened injury is ‘certainly impending,’ or there is a ‘substantial risk’ that the harm will \noccur.” Id. (citation omitted). However, the U.S. Supreme Court has “repeatedly reiterated that \n‘threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact,’ and that ‘allegations \nof possible future injury’ are not sufficient.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 \n(2013) (citation omitted).  \n  In Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 137 (1967), and again in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. \n778, 781 (1973), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a probationer is entitled to be represented by \nappointed counsel at a proceeding to revoke a defendant’s probation and impose a criminal \nsentence. Presently, however, no such proceeding is underway and the Court cannot assume \nPlaintiff Church will violate the terms of his probation, even considering the payments required \nand his alleged inability to pay them. Plaintiffs have not cited any authority for the argument that \npotential or even probable probation violations are “certainly impending” to constitute injury in \nfact. As a result, Plaintiff Church lacks standing to bring this suit.   \n33 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 33 of 48\n\n      ii. Plaintiffs Dalton, Samuels, Bowman, and Richman \nDefendants separately argue the remaining Plaintiffs lack standing despite the fact that \ntheir prosecutions are ongoing. The crux of Defendants’ argument is any Sixth Amendment \nclaim requires a conviction to be justiciable. As a result, besides Plaintiff Church, Defendants \nargue Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not yet been found guilty or pled guilty.  \nDefendants are correct that there can be no Sixth Amendment claim without prejudice. \nLockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369 n.2 (1993). That does not, however, support Defendants’ \nrepeated  claim  that  “[a]  person  claiming  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  does  not  sustain \n‘prejudice’ unless she is found guilty or pleads guilty.” [Doc. 19, p. 10]; [Doc. 49, pp. 8–9] (“As \nthe State Defendants explained, the Sixth Amendment and its Missouri equivalent simply do not \nprotect  against  harms  from  deficient  legal  representation  unless  a  defendant  has  been \nconvicted.”). That is incorrect. In fact, it is “‘well settled’ that the Sixth Amendment right to \ncounsel is broader than the question of whether a court must retrospectively set aside a judgment \ndue to ineffective assistance of counsel.” State ex rel. Mo. Pub. Def. Comm’n v. Waters, 370 \nS.W.3d 592, 607 (Mo. banc 2012). The Missouri Supreme Court noted that the right to counsel \n“is affirmative and prospective.” Id.  \nDefendants  seem  to  argue  that  Plaintiffs  cannot  plausibly  allege  Sixth  Amendment \nviolations and, moreover, cannot have standing to sue unless they are proven or plead guilty \nunder the framework set out in Strickland v. Washington,  466  U.S.  668  (1984).  However, \nStrickland authorizes relief in individual criminal cases by, inter alia, allowing courts to vacate \nconvictions due to counsel’s ineffective assistance. The U.S. Supreme Court in Strickland was \nvery clear about the individualized analysis it was creating. Id. at 690. “Strickland, therefore, is \ninapplicable when systemic deficiencies in the provision of public defense are at issue.” Tucker \n34 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 34 of 48\n\nv. State, 394 P.3d 54, 62 (Idaho 2017). As the Missouri Supreme Court outlined:  \n[T]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel is broader than the question of whether a \ncourt must retrospectively set aside a judgment due to ineffective assistance of \ncounsel. The constitutional right to effective counsel applies to all critical stages \nof the proceeding; it is a prospective right to have counsel’s advice during the \nproceeding and is not merely a retrospective right to have a verdict or plea set \naside  if  one  can  prove  that  the  absence  of  competent  counsel  affected  the \nproceeding.  \n \nWaters, 370 S.W.3d at 608 (citations omitted). \nAs in Tucker, the issues raised in Plaintiffs’ Petition do not implicate Strickland. There, \nthe Idaho Supreme Court explained:  \nAppellants  alleged  systemic,  statewide  deficiencies  plaguing  Idaho’s  public \ndefense  system.  Appellants  seek  to  vindicate  their  fundamental  right  to \nconstitutionally adequate public defense at the State’s expense, as required under \nthe Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, Section 13 of the \nIdaho Constitution. They have not asked for any relief in their individual criminal \ncases. Rather, they seek to effect systemic reform. Their allegations find support \nin both Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342, 83 S.Ct. 792, 795, 9 L.Ed.2d \n799, 803–04 (1963), and State v. Montroy, 37 Idaho 684, 690, 217 P. 611, 614 \n(1923),  which  make  clear  that  it  is  the  State’s  obligation  to  provide \nconstitutionally  adequate  public  defense  at  critical  stages  of  the  prosecution. \nAlleging systemic inadequacies in a public defense system results in actual or \nconstructive denials of counsel at critical stages of the prosecution suffices to \nshow  an  injury  in  fact  to  establish  standing  in  a  suit  for  deprivation  of \nconstitutional rights.  \n \nTucker, 394 P.3d at 62–63.  The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also confronted this \nissue and found:  \nThe question that we confront today is whether a cause of action exists entitling a \nclass of indigent criminal defendants to allege prospective, systemic violations of \nthe right to counsel due to underfunding, and to seek and obtain an injunction \nforcing  a  county  to  provide  adequate  funding  to  a  public  defender’s  office. \nPursuant to Gideon and its progeny, and because remedies for Sixth Amendment \nviolations need not await conviction and sentencing, we hold that such a cause of \naction exists, so long as the class action plaintiffs demonstrate ‘the likelihood of \nsubstantial and immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies at \nlaw.’ \n \nKuren v. Luzerne Cty., 146 A.3d 715, 718 (Pa. 2016) (quoting O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, \n35 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 35 of 48\n\n502 (1974). See also Hurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217, 227 (N.Y. 2010) (“We have \nconsistently held that enforcement of a clear constitutional or statutory mandate is the proper \nwork of the courts, and it would be odd if we made an exception in the case of a mandate as \nwell-established and as essential to our institutional integrity as the one requiring the State to \nprovide  legal  representation  to  indigent  criminal  defendants  at  all  critical  stages  of  the \nproceedings against them.”) (internal citations omitted). \n  In Hurrell-Harring, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a statement of interest pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 517. U.S. Statement of Interest, Case No. 8866-07. The United States explained \nthe cognizable obstacles to indigent defense outside of the Strickland context: \nSubstantial  structural  limitations  force  even  otherwise  competent  and  well-\nintentioned public defenders into a position where they are, in effect, a lawyer in \nname  only.  Such  limitations  essentially  require  counsel  to  represent  clients \nwithout being able to fulfill their basic obligations to prepare a defense, including \ninvestigating the facts of the case, interviewing witnesses, securing discovery, \nengaging in motions practice, identifying experts when necessary, and subjecting \nthe evidence to adversarial testing. \n \nId. at 11–12. Collecting cases, the United States noted that “[t]he absence of traditional markers \nof representation has led courts to find non-representation in violation of the Sixth Amendment.” \nId. at 13 (citing Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, 989 F.Supp.2d 1122, 1137 (W.D. Wash. 2013); \nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984); Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940); Pub. \nDefender v. State, 115 So. 3d 261 (Fla. 2013); State v. Citizen, 898 So. 2d 325 (La. 2005); State \nv. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780 (La. 1993)).    \nIn addition to the allegations of systemic constitutional inadequacy addressed by the \nTucker, Kuren, and Hurrell-Harring courts, Plaintiffs Dalton, Samuels, Bowman, and Richman \nset forth two specific arguments regarding their respective injuries, either of which would be \nsufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of Article III standing. First, “Plaintiffs allege that \n36 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 36 of 48\n\nthey have waited longer than necessary for acquittal or trial, resulting in increased anxiety, the \ncollateral consequences that attend the pendency of a criminal case, and—the paradigmatic \nArticle III injury—loss of liberty in the form of prolonged pretrial detention.” [Doc. 44, p. 10] \n(citing Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 532-33 (1972) (detailing injuries caused by pretrial \ndelay)).  Second,  “Plaintiffs  have  alleged  that,  due  to  deficient  counsel,  they  are  unable  to \n‘compete on an equal footing’ in the criminal process, regardless of whether they in fact lose at \ntrial.” [Doc. 44, p. 11] (citing Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of \nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993)).  \n  Therefore, Plaintiffs Dalton, Samuels, Bowman, and Richman have satisfied the injury-\nin-fact prong of the Court’s standing inquiry.  \n    b. Redressability  \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that his or her “injury will likely \nbe redressed by a favorable decision.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997). Defendants \ncontend  “Plaintiffs  also  lack  standing  to  assert  any  of  their  claims,  because  relief  against \nDefendants would not redress their alleged injuries.” [Doc. 19, p. 13]. Specifically, “individual \nDefendants in this case lack legal authority to unilaterally increase the funding available to the \npublic-defender  system  without  the  concurrence  of  the  Missouri  General  Assembly.”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs “need not show that a favorable decision will ‘ensure’ redress; it is enough that a \ndecision is likely to result in redress.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \nPlaintiffs argue “the Governor himself can, without the participation of the legislature, \nrectify or exacerbate some portion of Plaintiffs’ constitutional deprivation.” [Doc. 44, p. 20]. \nGovernor Greitens and his predecessor each withheld funds appropriated by the legislature for \nthe MSPD. Although Defendants concede the Court could enjoin the Governor from withholding \n37 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 37 of 48\n\nany  funds—contingent  on  Defendants’  legislative  immunity  arguments  addressed  below—\nPlaintiffs plead “it would take an additional $20 million or more per year for MSPD to meet the \nconstitutional floor of providing minimally adequate representation to indigent defendants.” \n[Doc. 1-2 § 46]. Therefore, even if the Court issued an injunction prohibiting the Governor from \nwithholding funds, Defendants argue the Court could not mandate an “additional $20 million or \nmore per year” which Plaintiffs’ cite as the funding required. [Doc. 49, p. 11].  \nHowever, Plaintiffs do not ask the Court to order Governor Greitens to affirmatively \nintroduce legislation or grant specific funding requests. Plaintiffs ask this Court to: “Declare that \nDefendants are obligated to provide constitutionally adequate representation to indigent criminal \ndefendants and juvenile respondents, including at their initial appearances;” “Declare that the \nconstitutional  and  statutory  rights  of  Missouri’s  indigent  criminal  defendants  and  juvenile \nrespondents  are  currently  being  violated  by  Defendants  on  an  ongoing  basis;”  “Enjoin \nDefendants  from  continuing  to  violate  the  rights  of  indigent  defendants  by  providing \nconstitutionally deficient representation;” and “Enter an injunction that requires Defendants to \npropose and implement, subject to this Court’s approval and monitoring, a plan to ensure that all \nindigent criminal defendants and juvenile respondents in the State of Missouri are provided with \nconstitutionally  adequate  legal  representation.”  [Doc.  1-2,  p.  52].  Such  declarations  and \ninjunctions may have a “substantial ancillary effect on the state treasury,” but that does not \nprohibit the Court from granting Plaintiffs’ requested relief. Randolf v. Rogers, 253 F.3d 342, \n348 (8th Cir. 2001).  \nNothing in Plaintiffs’ Petition requests the Court enter an injunction forcing the Governor \nto  direct  specific  funds,  but  rather  asks  the  Court  to  “[e]nter  an  injunction  that  requires \nDefendants to propose and implement, subject to this Court’s approval and monitoring, a plan to \n38 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 38 of 48\n\nensure that all indigent criminal defendants and juvenile respondents in the State of Missouri are \nprovided  with  constitutionally  adequate  legal  representation.”  [Doc.  1-2,  p.  52].  Such  an \ninjunction is likely to redress Plaintiffs’ claims and Plaintiffs Dalton, Samuels, Bowman, and \nRichman have standing to sue.  \nB. Defendants’ Motion under Rule 12(b)(6)  \nDefendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Petition under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6), \narguing (1) absolute legislative immunity bars all claims against Gov. Greitens; (2) Plaintiffs \nhave  adequate  alternative  legal  remedies;  (3)  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  state  a  plausible \nconstitutional claim for relief against Gov. Greitens because Plaintiffs have failed to establish \nthat Gov. Greitens is causally linked to or directly responsible for any alleged constitutional \nviolations; (4) that Plaintiffs’ claims brought under various Mo. Rev. Stat. provisions fail to state \na claim against Missouri or Gov. Greitens; and (5) that Heck v. Humphrey bars all claims brought \nby Plaintiff Church. Finding Plaintiff Church lacks standing to bring his claims, the Court will \naddress Defendants’ remaining arguments.  \n  1. Legislative Immunity  \nAbsolute legislative immunity bars all claims against a governmental actor based on his \nor her “legislative activities.” See Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S. 44, 54-55 (1998); Young v. \nMercer Cnty. Comm’n, 849 F.3d 728, 733-34 (8th Cir. 2017). The absolute immunity applies \nboth  to  claims  for  damages  and  to  those  for  prospective  relief.  Supreme  Court  of  Va.  v. \nConsumers Union of the U.S., Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 732-33 (1980). \nIn Bogan, the U.S. Supreme Court held that city council members were entitled to \nabsolute immunity from § 1983 liability for “actions taken in the sphere of legitimate legislative \nactivity.” 523 U.S. at 53–54. The Bogan Court found that the council’s action in eliminating \n39 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 39 of 48\n\ncertain services was legislative in substance because their action “reflected a discretionary, \npolicymaking decision implicating the budgetary priorities of the city and the services the city \nprovides to its constituents.” Id. at 55–56. This absolute legislative immunity does not apply only \nto legislators; the Supreme Court acknowledged that executive branch officials are entitled to \nlegislative  immunity  when  they  perform  legislative  functions  such  as  making  discretionary \npolicy decisions that implicate budgetary priorities. Id. at 55–56. \nWhether an act is legislative turns on the “nature of the act.” Bogan, 523 U.S. at 54–55. \nLegislative immunity protects acts “integral” to the legislative process, which Plaintiffs argue \ncovers only “‘formally legislative’ acts like introducing, signing, vetoing legislation, and the \nlike.” [Doc. 44, p. 8] (citing Bogan, 523 U.S. at 54–55). Plaintiffs state that the challenged \nactions taken by the Governor are actions taken “in what he himself has argued is his executive \ncapacity,” thus arguing legislative immunity is inapplicable to this case.  \nOne of the actions Plaintiffs challenge is the Governor’s decision to direct his executive \nbranch’s  Office  of  Administration  to  withhold  money  already  allocated  to  the  MSPD  by \nlegislation. Plaintiffs contend that the withholding of allocated funds is not a “legislative” act, \nbut  an  executive  act.  [Doc.  44,  p.  9]  (citing  [Doc.  1-2,    ¶  16];  Barrett  v.  Nixon,  No. \n16ACCC00290 (Mo. Cir. Ct. July 13, 2016), Rothert Decl. Ex. 3).  \nWhen MSPD sued Governor Nixon in 2016 for withholding funds that had been allocated \nby the Missouri legislature, Plaintiffs contend the Governor contended that his authority to \nwithhold funding were executive powers. [Doc. 44, p. 9] (citing Def.’s Renewed Motion to \nDismiss at 9-10, Barrett v. Nixon, No. 16AC-CC00290 (Mo. Cir. Ct. Oct. 13, 2016), Rothert \nDecl.  Ex.  5).  Plaintiffs  argue  that,  because  Governor  Nixon  argued  his  authority  was  an \nexecutive function, “Judicial estoppel precludes the Governor from now arguing a contrary \n40 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 40 of 48\n\nposition to this Court.” [Doc. 44, p. 9]. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749-51 \n(2001); Shockley v. Dir., Div. of Child Support Enf’t, 980 S.W.2d 173, 175 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998). \nPlaintiffs noted “that case is on appeal in Missouri Court of Appeals, and the Attorney General’s \nOffice is still defending that decision on behalf of Governor Greitens, who is substituted now as \nthe appropriate party in that case. So [counsel’s] understanding is . . . that Governor Greitens has \nnot disclaimed Governor Nixon’s position in that case.” [Doc. 64, p. 23].  \nDefendants argue this position is not inconsistent and that Plaintiffs mischaracterize the \nGovernor’s position: “In Barrett, the former Governor did not argue that withholding funds is an \nexecutive function. Rather, [he] argued that his authority to withhold funds could not violate the \nMissouri Constitution’s separation-of-powers doctrine, because the authority to withhold funds is \nitself expressly provided by the Constitution.” [Doc. 49, pp. 2-3].  \nThe Court agrees; the Missouri Constitution includes a separation-of-powers provision \nwhich expressly permits the Executive Branch to exercise legislative power. MO. CONST. Art. II, \n§ 1. Thus, the Governor’s argument that withholding funds does not violate the separation-of-\npowers provision does not mean the Governor argued the function was executive. Judicial \nestoppel does not bar Gov. Greitens from asserting legislative immunity.  \n  Defendants  cite  four  cases  in  which  legislative  immunity  has  barred  claims  against \ngovernors. Three of these cases are clearly distinguishable. In Torres-Rivera v. Calderon-Serra, \n412 F.3d 205, 213 (1st Cir. 2005), the Governor of Puerto Rico was entitled to legislative \nimmunity for his act of signing a particular piece of legislation into law. Plaintiffs concede that \ntype of act is “integral to the legislative process.” [Doc. 44, p. 8]. Here, conversely, Plaintiffs \nchallenge withholding of funds already allocated by the legislature, and Torres-Rivera is not \napplicable. In Peter B. v. Sanford, No. 6:10-767, 2012 WL 2149784 (D.S.C. June 13, 2012), \n41 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 41 of 48\n\nplaintiffs sued the former governor in his individual capacity only. In E.C. v. Blunt, No. 05-0726-\ncv-W-SOW, 2006 WL 44318, at *1 (W.D. Mo. Jan. 9, 2006), the court based its decision on the \nEleventh Amendment’s sovereign immunity, and noted in dicta that “a governor cannot be sued \nfor signing a bill into law due to his absolute legislative immunity.” As a result, Blunt is also \ninapplicable.  \n  However, in Abbey v. Rowland, 359 F. Supp.2d 94, 99-100 (D. Conn. 2005), former state \nemployees, whose jobs were eliminated during budget cuts, brought action against governor of \nState of Connecticut. There, the court held the governor’s discretionary choice on exactly how to \ncut the state budget, which had an adverse impact on some employment within the agency, was a \nlegislative function entitled to legislative immunity to suit. Thus, although it is not binding \nauthority, Abbey supports Defendants’ argument that Gov. Greitens’ withholding of funds is a \nlegislative function entitled to legislative immunity.  \nHowever, Plaintiffs clarified that withholding of funds pursuant to Missouri’s budgetary \nprocess is not the only challenged action under their petition for relief. Plaintiffs noted that “at \nthis point” there is no specific request that Defendants release money from withholding. Rather, \nPlaintiffs “have pleaded . . . a general claim for equitable relief to remedy the ongoing violation.” \nPlaintiffs’ requested remedy “may include an order that the governor release or in the future not \nimpound money allocated to the MSPD, which may be one way in which remedial reform can \nactually happen here, that the governor cannot interfere with an attempt to bring the State into \ncompliance.” [Doc. 64, p. 31].  \n  At this stage of litigation, because it is unclear what the terms of any injunction entered \nwould include, the Court does not find that claims against Gov. Greitens are barred by legislative \n42 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 42 of 48\n\nimmunity. That finding is subject to change should the Plaintiffs request any remedies that would \nviolate Gov. Greitens’ immunity from acts “integral” to the legislative process.  \n    2. Alternative Legal Remedies \nUnder Missouri law, any party seeking an injunction or declaratory relief must establish \nthat she lacks an adequate remedy at law. See, e.g., Farm Bureau Town & Country Ins. Co. v. \nAngoff, 909 S.W.2d 348, 354 (Mo. banc 1995); Foster v. State, 352 S.W.3d 357, 359 (Mo. banc \n2011).  Similarly,  a  plaintiff  seeking  an  injunction  under  §  1983  must  “meet  the  usual \nrequirements for injunctive relief.” Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 648 (1997). One of these \nrequirements is that a party must demonstrate that she lacks an adequate remedy at law. See, e.g., \nTaylor Corp. v. Four Seasons Greetings, LLC, 403 F.3d 958, 967 (8th Cir. 2005) (“It is well-\nestablished that a party is entitled to equitable relief only if there is no adequate remedy at law.”). \nDefendants argue Plaintiffs have alternative remedies available, specifically in a state-\ncourt post-conviction review (“PCR”) proceeding and, if necessary, a federal habeas corpus \nproceeding. [Doc. 21, pp. 3–4] (citing Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15(a) (state PCR review); 28 U.S.C. § \n2254 (federal habeas corpus review)). This argument lacks merit because—as Defendants argue \nelsewhere—only Plaintiff Church has plead guilty and none of the other named Plaintiffs stated \nan intention to plead guilty. As explained above, Strickland is not the appropriate standard in this \ncase. Post-conviction Strickland claims do not constitute adequate remedies at law because they \ncannot adequately protect the entirety of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and because they \n“cannot provide systemic structural relief that will help fix the problem of under-funded and \nunder-resourced public defenders.”  [Doc. 44, p. 20].  \n“[F]ederal courts should not interfere in state criminal court proceedings when state and \nfederal law provide adequate legal remedies and when intervention needlessly threatens the \n43 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 43 of 48\n\nprinciple of comity.” Smith v. Bacon, 699 F.2d 434, 437 (8th Cir. 1983) (emphasis added); \naccord Rogers v. Bruntrager, 841 F.2d 853, 856 (8th Cir. 1988). In this case, however, neither \nstate nor federal habeas relief provides an adequate remedy for Plaintiffs’ claims. Both Smith and \nRogers involved plaintiffs bringing post-conviction claims and, in both cases, the plaintiffs had \npending state post-conviction relief motions. Smith, 699 F.2d at 438; Rogers, 841 F.2d at 856.  \nThat is not the case here, where all named Plaintiffs besides Plaintiff Church are awaiting \ntrial. Plaintiffs in this case seek prospective relief to remedy ongoing and future violations of \ntheir right to adequate counsel, not retrospective vacatur of existing convictions. Plaintiffs argue \n“post-conviction relief cannot provide prospective relief, cannot provide systemic relief, cannot \nprotect the full scope of the Sixth Amendment right, and cannot protect the Sixth Amendment \nrights of those whose evidence of guilt is overwhelming.” [Doc. 44, p. 21].  \nBecause  “[t]he  right  to  counsel  is  the  lifeblood  of  our  system  of  criminal  justice,” \n“nothing in our legal tradition or precedents requires a person seeking to vindicate that right to \nwait until he or she has been convicted and sentenced.” Kuren, 146 A.3d at 747. Therefore, \nPlaintiffs do not have adequate legal remedies at law.  \n  3. Causation & Governor Greitens  \nSimilar  but  distinguishable  from  Defendants’  arguments  surrounding  redressability, \nDefendants contend Plaintiffs “have failed to establish that Governor Greitens is causally linked \nto or directly responsible for any alleged constitutional violations.” [Doc. 21, p. 5].  \n   a. Federal Constitutional Claims \nPlaintiffs’ claims brought pursuant to the U.S. Constitution are brought under 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 1983. “To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was \n44 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 44 of 48\n\ncommitted by a person acting under color of state law.” West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n“Liability  under  section  1983  requires  a  causal  link  to,  and  direct  responsibility  for,  the \ndeprivation of rights.” Mayorga v. Missouri, 442 F.3d 1128, 1132 (8th Cir. 2006). \nAs noted above, Governor Greitens “is responsible for law enforcement . . . and is \ncharged with executing the laws faithfully,” “has the residual power to commence criminal \nprosecutions,”  and  “has  the  final  authority  to  direct  the  Attorney  General  to  ‘institute  and \nprosecute’ on behalf of the state.” Mo. Const. art. IV, §§1-2; Mo. Rev. Stat. § 27.030. Governor \nGreitens’s predecessor, Governor Nixon, affirmatively used his executive authority to withhold \nroughly $7 million in funding allocated by the Missouri Legislature to the MSPD, thereby \ndemonstrating an even more direct “connection” to the challenged conduct. [Doc. 1-2, ¶¶ 42-43]. \nGovernor Greitens has since upheld Governor Nixon’s withholding of funds allocated to the \nMSPD. Id. ¶ 44; [Doc. 17 ¶ 45]. Finally, the Governor appoints all seven members of the MSPD \nCommission.  See  Mo.  Rev.  Stat.  §  600.015(1);  Eu,  979  F.2d  at  704  (holding  California \ngovernor’s power to appoint judges was a sufficient “connection” to the challenged statute \nlimiting the number of judges in Los Angeles County). \nPlaintiffs have alleged a sufficient connection regarding Gov. Greitens to place him \nsquarely within Ex Parte Young. For the same reasons, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged “a causal \nlink to, and direct responsibility for, the deprivation of rights.” Mayorga v. Missouri, 442 F.3d \n1128, 1132 (8th Cir. 2006). \n   b. Missouri Constitutional Claims    \nPlaintiffs’ Second and Fourth Claims seek relief against the Governor under Missouri \nlaw. Under Missouri law, a plaintiff must bring suit against “the state official charged with the \nduty to enforce” the state law at issue. Midwest Freedom Coalition, LLC v. Koster, 398 S.W.3d \n45 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 45 of 48\n\n23, 27 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013); see also State ex rel. Reeves v. Brady, 303 S.W.3d 22, 25 (Mo. banc \n1957). Plaintiffs note that “it is Governor Greitens’s role to ensure that the State fulfills its \naffirmative constitutional obligations, just as the Eleventh Circuit held that it was the governor of \nGeorgia’s role to do so in Luckey.” [Doc. 44, p. 8].  \nIn Luckey v. Harris, the Eleventh Circuit allowed indigent defendants bringing a Sixth \nAmendment claim to sue the governor of Georgia for prospective equitable relief. 860 F.2d \n1012, 1016 (11th Cir. 1988). The Eleventh Circuit held that the governor was a proper defendant \nbecause  “[a]ccording  to  the  Georgia  constitution,  the  governor  is  responsible  for  law \nenforcement in that state and is charged with executing the laws faithfully,” “has the residual \npower to commence criminal prosecutions,” and “has the final authority to direct the Attorney \nGeneral to ‘institute and prosecute’ on behalf of the state.” Id. at 1016 (citations omitted). \nFor the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged Governor Greitens is \n“the  state  official  charged  with  the  duty  to  enforce”  the  provisions  of  the  Missouri  State \nConstitution dealing with indigent defense, the right to counsel, and due process. See Midwest \nFreedom Coalition, LLC v. Koster, 398 S.W.3d 23, 27 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013).  \n  4. Claims brought under Missouri Criminal & Juvenile Code Provisions \nPlaintiffs’ Fifth Claim for Relief alleges Defendants have violated Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ \n600.042, 600.048, 211.061, and 211.211, and Missouri Rule of Juvenile Procedure 126.01. [Doc. \n1-2, ¶¶ 224-226.] Under Missouri law, declaratory judgments and injunctive relief constitute \nremedies, not independent causes of action. See Goerlitz v. City of Maryville, 333 S.W.3d 450, \n455 (Mo. banc 2011) (“[A]n injunction is a remedy and not a cause of action[.]”); ABB, Inc. v. \nSecuritas Sec. Servs. USA, Inc., 390 S.W.3d 196, 203 (Mo. Ct. App. 2012) (explaining that a \ndeclaratory  judgment  “is  but  one  of  several  remedies,  not  a  substantive  claim”  (quotation \n46 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 46 of 48\n\nomitted)). Thus, a request for such remedies “must be based on some recognized and pleaded \nlegal theory.” Goerlitz, 333 S.W.3d at 455. \nSection 600.042 imposes a number of duties on the director of the Public Defender’s \nOffice (Defendant Barrett) and the public defenders who operate under him. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § \n600.042. But the statute imposes no obligations on Governor Greitens. Id. Similarly, § 600.048 \nimposes a number of duties on public defenders, courts, and those who operate jails, police \nstations, constables’ offices, sheriffs’ offices, and detention facilities. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § \n600.048. Again, § 600.048 imposes no duties on Governor Greitens. Id. Likewise, neither § \n211.061, § 211.211, nor Missouri Rule of Juvenile Procedure 126.01 imposes any duties on \nGovernor  Greitens.  Defendants  thus  move  to  dismiss  these  claims  against  Gov.  Greitens. \nPlaintiffs concede to dismissal of Count V against Gov. Greitens. [Doc. 44, p. 7 n.4].  \nPlaintiffs argue Missouri is a proper defendant under the cited code provisions and \noppose that portion of Defendants’ motion on Count V. Id. Defendants argue that Missouri \ncourts “will not interpret a statute to establish a private cause of action without clear implication \nof the legislature’s intent to do so.” Byrne & Jones Enters., Inc. v. Monroe City R-1 Sch. Dist., \n493 S.W.3d 847, 856 (Mo. 2016). But, as Plaintiffs point out, that is true only “[w]hen the \nlegislature has established other means of enforcing [the] statute[.]” Dierkes v. Blue Cross & \nBlue Shield of Mo., 991 S.W.2d 662, 667 (Mo. 1999). Defendants have pointed to no other \nmeans of enforcement here besides post-conviction relief, which the Court already found is an \ninadequate remedy for the alleged violations.  \nPlaintiffs have plausibly alleged violations of the Missouri Criminal and Juvenile codes \nand Defendants have not convinced the Court that the legislature has established other means of \nenforcing the statute. Therefore, Count V is dismissed against Governor Greitens but is not \n47 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 69   Filed 07/24/17   Page 47 of 48\n\ndismissed against the State of Missouri.  \n \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), \n[Doc. 18], is granted as to Plaintiff Church and denied to all other claims. Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), [Doc. 20], is granted as to Count V against Governor \nGreitens and denied as to all other claims.  \n \ns/ Nanette K.

For the \nfollowing reasons, the motion is denied.  \nI.  Background \nThis lawsuit challenges the adequacy of the Missouri State Public Defender (MSPD), \nwhich provides legal representation to all indigent citizens accused or convicted of crimes in \nMissouri state court.  Named Plaintiffs filed this putative class action alleging that Missouri “has \nfailed  to  meet  its  constitutional  obligation  to  provide  indigent  defendants  with  meaningful \nrepresentation.”  Doc. 1-2, p. 2.  The crux of Plaintiffs’ allegations is that the MSPD is underfunded \nand overworked, and Plaintiffs seek only injunctive and declaratory relief aimed at correcting the \nissues.   \nA.   Missouri Indigent Defense Overview  \nThe State of Missouri relies almost exclusively on local MSPD offices to provide indigent \n                                                            \n1 The caption reflects the current parties.  Although originally captioned Church v. State of \nMissouri, the Court has found that plaintiff Shondel Church lacked standing, Doc. 69, p. 33, and \nplaintiffs’ claims against the State of Missouri and the Governor have been dismissed.  Doc. 211.    \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 1 of 13\n\ndefense services in all 114 counties and St. Louis City.  MSPD comprises three distinct parts: the \nTrial Division, subdivided into 33 district offices across the State; the Appellate/Post-Conviction \nDivision, subdivided into six offices; and the Capital Division, subdivided into three offices.  \nMSPD employs approximately 376 attorneys—including roughly 313 in the Trial Division—and \napproximately 200 administrative staff, support staff, paralegals, and investigators.  The MSPD \nrepresents indigent defendants in over 100,000 cases each year, counting new cases and cases \ncarried over from previous years.  \n1.  Funding \n  MSPD is funded almost exclusively from Missouri’s general revenue.  The level of funding \nprovided by the State is less than one half of one percent of the State’s general revenue.  In fiscal \nyear 2016, the MSPD Trial Division handled more than 75,000 cases; with its funding, the MSPD \nspent an average of $356 per case.  Since the establishment of MSPD in its current form in 1989, \nthere have been at least ten independent evaluations of Missouri’s public defense system.2  One \nsuch study, conducted by the Sixth Amendment Center, determined that Missouri’s per capita \nspending on indigent defense is approximately one-third of the average of the 35 states surveyed.  \nAccording to the study, in fiscal year 2015 Missouri spent $6.20 per resident for indigent defense \nservices, compared to an average of $18.41 per capita among the other States in the study.  \nMissouri currently ranks 49th among the 50 states in funding for indigent defense.   \n2.   Workloads  \n  In 1993, the MSPD Commission sought the assistance of The Spangenberg Group (TSG) \nin studying the internal operations of the Missouri public defense system, including issues related \nto budgeting, staffing, and allocation of resources.  TSG’s report concluded that MSPD “lack[ed] \n                                                            \n2 The reports from those studies are in the record at Docs. 1-3, 1-4.  \n2 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 2 of 13\n\nthe necessary resources to provide competent representation,” and that “[t]he legal staff needs to \nbe increased as soon as possible.”  Doc. 1-3, pp. 86–106.  \nIn 2005, the Missouri Bar Association formed a Public Defender Task Force to work in \nconjunction  with  the  MSPD  Commission  to  address  those  deficiencies.    The  task  force \ncommissioned TSG to conduct another study into the MSPD.  The report warned that, despite the \nbest efforts of MSPD’s attorneys, many public defenders were routinely failing to comply with \nMSPD’s Public Defender Guidelines for Representation and the Missouri Rules of Professional \nConduct.  Doc. 1-3, pp. 111–38.  \nIn January 2007, an interim committee of the Missouri Senate released its report on MSPD.  \nThe committee found that the caseloads of public defenders were “too large,” and recommended \nthat “caseloads . . . be reduced, support staff be increased, the number of public defenders be \nincreased . . . [and] the base salary of public defenders be[ ] increased.”  Docs. 1-3, pp. 140–50; 1-\n4, pp. 1–4. \nIn 2009, the Missouri Bar Association retained TSG for another report.  TSG concluded \nthat public defender workloads had worsened since its 2005 report and, as a result of those \nworkloads,  public  defenders  were  failing  to  (1)  conduct  prompt  interviews  of  their  clients \nfollowing arrest, (2) spend sufficient time interviewing and counseling their clients, (3) advocate \neffectively for pretrial release, (4) conduct thorough investigations of their cases, (5) pursue formal \nand informal discovery, (6) file appropriate and essential pleadings and motions, (7) conduct \nnecessary legal research, and (8) prepare adequately for pretrial hearings, trial, and sentencing.  \nDoc. 1-4, pp. 6–73.  \nIn June 2014, the ABA and accounting firm RubinBrown released a study of Missouri’s \npublic defender system, which included an assessment of public defender workloads for both adult \n3 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 3 of 13\n\nand juvenile matters.  Doc. 1-7.  The researchers calculated the minimum number of hours \n(excluding court time, travel, and administrative tasks) that an attorney would need to devote to \ndifferent types of cases in order to provide constitutionally adequate representation.  The study \ndetermined that a constitutionally adequate attorney would need to spend a minimum of 106.6 \nhours on a non-capital murder/homicide case; at least 47.6 hours on an A/B felony; at least 25.0 \nhours on a C/D felony; at least 63.8 hours on a felony sex offense; at least 11.7 hours on a \nmisdemeanor; at least 9.8 hours on a probation violation; and at least 19.5 hours on a juvenile case.  \nDoc. 1-4, pp. 75–121. \nIn 2015, MSPD attorneys were able to spend, on average, 84.5 hours on each non-capital \nmurder/homicide case; 8.7 hours on each A/B felony; 4.4 hours on each C/D felony; 25.6 hours \non each felony sex offense; 2.3 hours on each misdemeanor; 1.4 hours on each probation violation; \nand 4.6 hours on each juvenile case.  Id.  Under the ABA’s analysis, “attorneys in the St. Louis \nCounty office [were] at 265% workload capacity,” and throughout the state, for example: “239% \ncapacity for the Springfield office, 254% for Jefferson City, and 254% for Farmington.”  Doc. 1-\n4, pp. 124–126.  MSPD Trial Division attorneys were able to devote the minimum required hours \nto only 2.4% of all A/B felony cases (or 97 out of 4,127 total A/B felony cases) and 1.4% of C/D \nfelony cases (or 311 out of 21,491 total C/D felony cases).  Doc. 1-4, pp. 189–99. \nIn 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the validity of a rule promulgated by the \nMSPD Commission that “permit[ted] a district defender office to decline additional appointments \nwhen it ha[d] been certified as being on limited availability after exceeding its caseload capacity \nfor  at  least  three  consecutive  calendar  months.”    State  ex  rel.  Missouri  Public  Defender \nCommission v. Waters, 370 S.W.3d 592, 597 (Mo. 2012).  After that decision, however, public \ndefenders who attempted to turn away cases faced resistance from prosecutors, judges, and \n4 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 4 of 13\n\nlegislators.  In some circuits, cases that were turned away were assigned to non-MSPD attorneys \nwith no criminal defense experience, and who were not compensated for their time.  \nThe then-head of MSPD was told that if local offices continued to turn away cases, the \nlegislature would pass a bill to privatize the entire system.  The legislature passed Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 600.062, which prevents the director of MSPD or the MSPD Commission from “limit[ing] the \navailability of a district office or any division director, district defender, deputy district defender, \nor assistant public defender to accept cases based on a determination that the office has exceeded \na caseload standard.”  Under Section 600.062, MSPD “may not refuse to provide representation” \nunless it receives “prior approval from a court of competent jurisdiction.”  Since the legislature’s \nenactment of 600.602, no MSPD office has refused cases in any consistent or systematic way. \n  B.   Plaintiffs’ Proposed Class \nPlaintiffs seek certification of a class of similarly situated individuals who currently are or \nwill be represented by MSPD defined as follows: \nAll  indigent  persons  who  are  now  or  who  will  be  during  the \npendency of this litigation under formal charge before a state court \nin Missouri of having committed any offense the penalty for which \nincludes  the  possibility  of  confinement,  incarceration, \nimprisonment,  or  detention  (regardless  of  whether  actually \nimposed), and who are eligible to be represented by MSPD. \n \nDoc. 53, pp. 1–2.  Plaintiffs’ Class Action Petition for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, Doc. 1-\n2, includes five claims for relief: (I) Violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution; (II) Violation of Article 1, Section 18(a) of the Missouri Constitution; (III) Violation \nof the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; (IV) Violation of \nArticle 1, Section 10 of the Missouri Constitution; and (V) Violation of Missouri Criminal and \nJuvenile Codes.  \nPlaintiffs  ask  this  Court  to:  “Declare  that  Defendants  are  obligated  to  provide \n5 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 5 of 13\n\nconstitutionally adequate representation to indigent criminal defendants and juvenile respondents, \nincluding at their initial appearances;” “Declare that the constitutional and statutory rights of \nMissouri’s indigent criminal defendants and juvenile respondents are currently being violated by \nDefendants on an ongoing basis;” “Enjoin Defendants from continuing to violate the rights of \nindigent  defendants  by  providing  constitutionally  deficient  representation;”  and  “Enter  an \ninjunction that requires Defendants to propose and implement, subject to this Court’s approval and \nmonitoring, a plan to ensure that all indigent criminal defendants and juvenile respondents in the \nState of Missouri are provided with constitutionally adequate legal representation.” Id. at 52.  \nII.  Discussion \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, a motion for class certification involves a two-\npart analysis.  First, under Rule 23(a), the proposed class must satisfy the requirements of \n“numerosity, commonality, typicality, and fair and adequate representation.”  Luiken v. Domino’s \nPizza, LLC, 705 F.3d 370, 372 (8th Cir. 2013).  Second, the proposed class must meet at least one \nof the three requirements of Rule 23(b).  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013). \nPlaintiffs carry the burden to show that the class should be certified.  See Luiken, 705 F.3d \nat 372.  This burden is met only if, “after a rigorous analysis,” the Court is convinced the Rule 23 \nrequirements are satisfied.  Comcast,  569 U.S. at 33  (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 \nU.S. 338, 341 (2011)).  Rigorous analysis may further “entail some overlap with the merits of the \nplaintiff’s underlying claim,” because “[t]he class determination generally involves considerations \nthat are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff’s cause of action.”  Id. at \n33–34 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982)).  However, the Court’s \ninquiry on a motion for class certification is “tentative,” “preliminary,” and “limited.”  In re Zurn \nPex Plumbing Prod. Liab. Litig., 644 F.3d 604, 613 (8th Cir. 2011).  “Rule 23 grants courts no \n6 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 6 of 13\n\nlicense to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.”  Amgen Inc. v. Conn. \nRet. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013).  “Merits questions may be considered to the \nextent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 \nprerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”  Id. \nA.    Plaintiffs Fail to Satisfy Rule 23(a)’s Commonality Requirement  \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  However, as “any competently crafted class complaint literally raises common \n‘questions,’” merely raising common questions—“even in droves”—is insufficient to obtain class \ncertification.  Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349–50 (2011) (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs must show that their class claims “depend upon a common contention” that “is capable \nof classwide resolution,” such that the “determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id. at 350.  Put another way, \n“what matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions . . . but, rather the \ncapacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the \nlitigation.”  Id. (emphasis in original) (internal quotations omitted).   \nPlaintiffs propose several “questions of law or fact,” which they argue are common to the \nentire class.  The “basic, unadorned question,” according to Plaintiffs, “is whether the State has \nmet its obligation to provide counsel.”  Doc. 53, p. 11 (citing Hurrell-Harring v. State of New \nYork, 914 N.Y.S.2d 367, 372 (App. Div. 2011)).  That overriding question purportedly “breaks \ndown into several sub-questions . . . .”  Id. at 12.  Specifically: \na) Whether MSPD attorneys’ inability to adequately perform the \nbasic tasks of representation stems from MSPD’s high workloads;  \nb) Whether MSPD’s high workloads are a result of Defendants’ \ncourse of conduct;  \nc) Whether MSPD attorneys are laboring under an actual conflict of \n7 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 7 of 13\n\ninterest because of their high workloads, which ensure that any time \nspent  providing  constitutionally  adequate  representation  to  one \nclient is time not spent providing such representation to another;  \nd) Whether Defendants have created circumstances such that even \nwhere  counsel  is  nominally  available,  “the  likelihood  that  any \nlawyer,  even  a  fully  competent  one,  could  provide  effective \nassistance is small,” constructively depriving Plaintiffs of counsel in \nviolation of United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984);  \ne) Whether MSPD attorneys are able to adequately perform the basic \ntasks  necessary  to  meet  the  minimum  requirements  for \nconstitutionally  sufficient  counsel,  such  as  communicating  with \nclients, investigating cases, and counseling clients regarding guilty \npleas;  \nf) Whether Defendants have created a likelihood of constitutionally \ndeficient performance on MSPD’s part and resulting prejudice on \nthe part of Plaintiffs; and  \ng) Whether Defendants have systematically denied Plaintiffs actual \nrepresentation at critical stages of their cases. \nId.  Plaintiffs maintain that each of these questions requires an analysis of MSPD at the system-\nwide level, and does not depend on the particular circumstances of individual cases.  The Court \ndisagrees.   \nNone of the questions that Plaintiffs present are apt to generate common answers, and \ninstead the answers may vary depending upon any one of a number of factors, including the \nPlaintiffs’ location and type of criminal charge, and may even vary among individual MSPD \nattorneys.  For instance, the Plaintiffs cannot establish the answer to “whether the State has met its \nobligation to provide counsel,” without providing evidence from each of MSPD’s forty-two offices \nand three divisions.  The answer could quite conceivably be yes in one MSPD office, but no in \nanother.  \nThe present matter is similar to Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes.  There, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt explained that while “commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class \nmembers ‘have suffered the same injury,’” that does not mean “merely that they have all suffered \n8 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 8 of 13\n\na violation of the same provision of law.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. \nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)).  In Dukes, the Supreme Court concluded that a proposed Title \nVII class of millions of female employees, challenging discretionary decisions made by managers \nin 3,400 stores across the country, did not satisfy Rule 23’s commonality requirement because \nthere was no common policy that bridged the “conceptual gap” between the individual claims of \ndiscrimination, and the existence of a class of persons who all suffered the same injury.  Id. at 352–\n53.  Likewise, here, Plaintiffs have failed to bridge the conceptual gap between their contention \nthat the MSPD is underfunded and overworked, and their allegation that every putative class \nmember has suffered a common injury of inadequate counsel.  Even assuming that the MSPD is \nunderfunded and overworked, Plaintiffs would still need to provide evidence that it causes injury \nto every class member, which would require individualized evidence. \nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish Dukes by offering “the State’s policy of underfunding its \npublic defender program” as the “common policy that was missing in Dukes.”  Doc. 68, p. 6. \nHowever, the Court is not persuaded.  Not every MSPD office receives the same amount of \nresources, much less requires the same amount.  Indeed, while Plaintiffs emphasize that the State \nof Missouri spends only an average of $356 per assigned case, Defendants point out that in Kansas \nCity, the average cost per assigned case in 2016 was $566.69, and in St. Louis City, the average \ncost per assigned case was $525.00.  Plaintiffs may attempt to prove that all three are underfunded, \nbut that will require evidence from each office, and may also require further narrowing among the \ntypes of criminal charge.  Moreover, that the MSPD is underfunded is not Plaintiffs’ main \ncontention in this lawsuit, and Plaintiffs do not seek an increase in funding.   \nPlaintiffs rely on three cases to support their position, but each is distinguishable.  Two are \nstate court cases, in which Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes is inapplicable.  See Hurrel-Harring, \n9 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 9 of 13\n\n914 N.Y.S.2d at 367; Rivera v. Rowland, No. CV95545629, 1996 WL 677452 (Conn. Super. Ct. \nNov. 8, 1996).3  The third case, Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, 298 F.R.D. 665 (W.D. Wash \n2012), involved a much smaller class than the Plaintiffs propose in the present matter.  In Wilbur, \nthe class included indigent defendants before only two municipal courts.  Id. at 666.  Moreover, \nthe Wilbur plaintiffs challenged a specific policy of the public defender system, which made it \nimpossible for counsel to engage in confidential communications with their clients.  Id. at 667.  \nHere, the Plaintiffs seek to certify a statewide, 10,000+ member class, with no common policy \nother than alleged system-wide underfunding.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to establish Rule 23(a)’s commonality \nrequirement. \n  B.   Plaintiffs Fail to Satisfy Any Rule 23(b) Requirements \n1.  Rule 23(b)(1) \nPlaintiffs first argue for certification under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), which allows certification \nwhere separate actions would risk “adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as \na practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the \nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their \ninterests.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(B).  The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 23(b)(1)(B) \nprovide: \n[Rule 23(b)(1)(B)] takes in situations where the judgment in a non-class action by \nor against an individual member of the class, while not technically concluding the \nother members, might do so as a practical matter.  The vice of an individual action \n                                                            \n3 Although Rivera v. Rowland explains that “Connecticut courts commonly rely on federal case \nlaw to aid them in their analysis,” it was decided in 1996, nearly fifteen years before Dukes.  1996 \nWL 677452 at *2.  Hurrel-Harring v. State of New York makes no mention of federal law, and \nindeed required that the common questions of law or fact “predominate over any questions \naffecting only individual members,” 914 N.Y.S.2d 367 (App. Div. 2011), which is not applicable \nhere.  \n10 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 10 of 13\n\nwould lie in the fact that the other members of the class, thus practically concluded, \nwould have had no representation in the lawsuit . . .  [This] reasoning applies to an \naction which charges a breach of trust by an indenture trustee or other fiduciary \nsimilarly affecting the members of a large class of security holders or other \nbeneficiaries, and which requires an accounting or like measures to restore the \nsubject of the trust. \n \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(1)(B) Advisory Committee Notes (1966 Amendment).  To qualify as a class \naction under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), it must be shown that “the shared character of rights claimed or \nrelief  awarded  entails  that  any  individual  adjudication  by  a  class  member  disposes  of,  or \nsubstantially affects, the interests of absent class members.”  Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. \n815, 834 (1999).  Typically, class actions under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) involve “the presence of property \nwhich call[s] for distribution or management,” often when claims are made “by numerous persons \nagainst a fund insufficient to satisfy all claims.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs attempt to argue that the existing pool of public defenders is a limited, finite \nresource.  Plaintiffs also argue that if a plaintiff succeeds on an individual suit for inadequate \nrepresentation, it necessarily would “substantially impede the ability of other indigent defendants \nto obtain adequate counsel, because other indigent defendants would then have access to even \nfewer public defender resources.”  Doc. 53, p. 16.  The Court disagrees.  There is no limited fund \nof public defenders, and the resolution of one indigent defendant’s inadequate assistance claim \nwould not preclude others from seeking similar relief.  The supply of public defenders can be \nexpanded by the legislature, as can its funding.  Indeed, regardless of whether the funding and \nstaffing of MSPD is adequate, both appropriations and the amount of public defenders have \nincreased over the past twenty five years.  Accordingly, it follows that if a plaintiff were to succeed \non an individual suit for inadequate representation, it would not necessarily impede any other \npotential plaintiff from raising a similar claim. \n11 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 11 of 13\n\nPlaintiffs fail to satisfy Rule 23(b)(1)(B).4 \n2.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nPlaintiffs also argue for certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Although a Rule 23(b)(2) class is not required to satisfy the \nadditional predominance and superiority requirements of Rule 23(b)(3), “the class claims must be \ncohesive.”  Ebert v. General Mills, Inc., 823 F.3d 472, 480 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Barnes v. Am. \nTobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 143 (3d Cir. 1998)).  Because a (b)(2) class is mandatory, and class \nmembers are not permitted to opt out, “the cohesiveness requirement of Rule 23(b)(2) is more \nstringent than the predominance and superiority requirements for maintaining a class action under \nRule 23(b)(3).”  Id.  For purposes of 23(b)(2), cohesiveness requires that “the relief sought must \nperforce affect the entire class at once.”  Id. (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. at 361–62) In contrast, \ncohesiveness is lacking where “each individual class member would be entitled to a different \ninjunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.”  Id. at 480–81. \nPlaintiffs’  proposed  class  is  not  sufficiently  cohesive.    The  class  includes  indigent \ndefendants charged with everything from first degree murder to passing bad checks and causing \npersonal  injury  while  boating  while  intoxicated.    It  includes  indigent  defendants  in  major \nmetropolitan areas, such as Kansas City and St. Louis, as well as rural areas, such as Kirksville.  \nThe  proposed  class  would  require  evidence  and  inquiries  into  far  too  many  individual \ncircumstances.  See Rubenstein, 2 Newberg on Class Actions § 4:34 (5th ed.) (“In determining \n                                                            \n4  Moreover,  “[t]he  Supreme  Court  has  cautioned  against  ‘adventurous  application  of  Rule \n23(b)(1)(B).’”  Elizabeth M. v. Montenez, 458 F.3d 779, 786 n.3 (8th Cir. 2006) (quoting Ortiz, \n527 U.S. at 845). \n12 \n \nCase 2:17-cv-04057-NKL   Document 212   Filed 02/26/19   Page 12 of 13\n\nwhether cohesiveness is present, courts tend to focus on whether adjudication is likely to break \ndown into individual inquiries.”). \nFurthermore, although Plaintiffs maintain that a single injunction would provide relief to \neach member of the class, their proposal “requires Defendants to propose and implement . . . a plan \nto ensure that all indigent criminal defendants and juvenile respondents in the State of Missouri \nare provided with constitutionally adequate legal representation.”  Doc. 53, p. 17. While that is \ntechnically just one injunction, it is not specific, and alone will not provide relief to all class \nmembers.  Under the injunction, the Defendants’ plan could take different forms for different \nPlaintiffs, depending on a variety of factors.  Indeed, there is no certainty that the single injunction \nwould benefit all class members equally, if at all.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs have an individual \nremedy, in that they could bring their claims individually, and obtain an individual injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment.  Therefore, this is not an instance where Defendants’ conduct can only be \nenjoined as to all class members or none.  See Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (“The key to the (b)(2) class \nis the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the \nconduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \nas to none of them.”).   \nAs the proposed class is not sufficiently cohesive, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2).  \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify a Class, Doc. 52, is denied.   \ns/ Nanette K. Laughrey \nNANETTE K.
