    "summary": "<p>On June 21, 2016, plaintiffs, six indigent adults incarcerated in Utah jails and detention centers, brought this class action lawsuit in the Third Judicial District Court in and for Salt Lake County, Utah. The plaintiffs sued the State of Utah and the Attorney General of Utah under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and Utah state law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the ACLU of Utah, sought injunctive and monetary relief claiming violations of their Sixth Amendment rights, including plaintiffsโ right to effective assistance of counsel, and their Fourteenth Amendment rights, including right to due process. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to provide constitutionally adequate legal representation to indigent adults accused of crimes punishable by incarceration in Utahโs District and Justice courts. </p><p>Plaintiffs alleged that defendantsโ failure to provide adequate legal representation was due to the state statutorily delegating the duty to provide indigent criminal defense to the individual counties and municipalities of the state, and then failing to provide funding, logical support, or oversight to the counties or municipalities.  In support of their claim of failure to provide funding, plaintiffs alleged that Utah provided no financial support to any county or municipality in the state. Additionally, plaintiffs supported their claim with investigations and assessments conducted by the ACLU of Utah, the Sixth Amendment Center, and the Utah Judicial Council.</p><p>On July 1, 2016, plaintiffs amended the complaint to emphasize alleged harm on individually named plaintiffs.</p><p>The case was moved from the Third Judicial District Court in and for Salt Lake County to the United States District Court for the District of Utah on July 13, 2016.  On July 20, 2016, defendants filed motion to consolidate case with <i> Cox v. Utah </i>, a similar case in which the plaintiffs, indigent individuals in Utah charged within Washington County of Utah, alleged deficiencies in Utahโs indigent defense program. Then, on July 26, 2016, plaintiffs sought certification of a class comprised of all indigent adults charged or to be charged with one or more crimes in a District or Justice Court within the State of Utah.</p><p>On August 5, 2016, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction. From August 8, 2016 through January 4, 2017, motions were stayed in consideration of the defendantsโ motion to consolidate cases, but this motion was rendered moot after <i> Cox v. Utah </i> was dismissed. District Judge David Nuffer then granted a partial lift of stay to rule on the defendantsโ motion to dismiss, but the stay remained in effect for all other matters, including the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification.</p><p>On March 23, 2018, Judge Nuffer granted the defendantsโ motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to allege sufficient facts to establish their standing to sue or to state a claim. Specifically, he found that that there were insufficient allegations of an actual or complete denial of appointed counsel, insufficient allegations that the plaintiffsโ public defenders had entirely failed to subject the prosecutionโs cases to meaningful adversarial testing, and insufficient allegations that the plaintiffsโ public defenders had been called upon to render assistance under circumstances where competent counsel very likely could not. Furthermore, Judge Nuffer found that the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently demonstrate a causal connection between their alleged injury and defendantsโ conduct. Lastly, he found that the declaratory relief sought by the plaintiffs in their amended complaint, a judgment that the defendants were not complying with US and Utah Constitutions, did not meet the standard of redressability. 2018 WL 1472484. The case is now closed. </p>",

Plaintiffs bring this civil rights class action to remedy Utahโs failure to provide \nconstitutionally adequate legal representation to indigent adults accused of crimes in Utahโs \nDistrict and Justice courts for which there is a possibility of incarceration.  This failure deprives \nand threatens to deprive plaintiffs of rights guaranteed to them by the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, ยง 12 of the Utah Constitution, and ยง 77-\n32-301, UTAH CODE ANN. \n2.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration from this Court that the indigent defense provided by \nthe State of Utah, as authorized and operated by the State of Utah and Attorney General Reyes \n(collectively, โDefendantsโ), deprives Plaintiffs of their rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs also seek a declaration from this Court \nthat the indigent defense system in the State of Utah, as operated by Defendants, violates \nPlaintiffsโ rights under Article I, ยงยง 12 and 24 of the Utah Constitution (right to counsel and \nuniform operation of laws); and ยง 77-32-301, UTAH CODE ANN., the Utah Indigent Defense Act.  \nPlaintiffs further seek injunctive relief to remedy the systemic failures that lead to this action. \n3.  The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that a person \naccused of a crime has the right to assistance of counsel for his or her defense.  This \nconstitutional guarantee โcannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment.โ  United States v. \nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 655 (1984) (quoting Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940)).  \n2\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 3 of 62\n \nRather, the Sixth Amendment requires defense counsel to subject the prosecutionโs case to โthe \ncrucible of meaningful adversarial testing.โ  Id. at 656.  It is the Stateโs duty to safeguard this \nright and ensure that people who face the threat of imprisonment receive competent assistance of \ncounsel regardless of their income.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342 (1963) (sometimes \nreferred to as โGideonโ).  \n4.  Article I, ยง 12 of the Utah Constitution (Rights of Accused Persons) guarantees \nthat in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person \nand by counsel.  Where a person is charged with an offense that may be punished by \nimprisonment, โthe accused is entitled to the effective assistance of a competent member of [the] \nbar who is willing to identify with the interests of the defendant and present the available \ndefenses.โ  State v. Wulffenstein, 733 P.2d 120, 121 (Utah 1986); State v. Gray, 601 P.2d 918, \n920 (Utah 1979).  \n5.  Article I, Section 24 of the Utah Constitution (Uniform Operation of Laws) \nmandates that:  โ[a]ll laws of a general nature shall have uniform operations.โ \n6.  The Utah Indigent Defense Act requires that indigent defendants be provided: \nโtimely representation by competent legal counsel,โ the โinvestigatory resources necessary for a \ncomplete defense,โ and โundivided loyalty of defense counsel.โ  UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 77-32-301.   \n7.  The State of Utah has the exclusive duty to provide indigent persons a \nconstitutionally sufficient defense.  Gideon, 372 U.S. at 342-43.  The State of Utah has \ncompletely abdicated this duty.  \n8.  Rather than provide indigent criminal defense itself, the State of Utah has \nstatutorily delegated that duty to the counties and municipalities.  UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 77-32-306.  \n3\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 4 of 62\n \nWhile this delegation might be acceptable if the State of Utah were to provide the proper \nfunding, logistical support, or oversight to the counties and municipalities, the State has done the \nexact opposite.  In fact, the State of Utah presently provides absolutely no financial support, \nsupervision, or oversight to any of its 29 counties, nor to any of its over 100 municipalities.  Utah \nis one of only two states in the nation to refuse to provide any such state funding or supervision.  \nIn essence, the State of Utah has not delegated its responsibilities, it has abnegated its \nresponsibilities  \n9.  In Utah, counties and municipalities provide criminal defense to indigent people \nas a contracted service.  In general, this contracting involves counties and municipalities \nperiodically seeking bids from private attorneys on contracts to provide all indigent defense for \nthe county or municipality. \n10.  With neither guidance nor oversight from Defendants, these contracts are poorly \nstructured, violate widely accepted American Bar Association standards, and lack any \nmechanism for identifying conflicts of interest.  Almost without exception, the contracts provide \na fixed flat fee for compensation, regardless of the number of cases the contract attorneys \nundertake.  Also almost without exception, the compensation to public defenders is inadequate to \nreasonably compensate them, and is invariably lower than the compensation given to \nprosecutors, with nothing resembling parity between defense and prosecution.   \n11.  Certain county contracts with public defenders require the attorneys to pay the \ncosts of investigators, testing, and expert witnesses with no additional funding from the county, \nwhich disincentivizes attorneys from paying for such services out of their own pocket.   \n4\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 5 of 62\n \n12.  All counties require contract attorneys to pay for their own office expenses, \noverhead, and support staff.  As a result, many, if not most, contract attorneys (save for two \ncontracted county legal defender offices) are forced to take on additional private cases for payโ\na particularly dangerous practice absent any written guidelines or policies governing conflicts of \ninterest and caseloads.   \n13.  Counties have no written requirements, policies, or standards for evaluating \npotential conflicts.  Counties keep no records of how many cases are assigned to their public \ndefenders.   \n14.  Defendants, like the counties and municipalities, have failed to implement any \nwritten policies and/or guidelines regarding the selection, required qualifications, or \ncompensation of public defense counsel.  Defendants do not supervise and evaluate public \ndefense counsel.  Defendants do not require or provide to public defense counsel continuing \nlegal education specific to criminal defense issues.  Defendants do not have guidelines governing \nthe identification and reassignment of conflicts of interest or the appeal of reimbursement \nrequests.  Defendants do not monitor caseloads of public defenders.  Defendants are unable to \nidentify the public defenders who are providing indigent defense services.  There is no central \nregistry of public defenders, much less their individual caseloads.     \n15.  Because of Defendantsโ lack of proper diligence, there is no practical way for an \nindependent observer to efficiently determine crucial facts such as:  the number of cases assigned \nto a particular public defender; the available resources for public defenders; or the number of \ntrials or contested motions or hearings involving indigent defendants.  \n5\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 6 of 62\n \n16.  Without access to this type of data, there is no practical way for independent \nobservers to determine whether the public defense in a county or municipality is living up to the \nkey criteria for determining whether the indigent defense services are constitutionally adequate.  \nSuch hallmarks include timely meetings with indigent clients (particularly those in custody), \nconducting discovery, calling expert witnesses, and vigorously contesting the criminal charges.  \n17.  Because neither Defendants nor the counties or municipalities keep any records \nabout the indigent defense system, there is no data-driven or statistical analysis of the Utah \nindigent defense system. \n18.  Defendants have been aware of the acute problems of Utahโs indigent defense \nsystem for years.   \n19.  First, the lack of funding or oversight is obvious on its face to Defendants.  \nDefendants have long been aware that Utah is truly an outlier among the states in that it is nearly \nalone in providing no state funding or oversight whatsoever.     \n20.  Moreover, despite the difficulty in data collection, over the last several years, \nseveral reports have been issued regarding Defendantsโ provision of indigent defense.  Each has \nfound a system in crisis.  \n21.  For example, in 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah published its \ninvestigation of indigent defense entitled โFailing Gideon: Utahโs Flawed County-by-County \nPublic Defender Systemโ (www.acluutah.org/images/Failing_Gideon.pdf) (last viewed on June \n20, 2016).  \n22.  In 2012, the Sixth Amendment Center was engaged by the Utah Judicial Council \n(through a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice) to conduct an assessment of Utahโs \n6\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 7 of 62\n \nindigent defense system.  On October 26, 2015, the Sixth Amendment Center published its report \nentitled โThe Right to Counsel in Utah โ An Assessment of Trial-Level Indigent Defense \nServicesโ (sixthamendment.org/what-we-do/our-current-projects/Utah-project-page/) (the โ6AC \nReportโ) (sixthamendment.org/what-we-do/our-current-projects/Utah-project-page/) (last viewed \non June 20, 2016). \n23.  On the same day, the Utah Judicial Council published its companion analysis \nentitled โReport โ Judicial Council Study Committee on the Representation of Indigent Criminal \nDefendants in Trial Courtsโ which can be found at \n(https://www.utcourts.gov/knowcts/adm/docs/Indigent_Defense_Committee_Report.pdf) (last \nviewed on June 20, 2016). \n24.  Each report speaks for itself as to the glaring deficiencies in the system.   \n25.  As a direct result of the Defendantsโ actions, the named Plaintiffs in this action \nare suffering ongoing harm. All of them have had very little time to meet with their public \ndefenders before critical events in their cases, some having spent weeks in jail without any \ncontact, making it impossible for them to meaningfully participate in the defense.  Some have \nbeen forced to meet with their defenders in the presence of others awaiting criminal hearings \nbecause their defenders lack the resources to arrange for private meetings.  Several have not had \ntheir attorneys assist them in having the court review their bail in a meaningful way.   Each of \ntheir attorneys are compromised in their ability to engage necessary resources like experts and \ninvestigators.  Each are likely to feel pressure to accept a disadvantageous plea deal that they are \nunlikely to fully understand, and are unlikely to be fully advised by their attorneys of the long \n7\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 8 of 62\n \nterm consequences of a guilty plea.  All face significant time incarcerated if convicted of their \ncharges. \n26.  The State of Utah recently passed legislation pertaining to the provision of \nindigent defense services.  As explained more thoroughly below, that legislation is wholly \nineffective in stemming the current, ongoing crisis, and the prospect that it will lead to \nsignificant improvements in the future is uncertain at best. \n27.  As a direct result of Defendantsโ actions and inactions, members of the Plaintiffsโ \nClass have suffered, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n28.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief pursuant to UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 78A-5-102 (original jurisdiction), Utah. R. Civ. \nP. 57 (declaratory judgments), and UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 78B-6-401 (jurisdiction of declaratory \njudgment action). \n29.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants under Utah. R. Civ. P. \n17.  Defendant Sean D. Reyes is a public official of the State of Utah who is sued in his official \ncapacity in order to enforce the performance of his official duties, UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 67-5-1 \n(duties of the attorney general), and the State has consented to be sued for violations of its own \nConstitution.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Utah Const. Art. VIII, ยง 5 and \nUTAH CODE ANN. ยง 78A-5-102(1) (jurisdiction of district court). \n30.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 78B-3-302 \nbecause Defendants are found in the State of Utah and committed certain wrongs giving rise to \nthis action within this judicial district.   \n8\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 9 of 62\n \nPARTIES \nI.  PLAINTIFFS \n31.  Class-Action Representative Colton Guy Remick (โRemickโ) is currently \nincarcerated in the Tooele County Detention Center in Tooele, Utah, with pending charges of \npossession of a forgery device (3rd Degree Felony), possession or use of a controlled substance \n(3rd Degree Felony), and use or possession of drug paraphernalia (Class B Misdemeanor).  \nDespite being incarcerated since May 4, 2016, Remick has only spoken to his public defender \nonce, at his initial appearance.  When Remick met with his public defender, it was only for a \nshort time and was in the presence of many other defendants, rather than in a confined, \nconfidential location.  Other defendants assigned to the same public defender were in a line \nwaiting to meet with the public defender; because of the wait, some defendants were incented to \naccept a plea deal because, if a plea deal was rejected, defendant would have to go to the back of \nthe line, and wait at least one more hour to again speak with the public defender.  \n32.  Class-action representative Plaintiff Skylar W. Garner (โGarnerโ) is a 32 year old \nmarried man with two children under the age of five who is currently incarcerated in the Carbon \nCounty jail due to a violation of a No Contact order.  Prior to his arrest, Garner held two jobs as \na technician and maintenance specialist.  Since his arrest, he has had very little contact with his \npublic defender.  The public defender has given Garner no discovery or police reports.  His \npublic defender has made no inquiry of Garner as to the facts surrounding the charge.  He has \nspoken with his public defender for less than 5 minutes.   \n33.  Class-Action Representative Bryce Tucker Lloyd (โLloydโ) is currently \nincarcerated in the Tooele County Detention Center located in Tooele, Utah, with pending \ncharges of burglary (2nd degree felony), unlawful acquisition, possession, or transfer of a card \n9\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 10 of 62\n \n(3rd degree felony), possession or use of a controlled substance (3rd degree felony), unlawful use \nof a financial transaction (Class B misdemeanor), and use or possession of drug paraphernalia \n(Class B misdemeanor).  When Lloyd met with his public defender at his initial appearance, it \nwas only for a short time and was in the presence of several other defendants, rather than in a \nconfined, confidential location.  Lloydโs public defender has been so habitually unresponsive to \nhis inquiries that Lloyd has stopped attempting to contact him. \n34.  Class Action Representative Plaintiff Anthony Murdzak (โMurdzakโ) is currently \nincarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in Logan, Utah, with pending charges of theft (3rd \nDegree Felony) and violation of firearm restrictions (Class A Misdemeanor).  Murdzak was \narrested on May 28, 2016, but not arraigned until June 7, 2016, ten days after his arrest, at which \npoint he was appointed counsel.  He did not meet with counsel prior to the arraignment and the \nonly meeting he had with his defense counsel was during the arraignment.  Murdzak received no \ncharging sheet and was not aware of the charges against him and had no information as to why \nthe firearm restriction charge had been made, as he had no firearm at the time of his arrest, nor \nwas one found in the vehicle in which he was driving.  Following the arraignment, Murdzak had \nnot met with defense counsel, had received no discovery, was unaware of when he would next \nmeet with his defense counsel or when a preliminary hearing was set for his case. \n35.  Class Action Representative Plaintiff Colter Ricks (โRicksโ) is currently \nincarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in Logan, Utah, with pending charges of failure to \nstop (Class A Misdemeanor), possession of drug paraphernalia (Class A Misdemeanor) and \npossession of methamphetamine (3rd Degree Felony).  Ricks was arrested on May 28, 2016.  He \nwas arraigned on May 31, 2016 via video conference.  Mr. Ricks had no counsel at the time of \n10\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 11 of 62\n \nhis arraignment and during the arraignment, bail for a prior charge was revoked and bail for his \ncurrent charges was denied.  It was only after bail had been revoked on the prior charge and had \nbeen denied for the current charges that Ricks was appointed counsel.  Despite having counsel \nappointed after the arraignment, Ricks has not met with defense counsel.  Ricksโ pre-trial hearing \nis set for June 27, by which point he will have spent a month in jail, having not met with a \ndefense lawyer. \n36.  Class Action Representative Plaintiff Brandon Timms (โTimmsโ) is currently \nincarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in Logan, Utah, with pending charges of theft \n(Class B Misdemeanor) and burglary (2nd Degree Felony).  Timms was originally arrested in \nSalt Lake County, but was transported and incarcerated in the Cache County Jail because the \noffenses for which he was charged allegedly took place in Logan, Utah.  While he was arrested \non June 2, 2016, Timms was not arraigned until June 13, 2016, eleven days after his initial arrest \nand was not provided with counsel before his arraignment.   \nII.  DEFENDANTS \n37.  Defendant State of Utah (โState of Utahโ or โUtahโ) is sued for violations of the \nUtah State Constitution.  The State Capitol and center of State government are located in Salt \nLake County. \n38.  Defendant Sean D. Reyes (โDefendant AGโ or โUtah AGโ) is the elected \nAttorney General of Utah and is sued in his official capacity as the person in charge of enforcing \nlaws of the State of Utah and the Utah and U.S. Constitutions.  Pursuant to Article VII, ยง 16 of \nthe Constitution of Utah, the Attorney General โshall be the legal adviser of the State officers . . .  \nand shall perform such other duties as provided by law.โ  The Utah AG is part of the executive \nbranch. \n11\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 12 of 62\n \n39.  In his constitutional role as โlegal adviser,โ the Utah AG has an implied duty to \nensure that Utah protects the constitutional rights of all of people in Utah, including the right to \nlegal counsel when facing criminal charges carrying the possibility of incarceration.  The Utah \nAttorney General also has a duty to ensure that Utah follows its own laws, including statutes \nrequiring effective representation of indigent defendants.  As described herein, the Utah AG has \nfailed to live up to these duties. \n40.  The Utah AG maintains his principal office at the Office of the Attorney General, \nUtah State Capitol Complex, 350 North State Street, Suite 230, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114, \nwhich is located in Salt Lake City and within this judicial district.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n41.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all previous and following allegations of this \nComplaint as if fully laid out here. \n42.  Plaintiffs Remick, Garner, Lloyd, Murdzak, Timms  and Ricks bring this action \npursuant to Utah R. Civ. P. 23(a), 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) on behalf of themselves and all \nothers similarly situated. \n43.  The class represented by the named Plaintiffs (the โClassโ) consists of all indigent \npersons statewide who have been or will be charged with crimes for which incarceration is a \npossible consequence of a conviction.     \n44.  As indigent persons unable to afford to hire counsel to defend them, class \nmembers are dependent upon Defendants to provide them with counsel and other associated \nservices necessary for their defense.    \n45.  Class members have been and are continuing to be harmed by the Defendantsโ \nfailure to fund, administer, or supervise Utahโs indigent criminal defense system as guaranteed \n12\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 13 of 62\n \nby the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Art. I,  ยง 7 and \n12 of the Utah Constitution, and as required under the Utah Indigent Defense Act (Utah Code \nAnn. ยง 77-32-101 et. seq.).  While the named Plaintiffs have been criminally charged and \nprovided public defenders in three counties, the harms they face are representative of the \nproblems faced by indigent defendants in all counties statewide.   \n46.  Certification of this action as a class action is appropriate under Utah R. Civ. P. \n23(b) for the following reasons: \n(a)  Separate prosecution of these actions by individual class members would \ncreate a risk of differing and inconsistent adjudications, creating the possibility of establishing \nincompatible standards of conduct for Defendants with respect to members of the Class; \n(b)  The Class is so numerous and fluid as to make joinder of all members of \nthe Class impracticable.  At any point in time, hundreds of indigent persons with pending \ncriminal charges punishable by imprisonment must rely on appointed defense counsel for legal \nrepresentation; \n(c)  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that are generally \napplicable to the Class, making declaratory relief with respect to the entire Class appropriate; \nand,  \n(d)  Common questions of law, fact, and relief relating to and affecting the \nindividual rights of class members predominate over any questions affecting individual class \nmembers.   \n47.  Questions of law common to the class include, but are not limited to:   \n13\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 14 of 62\n \n(a)  Whether Defendants have a Constitutional duty under both the United \nStates Constitution and the Utah Constitutions to provide counsel and related services to indigent \npersons charged with crimes for which incarceration is possible;  \n(b)  The extent and nature of Defendantsโ Constitutional duties to provide \noversight and supervision for appointed counsel and related defense services to the class \nmembers;  \n(c)  Whether Defendants are in violation of their obligations under the Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to ensure that defense counsel \nappointed for class members have the resources necessary to provide class members with \nconstitutionally adequate representation;  \n(d)  Whether Defendants are in violation of their obligations under Art. I, ยงยง 7 \nand 12 of the Utah Constitution to ensure that defense counsel appointed for class members have \nthe resources necessary to provide class members with constitutionally adequate representation; \n(e)  Whether Defendants are in violation of their obligation under Utah Code \nAnn. ยง 77-32-101 et. seq. to ensure that indigent defense services provided by the State of Utah \ncomport with the standards laid out in the Act; and  \n(f)  Whether the Stateโs delegation of the responsibility for indigent defense to \nthe counties creates disparate access to the fundamental right to counsel in violation of both the \nSixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Art. I, ยง 24 \nof the Utah Constitution, which states:  โAll laws of a general nature shall have uniform \noperations.โ \n48.  Questions of fact common to the class include, but are not limited to: \n14\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 15 of 62\n \n(a)  Whether Defendants have failed to ensure that defense counsel appointed \nto represent class members have been provided with the resources necessary to adequately \nchallenge the Stateโs charges against the class members; and \n(b)  Whether, as a result of Defendantsโ actions and omissions, class members \nhave been and are currently being harmed based on the inability of appointed defense counsel to \nprovide them with constitutionally and statutorily adequate legal representation. \n49.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class as a \nwhole.   \n50.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs arise from the same acts and/or omissions of \nDefendants, as do the claims of the members of the Class. \n51.  Class members have no significant interest in individual control of these claims \nthat would make class action inappropriate. \n52.  The resolution of the claims presented by the Class is more likely to result in fair \nand efficient adjudication than other available methods. \n53.  Based on these facts, prosecution of this case as a class action is superior and \npreferable to the prosecution of myriad individual actions. \n54.  The individuals identified as named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the Class and will vigorously prosecute this suit on behalf of the Class.  Plaintiffs \nand their legal counsel know of no conflicts of interest between the named Plaintiffs as \nrepresentatives and class members concerning the relief sought in this complaint.   \n55.  The named Plaintiffs are jointly represented by attorneys associated with the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Utah (โACLUโ) and the law firm of Holland & Hart LLP.  \n15\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 16 of 62\n \nThe ACLU has extensive experience in successfully representing individuals and classes in \nsimilar actions.  The attorneys for the named Plaintiffs are capable and experienced litigators, are \nattorneys of good reputation, and have successfully represented plaintiffs in state and federal \ncourts in complex litigation.  Plaintiffsโ attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all \nclaims in this action, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class. \nFACTS ENTITLING CLASS-ACTION PLAINTIFFS TO RELIEF \nI.  DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO PERFORM THEIR DUTY TO PROVIDE \nINDIGENT DEFENSE AFTER HAVING DELEGATED THE RESPONSIBILITY \nTO COUNTIES AND MUNICIPALITIES \n56.  It is a core guarantee of the Sixth Amendment that every criminal defendant, \nregardless of economic means, has the right to counsel when facing incarceration.  Gideon, 372 \nU.S. at 340-344 (holding that the right to counsel is โfundamental and essential to a fair trialโ).  \nThis right is so fundamental that any impairment of the right erodes the principles of liberty and \njustice that underpin all civil rights in criminal proceedings.  The duty to provide criminal \nindigent defense is placed on the states.  Id., at 342.   \n57.  The State of Utah has delegated its Sixth Amendment responsibility to the \ncounties and municipal legislative bodies, UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 77-32-306.  \nA.  Failure to Supervise and Oversee Utahโs Indigent Defense System \n58.  After delegating its Sixth Amendment responsibilities, Defendants have done \nnothing to ensure that the indigent defense system in Utah and the provision of indigent defense \nby the counties and municipalities is of a quality that meets constitutional standards. \n59.  As the principals responsible for indigent defense, Defendants have allowed their \nagents (i.e., the counties and municipalities) to operate without any accountability or governance \nas to the essential elements of a criminal defense system for indigent persons.  Defendants leave \n16\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 17 of 62\n \neach county and municipality to its own devices in providing indigent defense with no obligation \nto report on those activities to Defendants. \n60.  Defendants have failed to require their agents to report on the indigent defense the \nagents provide.  As a direct and proximate result, Defendants cannot determine if Utahโs indigent \ndefense system meets constitutional standards, particularly with respect to the caseload placed on \npublic defenders.   \n61.  By purposefully failing to require their agents to report or document their \nactivities regarding indigent criminal defense, Defendants have breached their obligation to \nadminister the indigent defense system and uphold the dictates of Gideon and its progeny.   \n62.  Defendants have recently highlighted their total lack of supervision of the Utah \nindigent defense system by the Utah Legislatureโs adoption of Senate Bill 155 (โSB 115โ) which \nwas signed by Governor Herbert on March 22, 2016, and which became effective on May 10, \n2016.   \n63.  SB 115 creates and describes the duties of the Utah Indigent Defense Commission \n(โUID Commissionโ).  ยง 77-32-804, UTAH CODE ANN.  Among other things, SB 155 allows, but \ndoes not require, the UID Commission to maintain โoversight to collect data, audit attorney \nperformance, establish standards and enforce the principles listed above.โ  ยง 77-32-\n804(1)(a)(vii), UTAH CODE ANN.   \n64.  SB 115 also instructs the UID Commission to โdevelop and adopt guiding \nprinciples,โ for indigent defense systems, ยง 77-32-804(1)(a)(i) (emphasis added), and to \nโdevelop and oversee the establishment of advisory caseload principlesโ ยง 77-32-804(1)(b) \n(emphasis added.) \n17\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 18 of 62\n \n65.  SB 155 does not require counties and municipalities to follow any โguiding \nprinciplesโ or โadvisory caseload principles, โ which the UID Commission will set at some point \nin the future.   \n66.  Rather, counties and municipalities will decide whether to undertake various steps \nto potentially qualify for grant money from the UID Commission, including passing a resolution \nadopting UID Commission standards, submitting a certified copy of that resolution, submitting a \ngrant application, and making additional expenditures of their own, unless they can show certain \nconditions are met.  See ยงยง 77-32-806 & 807.   \n67.  The only consequences a county or municipality faces for not meeting or adopting \nUID Commission standards is potentially losing grant money, ยง 77-32-806(2), or potentially \nbeing ineligible for grant money, ยง 77-32-807(5).   \n68.  As of the date of this Complaint, the UID Commission has not commenced \ncollecting data pertaining to the Utah indigent defense system or fulfilled any of the other \nstatutory directives given to the UID Commission.   \n69.  Upon information and belief, the collection of data and auditing of public \ndefender performance is months or years away from completion.  Also upon information and \nbelief, the UID Commission is months or years away from issuing any advisory guidelines about \nindigent defense provision for counties or municipalities.   \n70.  In the meantime, Plaintiffs and the class members continue to face actual and \nconstructive denials of their constitutional rights by Defendants.  The actions of the Utah \nLegislature are totally inadequate to address the problems. \n18\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 19 of 62\n \n71.  Defendantsโ present refusal to monitor the indigent defense systems in any county \nor municipality constitutes a willful disregard of the State of Utahโs constitutional obligations.  \nDefendantsโ delegation of their constitutional duties to counties and municipalities does not \nrelieve them of their constitutional duties.   \n72.  Likewise, the public defenders contracted by the counties and municipalities are \nnot to blame for the systemic problems they and their clients face every day as a result \nDefendantsโ complete failure to fund or oversee indigent defense. \n73.  The fact that Defendants cannot ascertain the status of indigent criminal defense is \nnot a viable defense to the claims brought before this Court.  The ultimate responsibility lies with \nthe Defendants, not the counties and municipalities.   \n74.  Furthermore, Defendant Utah AG has the statutory authority to require the district \nand county attorneys to report on the conditions of the indigent criminal defense system, ยง 67-5-\n1(6), UTAH CODE ANN., but has failed to request or obtain such reports. \nB.  Defendantsโ Knowledge of Constitutional Deficiencies \n75.  Although Defendants have attempted to keep themselves ignorant of the operation \nof criminal justice in Utah state courts by failing to supervise the state public defender system, \nthe Defendants have known about the systemic deficiencies for many years.   \n76.  First, it has been a continuing, conscious choice by Defendants to neither fund nor \noversee the system at all.  Defendants have known for years that Utah is nearly alone in refusing \nto provide any state resources of any kind to assist the counties and municipalities in providing \nthis constitutionally mandated service.  \n77.  In 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah published โFailing Gideon โ \nUtahโs Flawed County-by-County Public Defender Systemโ (โFailing Gideonโ).  \n19\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 20 of 62\n \n78.  A second investigative report was published in 2015 by the Study Committee on \nthe Representation of Indigent Criminal Defendants in Trial Court (the โStudy Committeeโ).  \nThe Study Committee was formed in 2011 and is part of the Utah Judicial Council which is the \npolicy-making body for the judicial branch as authorized by the Utah State Constitution, UTAH \nCODE ANN. ยง 78A-2-104(4).  The Utah Judicial Council is responsible for the promulgation of \nuniform rules and standards to ensure the proper administration of the courts in Utah, as required \nby Article VIII, ยง 12 of the Utah Constitution.   \n79.  The Study Committee was asked โto assess the provision of indigent criminal \ndefense services at the trial level in Utah courts and to identify any concerns and make \nappropriate recommendations for improvementโ (https://www.utcourts.gov/knowcts/adm/).   \n80.  The Study Committee engaged the Sixth Amendment Center (a non-profit \nMassachusetts entity) to perform a study of Utahโs indigent defense systems.  In October, 2015, \nthe Sixth Amendment Center published its 6AC Report.  Simultaneously, the Study Committee \npublished its own report (โStudy Committee Reportโ).   \n81.  The Study Committee Report cited three major structural issues affecting indigent \ncriminal defense:   \nA.  The lack of State oversight of the county and municipal indigent defense \nsystems; \nB.  Contracting โconventions,โ such as all-inclusive, flat-fee contracts, which \ncreate systemic disincentives pitting an attorneyโs financial interests against the best interest of a \nclient; and  \n20\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 21 of 62\n \nC.  Justice courts in which high volume caseloads and lack of uniformity \ncompromise constitutional requirements for adequate defense of indigent defendants. \n82.  The 6AC Report is subdivided into two categories:  (1) actual denial of counsel; \nand (2) constructive denial of counsel.   \n83.  With respect to the actual denial of counsel, the 6AC Report cited, inter alia;  (1) \nfailure to appoint counsel at the early critical stages of a criminal prosecution; (2) accepting a \nwaiver of the right to counsel without a colloquy between judge and defendant to ascertain if the \nwaiver was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made; (3) pleas accepted without counsel; \nand (4) interference of prosecutors and judges in plea negotiation with respect to persons \nunrepresented by counsel.   \n84.  The 6AC Report focused extensively on the constructive denial of counsel to \nindigent persons, including:  (1) the lack of accountability for indigent defense on the part of \nDefendant State of Utah, the counties and municipalities; (2) the structure of indigent defense, \nparticularly in Justice Courts; (3) the role of county prosecutors in the selection, evaluation and \nretention of public defenders; (4) financial conflicts created through flat-fee contracting and \nfunding of investigative and trial related expenses; and (5) workloads of public defenders, \nincluding time for contesting the prosecutionโs case. \n85.  The deficiencies of the Utah indigent defense system have persisted for many \nyears without any substantive efforts by Defendants to redress those constitutional defects.   \nC.  Standards for Constitutionally Sufficient Defense \n86.  There is a national consensus and strong legal precedent on what constitutes \nconstitutionally adequate indigent defenseโboth at the systemic level and at the level of \nindividual defense providers.   \n21\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 22 of 62\n \n87.  In United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984), the United States Supreme \nCourt recognized that the Sixth Amendment is violated when a criminal defendant is \nconstructively denied counsel.   \n88.  Constructive denial of counsel occurs when, among other things, an indigent \ndefendant is denied assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings, when defense \ncounsel utterly fails to investigate the underlying facts of a case, or when defense counsel fails to \nsubject the prosecutionโs case to meaningful adversarial testing, or represents conflicting \ninterests.    \n89.  The American Bar Association (โABAโ) approved the Ten Principles of a Public \nDefense Delivery System (the โTen Principlesโ), which establish the fundamental criteria \nnecessaryโat the systemic levelโto provide effective, efficient, and conflict-free legal \nrepresentation to its clients.  The Ten Principles reflect a national consensus regarding the \nprerequisites for constitutionally adequate indigent defense reached by representatives from each \nof the fifty states, the civil bar, and all segments of the criminal justice systemโincluding \njudges, prosecutors, private defense counsel, public defenders, court personnel, and academics \nactive in criminal justice. \n90.  The Ten Principles state that to have constitutionally adequate indigent defense:  \n(a) defense counsel should be an equal partner in the justice system, with the same resources as \nprosecuting attorneys; (b) only qualified counsel should represent indigent defendants; (c) clients \nshould be appropriately screened for eligibility for public defense services; (d) defense counsel \nshould receive the training necessary to perform competently; (e) there should be attorney \nperformance standards and adequate supervision and oversight to ensure compliance with those \n22\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 23 of 62\n \nstandards; (f) workloads should be monitored; and (g) indigent defense systems should be \nindependent from undue political influence, to ensure that counsel are free to make decisions \nnecessary to meaningfully advocate for their clients. \n91.  The ABA and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (โNLADAโ) \nhave also promulgated performance standards for constitutionally adequate indigent defense \ncounsel with respect to individual providers.  Those standards dictate that indigent defense \ncounsel:  (a) have adequate knowledge of the relevant areas of law; (b) act with reasonable \ndiligence and promptness, avoiding unnecessary delay in the disposition of cases; (c) provide \nrepresentation at every critical stage of their clientโs proceedings; (d) conduct reasonable factual \nand legal pre-trial investigations into the charges against their clients, pursue available formal \nand informal discovery procedures and use appropriate and necessary experts; and (e) consult \nwith their clients in order to elicit relevant information about the case, to inform clients of their \nrights, and to enable clients to make informed decisions about the direction of their cases. \n92.  Attached as Appendix 1 to the Study Committee Report is a white paper authored \nby Hon. Derek P. Pullan of the Fourth Judicial District Court entitled โTHE CONSTITUTIONAL \nRIGHT TO COUNSEL โ EVALUATING THE HEALTH OF UTAHโS INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEMโ \n(โPullan Reportโ).  Judge Pullan articulated seven factors to be used in assessing the health of \nUtahโs public defense system: \nA.  Independent representation, which includes the exclusion of county \nattorneys and judges from hiring and supervising public defenders; \n23\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 24 of 62\n \nB.  Representation without conflicts of interest, which encompasses systemic \nconflicts of interest arising from the contract terms of engagement, the manner of \nselection, funding and payment of defense counsel; \nC.  Representation without interference, such as not providing a private place \nfor attorney-client confidential communications; \nD.  Representation at all critical stages, which includes custodial \ninterrogations, lineups, initial appearances, bail hearings, preliminary examination, \narraignment, plea bargaining, sentencing and the first appeal of right; \nE.  Representation that ensures meaningful adversarial testing of the Stateโs \nevidence, which includes qualified counsel (ability, training and experience), access to \ndefense resources (e.g., investigators, expert witnesses and scientific or medical testing) \nand reasonable caseload standards; \nF.  Fair compensation and proper incentives; and \nG.  Case specific and systemic quality control, including minimum \nperformance standards and collection of meaningful data. \n93.  The State of Utah passed the Indigent Defense Act of 1965 (the โActโ).  The Act \nhas been amended and is currently set forth in ยงยง 77-32-101 et seq., UTAH CODE ANN.  The legal \ndefense standards for Utahโs public defender are defined in ยง 77-32-201(8), UTAH CODE ANN.: \nA.  Provide defense counsel for each indigent who faces the potential \ndeprivation of the indigentโs liberty; \nB.  Afford timely representation by defense counsel; \nC.  Provide the defense resources necessary for a complete defense; \n24\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 25 of 62\n \nD.  Assure undivided loyalty of defense counsel to the client; \nE.  Provide a first appeal of right; and \nF.  Prosecute other remedies before or after a conviction, considered by \ndefense counsel to be in the interest of justice except for other and subsequent \ndiscretionary appeals or discretionary writ proceedings. \n94.  Defendants have failed to meet or maintain the statutory mandates of the Act as \nfurther described below.  Furthermore, Defendants have failed to fulfill the constitutional \nstandards articulated in the Ten Principles, by the NLADA and in the Pullan Report. \n95.  Among other things, Defendants have allowed a system to develop in which \ncounties and municipalities are not providing timely and competent legal counsel, are denying \npublic defenders investigatory resources necessary for a complete defense, and creating \nconditions making it practically impossible for public counsel to provide undivided loyalty to \ntheir clients.   \n96.  The substandard performance of the indigent criminal defense system is on-going \nand continuous, thereby damaging the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, and those similarly \nsituated. \nII.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEFICIENCIES OF THE UTAH INDIGENT \nDEFENSE SYSTEM ARE OPEN AND NOTORIOUS   \nA.  Defendants Exercise No Administrative Oversight Over the Indigent Defense \nSystem. \n97.  Defendants are not taking any steps to ensure that their agents are living up to the \nminimum constitutional and statutory requirements of indigent defense.   \n98.  Notwithstanding the generalized responsibilities Defendant Utah AG has over \nDefendantโs provision of indigent defense, Utah presently has no statewide entity or official with \n25\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 26 of 62\n \nthe unambiguous mandate to ensure Defendantsโ compliance with their constitutional obligations \non an ongoing basis.   \n99.  Utah has no official or entity empowered to take any binding, remedial actions to \nfix the countiesโ and municipalitiesโ failure to comply.     \n100.  Defendants do not supervise the provision of indigent defense services in \nmisdemeanor and felony criminal actions in any of Utahโs twenty-nine counties.   \n101.  Defendants have not implemented any safeguards to ensure that counties comply \nwith the Act and with national performance standards.   \n102.  National standards require ongoing training, professional development, and \ncontinuing legal education.  Indigent defense counsel must acquire and maintain lawyering skills, \nas well as keep current with new developments in the complex and rapidly changing field of \ncriminal law.   \n103.  Defendants do not provide resources for attorney training, nor require attorney \nperformance evaluations.  Defendants do not oversee workload limits.  As a result, only two of \nUtahโs twenty-nine counties (i.e., Salt Lake and Utah counties) have implemented a formal \ntraining program for indigent defense counsel at the insistence and direction of the legal defender \nassociations in those two counties.   \n104.  Most counties rely on private low-bid contracts without any investigation into the \nqualifications of the applicants.  Lacking formal orientation, newly hired attorneys have no \nopportunity to acquire and maintain the skills and legal knowledge necessary to put the \nprosecutionโs case to the crucible of adversarial testing.  Counties do not provide or fund training \n26\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 27 of 62\n \nprograms for contracted attorneys to hone their skills and remain knowledgeable of significant \nchanges in the law.  \n105.  The very recently formed UIC Commission, by its nature, has no power at all to \ntake any binding action to bring any county or municipality failing to provide adequate defense \ninto compliance.  The UIC Commission is advisory in nature, and counties and municipalities \nhave no obligation to follow any of its guidelines.  \n106.  By contrast, Defendants, through the Utah Prosecution Council (โUPCโ) provide \nnumerous opportunities for ongoing education and training for county prosecutors.  Counties \noften pay for prosecutorsโ training and memberships in statewide associations for prosecutors \nand other professional associations. \n107.  National standards further mandate that indigent defense programs subject their \nattorneys to systematic supervision and evaluation based on publicized practice standards.  Utah \nhas no statewide supervision or evaluation policies.  Defendants keep no records, documents, \nfiles, or written protocol of any kind to monitor the indigent defense system.  Defendants have no \nsystem in place to ensure that counties set practice standards or methods of evaluation, \nsupervision, and monitoring to ensure the adequate assistance of indigent defense counsel. \n108.  The lack of basic supervision results in inevitably hampering the quality of \nrepresentation across the state.  While every county and municipality suffers from its own \nsystemic issues, there are some counties and municipalities where there are more and more acute \nproblems.   \n27\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 28 of 62\n \n109.  The lack of supervision also results in counties attempting to save money by \nrelying on overworked, underpaid, inexperienced, untrained, understaffed and often conflicted \ncounsel.   \n110.  Most Utah counties award indigent defense contracts based on the lowest cost \npossible, without regard to constitutional adequacy.  Under such contracts, defenders are left to \npolice their own caseloads and report when they become too burdensome.  The potential for \nrecriminations and reprisals (e.g., terminating or not renewing a public defender contract) if \npublic defenders complain about excessive caseloads militates against public defenders making \nany objection to caseloads and lack of resources.   \nB.  Defendants Do Not Consistently Provide Legal Counsel to Indigent \nDefendants at All Critical Stages of the Criminal Prosecution.   \n111.  The constructive denial of legal counsel to indigent defendants commences at the \nhiring of public defenders.  From stem to stern, the hiring and supervision of public defenders is \ndefective ab initio. \n112.  With limited exceptions, Utah counties have coalesced around two models.  In \nSalt Lake and Utah counties, the county commissioners have engaged by contract a single, not-\nfor-profit provider of legal defense to indigents.   \n113.  Outside of those two counties, and in every municipality, the counties and \nmunicipalities contract with private attorneys to provide services in either the District and Justice \ncourts, or both.   \n114.  The countiesโ and municipalitiesโ selection of private attorneys for indigent \ndefense contracts is fraught with inherent defects.  The governmental bodies awarding contracts \nto the public defenders consist of elected officials who are usually not law trained.  They do not \n28\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 29 of 62\n \nhave backgrounds in legal matters and are not acquainted with the skills and experience level the \npublic defenders should have.   \n115.  Moreover, because the cost of the indigent defense system is borne by each of the \nseparate counties and municipalitiesโ and their general tax funds, the officials are motivated to \nkeep the costs as low as possible without regard to the constitutional sufficiency of the defense \nsystem.   \n116.  Because of this lack of law training, the officials often turn to the county or city \nattorneys for advice and guidance in selecting the private attorneys to be hired for indigent \ndefense.  In effect, the prosecutors are involved in hiring their opposing counsel, which \nconstitutes a self-evident conflict of interest.   \n117.  The contracts used by nearly all counties and municipalities are annual, flat-fee \narrangements.  Under such contracts, the private attorney and the county or municipality \nnegotiate a set price for all services on a yearly basis.  Such contracts make no accommodation \nfor an increase in the number of cases assigned to the public defender or the complexity of any \nparticular case.  \n118.  In most counties, there is no prohibition against public defenders having private \nclients while fulfilling the flat-fee annual contract with the county.  In those instances, the public \ndefender is conflicted by the duty to the private clients (who usually will pay more money on an \nhourly or project basis than the public defender contract) and the contractual duty to represent \nindigent defendants.   \n29\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 30 of 62\n \n119.  Under the flat-fee annual contract, the public defender will not be paid any more \nor less for the number or complexity of cases; whereas his/her annual income can be increased \nby dedicating more time and energy into private practice.   \n120.  Because of the structure of the contractual commitment, the average public \ndefender is economically motivated to do as little as possible regarding the indigent defendants \nand to increase his/her productivity with respect to private clients.  From the inception of the \ncontract, the contracts create a conflict, which compromises the defense of people unable to pay \nfor an attorney.   \n121.  By way of illustration, not limitation, attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a copy of the \nRequest for Qualification for Kane County Public Defender Services (โKane County RFQโ) to \nwhich was attached the Public Defender AgreementโโTrial ServicesโโMarch 1, 2016 โ February \n28, 2018 (โKane County PD Contractโ).  Responses to the Kane County RFQ were due on \nMarch 2, 2016.  The Kane County PD Contract embodies the same systemic problems that \nplague all flat-rate annual contracts.  The annual flat-rate is $60,844.10.  See Scope of Work in \nKane County RFQ and ยถ 5.1 of the Kane County PD Contract.   \n122.  Before the Kane County public defender may use an expert witness, the trial court \nmust approve the expert witness feesโโa requirement that the county prosecutors do not have to \ncomply with.  This requirement places a burden on the public defenders, because a motion to \napprove the payment of expert witnesses fees will often require the disclosure of discovery and \ntrial strategy and because it places key decisions about what is needed for a proper defense in the \njudgeโs hands and out of the defenseโs hands.  Furthermore, the public defender must โuse his \nbest efforts to minimize the cost and expenses.โ  Kane County PD Contract at ยถ 3.9.  \n30\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 31 of 62\n \nExtraordinary unforeseen expenses may be requested from the non-lawyer county \ncommissioners.  Kane County PD Contract at ยถ 5.3.  Private practice is not prohibited.  Kane \nCounty PD Contract at ยถ 7.9.   \n123.  The Kane County PD Contract demonstrates that various Utah counties continue \nto use contracts with built-in conflicts.   \n124.  Beginning in October 2015, legal counsel for Plaintiffs issued a series of \ndocument requests to all Utah county commissions and District Courts under the auspices of the \nGovernment Records Access and Management Act, ยงยง 63G-2-101, et seq., UTAH CODE ANN. \n(โGRAMAโ).   \n125.  All county Commissions were asked to produce copies of records pertaining to \nthe indigent defense system in each county, including copies of any public defender contracts \nand minutes of any county commission meetings pertaining to indigent defense.  \n126.  Like the Kane County PD Contract, county commissions have used the flat-rate \nannual contract format  to provide indigent legal services.  In addition to the intrinsic flaws \ncontained in the Kane County PD Contract, other flat-rate contracts require that the public \ndefender pay for expert witness fees, testing and investigative research out of their own pocket, \nwith no additional monies from the county.   \n127.  Stunningly, certain counties require public defenders to pay for substitute counsel \nin the event the public defender is conflicted out of representation, which dampers the \nwillingness of public defenders to acknowledge conflicts. \n31\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 32 of 62\n \n128.  County commission minutes and related documents produced in response to the \nGRAMA requests do not show any public defenders having requested or being granted \nadditional monies for extraordinary expenses by the county commissioners.   \n129.  In the cases where the public defender must pay for expert witness fees, testing \nand investigations, there are no produced documents showing expenditures in excess of the \nyearly flat-rate.   \n130.  Defendants have provided no directives, oversight or supervision with respect to \nthe types of contracts utilized by Utah counties with public defenders.  Defendants have allowed \nsuch contracts to continue and to proliferate.  Defendants have no means of requiring that public \ndefender contracts or other arrangements conform with the Utah Constitution, statutes and case \nlaw, including the recently enacted UID Commission.   \n131.  Failure to govern the indigent defense systems of the Utah counties, particularly \nthe way in which public defenders are chosen and compensated, constitutes a breach of \nDefendantsโ constitutional responsibilities to indigent criminal defendants and a violation of the \nfederal and state constitutions, statutes and attendant case law.  Plaintiffs suffer harm as public \ndefenders routinely represent conflicting interests. [Need to spell out a little more] \n132.  Over and beyond the actual contracts, Defendants have failed to regulate and \nsupervise the selection of public defenders.  Defendants provide no mechanism to ensure \nindigent defense providers are qualified for the job.  Most contracts have no written job \nqualifications other than a prerequisite in the contract that counsel be members of the Utah State \nBar Association in good standing.   \n32\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 33 of 62\n \n133.  Given the lack of hiring criteria, there is no way of telling whether indigent \ndefense counsel have the requisite ability, training, experience and adequate knowledge of \nrelevant areas of the law to match the complexity of their caseloads.   \n134.  Most counties rely on private low-bid contracts without any investigation into the \nqualifications of the applicants.  Lacking formal orientation, newly hired attorneys often have no \nopportunity to acquire and maintain the skills and legal knowledge necessary to put the \nprosecutionโs case to the meaningful crucible of adversarial testing.   \n135.  The collateral effects of a guilty plea or conviction are complex and intricate in \ntodayโs interconnected legal system.  For example, a guilty plea or verdict may have adverse \nconsequences on the indigent defendantโs eligibility for public housing, and if a landlord \nconducts a background check, private housing.  42 U.S.C. ยง 13661(c) gives public housing \nauthorities the power to deny people Section 8 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1437(f)) rental housing assistance \nbased on criminal activity.  Criminal convictions also have effects on immigration status, student \nloan eligibility, and many other issues.   \n136.  Effective criminal representation means being able to advise clients about these \ncollateral effects.  In other states, there is a state requirement for public defenders to be aware of \nsuch consequences.  For example, in New Mexico, public defenders are expected to know what \nthe consequences of a guilty plea might be on the immigration status of an indigent defendant.   \n137.  On the other hand, Utah has no such requirement for its public defenders.  In \nUtah, for example, there is no means of determining if the public defenders are knowledgeable \nabout the intersection of criminal and immigration law.  See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1227(a)(2) (crimes of \nโmoral turpitudeโ or involving controlled substances shall serve as a basis for deportation of \n33\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 34 of 62\n \naliens) and the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) which provides the US. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (ICE) agency support in the biometric and biographic identification, arrest, and \nremoval of priority aliens who are incarcerated with federal, state and local prisons and jails.   \n138.  As the parties ultimately responsible for the indigent defense systems, Defendants \nhave abnegated their responsibilities by not instituting standards by which public defenders are \nhired and perform on the job.   \n139.  With the exception of Salt Lake County and Utah County, which cover training \nexpenses, counties do not pay for any training and continuing legal education for public \ndefenders and Defendants do not provide any funding to cover such costs.  Indigent defense \ncounsel must pay for all training and continuing legal education (โCLEโ) out of pocket.  \nDefendants take no steps to ensure indigent defense counsel actually receive applicable training \nand ongoing legal education.   \n140.  By contrast, several counties directly fund training for prosecutors, and pay for \nmemberships in professional associations such as the UPC and the Statewide Association of \nProsecutors, which provide training and continuing legal education.   \n141.  Defendants contribute nothing to CLE for the attorneys representing indigent \ndefendants.  Although the Utah State Bar requires continuing legal education of all licensed \nattorneys, public defenders can satisfy these requirements by pursuing instruction in unrelated \npractice areas.  There is no requirement that public defenders keep abreast of developments in \ncriminal law or report their CLE to an authority charged with overseeing performance.   \nC.  Caseloads and Availability of Public Defenders \n34\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 35 of 62\n \n142.  Defendants do not monitor, limit or otherwise provide supervision and oversight \nof public defense counsel workloads.  Defendantโs failure to provide supervision and guidance \nhas resulted in unmanageably large workloads for indigent defense counsel.   \n143.  Workload affects the productivity and effectiveness of indigent defense counsel \nmore than any other variable.  The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards \nand Goals created by the United States Department of Justice stated in 1973 that a single, full-\ntime indigent defense counsel can reasonably be expected to handle no more than 150 felonies \nper year; or 400 misdemeanors per year; or 200 juvenile delinquency cases per year.  The \nnational standards published in 1973 may now be too high in light of the complexity of criminal \ndefense and the need for scientific testing (e.g., DNA) and detailed investigations, which did not \nexist in 1973 but which are standard procedures in 2016.    \n144.  As alleged above, Defendants do not collect meaningful data regarding the \nindigent defense system and the caseloads placed on public defenders.  Defendants cannot \ndetermine the effectiveness of indigent defense counsel if Defendants do not know who handles \npublic defense cases from one county and municipality to the next.   \n145.  Quite simply, Defendants do not know who the public defenders are, much less \nwhat the caseload is for a particular public defender.  This is particularly true because defenders \nsometimes hold contracts for various types of services within one county or city and/or with \nvarious counties and cities and/or have private clients in addition to their contract or contracts. \n146.  Defendants have not set workload limits and do not require the counties to do so.  \nA review of the sparse data available reveals that in many counties, indigent defense counsel \n35\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 36 of 62\n \nmaintain felony caseloads as high as 250 to 300 cases, almost twice the ABA recommended \nmaximum of 150, not counting any juvenile representation they may undertake.   \n147.  Many attorneys carry private caseloads in addition to the cases assigned by the \ncounty in order to supplement their income.   \n148.  Because of the prevalence in Utah of public defenders taking on multiple \ncontracts for multiple services with various counties and municipalities in addition to private \nwork, public defenders are overburdened even in counties where there the amount of criminal \ncases that public defender handles under one contract may be modest.  \n149.  Caseloads for indigent defense are often so high that attorneys spend no more \nthan a few minutes with a client prior to court proceedings.  Because of the excessive caseloads, \npublic defenders are forced into the โmeet and pleadโ syndrome where they meet their indigent \nclient a few minutes before entry of a plea agreement.  The excessive caseloads impede counselโs \nability to provide constitutionally and statutorily adequate legal representation.   In some isolated \nrural counties, caseloads may not be as pressing an issue as the other consequences of a defective \nindigent defense system.   \nD.  Funding and Resources for Indigent Defense \n150.  Each county and municipality is responsible for funding its own indigent defense \nservices.  Defendants do not provide any funding whatsoever for indigent defense. \n151.  Utah ranks 48th out of the 50 states in per capita spending for indigent \ndefendants, spending $5.22 (the national average is $11.86), with some counties spending as \nlittle as $1.87 per person per year.   \n152.  In contrast to the paltry sums spent on indigent defense, Defendants provide \ncounty prosecutors with myriad resources, which increases the disparity between prosecutors and \n36\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 37 of 62\n \ndefenders and decreases the defendersโ ability to subject the prosecutorโs case to the crucible of \nadversarial testing.  For example, the state-funded UPC, which focuses on providing legal \ntraining to prosecutors, has a substantial annual budget.  The Utah Prosecutorial Assistants \nAssociation, which received $12,000 from the UPC, provides prosecutorial assistants with legal \ntraining.  Additionally, the Statewide Association of Prosecutors, funded by dues paid by \ncounties, advances legislation to benefit prosecutors.  Finally, because prosecutors are county \nemployees, they receive state benefits, including health insurance and retirement plans, for both \nthem and their staff.   \n153.  By contrast, public defenders must hire staff, pay for overhead, and cover the \ncosts of benefits on their own. \n154.  Public defense contracts awarded in most counties do not provide additional funds \nto hire private investigators or experts.  Rather, public defenders must cover the cost of such \ninvestigations out of their own funds or make a special request for additional funding from the \ncounty or municipality.  The practical reality is that public defenders rarely hire investigators.  \n155.  In contrast, prosecutors have immediate access to the State of Utah Crime \nLaboratory and the various services it offers, including scientific consulting, law enforcement \ntraining, crime scene response, laboratory testing services,1 and courtroom testimony.  The \nBureau of Forensic Services is located within the Utah Department of Public Safety.  None of \nthose services, however, are freely available to public defenders and their clients.   \n                                                 \n1  Laboratory testing services offered to prosecutors consist of biology screening, DNA, combined DNA index \nsystem input/management, controlled substances (including suspected clandestine labs), fire debris, paint, general \ntrace and unknown substances, latent prints, footwear/tire track, automated fingerprint identification system, \nbloodstain pattern analysis, firearms, toolmarks, serial number restoration, distance determination and shooting \nscene reconstruction.  See forensicservices.utah.gov.   \n37\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 38 of 62\n \n156.  In many counties, indigent defense attorneys must appeal to county officials (who \nare usually not law trained) to have investigators, experts, and other expenses approved and paid.  \nIn cases where the county commissioners must approve extraordinary expenses requested by the \npublic defender before such expenditures can be made, the county commissionersโ lack of \ncriminal law expertise prevents them from understanding the necessity of such expenses.  For \nexample, a county commissioner without legal training cannot be expected to know when DNA \ntesting is an absolute necessity for the adequate defense of a particular indigent defendant.   \n157.  Requiring public defenders to justify such expenses to non-lawyers is another \ndeterrent to adequate, constitutional defense.  As a result, public defenders lack real \nindependence from prosecutorial and judicial influence, which is critical to our adversarial \nsystem. \n158.  The lack of funding and oversight on the part of Defendants has also resulted in \ncounties and municipalities failing to provide private spaces in the courthouses for public \ndefenders to meet with their clients.   \n159.  There are very few court facilities that have dedicated spaces in which public \ndefenders can have confidential conversations with their attorneys.  Most indigent defendants \nfirst meet and then converse with their assigned public defender in the courtroom or the hallways \noutside the courtrooms.  There is no physical barrier or door protecting the attorney-client \nprivileged discussions from other people in attendance.   \n160.  For in-custody indigent defendants, conversations with the assigned public \ndefenders often take place in group holding cells where the defendants are not assured that their \nstatements to counsel will not be overhead by other prisoners and jail personnel.   \n38\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 39 of 62\n \n161.  As a result, the confidence and trust of the indigent defendants in their public \ndefenders are severely eroded by lack of physical space.   \n162.  In Utah, indigent defendants may be ordered to repay the county โcostsโ if \nconvicted of a crime, ยง 77-32a-1, UTAH CODE ANN.  Costs are defined by statute to include \nโattorney fees of counsel assigned to represent the defendant.โ  ยง 77-32-2, UTAH CODE ANN.   \n163.  In contrast to the Miranda advisory that an attorney will be appointed if the \naccused cannot afford an attorney, indigent defendants are not regularly advised that a guilty plea \nmay entail more than just a fine.   \n164.  If recoupment is ordered and the defendant does not pay the attorney fees, the \ncounty or municipal court may move for an order to show cause why the indigent defendantโs \ndefault should not be treated as contempt of court and may โorder him committed until the costs \nor a specified part thereof, are paid.โ  UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 77-32a-8.   \n165.  As a result, indigent defendants are denied public defender services because they \nmust ultimately pay for these services if they are convicted.  Recoupment of fees has a chilling \neffect on the right to counsel. \n166.  Counties usually charge indigent defendants a flat fee for the public defense \nservices they receive, without regard to the length or complexity of their cases, the quality of the \ndefense services, or their ability to pay without substantial hardship.   \n167.  Typically, indigent defendants are charged $500 for a felony conviction and $250 \nfor a misdemeanor conviction.  These flat fees apply even if the public defender in question did \nnot incur that amount in costs or attorney time.   \n39\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 40 of 62\n \n168.  County and municipal courts make no attempt to ascertain whether indigent \nclients can pay the recoupment fees without substantial hardship and routinely assess the fees \ndespite the fact that these indigent clients have already filled out forms with their financial \ninformation to indicate they qualify for free assistance of counsel.  \n169.  Many of the countiesโ contracts with public defenders require the attorney to \nprovide information to the county prosecutors as to their clientsโ ability to pay the recoupment \ncosts.  This requirement is contrary to the UTAH RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT which \ndemand that the attorneyโs allegiance be only to the client.   \nE.  Disparity in Compensation \n170.  The comparison of annual contract fees paid to public defenders with the salaries \nof prosecutors reveals a great disparity between the compensation paid to public defenders that \npaid to prosecutors.   \n171.  A side-by-side comparison underreports the true disparity because counties also \npay for the prosecution teamโs retirement, health and dental insurance, office expenses and \nsupplies, training and travel, service fees, fleet vehicles, severance benefits, workerโs \ncompensation insurance, phone charges, equipment and computer maintenance, risk management \nand malpractice insurance, legal subscriptions, professional association dues, disability \ninsurance, car allowances and cell phones.   \n172.  Contract defenders receive no such support or benefits from Defendants.  As a \nresult, many public defenders are forced to supplement their incomes through private practices \nand/or additional indigent defense contracts in surrounding counties.   \nF.  Harm to Indigent Defendants \n40\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 41 of 62\n \n173.  The lack of resources, excessive caseloads, and latent conflicts contained in the \ncounty public defender contracts are some of the root causes of public defendersโ inability to \nprovide adequate time for their clients.   \n174.  As a result of crushing workloads, public defenders do not have sufficient time to \nmeet and confer with their clients throughout the critical stages of the criminal proceedings.   \n175.  When assigning a public defender, judges or court personnel routinely inform \npublic defenders of the name and contact information for the attorney, sometimes with the \nadmonition that contacting the public defender will be difficult.  In most instances, the public \ndefender does not meet or converse with the defendant until a court hearing.   \n176.  Without adequate client contact, defense counsel cannot and do not adequately \nargue against pretrial incarceration or the imposition of bail.   \n177.  There is no time to ascertain what contacts the defendant has with the community, \njob status, or family commitment, and therefore the public defender does not have the necessary \ninformation to seek no bail, reduced bail, or prevent pre-trial incarceration.   \n178.  Because their counsel fail to advocate effectively against detention or the \nimposition of bail, people are routinely detained unnecessarily or for prolonged periods of time \nbefore trial.   \n179.  Unless Defendants take affirmative steps to ensure that public defenders have \nmanageable caseloads, indigent defendants will continue to have limited or no contact with their \nlegal counsel at critical stages of the proceedings. \n180.  Also as a result of overly burdensome caseloads created and sustained by \nDefendantsโ actions, many public defenders do not conduct appropriate discovery or make \n41\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 42 of 62\n \nappropriate pre-trial motions.  Likewise, many public defenders rarely make discovery motions \nor challenge the sufficiency of the documents they are permitted to review.  Motions to suppress \nevidence in Utah Justice Courts are virtually unheard of.   \n181.  Because of the Defendantsโ failure to assemble pertinent data on the indigent \ndefense system in Utah, it is impracticable to determine on a county-wide basis the number of \ndiscovery motions, motion to suppress, and actual trials conducted by public defenders.  \nSampling of dockets in various counties reveals very few instances where there is a record of \npublic defenders contesting the merits of the prosecutionโs case.   \n182.  Many members of the Plaintiff class have been detained unnecessarily or for \nprolonged periods of time before trial.  Many public defenders rarely seek reductions in bail, \neven for clients who pose no flight risk.  Many times indigent defense counsel fails to appear at \ncourt proceedings, resulting in frequent rescheduling and postponements.   \n183.  Many class members are compelled to take inappropriate pleas, often to the \nhighest charge, even when they have meritorious defenses.   \n184.  Many public defenders routinely encourage their clients to plead guilty without a \nproper factual basis for guilt, without even a cursory investigation into potentially meritorious \ndefenses, in the absence of any physical evidence, and without the presence of a complaining \nwitness.   \n185.  Fearful that their attorneys will not adequately prepare for trial, Plaintiffs forgo \ntheir right to trial, pleading guilty to crimes they did not commit or to charges more severe than \nthe facts of their cases warrant. \n42\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 43 of 62\n \n186.  Many public defenders in Utah routinely fail to review presentence reports with \nclients prior to the day of sentencing.  Likewise, many public defenders do not conduct \nindependent mitigation investigations or pre-sentence reports for their clients, leaving the stateโs \nreport as the primary document relied upon by the court in sentencing.   \n187.  These failures are to be expected because public defenders have so little time and \nresources (e.g., no investigators) to marshal an adequate defense. \n188.  The hallmarks of a vigorous defense on behalf of indigent criminal defendants are \nmissing, which leads to the conclusion that the Utah system of indigent defense has failed to put \nthe prosecution to the โcrucible of meaningful adversarial testing.โ  The net effect of inadequate \nresources, lack of oversight and excessive caseloads is that indigent defense counsel more \nroutinely expend their energy pressuring defendants to accept the prosecutionโs plea offers.  \n189.  Plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have suffered irreparable harm or are \nat imminent risk of suffering such harm because Defendants have failed to supervise and monitor \nthe indigent defense system for which they are responsible.  There is no adequate remedy at law \nto address these deficiencies or the consequential deprivation of adequate counsel. \n190.  As a direct result of the Defendantsโ lack of supervision and oversight, individual \ncounties and municipalities in the State of Utah have failed to supervise, monitor and adequately \nfund the indigent criminal defense system within the individual counties and municipalities.  \nBecause of the lack of oversight and accountability on the part of Defendants and the counties, \npublic defenders are not selected and engaged in a consistent manner with the best interests of \nthe indigent defendants in mind (e.g., flat-fee annual contracts), are not adequately trained during \nthe course of their engagement, are not given performance evaluations, are overworked, \n43\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 44 of 62\n \nunderstaffed, and without sufficient time to investigate the charges, are unable to provide legal \nrepresentation at all critical stages of the proceedings, unable to contest pre-trial bail hearings, \ncannot provide independent legal advice with respect to plea arrangements, unable to contest the \ncharges leveled against their client, are prevented from trying cases with adequate investigation \nand discovery, lack sufficient time to provide legal counsel necessary to evaluate criminal \ncharges and plea arrangements, cannot provide indigent defendants with alternative sentencing \noptions, and otherwise prevented from fulfilling the constitutional defense of indigent \ndefendants.   \n191.  As a direct result of the unconstitutional indigent criminal defense system which \nDefendants have allowed to persist in the State of Utah, Plaintiffs and class members are harmed \nin a multitude of ways every day, including:  spending more time in pre-trial detention; being \nsubject to excessive bail; accepting plea agreements about which they are ill-informed and have \nno understanding of collateral effects (e.g., immigration); agreeing to plea agreements that are \nexcessively punitive (increased fines and recoupment of attorney fees) and entail longer \nsentences; being unaware of sentencing alternatives; and generally being denied the \nconstitutionally mandated procedures that ensure a fair and just defense to criminal charges.  The \ndeprivation of constitutional rights and the resulting harm visited upon Plaintiffs and class \nmembers continue unabated as of the date of this Complaint.  \n192.  Each of the named Plaintiffs in this action have been directly affected by the \nproblem created by Defendants.   \n193.  Consistent with the experience of indigent defendants statewide, named Plaintiffs \nhave all had little or no time to meet with their attorneys at at all, much less at key junctures in \n44\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 45 of 62\n \ntheir cases.  Remick spoke to his attorney once, at a hearing, in a nearly two month period.  As of \nJune 27, Garner has spoken to his attorney for five minutes, during which his attorney did not \nask him for the facts.  Lloyd has spoken to his attorney once, and after multiple attempts, he has \nstopped trying to even attempt to do so again.  Murdzak had not met with counsel at the time of \nhis arraignment or before the next hearing.  As of June 27, Ricks had not met with his attorney \nyet, despite having his bail revoked.  Timms did not met with his counsel prior to the \narraignment.  \n194.  This lack of meaningful time to meet means Plaintiffs are facing incarceration \nwithout a meaningful opportunity to understand the process generally, much less assist their \nattorneys in an effective defense. \n195.    Also like many other indigent defendants who are being incarcerated pre-trial, \nRemick and Lloyd met with their public defenders in a non-private setting with other detainees \nand/or inmates, compromising their communications and effectiveness. \n196.  Some Plaintffs, like Ricks and Timms, have been detained in jail for over a \nmonth, increasing the pressure to take a deal that is in the long term not to their advantage but \nhas the potential immediate advantage of getting out of jail and being able to go back to work. \n197.  Named Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed class are suffering these \nharms caused by the Defendants on a daily basis. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nSIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE U.S. \nCONSTITUTION AND 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n(Right to Counsel) \n \n198.

The Utah Indigent Defense Act, ยง 77-32-301 UTAH CODE ANN., provides \nminimum standards for the defense of indigent defendants.  The Act requires counties and \nmunicipalities to provide competent and timely legal counsel.  This includes, among other \nthings: the investigatory resources adequate for a good defense,2 undivided loyalty of the defense \ncounsel to the client,3 and continuous representation by the appointed attorney throughout all \nstages of the prosecution.4  \n226.  Defendants fail to provide adequate funding and oversight to ensure all indigent \ndefendants timely receive competent counsel. \n227.  Defendants fail to provide adequate investigative resources for indigent \ndefendants. \n228.  Defendants fail to provide undivided loyalty to their indigent clients by failing to \nrecognize and address conflicts of interest. \n229.  Utah counties fail to provide uniform representation at all stages of the \nproceeding.  Indigent defendants are often represented by more than one attorney, and are often \nleft unrepresented during crucial stages of their prosecution. \n                                                 \n2  Utah Code Ann. ยง 77 32 301 (3) \n3  Utah Code Ann. ยง 77 32 301 (4) \n4  Utah Code Ann. ยง 77 32 304 (1)(a) \n50\n8928562_1   \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 18-1   Filed 07/26/16   Page 51 of 62\n \n230.

Plaintiffs bring this civil rights class action to remedy Utah's failure to provide \nconstitutionally adequate legal representation to indigent adults accused of crimes in Utah's \nDistrict and Justice courts for which there is a possibility of incarceration.  This failure deprives \nand threatens to deprive plaintiffs of rights guaranteed to them by the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, ยง 12 of the Utah Constitution, andยง 77-\n32-301, UTAH CODE ANN. \n2.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration from this Court that the indigent defense provided by \nthe State of Utah, as authorized and operated by the State of Utah and Attorney General Reyes \n(collectively, \"Defendants\"), deprives Plaintiffs of their rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs also seek a declaration from this Court \nthat the indigent defense system in the State of Utah, as operated by Defendants, violates \nPlaintiffs' rights under Article I, ยงยง 12 and 24 of the Utah Constitution (right to counsel and \nuniform operation of laws); andยง 77-32-301, UTAH CODE ANN., the Utah Indigent Defense Act. \nPlaintiffs further seek injunctive relief to remedy the systemic failures that lead to this action. \n3.  The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that a person \naccused of a crime has the right to assistance of counsel for his or her defense.  This \nconstitutional guarantee \"cannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment.\"  United States v. \nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 655 (1984) (quoting Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940)). \n8883214_2  2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 6 of 63\nRather, the Sixth Amendment requires defense counsel to subject the prosecution's case to \"the \ncrucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\" Id. at 656.  It is the State's duty to safeguard this \nright and ensure that people who face the threat of imprisonment receive competent assistance of \ncounsel regardless of their income.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342 (1963) (sometimes \nreferred to as \"Gideon\"). \n4.  Article I, ยง 12 of the Utah Constitution (Rights of Accused Persons) guarantees \nthat in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person \nand by counsel.  Where a person is charged with an offense that may be punished by \nimprisonment, \"the accused is entitled to the effective assistance of a competent member of [the] \nbar who is willing to identify with the interests of the defendant and present the available \ndefenses.\"  State v.  Wulffenstein, 733 P.2d 120, 121(Utah1986); State v. Gray, 601P.2d918, \n920 (Utah 1979). \n5.  Article I, Section 24 of the Utah Constitution (Uniform Operation of Laws) \nmandates that:  \"[a]ll laws of a general nature shall have uniform operations.\" \n6.  The Utah Indigent Defense Act requires that indigent defendants be provided: \n\"timely representation by competent legal counsel,\" the \"investigatory resources necessary for a \ncomplete defense,\" and \"undivided loyalty of defense counsel.\"  UTAH CODE ANN.ยง 77-32-301. \n7.  The State of Utah has the exclusive duty to provide indigent persons a \nconstitutionally sufficient defense.  Gideon, 372 U.S. at 342-43.  The State of Utah has \ncompletely abdicated this duty. \n8.  Rather than provide indigent criminal defense itself, the State of Utah has \nstatutorily delegated that duty to the counties and municipalities.  UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 77-32-306. \n8883214_2  3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 7 of 63\nWhile this delegation might be acceptable ifthe State of Utah were to provide the proper \nfunding, logistical support, or oversight to the counties and municipalities, the State has done the \nexact opposite.  In fact, the State of Utah presently provides absolutely no financial support to \nany of its 29 counties, nor to any of its over 100 municipalities.  Utah is one of only two states in \nthe nation to refuse to provide any such state funding or supervision.  In essence, the State of \nUtah has not delegated its responsibilities, it has abnegated its responsibilities \n9.  In Utah, counties and municipalities provide criminal defense to indigent people \nas a contracted service.  In general, this contracting involves counties and municipalities \nperiodically seeking bids from private attorneys on contracts to provide all indigent defense for \nthe county or municipality. \n10.  With neither guidance nor oversight from Defendants, these contracts are poorly \nstructured, violate widely accepted American Bar Association standards, and lack any \nmechanism for identifying conflicts of interest.  Almost without exception, the contracts provide \na fixed flat fee for compensation, regardless of the number of cases the contract attorneys \nundertake.  Also almost without exception, the compensation to public defenders is inadequate to \nreasonably compensate them, and is invariably lower than the compensation given to \nprosecutors, with nothing resembling parity between defense and prosecution. \n11.  Certain county contracts with public defenders require the attorneys to pay the \ncosts of investigators, testing, and expert witnesses with no additional funding from the county, \nwhich disincentivizes attorneys from paying for such services out of their own pocket. \n12.  All counties require contract attorneys to pay for their own office expenses, \noverhead, and support staff.  As a result, many, if not most, contract attorneys (save for two \n8883214_2  4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 8 of 63\ncontracted county legal defender offices) are forced to take on additional private cases for pay \na particularly dangerous practice absent any written guidelines or policies governing conflicts of \ninterest and caseloads. \n13.  Counties have no written requirements, policies, or standards for evaluating \npotential conflicts.  Counties keep no records of how many cases are assigned to their public \ndefenders. \n14.  Defendants, like the counties and municipalities, have failed to implement any \nwritten policies and/or guidelines regarding the selection, required qualifications, or \ncompensation of public defense counsel.  Defendants do not supervise and evaluate public \ndefense counsel.  Defendants do not require or provide to public defense counsel continuing \nlegal education specific to criminal defense issues.  Defendants do not have guidelines governing \nthe identification and reassignment of conflicts of interest or the appeal ofreimbursement \nrequests.  Defendants do not monitor caseloads of public defenders. Defendants are unable to \nidentify the public defenders who are providing indigent defense services.  There is no central \nregistry of public defenders, much less their individual caseloads. \n15.  Because of Defendants' lack of proper diligence, there is no practical way for an \nindependent observer to efficiently determine crucial facts such as:  the number of cases assigned \nto a particular public defender; the available resources for public defenders; or the number of \ntrials or contested motions or hearings involving indigent defendants. \n16.  Without access to this type of data, there is no practical way for independent \nobservers to determine whether the public defense in a county or municipality is living up to the \nkey criteria for determining whether the indigent defense services are constitutionally adequate. \n8883214_2  5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 9 of 63\nSuch hallmarks include timely meetings with indigent clients (particularly those in custody), \nconducting discovery, calling expert witnesses, and vigorously contesting the criminal charges. \n17.  Because neither Defendants nor the counties or municipalities keep any records \nabout the indigent defense system, there is no data-driven or statistical analysis of the Utah \nindigent defense system. \n18.  Defendants have been aware of the acute problems of Utah's indigent defense \nsystem for years. \n19.  First, the lack of funding or oversight is obvious on its face to Defendants. \nDefendants have long been aware that Utah is truly an outlier among the states in that it is nearly \nalone in providing no state funding or oversight whatsoever. \n20.  Moreover, despite the difficulty in data collection, over the last several years, \nseveral reports have been issued regarding Defendants' provision of indigent defense.  Each has \nfound a system in crisis. \n21.  For example, in 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah published its \ninvestigation of indigent defense entitled \"Failing Gideon: Utah's Flawed County-by-County \nPublic Defender System\" (www.acluutah.org/images/Failing Gideon.pdf) (last viewed on June \n20, 2016). \n22.  In 2012, the Sixth Amendment Center was engaged by the Utah Judicial Council \n(through a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice) to conduct an assessment of Utah's \nindigent defense system.  On October 26, 2015, the Sixth Amendment Center published its report \nentitled \"The Right to Counsel in Utah -An Assessment of Trial-Level Indigent Defense \nServices\" (sixthamendment.org/what-we-do/our-current-projects/Utah-project-page/) (the \"6AC \n8883214_2  6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 10 of 63\nReport\") ( sixthamendment.org/what-we-do/o ur-current-projects/Utah-project-page/) (last viewed \non June 20, 2016). \n23.  On the same day, the Utah Judicial Council published its companion analysis \nentitled \"Report - Judicial Council Study Committee on the Representation ofI ndigent Criminal \nDefendants in Trial Courts\" which can be found at \n(https://www.utcourts.gov/knowcts/adm/docs/Indigent_D  efense_C  ommittee_R  eport.pdt) (last \nviewed on June 20, 2016). \n24.  Each report speaks for itself as to the glaring deficiencies in the system. \n25.  As a direct result of Defendants' actions and inactions, members of the Plaintiffs' \nClass have suffered, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n26.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief pursuant to UTAH CODE ANN.ยง 78A-5-102 (original jurisdiction), Utah. R. Civ. \nP. 57 (declaratory judgments), and UTAH CODE ANN.ยง 78B-6-401 Gurisdiction of declaratory \njudgment action). \n27.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants under Utah. R. Civ. P. \n17.  Defendant Sean D. Reyes is a public official of the State of Utah who is sued in his official \ncapacity in order to enforce the performance of his official duties, UTAH CODE ANN.ยง 67-5-1 \n(duties of the attorney general), and the State has consented to be sued for violations of its own \nConstitution.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Utah Const. Art. VIII, ยง 5 and \nUTAH CODE ANN.ยง 78A-5-102(1) Gurisdiction of district court). \n8883214_2  7 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 11 of 63\n28.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 788-3-302 \nbecause Defendants are found in the State of Utah and committed certain wrongs giving rise to \nthis action within this judicial district. \nPARTIES \nI.  PLAINTIFFS \n29.  Class-Action Representative Colton Guy Remick (\"Remick\") is currently \nincarcerated in the Tooele County Detention Center in Tooele, Utah, with pending charges of \npossession of a forgery device (3rd Degree Felony), possession or use of a controlled substance \n(3rd Degree Felony), and use or possession of drug paraphernalia (Class B Misdemeanor). \nDespite being incarcerated since May 4, 2016, Remick has only spoken to his public defender \nonce, at his initial appearance.  When Remick met with his public defender, it was only for a \nshort time and was in the presence of many other defendants, rather than in a confined, \nconfidential location.  Other defendants assigned to the same public defender were in a line \nwaiting to meet with the public defender; because of the wait, some defendants were incented to \naccept a plea deal because, if a plea deal was rejected, defendant would have to go to the back of \nthe line, and wait at least one more hour to again speak with the public defender. \n30.  Class-action representative Plaintiff Skylar W. Garner (\"Garner\") is a 32 year old \nmarried man with two children under the age of five who is currently incarcerated in the Carbon \nCounty jail due to a violation of a No Contact order.  Prior to his arrest, Gamer held two jobs as \na technician and maintenance specialist.  Since his arrest, he has had very little contact with his \npublic defender.  The public defender has given Gamer no discovery or police reports.  His \npublic defender has made no inquiry of Garner as to the facts surrounding the charge.  He has \nspoken with his public defender for less than 5 minutes. \n8883214_2  8 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 12 of 63\n31.  Class-Action Representative Bryce Tucker Lloyd (\"Lloyd\") is currently \nincarcerated in the Tooele County Detention Center located in Tooele, Utah, with pending \ncharges of burglary (2nd degree felony), unlawful acquisition, possession, or transfer of a card \n(3rd degree felony), possession or use of a controlled substance (3rd degree felony), unlawful use \nof a financial transaction (Class B misdemeanor), and use or possession of drug paraphernalia \n(Class B misdemeanor).  When Lloyd met with his public defender at his initial appearance, it \nwas only for a short time and was in the presence of several other defendants, rather than in a \nconfined, confidential location.  Lloyd's public defender has been so habitually unresponsive to \nhis inquiries that Lloyd has stopped attempting to contact him. \n32.  Class Action Representative Plaintiff Anthony Murdzak (\"Murdzak\") is currently \nincarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in Logan, Utah, with pending charges of theft (3rd \nDegree Felony) and violation of firearm restrictions (Class A Misdemeanor).  Murdzak was \narrested on May 28, 2016, but not arraigned until June 7, 2016, ten days after his arrest, at which \npoint he was appointed counsel.  He did not meet with counsel prior to the arraignment and the \nonly meeting he had with his defense counsel was during the arraignment.  Murdzak received no \ncharging sheet and was not aware of the charges against him and had no information as to why \nthe firearm restriction charge had been made, as he had no firearm at the time of his arrest, nor \nwas one found in the vehicle in which he was driving.  Following the arraignment, Murdzak had \nnot met with defense counsel, had received no discovery, was unaware of when he would next \nmeet with his defense counsel or when a preliminary hearing was set for his case. \n33.  Class Action Representative Plaintiff Colter Ricks (\"Ricks\") is currently \nincarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in Logan, Utah, with pending charges of failure to \n8883214_2  9 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 13 of 63\nstop (Class A Misdemeanor), possession of drug paraphernalia (Class A Misdemeanor) and \npossession ofmethamphetamine (3rd Degree Felony).  Ricks was arrested on May 28, 2016.  He \nwas arraigned on May 31, 2016 via video conference.  Mr. Ricks had no counsel at the time of \nhis arraignment and during the arraignment, bail for a prior charge was revoked and bail for his \ncurrent charges was denied.  It was only after bail had been revoked on the prior charge and had \nbeen denied for the current charges that Ricks was appointed counsel.  Despite having counsel \nappointed after the arraignment, Ricks has not met with defense counsel.  Ricks' pre-trial hearing \nis set for June 27, by which point he will have spent a month in jail, having not met with a \ndefense lawyer. \n34.  Class Action Representative Plaintiff Brandon Timms (\"Timms\") is currently \nincarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in Logan, Utah, with pending charges of theft \n(Class B Misdemeanor) and burglary (2nd Degree Felony).  Timms was originally arrested in \nSalt Lake County, but was transported and incarcerated in the Cache County Jail because the \noffenses for which he was charged allegedly took place in Logan, Utah.  While he was arrested \non June 2, 2016, Timms was not arraigned until June 13, 2016, eleven days after his initial arrest \nand was not provided with counsel before his arraignment. \nII.  DEFENDANTS \n35.  Defendant State of Utah (\"State of Utah\" or \"Utah\") is sued for violations of the \nUtah State Constitution.  The State Capitol and center of State government are located in Salt \nLake County. \n36.  Defendant Sean D. Reyes (\"Defendant AG\" or \"Utah AG\") is the elected \nAttorney General of Utah and is sued in his official capacity as the person in charge of enforcing \nlaws of the State of Utah and the Utah and U.S. Constitutions.  Pursuant to Article VII,ยง 16 of \n8883214_2  10 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 14 of 63\nthe Constitution of Utah, the Attorney General \"shall be the legal adviser of the State officers ... \nand shall perform such other duties as provided by law.\" \n37.  Underยง 67-5-1(6), UTAH CODE ANN., the Utah Attorney General shall \"exercise \nsupervisory powers over the district and county attorneys of the state in all matters pertaining to \nthe duties of their offices, and from time to time require of them reports of the condition of \npublic business entrusted to their charge.\" \n38.  The Utah AG is a member of the executive branch of the Utah state government \nand is charged with the supervision of criminal prosecutions within Utah, including indigent \nadult defendants.  The Utah AG has failed to supervise the prosecution of indigent defendants by \nignoring the constitutional defects existing in the state indigent defense system which have been \nand continue to be readily apparent.  The Utah AG has not required reports on the condition of \n\"public business entrusted\" to the district and county attorneys pertaining to the indigent defense \nsystem.  The Utah AG has also failed to protect the constitutional rights of indigent persons \ncharged with criminal wrongdoing in Utah. \n39.  The Utah AG maintains his principal office at the Office of the Attorney General, \nUtah State Capitol Complex, 350 North State Street, Suite 230, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114, \nwhich is located in Salt Lake City and within this judicial district. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n40.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all previous and following allegations of this \nComplaint as if fully laid out here. \n41.  Plaintiffs Remick, Garner, Lloyd, Murdzak, Timms  and Ricks bring this action \npursuant to Utah R. Civ. P. 23(a), 23(b)(l), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) on behalf of themselves and all \nothers similarly situated. \n8883214_2  11 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 15 of 63\n42.  The class represented by the named Plaintiffs (the \"Class\") consists of all indigent \npersons who have been or will be charged with crimes for which incarceration is a possible \nconsequence of a conviction. \n43.  As indigent persons unable to afford to hire counsel to defend them, class \nmembers are dependent upon Defendants to provide them with counsel and other associated \nservices necessary for their defense. \n44.  Class members have been and are continuing to be harmed by the Defendants' \nfailure to fund, administer, or supervise Utah's indigent criminal defense system as guaranteed \nby the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Art. I,  ยง 7 and \n12 of the Utah Constitution, and as required under the Utah Indigent Defense Act (Utah Code \nAnn.ยง 77-32-101 et. seq.). \n45.  Certification of this action as a class action is appropriate under Utah R. Civ. P. \n23(b) for the following reasons: \n(a)  Separate prosecution of these actions by individual class members would \ncreate a risk of differing and inconsistent adjudications, creating the possibility of establishing \nincompatible standards of conduct for Defendants with respect to members of the Class; \n(b)  The Class is so numerous and fluid as to make joinder of all members of \nthe Class impracticable.  At any point in time, hundreds of indigent persons with pending \ncriminal charges punishable by imprisonment must rely on appointed defense counsel for legal \nrepresentation; \n8883214_2  12 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 16 of 63\n( c)  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that are generally \napplicable to the Class, making declaratory relief with respect to the entire Class appropriate; \nand, \n( d)  Common questions of law, fact, and relief relating to and affecting the \nindividual rights of class members predominate over any questions affecting individual class \nmembers. \n46.  Questions oflaw common to the class include, but are not limited to: \n(a)  Whether Defendants have a Constitutional duty under both the United \nStates Constitution and the Utah Constitutions to provide counsel and related services to indigent \npersons charged with crimes for which incarceration is possible; \n(b)  The extent and nature of Defendants' Constitutional duties to provide \noversight and supervision for appointed counsel and related defense services to the class \nmembers; \n(c)  Whether Defendants are in violation of their obligations under the Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to ensure that defense counsel \nappointed for class members have the resources necessary to provide class members with \nconstitutionally adequate representation; \n(d)  Whether Defendants are in violation of their obligations under Art. I, ยงยง 7 \nand 12 of the Utah Constitution to ensure that defense counsel appointed for class members have \nthe resources necessary to provide class members with constitutionally adequate representation; \n8883214 2  13 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 17 of 63\n( e)  Whether Defendants are in violation of their obligation under Utah Code \nAnn.ยง 77-32-101 et. seq. to ensure that indigent defense services provided by the State of Utah \ncomport with the standards laid out in the Act; and \n(f)  Whether the State's delegation of the responsibility for indigent defense to \nthe counties creates disparate access to the fundamental right to counsel in violation of both the \nSixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Art. I, ยง 24 \nof the Utah Constitution, which states:  \"All laws of a general nature shall have uniform \noperations.\" \n47.  Questions of fact common to the class include, but are not limited to: \n(a)  Whether Defendants have failed to ensure that defense counsel appointed \nto represent class members have been provided with the resources necessary to adequately \nchallenge the State's charges against the class members; and \n(b)  Whether, as a result of Defendants' actions and omissions, class members \nhave been and are currently being harmed based on the inability of appointed defense counsel to \nprovide them with constitutionally and statutorily adequate legal representation. \n48.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class as a \nwhole. \n49.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs arise from the same acts and/or omissions of \nDefendants, as do the claims of the members of the Class. \n50.  Class members have no significant interest in individual control of these claims \nthat would make class action inappropriate. \n8883214_2  14 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 18 of 63\n51.  The resolution of the claims presented by the Class is more likely to result in fair \nand efficient adjudication than other available methods. \n52.  Based on these facts, prosecution of this case as a class action is superior and \npreferable to the prosecution of myriad individual actions. \n53.  The individuals identified as named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the Class and will vigorously prosecute this suit on behalf of the Class.  Plaintiffs \nand their legal counsel know of no conflicts of interest between the named Plaintiffs as \nrepresentatives and class members concerning the relief sought in this complaint. \n54.  The named Plaintiffs are jointly represented by attorneys associated with the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Utah (\"ACLU\") and the law firm of Holland & Hart LLP. \nThe ACLU has extensive experience in successfully representing individuals and classes in \nsimilar actions.  The attorneys for the named Plaintiffs are capable and experienced litigators, are \nattorneys of good reputation, and have successfully represented plaintiffs in state and federal \ncourts in complex litigation.  Plaintiffs' attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all \nclaims in this action, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class. \nFACTS ENTITLING CLASS-ACTION PLAINTIFFS TO RELIEF \nI.  DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO PERFORM THEIR DUTY TO PROVIDE \nINDIGENT DEFENSE AFTER HAVING DELEGATED THE RESPONSIBILITY \nTO COUNTIES AND MUNICIPALITIES \n55.  It is a core guarantee of the Sixth Amendment that every criminal defendant, \nregardless of economic means, has the right to counsel when facing incarceration.  Gideon, 3 72 \nU.S. at 340-344 (holding that the right to counsel is \"fundamental and essential to a fair trial\"). \nThis right is so fundamental that any impairment of the right erodes the principles of liberty and \n8883214_2  15 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 19 of 63\njustice that underpin all civil rights in criminal proceedings.  The duty to provide criminal \nindigent defense is placed on the states.  Id., at 342. \n56.  The State of Utah has delegated its Sixth Amendment responsibility to the \ncounties and municipal legislative bodies, UTAH CODE ANN.ยง 77-32-306. \nA.  Failure to Supervise and Oversee Utah's Indigent Defense System \n57.  After delegating its Sixth Amendment responsibilities, Defendants have done \nnothing to ensure that the indigent defense system in Utah and the provision of indigent defense \nby the counties and municipalities is of a quality that meets constitutional standards. \n58.  As the principals responsible for indigent defense, Defendants have allowed their \nagents (i.e., the counties and municipalities) to operate without any accountability or governance \nas to the essential elements of a criminal defense system for indigent persons.  Defendants leave \neach county and municipality to its own devices in providing indigent defense with no obligation \nto report on those activities to Defendants. \n59.  Defendants have failed to require their agents to report on the indigent defense the \nagents provide.  As a direct and proximate result, Defendants cannot determine if Utah's indigent \ndefense system meets constitutional standards, particularly with respect to the caseload placed on \npublic defenders. \n60.  By purposefully failing to require their agents to report or document their \nactivities regarding indigent criminal defense, Defendants have breached their obligation to \nadminister the indigent defense system and uphold the dictates of Gideon and its progeny. \n61.  Defendants have recently highlighted their total lack of supervision of the Utah \nindigent defense system by the Utah Legislature's adoption of Senate Bill 155 (\"SB 115\") which \n8883214_2  16 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 20 of 63\nwas signed by Governor Herbert on March 22, 2016, and which became effective on May 10, \n2016. \n62.  SB 115 creates and describes the duties of the Utah Indigent Defense Commission \n(\"UID Commission\").  ยง 77-32-804, UTAH CODE ANN.  Among other things, SB 155 allows, but \ndoes not require, the UID Commission to maintain \"oversight to collect data, audit attorney \nperformance, establish standards and enforce the principles listed above.\"  ยง 77-32-\n804(1)(a)(vii), UTAH CODE ANN. \n63.  SB 115 also instructs the UID Commission to \"develop and adopt guiding \nprinciples,\" for indigent defense systems,ยง 77-32-804(1)(a)(i) (emphasis added), and to \n\"develop and oversee the establishment of advisory caseload principles\"ยง 77-32-804(1)(b) \n(emphasis added.) \n64.  SB 155 does not require counties and municipalities to follow any \"guiding \nprinciples\" or \"advisory caseload principles, \" which the UID Commission will set at some point \nin the future. \n65.  Rather, counties and municipalities will decide whether to undertake various steps \nto potentially qualify for grant money from the UID Commission, including passing a resolution \nadopting UID Commission standards, submitting a certified copy of that resolution, submitting a \ngrant application, and making additional expenditures of their own, unless they can show certain \nconditions are met.  Seeยงยง 77-32-806 & 807. \n66.  The only consequences a county or municipality faces for not meeting or adopting \nUID Commission standards is potentially losing grant money, ยง 77-32-806(2), or potentially \nbeing ineligible for grant money, ยง 77-32-807(5). \n8883214_2  17 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 21 of 63\n67.  As of the date of this Complaint, the UID Commission has not commenced \ncollecting data pertaining to the Utah indigent defense system or fulfilled any of the other \nstatutory directives given to the UID Commission. \n68.  Upon information and belief, the collection of data and auditing of public \ndefender performance is months or years away from completion.  Also upon information and \nbelief, the UID Commission is months or years away from issuing any advisory guidelines about \nindigent defense provision for counties or municipalities. \n69.  In the meantime, Plaintiffs and the class members continue to face actual and \nconstructive denials of their constitutional rights by Defendants.  The actions of the Utah \nLegislature are totally inadequate to address the problems. \n70.  Defendants' present refusal to monitor the indigent defense systems in any county \nor municipality constitutes a willful disregard of the State of Utah's constitutional obligations. \nDefendants' delegation of their constitutional duties to counties and municipalities does not \nrelieve them of their constitutional duties. \n71.  Likewise, the public defenders contracted by the counties and municipalities are \nnot to blame for the systemic problems they and their clients face every day as a result \nDefendants' complete failure to fund or oversee indigent defense. \n72.  The fact that Defendants cannot ascertain the status of indigent criminal defense is \nnot a viable defense to the claims brought before this Court.  The ultimate responsibility lies with \nthe Defendants, not the counties and municipalities. \n8883214_2  18 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 22 of 63\n73.  Furthermore, Defendant Utah AG has the statutory authority to require the district \nand county attorneys to report on the conditions of the indigent criminal defense system, ยง 67-5-\n1(  6), UTAH CODE ANN., but has failed to request or obtain such reports. \nB.  Defendants' Knowledge of Constitutional Deficiencies \n74.  Although Defendants have attempted to keep themselves ignorant of the operation \nof criminal justice in Utah state courts by failing to supervise the state public defender system, \nthe Defendants have known about the systemic deficiencies for many years. \n75.  First, it has been a continuing, conscious choice by Defendants to neither fund nor \noversee the system at all.  Defendants have known for years that Utah is nearly alone in refusing \nto provide any state resources of any kind to assist the counties and municipalities in providing \nthis constitutionally mandated service. \n76.  In 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah published \"Failing Gideon -\nUtah's Flawed County-by-County Public Defender System\" (\"Failing Gideon\"). \n77.  A second investigative report was published in 2015 by the Study Committee on \nthe Representation oflndigent Criminal Defendants in Trial Court (the \"Study Committee\"). \nThe Study Committee was formed in 2011 and is part of the Utah Judicial Council which is the \npolicy-making body for the judicial branch as authorized by the Utah State Constitution, UT AH \nCODE ANN. ยง 78A-2-104( 4). The Utah Judicial Council is responsible for the promulgation of \nuniform rules and standards to ensure the proper administration of the courts in Utah, as required \nby Article VIII, ยง 12 of the Utah Constitution. \n78.  The Study Committee was asked \"to assess the provision of indigent criminal \ndefense services at the trial level in Utah courts and to identify any concerns and make \nappropriate recommendations for improvement\" (https://www.utcourts.gov/knowcts/admi'.). \n8883214_2  19 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 23 of 63\n79.  The Study Committee engaged the Sixth Amendment Center (a non-profit \nMassachusetts entity) to perform a study of Utah's indigent defense systems.  In October, 2015, \nthe Sixth Amendment Center published its 6AC Report.  Simultaneously, the Study Committee \npublished its own report (\"Study Committee Report\"). \n80.  The Study Committee Report cited three major structural issues affecting indigent \ncriminal defense: \nA.  The lack of State oversight of the county and municipal indigent defense \nsystems; \nB.  Contracting \"conventions,\" such as all-inclusive, flat-fee contracts, which \ncreate systemic disincentives pitting an attorney's financial interests against the best interest of a \nclient; and \nC.  Justice courts in which high volume caseloads and lack of uniformity \ncompromise constitutional requirements for adequate defense of indigent defendants. \n81.  The 6AC Report is subdivided into two categories:  (1) actual denial ofcounsel; \nand (2) constructive denial of counsel. \n82.  With respect to the actual denial of counsel, the 6AC Report cited, inter alia;  (1) \nfailure to appoint counsel at the early critical stages of a criminal prosecution; (2) accepting a \nwaiver of the right to counsel without a colloquy between judge and defendant to ascertain ifthe \nwaiver was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made; (3) pleas accepted without counsel; \nand ( 4) interference of prosecutors and judges in plea negotiation with respect to persons \nunrepresented by counsel. \n8883214_2  20 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 24 of 63\n83.  The 6AC Report focused extensively on the constructive denial of counsel to \nindigent persons, including:  (1) the lack of accountability for indigent defense on the part of \nDefendant State of Utah, the counties and municipalities; (2) the structure of indigent defense, \nparticularly in Justice Courts; (3) the role of county prosecutors in the selection, evaluation and \nretention of public defenders; ( 4) financial conflicts created through flat-fee contracting and \nfunding of investigative and trial related expenses; and ( 5) workloads of public defenders, \nincluding time for contesting the prosecution's case. \n84.  The deficiencies of the Utah indigent defense system have persisted for many \nyears without any substantive efforts by Defendants to redress those constitutional defects. \nC.  Standards for Constitutionally Sufficient Defense \n85.  There is a national consensus and strong legal precedent on what constitutes \nconstitutionally adequate indigent defense-both at the systemic level and at the level of \nindividual defense providers. \n86.  In United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984), the United States Supreme \nCourt recognized that the Sixth Amendment is violated when a criminal defendant is \nconstructively denied counsel. \n87.  Constructive denial of counsel occurs when, among other things, an indigent \ndefendant is denied assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings, when defense \ncounsel utterly fails to investigate the underlying facts of a case, or when defense counsel fails to \nsubject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing, or represents conflicting \ninterests. \n88.  The American Bar Association (\"ABA\") approved the Ten Principles ofa  Public \nDefense Delivery System (the \"Ten Principles\"), which establish the fundamental criteria \n8883214_2  21 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 25 of 63\nnecessary-at the systemic level-to provide effective, efficient, and conflict-free legal \nrepresentation to its clients.  The Ten Principles reflect a national consensus regarding the \nprerequisites for constitutionally adequate indigent defense reached by representatives from each \nof the fifty states, the civil bar, and all segments of the criminal justice system-including \njudges, prosecutors, private defense counsel, public defenders, court personnel, and academics \nactive in criminal justice. \n89.  The Ten Principles state that to have constitutionally adequate indigent defense: \n(a) defense counsel should be an equal partner in the justice system, with the same resources as \nprosecuting attorneys; (b) only qualified counsel should represent indigent defendants; ( c) clients \nshould be appropriately screened for eligibility for public defense services; (d) defense counsel \nshould receive the training necessary to perform competently; (e) there should be attorney \nperformance standards and adequate supervision and oversight to ensure compliance with those \nstandards; (f) workloads should be monitored; and (g) indigent defense systems should be \nindependent from undue political influence, to ensure that counsel are free to make decisions \nnecessary to meaningfully advocate for their clients. \n90.  The ABA and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (\"NLADA\") \nhave also promulgated performance standards for constitutionally adequate indigent defense \ncounsel with respect to individual providers.  Those standards dictate that indigent defense \ncounsel:  (a) have adequate knowledge of the relevant areas oflaw; (b) act with reasonable \ndiligence and promptness, avoiding unnecessary delay in the disposition of cases; (c ) provide \nrepresentation at every critical stage of their client's proceedings; (d) conduct reasonable factual \nand legal pre-trial investigations into the charges against their clients, pursue available formal \n8883214_2  22 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 26 of 63\nand informal discovery procedures and use appropriate and necessary experts; and ( e) consult \nwith their clients in order to elicit relevant information about the case, to inform clients of their \nrights, and to enable clients to make informed decisions about the direction of their cases. \n91.  Attached as Appendix 1 to the Study Committee Report is a white paper authored \nby Hon. Derek P. Pullan of the Fourth Judicial District Court entitled \"THE CONSTITUTIONAL \nRIGHT TO COUNSEL - EVALUATING THE HEAL TH OF UT AH' S INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEM\" \n(\"Pullan Report\").  Judge Pullan articulated seven factors to be used in assessing the health of \nUtah's public defense system: \nA.  Independent representation, which includes the exclusion of county \nattorneys and judges from hiring and supervising public defenders; \nB.  Representation without conflicts of interest, which encompasses systemic \nconflicts of interest arising from the contract terms of engagement, the manner of \nselection, funding and payment of defense counsel; \nC.  Representation without interference, such as not providing a private place \nfor attorney-client confidential communications; \nD.  Representation at all critical stages, which includes custodial \ninterrogations, lineups, initial appearances, bail hearings, preliminary examination, \narraignment, plea bargaining, sentencing and the first appeal of right; \nE.  Representation that ensures meaningful adversarial testing of the State's \nevidence, which includes qualified counsel (ability, training and experience), access to \ndefense resources (e.g., investigators, expert witnesses and scientific or medical testing) \nand reasonable caseload standards; \n8883214_2  23 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 27 of 63\nF.  Fair compensation and proper incentives; and \nG.  Case specific and systemic quality control, including minimum \nperformance standards and collection of meaningful data. \n92.  The State of Utah passed the Indigent Defense Act of 1965 (the \"Act\").  The Act \nhas been amended and is currently set forth inยงยง 77-32-101 et seq., UTAH CODE ANN.  The legal \ndefense standards for Utah's public defender are defined in ยง 77-32-201(8), UTAH CODE ANN.: \nA.  Provide defense counsel for each indigent who faces the potential \ndeprivation of the indigent's liberty; \nB.  Afford timely representation by defense counsel; \nC.  Provide the defense resources necessary for a complete defense; \nD.  Assure undivided loyalty of defense counsel to the client; \nE.  Provide a first appeal of right; and \nF.  Prosecute other remedies before or after a conviction, considered by \ndefense counsel to be in the interest ofj ustice except for other and subsequent \ndiscretionary appeals or discretionary writ proceedings. \n93.  Defendants have failed to meet or maintain the statutory mandates of the Act as \nfurther described below.  Furthermore, Defendants have failed to fulfill the constitutional \nstandards articulated in the Ten Principles, by the NLADA and in the Pullan Report. \n94.  Among other things, Defendants have allowed a system to develop in which \ncounties and municipalities are not providing timely and competent legal counsel, are denying \npublic defenders investigatory resources necessary for a complete defense, and creating \n8883214_2  24 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 28 of 63\nconditions making it practically impossible for public counsel to provide undivided loyalty to \ntheir clients. \n95.  The substandard performance of the indigent criminal defense system is on-going \nand continuous, thereby damaging the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, and those similarly \nsituated. \nII.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEFICIENCIES OF THE UTAH INDIGENT \nDEFENSE SYSTEM ARE OPEN AND NOTORIOUS \nA.  Defendants Exercise No Administrative Oversight Over the Indigent Defense \nSystem. \n96.  Defendants are not taking any steps to ensure that their agents are living up to the \nminimum constitutional and statutory requirements of indigent defense. \n97.  Notwithstanding the generalized responsibilities Defendant Utah AG has over \nDefendant's provision of indigent defense, Utah presently has no statewide entity or official with \nthe unambiguous mandate to ensure Defendants' compliance with their constitutional obligations \non an ongoing basis. \n98.  Utah has no official or entity empowered to take any binding, remedial actions to \nfix the counties' and municipalities' failure to comply. \n99.  Defendants do not supervise the provision of indigent defense services in \nmisdemeanor and felony criminal actions in any of Utah's twenty-nine counties. \n100.  Defendants have not implemented any safeguards to ensure that counties comply \nwith the Act and with national performance standards. \n101.  National standards require ongoing training, professional development, and \ncontinuing legal education.  Indigent defense counsel must acquire and maintain lawyering skills, \n8883214_2  25 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 29 of 63\nas well as keep current with new developments in the complex and rapidly changing field of \ncriminal law. \n102.  Defendants do not provide resources for attorney training, nor require attorney \nperformance evaluations.  Defendants do not oversee workload limits.  As a result, only two of \nUtah's twenty-nine counties (i.e., Salt Lake and Utah counties) have implemented a formal \ntraining program for indigent defense counsel at the insistence and direction of the legal defender \nassociations in those two counties. \n103.  Most counties rely on private low-bid contracts without any investigation into the \nqualifications of the applicants.  Lacking formal orientation, newly hired attorneys have no \nopportunity to acquire and maintain the skills and legal knowledge necessary to put the \nprosecution's case to the crucible of adversarial testing.  Counties do not provide or fund training \nprograms for contracted attorneys to hone their skills and remain knowledgeable of significant \nchanges in the law. \n104.  The very recently formed UIC Commission, by its nature, has no power at all to \ntake any binding action to bring any county or municipality failing to provide adequate defense \ninto compliance.  The UIC Commission is advisory in nature, and counties and municipalities \nhave no obligation to follow any of its guidelines. \n105.  By contrast, Defendants, through the Utah Prosecution Council (\"UPC\") provide \nnumerous opportunities for ongoing education and training for county prosecutors.  Counties \noften pay for prosecutors' training and memberships in statewide associations for prosecutors \nand other professional associations. \n8883214_2  26 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 30 of 63\n106.  National standards further mandate that indigent defense programs subject their \nattorneys to systematic supervision and evaluation based on publicized practice standards.  Utah \nhas no statewide supervision or evaluation policies.  Defendants keep no records, documents, \nfiles, or written protocol of any kind to monitor the indigent defense system.  Defendants have no \nsystem in place to ensure that counties set practice standards or methods of evaluation, \nsupervision, and monitoring to ensure the adequate assistance of indigent defense counsel. \n107.  The lack of basic supervision results in inevitably hampering the quality of \nrepresentation across the state.  While every county and municipality suffers from its own \nsystemic issues, there are some counties and municipalities where there are more and more acute \nproblems. \n108.  The lack of supervision also results in counties attempting to save money by \nrelying on overworked, underpaid, inexperienced, untrained, understaffed and often conflicted \ncounsel. \n109.  Most Utah counties award indigent defense contracts based on the lowest cost \npossible, without regard to constitutional adequacy.  Under such contracts, defenders are left to \npolice their own caseloads and report when they become too burdensome.  The potential for \nrecriminations and reprisals (e.g., terminating or not renewing a public defender contract) if \npublic defenders complain about excessive caseloads militates against public defenders making \nany objection to caseloads and lack of resources. \n8883214_2  27 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 31 of 63\nB.  Defendants Do Not Consistently Provide Legal Counsel to Indigent \nDefendants at All Critical Stages of the Criminal Prosecution. \n110.  The constructive denial of legal counsel to indigent defendants commences at the \nhiring of public defenders.  From stem to stern, the hiring and supervision of public defenders is \ndefective ab initio. \n111.  With limited exceptions, Utah counties have coalesced around two models.  In \nSalt Lake and Utah counties, the county commissioners have engaged by contract a single, not-\nfor-profit provider of legal defense to indigents. \n112.  Outside of those two counties, and in every municipality, the counties and \nmunicipalities contract with private attorneys to provide services in either the District and Justice \ncourts, or both. \n113.  The counties' and municipalities' selection of private attorneys for indigent \ndefense contracts is fraught with inherent defects.  The governmental bodies awarding contracts \nto the public defenders consist of elected officials who are usually not law trained.  They do not \nhave backgrounds in legal matters and are not acquainted with the skills and experience level the \npublic defenders should have. \n114.  Moreover, because the cost of the indigent defense system is borne by each of the \nseparate counties and municipalities' and their general tax funds, the officials are motivated to \nkeep the costs as low as possible without regard to the constitutional sufficiency of the defense \nsystem. \n115.  Because of this lack of law training, the officials often tum to the county or city \nattorneys for advice and guidance in selecting the private attorneys to be hired for indigent \n8883214_2  28 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 32 of 63\ndefense.  In effect, the prosecutors are involved in hiring their opposing counsel, which \nconstitutes a self-evident conflict of interest. \n116.  The contracts used by nearly all counties and municipalities are annual, flat-fee \narrangements.  Under such contracts, the private attorney and the county or municipality \nnegotiate a set price for all services on a yearly basis.  Such contracts make no accommodation \nfor an increase in the number of cases assigned to the public defender or the complexity of any \nparticular case. \n117.  In most counties, there is no prohibition against public defenders having private \nclients while fulfilling the flat-fee annual contract with the county.  In those instances, the public \ndefender is conflicted by the duty to the private clients (who usually will pay more money on an \nhourly or project basis than the public defender contract) and the contractual duty to represent \nindigent defendants. \n118.  Under the flat-fee annual contract, the public defender will not be paid any more \nor less for the number or complexity of cases; whereas his/her annual income can be increased \nby dedicating more time and energy into private practice. \n119.  Because of the structure of the contractual commitment, the average public \ndefender is economically motivated to do as little as possible regarding the indigent defendants \nand to increase his/her productivity with respect to private clients.  From the inception of the \ncontract, the contracts create a conflict, which compromises the defense of people unable to pay \nfor an attorney. \n120.  By way of illustration, not limitation, attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a copy of the \nRequest for Qualification for Kane County Public Defender Services (\"Kane County RFQ\") to \n29 \n8883214_2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 33 of 63\nwhich was attached the Public Defender Agreement-Trial Services-March 1, 2016 - February \n28, 2018 (\"Kane County PD Contract\").  Responses to the Kane County RFQ were due on \nMarch 2, 2016.  The Kane County PD Contract embodies the same systemic problems that \nplague all flat-rate annual contracts.  The annual flat-rate is $60,844.10.  See Scope of Work in \nKane County RFQ and~ 5.1 of the Kane County PD Contract. \n121.  Before the Kane County public defender may use an expert witness, the trial court \nmust approve the expert witness fees-a requirement that the county prosecutors do not have to \ncomply with.  This places a burden on the public defenders, particularly when the motion to \napprove the payment of expert witnesses fees will require the disclosure of discovery and trial \nstrategy-something that prosecutors don't have to do.  Furthermore, the public defender must \n\"use his best efforts to minimize the cost and expenses.\"  Kane County PD Contract at~ 3.9. \nExtraordinary unforeseen expenses may be requested from the non-lawyer county \ncommissioners.  Kane County PD Contract at~ 5.3.  Private practice is not prohibited.  Kane \nCounty PD Contract at~ 7.9. \n122.  The Kane County PD Contract demonstrates that various Utah counties continue \nto use contracts with built-in conflicts. \n123.  Beginning in October 2015, legal counsel for Plaintiffs issued a series of \ndocument requests to all Utah county commissions and District Courts under the auspices of the \nGovernment Records Access and Management Act,ยงยง 630-2-101, et seq., UTAH CODE ANN. \n(\"GRAMA\"). \n8883214_2  30 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 34 of 63\n124.  All county Commissions were asked to produce copies ofrecords pertaining to \nthe indigent defense system in each county, including copies of any public defender contracts \nand minutes of any county commission meetings pertaining to indigent defense. \n125.  Like the Kane County PD Contract, county commissions have used the flat-rate \nannual contract format  to provide indigent legal services.  In addition to the intrinsic flaws \ncontained in the Kane County PD Contract, other flat-rate contracts require that the public \ndefender pay for expert witness fees, testing and investigative research out of their own pocket, \nwith no additional monies from the county. \n126.  Stunningly, certain counties require public defenders to pay for substitute counsel \nin the event the public defender is conflicted out of representation, which dampers the \nwillingness of public defenders to acknowledge conflicts. \n127.  County commission minutes and related documents produced in response to the \nGRAMA requests do not show any public defenders having requested or being granted \nadditional monies for extraordinary expenses by the county commissioners. \n128.  In the cases where the public defender must pay for expert witness fees, testing \nand investigations, there are no produced documents showing expenditures in excess of the \nyearly flat-rate. \n129.  Defendants have provided no directives, oversight or supervision with respect to \nthe types of contracts utilized by Utah counties with public defenders.  Defendants have allowed \nsuch contracts to continue and to proliferate.  Defendants have no means of requiring that public \ndefender contracts or other arrangements conform with the Utah Constitution, statutes and case \nlaw, including the recently enacted UID Commission. \n8883214_2  31 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 35 of 63\n130.  Failure to govern the indigent defense systems of the Utah counties, particularly \nthe way in which public defenders are chosen and compensated, constitutes a breach of \nDefendants' constitutional responsibilities to indigent criminal defendants and a violation of the \nfederal and state constitutions, statutes and attendant case law.  Plaintiffs suffer harm as public \ndefenders routinely represent conflicting interests. \n131.  Over and beyond the actual contracts, Defendants have failed to regulate and \nsupervise the selection of public defenders.  Defendants provide no mechanism to ensure \nindigent defense providers are qualified for the job.  Most contracts have no written job \nqualifications other than a prerequisite in the contract that counsel be members of the Utah State \nBar Association in good standing. \n132.  Given the lack of hiring criteria, there is no way of telling whether indigent \ndefense counsel have the requisite ability, training, experience and adequate knowledge of \nrelevant areas of the law to match the complexity of their caseloads. \n133.  Most counties rely on private low-bid contracts without any investigation into the \nqualifications of the applicants.  Lacking formal orientation, newly hired attorneys often have no \nopportunity to acquire and maintain the skills and legal knowledge necessary to put the \nprosecution's case to the meaningful crucible of adversarial testing. \n134.  The collateral effects of a guilty plea or conviction are complex and intricate in \ntoday's interconnected legal system.  For example, a guilty plea or verdict may have adverse \nconsequences on the indigent defendant's eligibility for public housing, and if a landlord \nconducts a background check, private housing.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1366l(c) gives public housing \nauthorities the power to deny people Section 8 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1437(ยฑ)) rental housing assistance \n8883214_2  32 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 36 of 63\nbased on criminal activity.  Criminal convictions also have effects on immigration status, student \nloan eligibility, and many other issues. \n135.  Effective criminal representation means being able to advise clients about these \ncollateral effects.  In other states, there is a state requirement for public defenders to be aware of \nsuch consequences.  For example, in New Mexico, public defenders are expected to know what \nthe consequences of a guilty plea might be on the immigration status of an indigent defendant. \n136.  On the other hand, Utah has no such requirement for its public defenders.  In \nUtah, for example, there is no means of determining ifthe public defenders are knowledgeable \nabout the intersection of criminal and immigration law.  See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1227(a)(2) (crimes of \n\"moral turpitude\" or involving controlled substances shall serve as a basis for deportation of \naliens) and the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) which provides the US. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (ICE) agency support in the biometric and biographic identification, arrest, and \nremoval of priority aliens who are incarcerated with federal, state and local prisons and jails. \n13 7.  As the parties ultimately responsible for the indigent defense systems, Defendants \nhave abnegated their responsibilities by not instituting standards by which public defenders are \nhired and perform on the job. \n138.  With the exception of Salt Lake County and Utah County, which cover training \nexpenses, counties do not pay for any training and continuing legal education for public \ndefenders and Defendants do not provide any funding to cover such costs.  Indigent defense \ncounsel must pay for all training and continuing legal education (\"CLE\") out of pocket. \nDefendants take no steps to ensure indigent defense counsel actually receive applicable training \nand ongoing legal education. \n8883214_2  33 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 37 of 63\n139.  By contrast, several counties directly fund training for prosecutors, and pay for \nmemberships in professional associations such as the UPC and the Statewide Association of \nProsecutors, which provide training and continuing legal education. \n140.  Defendants contribute nothing to CLE for the attorneys representing indigent \ndefendants.  Although the Utah State Bar requires continuing legal education of all licensed \nattorneys, public defenders can satisfy these requirements by pursuing instruction in unrelated \npractice areas.  There is no requirement that public defenders keep abreast of developments in \ncriminal Jaw or report their CLE to an authority charged with overseeing performance. \nC.  Caseloads and Availability of Public Defenders \n141.  Defendants do not monitor, limit or otherwise provide supervision and oversight \nof public defense counsel workloads.  Defendant's failure to provide supervision and guidance \nhas resulted in unmanageably large workloads for indigent defense counsel. \n142.  Workload affects the productivity and effectiveness of indigent defense counsel \nmore than any other variable.  The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards \nand Goals created by the United States Department of Justice stated in 1973 that a single, full \ntime indigent defense counsel can reasonably be expected to handle no more than 150 felonies \nper year; or 400 misdemeanors per year; or 200 juvenile delinquency cases per year.  The \nnational standards published in 1973 may now be too high in light of the complexity of criminal \ndefense and the need for scientific testing (e.g., DNA) and detailed investigations, which did not \nexist in 1973 but which are standard procedures in 2016. \n143.  As alleged above, Defendants do not collect meaningful data regarding the \nindigent defense system and the caseloads placed on public defenders.  Defendants cannot \n8883214_2  34 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 38 of 63\ndetermine the effectiveness of indigent defense counsel if Defendants do not know who handles \npublic defense cases from one county and municipality to the next. \n144.  Quite simply, Defendants do not know who the public defenders are, much less \nwhat the caseload is for a particular public defender.  This is particularly true because defenders \nsometimes hold contracts for various types of services within one county or city and/or with \nvarious counties and cities and/or have private clients in addition to their contract or contracts. \n145.  Defendants have not set workload limits and do not require the counties to do so. \nA review of the sparse data available reveals that in many counties, indigent defense counsel \nmaintain felony caseloads as high as 250 to 300 cases, almost twice the ABA recommended \nmaximum of 150, not counting any juvenile representation they may undertake. \n146.  Many attorneys carry private caseloads in addition to the cases assigned by the \ncounty in order to supplement their income.  Caseloads for indigent defense are often so high \nthat attorneys spend no more than a few minutes with a client prior to court proceedings. \n147.  Because of the excessive caseloads, public defenders are forced into the \"meet \nand plead\" syndrome where they meet their indigent client a few minutes before entry of a plea \nagreement.  The excessive caseloads impede counsel's ability to provide constitutionally and \nstatutorily adequate legal representation.  In some isolated rural counties, caseloads may not be \nas pressing an issue as the other consequences of a defective indigent defense system. \nD.  Funding and Resources for Indigent Defense \n148.  Each county and municipality is responsible for funding its own indigent defense \nservices.  Defendants do not provide any funding whatsoever for indigent defense. \n8883214_2  35 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 39 of 63\n149.  Utah ranks 48th out of the 50 states in per capita spending for indigent \ndefendants, spending $5.22 (the national average is $11.86), with some counties spending as \nlittle as $1.87 per person per year. \n150.  In contrast to the paltry sums spent on indigent defense, Defendants provide \ncounty prosecutors with myriad resources, which increases the disparity between prosecutors and \ndefenders and decreases the defenders' ability to subject the prosecutor's case to the crucible of \nadversarial testing.  For example, the state-funded UPC, which focuses on providing legal \ntraining to prosecutors, has a substantial annual budget.  The Utah Prosecutorial Assistants \nAssociation, which received $12,000 from the UPC, provides prosecutorial assistants with legal \ntraining.  Additionally, the Statewide Association of Prosecutors, funded by dues paid by \ncounties, advances legislation to benefit prosecutors.  Finally, because prosecutors are county \nemployees, they receive state benefits, including health insurance and retirement plans, for both \nthem and their staff. \n151.  By contrast, public defenders must hire staff, pay for overhead, and cover the \ncosts of benefits on their own. \n152.  Public defense contracts awarded in most counties do not provide additional funds \nto hire private investigators or experts.  Rather, public defenders must cover the cost of such \ninvestigations out of their own funds or make a special request for additional funding from the \ncounty or municipality.  The practical reality is that public defenders rarely hire investigators. \n153.  In contrast, prosecutors have immediate access to the State of Utah Crime \nLaboratory and the various services it offers, including scientific consulting, law enforcement \n8883214_2  36 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 40 of 63\ntraining, crime scene response, laboratory testing services, 1 and courtroom testimony.  The \nBureau of Forensic Services is located within the Utah Department of Public Safety.  None of \nthose services, however, are freely available to public defenders and their clients. \n154.  In many counties, indigent defense attorneys must appeal to county officials (who \nare usually not law trained) to have investigators, experts, and other expenses approved and paid. \nIn cases where the county commissioners must approve extraordinary expenses requested by the \npublic defender before such expenditures can be made, the county commissioners' lack of \ncriminal law expertise prevents them from understanding the necessity of such expenses.  For \nexample, a county commissioner without legal training cannot be expected to know when DNA \ntesting is an absolute necessity for the adequate defense of a particular indigent defendant. \n155.  Requiring public defenders to justify such expenses to non-lawyers is another \ndeterrent to adequate, constitutional defense.  As a result, public defenders lack real \nindependence from prosecutorial and judicial influence, which is critical to our adversarial \nsystem. \n156.  The lack of funding and oversight on the part of Defendants has also resulted in \ncounties and municipalities failing to provide private spaces in the courthouses for public \ndefenders to meet with their clients. \n157.  There are very few court facilities that have dedicated spaces in which public \ndefenders can have confidential conversations with their attorneys.  Most indigent defendants \nfirst meet and then converse with their assigned public defender in the courtroom or the hallways \n1 Laboratory testing services offered to prosecutors consist of biology screening, DNA, combined DNA index \nsystem input/management, controlled substances (including suspected clandestine labs), fire debris, paint, general \ntrace and unknown substances, latent prints, footwear/tire track, automated fingerprint identification system, \nbloodstain pattern analysis, firearms, toolmarks, serial number restoration, distance determination and shooting \nscene reconstruction. See forensicservices.utah.gov. \n8883214_2  37 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 41 of 63\noutside the courtrooms.  There is no physical barrier or door protecting the attorney-client \nprivileged discussions from other people in attendance. \n158.  For in-custody indigent defendants, conversations with the assigned public \ndefenders often take place in group holding cells where the defendants are not assured that their \nstatements to counsel will not be overhead by other prisoners and jail personnel. \n159.  As a result, the confidence and trust of the indigent defendants in their public \ndefenders are severely eroded by lack of physical space. \n160.  In Utah, indigent defendants may be ordered to repay the county \"costs\" if \nconvicted of a crime, ยง 77-32a-1, UTAH CODE ANN.  Costs are defined by statute to include \n\"attorney fees of counsel assigned to represent the defendant.\"  ยง 77-32-2, UTAH CODE ANN. \n161.  In contrast to the Miranda advisory that an attorney will be appointed if the \naccused cannot afford an attorney, indigent defendants are not regularly advised that a guilty plea \nmay entail more than just a fine. \n162.  If recoupment is ordered and the defendant does not pay the attorney fees, the \ncounty or municipal court may move for an order to show cause why the indigent defendant's \ndefault should not be treated as contempt of court and may \"order him committed until the costs \nor a specified part thereof, are paid.\"  UTAH CODE ANN. ยง 77-32a-8. \n163.  As a result, indigent defendants are denied public defender services because they \nmust ultimately pay for these services if they are convicted.  Recoupment of fees has a chilling \neffect on the right to counsel. \n8883214_2  38 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 42 of 63\n164.  Counties usually charge indigent defendants a flat fee for the public defense \nservices they receive, without regard to the length or complexity of their cases, the quality of the \ndefense services, or their ability to pay without substantial hardship. \n165.  Typically, indigent defendants are charged $500 for a felony conviction and $250 \nfor a misdemeanor conviction.  These flat fees apply even if the public defender in question did \nnot incur that amount in costs or attorney time. \n166.  County and municipal courts make no attempt to ascertain whether indigent \nclients can pay the recoupment fees without substantial hardship and routinely assess the fees \ndespite the fact that these indigent clients have already filled out forms with their financial \ninformation to indicate they qualify for free assistance of counsel. \n167.  Many of the counties' contracts with public defenders require the attorney to \nprovide information to the county prosecutors as to their clients' ability to pay the recoupment \ncosts.  This requirement is contrary to the UTAH RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT which \ndemand that the attorney's allegiance be only to the client. \nE.  Disparity in Compensation \n168.  The comparison of annual contract fees paid to public defenders with the salaries \nof prosecutors reveals a great disparity between the compensation paid to public defenders that \npaid to prosecutors. \n169.  A side-by-side comparison underreports the true disparity because counties also \npay for the prosecution team's retirement, health and dental insurance, office expenses and \nsupplies, training and travel, service fees, fleet vehicles, severance benefits, worker's \ncompensation insurance, phone charges, equipment and computer maintenance, risk management \n8883214_2  39 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 43 of 63\nand malpractice insurance, legal subscriptions, professional association dues, disability \ninsurance, car allowances and cell phones. \n170.  Contract defenders receive no such support or benefits from Defendants.  As a \nresult, many public defenders are forced to supplement their incomes through private practices \nand/or additional indigent defense contracts in surrounding counties. \nF.  Availability of Public Defenders and Quality of Representation \n171.  The lack ofresources, excessive caseloads, and latent conflicts contained in the \ncounty public defender contracts are some of the root causes of public defenders' inability to \nprovide adequate time for their clients. \n172.  As a result of crushing workloads, public defenders do not have sufficient time to \nmeet and confer with their clients throughout the critical stages of the criminal proceedings. \n173.  When assigning a public defender, judges or court personnel routinely inform \npublic defenders of the name and contact information for the attorney, sometimes with the \nadmonition that contacting the public defender will be difficult.  In most instances, the public \ndefender does not meet or converse with the defendant until a court hearing. \n174.  Without adequate client contact, defense counsel cannot and do not adequately \nargue against pretrial incarceration or the imposition of bail. \n175.  There is no time to ascertain what contacts the defendant has with the community, \njob status, or family commitment, and therefore the public defender does not have the necessary \ninformation to seek no bail, reduced bail, or prevent pre-trial incarceration. \n176.  Because their counsel fail to advocate effectively against detention or the \nimposition of bail, people are routinely detained unnecessarily or for prolonged periods of time \nbefore trial. \n8883214_2  40 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 44 of 63\n177.  Unless Defendants take affirmative steps to ensure that public defenders have \nmanageable caseloads, indigent defendants will continue to have limited or no contact with their \nlegal counsel at critical stages of the proceedings. \n178.  Also as a result of overly burdensome caseloads created and sustained by \nDefendants' actions, many public defenders do not conduct appropriate discovery or make \nappropriate pre-trial motions.  Likewise, many public defenders rarely make discovery motions \nor challenge the sufficiency of the documents they are permitted to review.  Motions to suppress \nevidence in Utah Justice Courts are virtually unheard of. \n179.  Because of the Defendants' failure to assemble pertinent data on the indigent \ndefense system in Utah, it is impracticable to determine on a county-wide basis the number of \ndiscovery motions, motion to suppress, and actual trials conducted by public defenders. \nSampling of dockets in various counties reveals very few instances where there is a record of \npublic defenders contesting the merits of the prosecution's case. \n180.  Many members of the Plaintiff class have been detained unnecessarily or for \nprolonged periods of time before trial.  Many public defenders rarely seek reductions in bail, \neven for clients who pose no flight risk.  Many times indigent defense counsel fails to appear at \ncourt proceedings, resulting in frequent rescheduling and postponements. \n181.  Many class members are compelled to take inappropriate pleas, often to the \nhighest charge, even when they have meritorious defenses. \n182.  Many public defenders routinely encourage their clients to plead guilty without a \nproper factual basis for guilt, without even a cursory investigation into potentially meritorious \n8883214_2  41 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN-DBP   Document 2-1   Filed 07/13/16   Page 45 of 63\ndefenses, in the absence of any physical evidence, and without the presence of a complaining \nwitness. \n183.  Fearful that their attorneys will not adequately prepare for trial, Plaintiffs forgo \ntheir right to trial, pleading guilty to crimes they did not commit or to charges more severe than \nthe facts of their cases warrant. \n184.  Many public defenders in Utah routinely fail to review presentence reports with \nclients prior to the day of sentencing.  Likewise, many public defenders do not conduct \nindependent mitigation investigations or pre-sentence reports for their clients, leaving the state's \nreport as the primary document relied upon by the court in sentencing. \n185.  These failures are to be expected because public defenders have so little time and \nresources (e.g., no investigators) to marshal an adequate defense. \n186.  The hallmarks of a vigorous defense on behalf of indigent criminal defendants are \nmissing, which leads to the conclusion that the Utah system of indigent defense has failed to put \nthe prosecution to the \"crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\"  The net effect of inadequate \nresources, lack of oversight and excessive caseloads is that indigent defense counsel more \nroutinely expend their energy pressuring defendants to accept the prosecution's plea offers. \n187.  Plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have suffered irreparable harm or are \nat imminent risk of suffering such harm because Defendants have failed to supervise and monitor \nthe indigent defense system for which they are responsible.

The Act establishes a system in which the State of \nUtah delegates the provision of indigent defense services to its counties and municipal legislative \nbodies.14 The Stateโs counties and municipalities must either โ(a) contract with a defense \nservices provider; or (b) authorize the court to provide the services . . . by assigning a qualified \n                                                 \n8 Id. \n9 Id. \n10 Id. \n11 Id. \n12 Id. \n13 State v.

The \nfirst is the Indigent Inmate Trust Fund,27 which pays for the โrepresentation, costs, and expenses \nof legal defense counsel for an indigent inmate in a state prison . . . who is charged with having \n                                                 \n21 Id. ยง 77-32-304.5(2)(b). \n22 Id. ยงยง 77-32-304.5(2)(c), (e). \n23 Id. ยง 77-32-305.5(2).

The Amended Complaint is rife with \ngeneralized and conclusory allegations, and legal argument and opinions, which are insufficient \nto establish Plaintiffsโ right to sue or state a claim. But because standing is a threshold \njurisdictional issue,56 the Amended Complaint will be analyzed and dismissed under principles \nof standing. However, for the same reasons, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted.57 \nStandard of Review \n  โFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.โ58 โThey possess only that power \nauthorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by judicial decree[.]โ59 \n                                                 \n54 Id. at 2 (emphasis in original). \n55 Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss. \n56 Warth v.

The vast majority of these allegations are generalized and conclusory. For \nexample, the Amended Complaint alleges: \nAll of them have had very little time to meet with their public defenders before \ncritical events in their cases, some having spent weeks in jail without any contact, \nmaking it impossible for them to meaningfully participate in the defense. Some \nhave been forced to meet with their defenders in the presence of others awaiting \ncriminal hearings because their defenders lack the resources to arrange for private \nmeetings. Several have not had their attorneys assist them in having the court \nreview their bail in a meaningful way. Each of their attorneys are compromised in \ntheir ability to engage necessary resources like experts and investigators. Each are \nlikely to feel pressure to accept a disadvantageous plea deal that they are unlikely \nto fully understand, and are unlikely to be fully advised by their attorneys of the \nlong term consequences of a guilty plea. All face significant time incarcerated if \nconvicted of their charges.84 \nIt also generally alleges that Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are: \nspending more time in pre-trial detention; being subject to excessive bail; \naccepting plea agreements about which they are ill-informed and have no \nunderstanding of collateral effects (e.g., immigration); agreeing to plea \nagreements that are excessively punitive (increased fines and recoupment of \nattorney fees) and entail longer sentences; being unaware of sentencing \nalternatives; and generally being denied the constitutionally mandated procedures \nthat ensure a fair and just defense to criminal charges.85 \n                                                 \n81 Id. at 695-96 (internal citations omitted). \n82 Id. at 696 (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659). \n83 Id. \n84 Amended Complaint ยถ 25. \n85 Id. ยถ 191. \n14 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 15 of 44\nBut the Amended Complaint fails to include necessary factual allegations demonstrating that \nthese generalized grievances have occurred, are occurring, or will occur to Plaintiffs. \n  Plaintiffs argue that Defendantsโ alleged failure to collect empirical data on the Stateโs \nindigent defense system and its public defenders prevents them from alleging specific facts \ndemonstrating the violation of their right to counsel.86 A lack of statewide empirical data may be \na valid reason for Plaintiffsโ generalized and conclusory allegations regarding the Stateโs \nindigent defense system as a whole, but it is not a valid excuse for their failure to allege specific \nfacts concerning their own public defenders and their own criminal cases. \n  Plaintiffsโ right to counsel is certainly a cognizable interest for purposes of standing. โBut \nthe โinjury in factโ test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest.โ87 โIt requires that \nthe [plaintiffs] be [themselves] among the injured.โ88 And the โthreatened injury must be \ncertainly impending to constitute injury in fact[; a]llegations of possible future injury are not \nsufficient.โ89 Without factual allegations showing that Plaintiffs are among the injured and the \ninjury is certainly impending, the Amended Complaint fails to allege an invasion of Plaintiffsโ \nlegally protected interests that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent.90 \n  Only nine of the Amended Complaintโs 231 numbered paragraphs include factual \nallegations relating to the six Plaintiffs.91 The rest of the allegations are generalized and \nconclusory, and legal argument and opinions couched as facts.

He has pending charges of possession of a forgery device (Third \nDegree Felony); possession or use of a controlled substance (Third Degree \nFelony); and use or possession of drug paraphernalia (Class B Misdemeanor). \nSince his incarceration, Mr. Remick has spoken with his public defender \nonceโat his initial appearance. When Mr. Remick spoke with his public \ndefender, it was for a โshort timeโ and in the presence of โmanyโ other \ndefendants waiting in a line to meet with the public defender.94 \nโข  Plaintiff Skylar W. Garner is a 32-year-old married man with two children \nunder the age of five. As of July 1, 2016, he was incarcerated in the Carbon \nCounty Jail due to a violation of a No Contact Order. Prior to his arrest, Mr. \nGarner held two jobs as a technician and maintenance specialist. Since his \narrest, he has had โvery littleโ contact with his public defender and has spoken \nwith his public defender for โless than 5 minutes.โ His public defender has \ngiven him no discovery or police reports, and has made no inquiry of him \nregarding the facts surrounding his charge.95 \nโข  Plaintiff Bryce Tucker Lloyd was incarcerated in the Tooele County Detention \nCenter located in Tooele, Utah as of July 1, 2016. He has pending charges of \nburglary (Second Degree Felony); unlawful acquisition, possession, or \ntransfer of a financial card (Third Degree Felony); possession or use of a \ncontrolled substance (Third Degree Felony); unlawful use of a financial \ntransaction (Class B Misdemeanor); and use or possession of drug \nparaphernalia (Class B Misdemeanor). Mr. Lloyd has spoken to his public \ndefender onceโat his initial appearance. When Mr. Lloyd met with his public \ndefender, it was for a โshort timeโ and was in the presence of โseveralโ other \ndefendants.

He did not meet with his public \ndefender prior to the arraignment and his only meeting with the public \ndefender was during his arraignment. Mr. Murdzak received no charging \nsheet; was not aware of the charges against him; and had no information as to \nwhy a firearm restriction charge had been made, as he had no firearm at the \ntime of his arrest, nor was one found in the vehicle he was driving. Following \nhis arraignment, Mr. Murdzak has not met with his public defender or \nreceived discovery, and he is unaware of when he will next meet with his \npublic defender or have a preliminary hearing set for his case.97 \nโข  Plaintiff Colter Ricks was incarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in \nLogan, Utah as of July 1, 2016. He has pending charges of failure to stop \n(Class A Misdemeanor); possession of drug paraphernalia (Class A \nMisdemeanor); and possession of methamphetamine (Third Degree Felony). \nMr. Ricks was arrested on May 28, 2016, and arraigned via video conference \non May 31, 2016. He had no counsel at his arraignment, and during the \narraignment, his bail for a prior charge was revoked and his bail for his \ncurrent charges was denied. After his arraignment, Mr. Ricks was appointed a \npublic defender, but he did not meet with his public defender prior to a pretrial \nhearing in his case on June 27, 2016.98 \nโข  Plaintiff Brandon Timms was incarcerated in the Cache County Jail located in \nLogan, Utah as of July 1, 2016. He has pending charges of theft (Class B \nMisdemeanor); and burglary (Second Degree Felony). Mr. Timms was \noriginally arrested in Salt Lake County, but was transported and incarcerated \nin the Cache County Jail because his charges allegedly took place in Logan, \nUtah. Mr. Timms was arrested on June 2, 2016, and arraigned on June 13, \n2016. He was not provided counsel and did not meet with his public defender \nprior to his arraignment.99 \n  Plaintiffs argue that these facts show a denial of their right to counsel through: \nโข  the absence of counsel at critical stages of judicial proceedings; \nโข  the denial of access to counsel; \nโข  the absence of a meaningful opportunity to understand the judicial process and \nto assist their public defenders in preparing a defense; \n                                                 \n97 Id. ยถยถ 34, 193. \n98 Id. ยถยถ 35, 193, 196. \n99 Id. ยถยถ 36, 193, 196. \n17 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 18 of 44\nโข  the denial of confidential attorney-client communications; and \nโข  being pressured to enter plea agreements that are, in the long term, not to their \nadvantage.100 \nPlaintiffs argument is without merit.

Nor does it contain allegations of when, \nor if, Plaintiffs were found to be indigent by a court. Plaintiffsโ indigence may reasonably be \ninferred from the allegations suggesting that public defenders were ultimately appointed.106 But \nin the absence of these crucial dates, the Amended Complaint fails to sufficiently allege that \ncounsel were not timely appointed following Plaintiffsโ arrests and the determination of their \nindigence. Rather, the allegations demonstrate that each Plaintiff was appointed a public \ndefender who, after appointment, was present at each Plaintiffโs respective court hearings.107 \n  One possible exception to this comes from the allegation that Mr. Ricks had no counsel at \nhis arraignment and bail hearing.108 These are critical stages in a criminal proceeding,109 and \ncould demonstrate that Mr. Ricks suffered an actual or complete denial of counsel. But because \nthere are no allegations suggesting that Mr. Ricks had been found indigent prior to, or at, his \narraignment and bail hearing, his entitlement to a public defender at those hearings is left to \nspeculation. Moreover, even if Mr. Ricks was entitled to a public defender at those hearings, \nthere are insufficient factual allegations to support a reasonable inference that the failure to \ntimely appoint him counsel resulted from a statewide, systemic failing of Utahโs indigent defense \nsystem.

It is not reasonable to infer that private spaces at other facilities are not made \navailable for Plaintiffs and their public defenders to meet and communicate. \nTherefore, the Amended Complaint fails to sufficiently allege a concrete and \nparticularized denial of Plaintiffsโ ability to engage in confidential attorney-client \ncommunications. \n  No factual allegations of being pressured to enter plea agreements \n  Couched in the allegation regarding Mr. Remickโs meeting with his public defender at his \ninitial appearance, is the statement that: \nOther defendants assigned to the same public defender were in a line waiting to \nmeet with the public defender; because of the wait, some defendants were \nincented to accept a plea deal because, if a plea deal was rejected, defendant \nwould have to go to the back of the line, and wait at least one more hour to again \nspeak with the public defender.117 \nThe Amended Complaint also alleges that โ[s]ome Plaintiffs, like [Mr.] Ricks and [Mr.] Timms \nhave been detained in jail for over a month, increasing the pressure to take a deal that is in the \nlong term not to their advantage but has the potential immediate advantage of getting out of jail \nand being able to go back to work.โ118 \n                                                 \n116 Amended Complaint ยถยถ 158-60. \n117 Id. ยถ 31. \n118 Id. ยถ 196. \n22 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 23 of 44\n  These are not allegations that Mr. Remick, Mr. Ricks, or Mr. Timms were pressured by \nsomeone to enter plea agreements. Indeed, there are no allegations that any Plaintiff was ever \npressured by a public defender or anyone else to enter a plea agreement. The first allegation is \npresumably an opinion of Mr. Remick that on the day of his initial appearance, โ[o]ther \ndefendantsโ felt incentivized to enter plea agreements to avoid waiting to speak with their public \ndefender.119 That other defendants felt incentivized is conclusory and conjecture. It is also \ninsufficient to show that Mr. Remick was pressured to enter a plea agreement. And even if the \nallegation pertained to Mr. Remick, having to wait is inconvenient, but does not compel. The \nallegations show that an opportunity for full discussionโat the back of the lineโwas available. \n  Additionally, the allegation regarding Mr. Ricks and Mr. Timms is merely that they felt \ninternal pressure to enter plea agreements.120 This was due to the length of time they had spent in \ncustody, not because their public defenders or anyone else had placed pressure on them.121 \nFeeling pressure to enter a plea from the circumstances of being charged with a crime and held in \ncustody is not the same as being pressured to coerce a plea agreement. Moreover, there are \ninsufficient factual allegations to support reasonable inference that the length of time Mr. Rick \nand Mr. Timms have spent in custody has anything to do with their indigence, or some failing on \nthe part of their public defenders or the Stateโs indigent defense system. \n  Therefore, allegations are insufficient show that Plaintiffs are being pressured to enter \nplea agreements. \n                                                 \n119 Id. ยถ 31. \n120 Id. ยถ 196 \n121 Id. \n23 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 24 of 44\n  Accordingly, the Amended Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts that Plaintiffs have \nsuffered, are suffering, or will suffer an injury in fact through an actual or complete denial of \ncounsel. \nThere are insufficient allegations that Plaintiffsโ public defenders have entirely failed, or \nwill entirely fail, to subject the prosecutionโs cases to meaningful adversarial testingโ \nCronicโs second situation in which prejudice is presumed \n  The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs have had limited contact and \ncommunication with their public defenders.122 Plaintiffs argue that these allegations, coupled \nwith the general allegations regarding the Stateโs public defenders are sufficient to raise \nreasonable inference that Plaintiffsโ public defenders have entirely failed, or will entirely fail, to \nsubject the prosecutionโs cases to meaningful adversarial testing.123 \n  Plaintiffsโ argument relies on the Amended Complaintโs general allegations that many of \nthe Stateโs public defenders provide services to indigent defendants based on fixed flat fee \ncontracts with the Stateโs counties.124 Plaintiffs submit that these contracts financially incentivize \npublic defenders to spend as little time as possible working on an indigent defendantโs case.125 \nPlaintiffs also rely on their generalized and conclusory allegations that many of the Stateโs public \ndefenders are overworked and rarely make discovery or other pretrial motions;126 that the State \nand its counties do not adequately compensate, train, or supervise public defenders;127 and that \nthere are no measures in place to assure that the Stateโs public defenders are qualified to subject \n                                                 \n122 Id. ยถยถ 31-36, 193. \n123 Plaintiffsโ Opposition at 20-21. \n124 Amended Complaint ยถยถ 10-12, 104, 110, 117-20, 126-27, 129, 134, 154, 169, 172, 190 \n125 Id. \n126 Id. ยถยถ 12, 103, 109, 118, 142, 144-49, 157, 173-75, 177, 179-80, 182, 186, 190. \n127 Id. ยถยถ 10, 12, 100, 103, 108-09, 118-20, 130, 132, 134, 139-40, 142, 153-54, 170-72, 187, 190. \n24 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 25 of 44\ncriminal cases to meaningful adversarial testing.128 Additionally, Plaintiffs refer to national \nstandards for public defenders and findings from various studies of the Stateโs indigent defense \nsystem that have identified issues with the use of flat fee contracts and the high caseloads, low \ncompensation, and lack of supervision and training of public defenders.129 \n  The issues with the Stateโs indigent defense system and its public defenders raised by \nPlaintiffs and the findings of the cited studies are certainly cause for concern.

Alabama144 is a case with \ncircumstances justifying a presumption of prejudice: \nThe defendants had been indicted for a highly publicized capital offense. Six days \nbefore trial, the trial judge appointed โall the members of the barโ for purposes of \narraignment. โWhether they would represent the defendants thereafter if no \ncounsel appeared in their behalf, was a matter of speculation only, or, as the judge \nindicated, of mere anticipation on the part of the court.โ On the day of trial, a \nlawyer from Tennessee appeared on behalf of persons โinterestedโ in the \ndefendants, but stated that he had not had an opportunity to prepare the case or to \nfamiliarize himself with local procedure, and therefore was unwilling to represent \nthe defendants on such short notice. The problem was resolved when the court \ndecided that the Tennessee lawyer would represent the defendants, with whatever \nhelp the local bar could provide. โThe defendants, young, ignorant, illiterate, \nsurrounded by hostile sentiment, haled back and forth under guard of soldiers, \ncharged with an atrocious crime regarded with especial horror in the community \nwhere they were to be tried, were thus put in peril of their lives within a few \nmoments after counsel for the first time charged with any degree of responsibility \nbegan to represent them.โ . . . [U]nder these circumstances the likelihood that \ncounsel could have performed as an effective adversary was so remote as to have \nmade the trial inherently unfair.145 \n  On the other hand, Avery v. Alabama146 is a case with circumstances that did not justify a \npresumption of prejudice: \n[C]ounsel was appointed in a capital case only three days before trial, and the trial \ncourt denied counselโs request for additional time to prepare. Nevertheless, . . . \nsince evidence and witnesses were easily accessible to defense counsel, the \ncircumstances did not make it unreasonable to expect that counsel could \nadequately prepare for trial during that period of time[.]147 \n                                                 \n143 Id. at 660-62. \n144 287 U.S. 45 (1932). \n145 Cronic, 466 U.S. at 660 (quoting Powell, 287 U.S. at 56, 57-58). \n146 308 U.S. 444 (1940). \n147 Cronic, 466 U.S. at 661 (citing Avery, 308 U.S. at 450-53). \n28 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 29 of 44\n  These examples demonstrate that a presumption of prejudice will arise only in extremely \nrare and fact specific circumstances.148 The possibility of defense counsel adequately preparing \nfor a capital trial in three days under any circumstances seems unlikely, but it was not so remote \nand inherently unfair as to justify a presumption of prejudice in Avery. This is not to say that a \ndefendant facing similar circumstances to those in Avery has no potential claim for a violation of \nthe right to counsel. Such a defendant may still assert a post-trial claim for ineffective assistance \nof counsel under Strickland, where counselโs actual performance and prejudice to the defendant \nare analyzed.149 But a defendant may not use Cronicโs presumption of prejudice to supplant the \npostconviction procedure of analyzing the right to counsel under Strickland.150 \n  The allegations of Plaintiffsโ Amended Complaint are insufficient to show, and fail to \ncreate reasonable inference, that Plaintiffsโ public defenders have been called upon to render \nassistance under circumstances in which competent counsel very likely could not. There are no \nallegations specific to Plaintiffsโ public defenders and only minimal allegations regarding \nPlaintiffsโ underlying criminal cases. Their public defendersโ experience, qualifications, \ncaseloads, and compensation and expenses are unknown. Whether their public defenders have \nreceived discovery, whether discovery is ongoing, and whether trials are scheduled is unknown. \nAnd the extent to which investigative resources, expert witnesses, and the filing of pretrial \nmotions are needed is unknown. \n  Plaintiffsโ Amended Complaint does allege a lack of contact and communication between \nPlaintiffs and their public defenders.151 But without further context, it fails to allege sufficient \n                                                 \n148 Hooks v.

Plaintiffs allege that the \nStateโs public defenders are not paid or given resources commensurate to the Stateโs \nprosecutors.152 But parity of compensation is only one factor in determining the appropriate \ncompensation for a public defender in a particular case.153 And a lack of parity does not \nautomatically equate to circumstances in which competent counsel cannot render assistance. \nSuch is not a reasonable inference. \n  Plaintiffs allege a lack of physical space in the Stateโs courthouses at which indigent \ndefendants can meet with their public defenders.154 But Plaintiffs fail to allege that such spaces \nare not made available elsewhere, such as at the jails and detention centers where the indigent \ndefendants are held in custody. And it is not reasonable to infer that the alleged issues arising \nfrom the public defendersโ flat fee contracts with the Stateโs counties are so great and inherently \nunfair as to justify a presumption that the public defenders cannot render constitutionally \nadequate representation to their indigent clients. \n  Indeed, โ[t]he Tenth Circuit has applied Cronic only where the evidence \nโoverwhelmingly established that [the] attorney abandoned the required duty of loyalty to his \n                                                 \n152 Id. ยถยถ 10, 106, 140, 152, 170-72. \n153 Utah Code Ann. ยง 77-32-304.5(2)(b). \n154 Amended Complaint ยถยถ 31, 33, 158-60, 195. \n30 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 31 of 44\nclient . . .  apparently with the intention to weaken his clientโs case.โโ155 The circumstances \nPlaintiffs allege, while troublesome, do not rise to the level of Avery, let alone Powell. \n  Therefore, the Amended Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts that Plaintiffs have \nsuffered, are suffering, or will suffer an injury in fact through their public defenders being called \nupon to render assistance under circumstances in which competent counsel very likely could not. \n  The Amended Complaints fails to allege sufficient circumstances to constitute an actual \nor constructive denial of Plaintiffsโ right to counsel under Cronic, where prejudice to Plaintiffs is \npresumed. Thus, it fails to demonstrate an actual or imminent invasion of Plaintiffsโ right to \ncounsel which is concrete and particularized. The alleged harms to Plaintiffs are conjectural and \nhypothetical.

When, \nhowever, . . . a plaintiffโs asserted injury arises from the governmentโs allegedly \nunlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else, much more is needed. \nIn that circumstance, causation . . . ordinarily hinge[s] on the response of the \nregulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or inactionโand \nperhaps on the response of others as well. The existence of one or more of the \nessential elements of standing depends on the unfettered choices made by \nindependent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and \nlegitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict, and \nit becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices \nhave been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation . . . .

Wainwright, the United States Supreme Court held that the United States \nConstitution requires states to furnish counsel to persons charged with crimes, who are unable to \nafford or obtain counsel.167 But Gideon left open how states were to fund and administer their \nrespective indigent defense systems. Through its Indigent Defense Act, Utah has delegated the \nprovision of indigent defense services to its counties and municipal legislative bodies.168 \nPlaintiffs cite to no authority, and do not argue, that such a delegation is constitutionally \nimpermissible on its face. Indeed, Plaintiffs acknowledge that โa state may delegate obligations \nimposed by either the state or U.S. Constitutions,โ169 including delegation of โthe practical \nimplementation of indigent defense to the [stateโs] counties and municipalities . . . .โ170 \n  Rather, Plaintiffs maintain that the manner in which the State has delegated indigent \ndefense services to the counties and municipalitiesโallegedly without funding, administration, \nor oversightโhas caused a systemic denial of Plaintiffs and the proposed class membersโ right to \n                                                 \n164 Id. at 561-62 (internal quotations and citations omitted; emphasis in original). \n165 Amended Complaint ยถยถ 7-8, 10, 14, 19, 58-61, 71-72, 97-101, 103, 107-09, 130-32, 138, 142, 144, 146, 150-51, \n158, 190. \n166 Id. ยถยถ 198-231. \n167 372 U.S. 335. \n168 Amended Complaint ยถยถ 8, 57; Utah Code Ann. ยง 77-32-306. \n169 Plaintiffsโ Opposition at 10. \n170 Id. at 8. \n33 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 34 of 44\ncounsel.171 Thus, while Plaintiffs are the ultimate beneficiaries of the indigent defense services \nprovided, they themselves are not the object of the challenged action or inaction of Defendants in \nthis case. Instead, the asserted denial of the right to counsel arises from Defendantsโ allegedly \nunlawful lack of regulation of the Stateโs counties and municipalities. And because the counties \nand municipalities are independent actors not before the court, Plaintiffs must meet the higher \nburden of adducing facts showing that the counties and municipalitiesโ provision of indigent \ndefense services has been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation.172 \n  Plaintiffsโ Amended Complaint fails to meet this burden. Plaintiffsโ assert: \n[T]he State has an obligation to ensure that its counties are capable of meeting the \ndelegated functions and have the means to do so. [It] also must assure that the \ncounties have in fact discharged any delegated functions by providing state \noversight to assure that the defense being provided by the counties passes \nconstitutional muster. If the counties cannot meet the delegated obligations, the \nStateโas the original obligorโmust step in.173 \nThis may very well be true. But the Amended Complaint does not allege that the Stateโs counties \nand municipalities are not capable of meeting the delegated functions of providing indigent \ndefense services in the absence of funding, administration, and oversight from Defendants. \nRather, the Amended Complaint alleges that โDefendants have allowed a system to develop in \nwhich counties and municipalities are not providing timely and competent legal counsel, are \ndenying public defenders investigatory resources necessary for a complete defense, and creating \nconditions making it practically impossible for public counsel to provide undivided loyalty to \ntheir clients.โ174 This allegation is conclusory and is not supported by factual allegations. \n                                                 \n171 Id. at 9-12. \n172 Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \n173 Id. at 9. \n174 Amended Complaint ยถ 95; see also id. ยถ 59. \n34 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 35 of 44\n  The Amended Complaint reads as though it were a brief, written in response to a motion \nto dismiss, rather than a complaint which alleges facts to support its causes of action. And at \ntimes it reads as though the public defenders are the plaintiffs, claiming unfairness in the \ncontracts they negotiate with the Stateโs counties and municipalities.175 The Amended Complaint \nis rife with anecdote, allegations of generalized grievances, and argument regarding the effect of \nhow the Stateโs counties and municipalities select, compensate, train, and supervise public \ndefenders.176 But it is missing factual allegations specific to these Plaintiffs to support and \ndemonstrate these generalized grievances. \n  Plaintiffs offer no facts of specific cases in which these grievances have occurred or are \noccurring. They do not identify or provide facts regarding any public defender that is \nunqualified, overworked, or unable to competently represent his or her indigent clients because \nof the counties and municipalitiesโ actions. And in the absence of these types of factual \nallegations, it is speculative to infer that the alleged denial of Plaintiffsโ right to counsel is caused \nby the counties and municipalitiesโ actions. Likewise, it is speculative to infer that the alleged \ndenial of counsel has occurred or is occurring on a systemic level because of Defendantsโ alleged \nfailure to fund, administer, and oversee the counties and municipalitiesโ provision of indigent \ndefense services. The alleged denial of counsel may simply be caused by the action or inaction of \ncertain public defenders in certain cases, which is appropriately the subject matter of an \nindividual defendantโs postconviction claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under \nStrickland.177 \n                                                 \n175 Id. ยถยถ 9-14, 112-129, 139-41, 143, 148-57, 170-80. \n176 Id. ยถยถ 9-14, 21-25, 61, 70-73, 75-85, 92, 94-96, 104, 108-120, 126-138, 142-43, 145-49, 150-61, 166-80, 182-91. \n177 Bell, 535 U.S. at 697-98. \n35 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 36 of 44\n  Certainly, Plaintiffs have identified issues that may arise with the use of flat fee contracts \nto retain public defenders.178 But Plaintiffs cite no authority holding that the counties and \nmunicipalitiesโ use of these types of contracts results in a per se denial of the right to counsel. \nFacts are needed to allow reasonable inference that Plaintiffs have suffered or are suffering harm \nbecause of these contracts. Likewise, Plaintiffs have identified issues that may arise from a lack \nof supervision and training of public defenders.179 But facts are needed to allow reasonable \ninference that a lack of supervision and training has caused or is causing harm to Plaintiffs. And \nfacts are needed to allow reasonable inference that a lack of State funding is the cause of \nPlaintiffsโ alleged harm. \n  Utahโs Indigent Defense Act sets forth how the Stateโs counties and municipalities are to \nobtain counsel for indigent defendants;180 when an indigent defendant is entitled to counsel;181 \nthe minimum standards for indigent defense;182 and how to determine appropriate compensation \nand reimbursement of expenses for counsel.183 The Act creates trust funds and a restricted \naccount which are dedicated to the provision of indigent defense services.184 The Act enables the \nStateโs counties and municipalities to use public funds and levy taxes to pay for indigent defense \nservices.185 And the Act establishes a commission to assist the state in meeting the stateโs \nobligations for the provision of indigent defense services.186 Given this statutory framework, and \n                                                 \n178 Amended Complaint ยถยถ 9-12, 81, 110, 113-29, 173-88. \n179 Id. ยถยถ 10, 13-14, 19-24, 77-84, 89-92, 98-104, 107-09, 130, 132-37, 142-49, 151, 154-61, 173-91. \n180 Utah Code Ann. ยง 77-32-306. \n181 Id. ยง 77-32-304(1). \n182 Id. ยงยง 77-32-201(12), 301. \n183 Id. ยงยง 77-32-304(3), 304.5, 305, 305.5. \n184 Id. ยงยง 77-32-502, 601, 805. \n185 Id. ยงยง 77-32-307(1), (3). \n186 Id. ยงยง 77-32-801, 804. \n36 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 37 of 44\nthe absence of factual allegations in Plaintiffsโ Amended Complaint, it is speculative to infer that \nPlaintiffsโ alleged denial of counsel is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of Defendants, \nand not the result of the independent action of some third partyโthe counties and municipalities \nor individual public defendersโnot before the court. \n  Therefore, the Amended Complaint fails to sufficiently demonstrate causation for \npurpose of establishing Plaintiffsโ standing to sue. \nThe Declaratory Relief Plaintiffs Seek Does Not Meet the Standard for Redressability \n  The third element of standing requires a plaintiff to establish that it is โlikely, as opposed \nto merely speculative, that [the plaintiffโs alleged] injury will be redressed by a favorable [court] \ndecision.โ187 Plaintiffs have limited the requested relief in their Amended Complaint โto present \na single issue for declaratory judgment: whether the Defendants are complying with the U.S. and \nUtah Constitutions in the way they ensure (or fail to ensure) the provision of indigent defense \nservices statewide.โ188 \n  โIt is well established that what makes a declaratory judgment action โa proper judicial \nresolution of a โcase or controversyโ rather than an advisory opinionโis [ ] the settling of some \ndispute which affects the behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff.โโ189 โA justiciable \ncontroversy is thus distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract \ncharacter; from one that is academic or moot.โ190 โThe controversy must be definite and \nconcrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.โ191 โIt must be a \n                                                 \n187 Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (internal quotations omitted). \n188 Plaintiffsโ Opposition at 2. \n189 Cox v.

Plaintiffs argument relies on the United State \nSupreme Courtโs analysis in Steffel v. Thompson.199 \n  In Steffel, the issue was โwhether declaratory relief is precluded when a state prosecution \nhas been threatened, but is not pending, and a showing of bad-faith enforcement or other special \ncircumstances has not been made.โ200 The petitioner was threatened with arrest for criminal \ntrespass for distributing anti-war handbills on the exterior sidewalk of a shopping center.201 He \nfiled a complaint in federal court seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that the \nstateโs criminal trespass statute was being applied in violation of his First and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights.202 \n  The Supreme Court determined that the petitioner had demonstrated an injury in fact: โIn \nthese circumstances, it is not necessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or \nprosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his \nconstitutional rights.โ203 The Court also determined that declaratory relief would not interfere \nwith state criminal proceedings: \nWhen no state criminal proceeding is pending at the time the federal complaint is \nfiled, federal intervention does not result in duplicative legal proceedings or \ndisruption of the state criminal justice system; nor can federal intervention, in that \ncircumstance, be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state courtโs ability \nto enforce constitutional principles.204 \nAnd the Court addressed the likely effect a declaratory judgment would have: \nOf course, a favorable declaratory judgment may . . . be valuable to the plaintiff \nthough it cannot make even an unconstitutional statute disappear . . . . [T]he \n                                                 \n199 415 U.S. 452 (1974). \n200 Id. at 454. \n201 Id. at 455-56. \n202 Id. at 454, 456. \n203 Id. at 459. \n204 Id. at 462. \n39 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 40 of 44\ndeclaration may still be able to cut down the deterrent effect of an \nunconstitutional statute. The persuasive force of the . . . opinion and judgment \nmay lead state prosecutors, courts, and legislators to reconsider their respective \nresponsibilities toward the statute. Enforcement policies or judicial construction \nmay be changed, or the legislature may repeal the statute and start anew.205 \nThe Court ultimately held that โfederal declaratory relief is not precluded when no state \nprosecution is pending and a federal plaintiff demonstrates a genuine threat of enforcement of a \ndisputed state criminal statute, whether an attack is made on the constitutionality of the statute on \nits face or as applied.โ206 \n  The inapplicability of Steffel to Plaintiffsโ claim for declaratory relief is obvious. Steffel is \nfactually distinguishable. Its petitioner challenged the constitutionality of a single state criminal \nstatute as applied to his conduct when no criminal prosecution was pending.207 A declaration of \nunconstitutionality would render later convictions under that statute for similar conduct \nreversible.208 It would also have the likely effect of changing the future conduct of state \nprosecutors and courts in applying the statue, and state legislators in repealing the statute.209 And \nbecause no prosecution was pending, the declaratory judgment was not interfering with state \ncriminal proceedings.210 \n  Also, Plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of a state statute as applied to their \nconduct. Rather, they challenge the constitutionality of the manner in which Defendants fund, \nadminister, and oversee the Stateโs indigent defense system in effort to control or prevent the \n                                                 \n205 Id. at 469 (quoting Perez v.

It will not have any effect on Plaintiffsโ underlying criminal \ncasesโtheir cases will still proceed to disposition with the same public defenders representing \nthem. The declaratory relief will not ensure the Stateโs public defenders will render \nconstitutionally effective assistance, or prohibit them from negotiating flat fee contracts with the \nStateโs counties and municipalities. The Stateโs prosecutors will not be likely to stop pursuing \ncharges against indigent defendants until corrections to the Stateโs indigent defense system are \nmade. Nor will the Stateโs courts be likely to dismiss prosecutions against indigent defendants \nuntil corrections are made. Simply put, the declaratory relief will not terminate a controversy by \nremedying Plaintiffsโ alleged injury. \n  A declaratory judgment could cause the State Legislature to take a hard look at Utahโs \nIndigent Defense Actโs funding, administration, and oversight provisions. It could also cause the \nState Legislature and the Stateโs counties and municipalities to reconsider the use of flat fee \ncontracts to retain public defenders. But again, Plaintiffs are not challenging the Stateโs \ndelegation of indigent defense services to its counties and municipalities.212 Nor do they seek \ndeclaration that the use of flat fee contracts is unconstitutional per se. And the State Legislature \nhas already acted by amending the Act in 2016 to create the Utah Indigent Defense Commission \nand an Indigent Defense Resources Restricted Account to address the issues with the indigent \ndefense system that Plaintiffs raise.213 \n                                                 \n211 Amended Complaint ยถยถ 198-231. \n212 Plaintiffsโ Opposition at 8, 10. \n213 Utah Code Ann. ยงยง 77-32-801(1)-(2), 804(1), 805(2)-(5). \n41 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 42 of 44\n  The declaratory relief Plaintiffsโ seek is either mooted by the 2016 amendment, or \nprematurely determines that the amendment is insufficient to effectuate the changes to the Stateโs \nindigent defense system Plaintiffs desire.

A declaratory judgment, or any later injunctive relief \n(which Plaintiffs allude may be necessary214), may impermissibly interfere with the ongoing \nstate criminal prosecutions.215 \n  โSensitive to principles of equity, comity, and federalism,โ the United States Supreme \nCourt has recognized โthat federal courts should ordinarily refrain from enjoining ongoing state \ncriminal prosecutions.โ216 โ[A] pending state proceeding, in all but unusual cases, would provide \nthe federal plaintiff with the necessary vehicle for vindicating his constitutional rights, and, in \nthat circumstance, the restraining of an ongoing prosecution would entail an unseemly failure to \ngive effect to the principle that state courts have the solemn responsibility, equally with the \nfederal courts to guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the constitution of \nthe United States . . . .โ217 โ[I]n cases where the state criminal prosecution was begun prior to the \nfederal suit, the same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken \n                                                 \n214 Plaintiffsโ Opposition at 15. \n215 OโShea v.

This alternate \navenue for relief is better suited to redress Plaintiffsโ alleged injury. \n  Therefore, the declaratory relief Plaintiffs seek does not meet the standard for \nredressability. \n  Accordingly, because Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege and demonstrate an injury in \nfact and causation, and because the declaratory relief they seek does not meet the standard of \nredressability, Plaintiff lack standing. \n   \n                                                 \n218 Id. at 461 (internal quotations omitted). \n43 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-00789-DN   Document 78   Filed 03/23/18   Page 44 of 44\nORDER \n  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n(1)  Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss219 is GRANTED; \n(2)  Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification220 is MOOT; \n(3)  Movant Roger Brynerโs Motion to Intervene221 is MOOT; and \n(4)  Plaintiffsโ Motion to Lift Stay and for Entry of Scheduling Order Regarding \nPlaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification222 is MOOT. \nThe Clerk is directed to close the case. \n  Signed March 23, 2017. \n            BY THE COURT \n \n            ________________________________________ \n        District Judge David Nuffer \n                                                 \n219 Docket no. 28, filed Aug. 5, 2016. \n220 Docket no. 16, filed July 26, 2016. \n221 Docket no. 59, filed Apr. 6, 2017. \n222 Docket no. 71, filed July 25, 2017. \n44 ",
