Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that plaintiff shall file any amended complaint by April 21, 2014. Plaintiff will not be given any further opportunity to amend the complaint to address issues raised by the motion to dismiss. If plaintiff does amend, by three (3) weeks after the amended complaint is filed, defendant shall: (1) file an answer; (2) file a new motion to dismiss; or (3) submit a letter to the Court, copying plaintiff, stating that it relies on the previously filed motion to dismiss. If defendant files an answer or a new motion to dismiss, the Court will deny the previously filed motion to dismiss as moot. Pursuant to the Case Management Plan (Docket No. 14) and the Endorsed Letter of March 19, 2014 (Docket No. 22), it is further ORDERED that, if no amended complaint is filed, plaintiff shall serve any opposition to the motion to dismiss by April 21, 2014. Defendant's reply, if any, shall be served by April 30, 2014. At the time any reply is served, the moving party shall supply the Court with one courtesy hard copy of all motion papers by mailing or delivering them to the United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York, New York. Finally, the parties are reminded that discovery is not stayed pending a ruling on the motion. (Signed by Judge Jesse M. Furman on 4/1/2014) (mro) (Entered: 04/02/2014)"

There is no need for a conference to address the parties' disputes as Plaintiffs' objections to the proposed releases are overruled. Defendants are entitled to the medical and mental health records they seek as Plaintiffs have put the medical and mental health of the student Plaintiffs directly into issue. The fact that Plaintiffs seek only \"garden variety\" damages is of no moment, as Defendants are entitled to the records to contest liability. And any privacy interests are adequately addressed by the protective order that is in place. (Docket No. 17). With respect to Plaintiffs' remaining objections - to the releases for certain Plaintiffs' private school and private evaluation records and ACS records - Plaintiffs have not invoked any privilege, but appear to challenge only the relevance of such records. Given the broad definition of relevance for purposes of discovery, those objections are without merit. Again, any privacy concerns are adequately addressed by the protective order. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' objections are overruled, and they are ordered to provide the releases at issue within one week of this Order. (HEREBY ORDERED by Judge Jesse M.

    "summary": "<p>On October 11, 2013, children with disabilities enrolled in New York City public schools, filed this lawsuit against the New York Department of Education in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. §1983, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, §504 of The Rehabilitation Act, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs alleged that the school district had forcibly interrupted the education of students with disabilities through repeated misuse of emergency medical services (EMS) to remove these students from school even though they were not in need of medical care. Instead, the district relied on EMS to address disruptive behavior. The plaintiffs also alleged this practice was unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and that it violated state law and city regulations. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt this practice, as well as damages and attorneys’ fees. The plaintiffs were represented by Legal Services NYC and private counsel.</p><p>On March 18, 2014, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding five additional plaintiff-parents and their children as well as new factual details.</p><p>On March 31, 2014, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. </p><p>April 7, 2014 – referring case to magistrate judge James L. Cott for settlement. From June 30, 2014 through November 6, 2014, the parties held five settlement conferences in front of Magistrate Judge Cott. In light of the settlement conferences, the defendants removed their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on September 24, 2014. </p><p>On December 15, 2014, the parties entered a settlement agreement that required policy changes and training for the defendant, as well as reporting requirements throughout the stipulation period that runs until June 30, 2018. In addition to injunctive relief, the defendant won $502,621.7 in emotional damages and out-of-pocket costs for eleven plaintiff-children and their parents and $613,000 in attorneys fees. The terms of agreement were enforceable by the court. </p><p>On January 14, 2015, Magistrate Judge Cott approved all the individual plaintiffs’ infant compromises, which outlined how the plaintiff parents would use the plaintiff children’s damages money. Most put the money into trusts for their chidlrens’ future use. Although the court maintains jurisdiction to monitor the settlement, all the disputes are now resolved. </p>",

Defendants shall provide the requested plans \nto Plaintiffs within 21  days of receiving Plaintiffs' written request. \n9.  By March  ] , 2016 and  by  each  subsequent March  1,  Defendants will  provide \nPlaintiffs with written confirmation that DOE is in compliance with Paragraphs Il.C. l., ll.C.3., \nII.C.4., II.C.5., ILC.6., and II.C.7. \nD.  TRAINING, ORIENTATION, AND COMMUNICATION OF DOE POLICY \n1.  DOE will provide TCIS Training to 500 employees assigned to Designated Sites \nat Designated Schools per school year in school years 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018. \nThis Training will  be in addition to the voluntary TCIS Training currently provided to DOE \nemployees throughout the school system.  DOE will make good-faith efforts to make available to \nDOE employees during the Stipulation Period voluntary TCIS Training beyond that which is \nmandated by this Stipulation.  The intention of these efforts will be to substantially increase the \ntotal number of DOE employees trained in TCIS during the Stipulation Period compared to the \ntotal number of DOE employees trained in TClS in the three years prior to July 1, 2015.  If DOE \nprovides TCIS Training to DOE employees during the period between July l and the first day in \nSeptember in which schools are open for instruction, such Training will count towards the 500 \nemployees  DOE  is  required  to  train  if the  DOE  employees  who  receive  that  Training  arc \nassigned to one of that school year's Designated Sites. \n2.  By  February  l, 2016, and  by  each subsequent February  1, at every building at \nwhich  a  Designated  Site  is  located,  DOE  will  meet  the  following  minimum  training \nrequirements.  At Designated Sites with student enrollment of 25 or less, there will be at least \ntwo employees with TCIS Training, and one must be an employee assigned to the Designated \nSite  of the  Designated  SchooL  and  the  second  must  either  be  an  employee  assigned  to  the \n9 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 71   Filed 12/15/14   Page 10 of 23\nDesignated Site of the  Designated School  or the  Special  Needs Coordinator on  the  Building \nResponse Team of the building in which  the  Designated Site is located.  At Designated Sites \nwith student enrollment of greater than 25, there will  be at  least three employees with TCIS \nTraining, and two must be employees assigned to the Designated Site of the Designated School, \nand the third  must either be  an employee assigned to the  Designated  Site of the  Designated \nSchool  or the Special Needs Coordinator on the Building Response Team of the building in \nwhich the Designated Site is located.  In the event that the number of trained employees at a \nDesignated Site falls  below the minimum requirements, DOE will  meet these requirements as \nsoon as reasonably practicable. \n3.  No sooner than April 1, 2017, Plaintiffs may initiate a meet and confor process \nwith  Defendants,  who  agree  to  meet  with  Plaintiffs  in  such  event to  discuss  whether  the \nmrmmum  number  of TCIS-Trained  employees  at  one  or  more  Designated  Sites  should  be \nincreased.  I( after the parties have met and conferred, they have not reached an agreement about \nincreasing the minimum number of TC JS-Trained employees at Designated Sites, Plaintiffs may \nmove to  modify this Stipulation and Order of Settlement solely for the purpose of seeking an \norder from the Court mandating an increased minimum number of TC IS-Trained employees at \none or more Designated Sites. \n4.  Provision of TCIS Training for additional employees assigned to the Designated \nSites beyond the minimum requirements set forth above (up to the 500 employees that DOE is \nrequired to  train  per year as  set forth in  Paragraph 11.D.1.) will  be determined by DOE in its \ndiscretion.  In making this determination, DOE shall consider the number of DOE staff at these \nDesignated Sites who have already received TCIS Training. the number of students enrolled at \nthat  Designated  Site  and  any  other  relevant  factors.  In  providing  the  training mandated  in \nI 0 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 71   Filed 12/15/14   Page 11 of 23\nParagraph  11.D. I ..  DOE  shall  prioritize  meeting  the  required  mm1mum  levels  of trained \nemployees as set forth  in  Paragraph  II. D.2.  as soon as possible.  J\\s  mandated by Paragraph \n!I. 0.2., those minimum levels shall be achieved by no later than February I. 2016, and by each \nsubsequent February l. \n5.  Selected Schools will be determined for each school year as set forth in Paragraph \n1.5.  Insofar as a school that was a Selected School in a prior year remains a Selected School, the \nminimum requirements of trained employees outlined in Paragraph fl.D.2. will remain applicable \nto that school's Designated Sites.  Tf a school that was a Selected School in a prior year is no \nlonger a Selected School, then these minimum requirements of trained employees will no longer \nbe applicable at that school's Designated Sites.  If a school that was not a Selected School in a \nprior year becomes a Selected School, then these minimum requirements of trained employees \nwill become applicable to that school's Designated Sites. \n6.  By  August  15  of each  year,  Defendants  will  provide  Plaintiffs  a  list  of the \nDesignated Schools and Designated Sites for the coming year and will provide Plaintiffs with the \ndata used for determining the list. \n7.  For purposes of meeting the minimum requirements set forth in Paragraph II.D.2., \nan individual employee must have either: (a) received TC!S Training in the last two years: or (b) \nreceived TCIS Trnining more than two years earlier and received TClS Refresher Training in the \nlast two years. \n8.

(13 Civ. 8777) \nExhibit A to the Stipulation and Order of Settlement \nSECTION I \nWhen  a  student engages in behavior that poses a substantial risk of serious injury to the student \nor others, schools must determine the appropriate way to manage the behavior and whether the \nsituation can be safely de-escalated by scbool staff as set forth below.  Jn such situations, the \nfollowing procedures must be followed: \nl)  The principal/designee must be  notified of the situation and must attempt to reach the \nparent. 1  The parent must be given an opportunity to speak by telephone or in person with \nbis/her child where safoty considerations permit and where it will not interfere with school \nstaffs efforts to de-escalate the situation. \n2)  Every effort must be made by responding school staff to safely de-escalate the behavior \nwhere possible using strategies and interventions for addressing behavioral crises and the \nin-school and community resources identified in the school's Crisis De-escalation Plan. \nIf the classroom  teacher or the responding staff member is  unable  to  de-escalate the \nbehavior, the teacher/staff member should seek assistance from staff members trained in \ncrisis  de-escalation.  The  teacher/staff member  may  also  seek  assistance  from  other \nappropriate staff and resources including the assistant principal, dean, a member of the \nschool's Crisis Intervention Team, a member of the Building Response Team, a guidance \ncounselor,  School-Based  Mental  Health  Clinic  (''SBMH\")  or  a  School-Based  Health \nCenter with mental health services (\"SBHC\") if there is one on-site, or the Crisis Mobile \nResponse Team if available in the borough. \n3)  However, where a student's behavior poses an imminent and substantial risk of serious \ninjury to himself or others and the situation cannot be safely addressed by school staff or \nthe  support  services  set  fo1ih  above,  the  principal/designee  must  call  911.

COTT, United States Magistrate Judge. \nPlaintiffs T.H., K.P., K.J., C.J., Y.P., M.E., T.W., A.D., N.C.R., I.S., and R.M.T. \ncommenced this action on December 11, 2013 on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor \nchildren J.H., W.P., J.R., J.M., N.R., D.E., A.A., S.D., C.R., Q.A., and R.T. (the \"Infants\"), \nrespectively, for injunctive and declaratory relief and damages against the City of New York, its \nDepartment of Education and its Fire Department.1 Plaintiffs, who are the parents of 11 New \nYork City public school children, alleged in their amended complaint that their children have \nbeen subjected to and damaged by an unlawful practice and policy of using Emergency Medical \nServices to remove children with disruptive behavior from schools when school personnel have \nno reasonable belief that the children are in need of emergency medical care.  Defendants denied \nthe allegations, and the parties vigorously litigated the case until they decided to make efforts to \nresolve their dispute.  To that end, beginning on June 30, 2014, the Court held five settlement \nconferences with the parties, culminating with a settlement in principle on November 6, 2014. \nThe parties then submitted a Stipulation and Order of Settlement (\"Stipulation\") to the Court for \n1  Although known to Defendants, Plaintiffs are named in this case using only their initials \nin order to preserve the privacy guaranteed the plaintiff children by the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., as well as by the Family  . \nEducational Rights Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g) and 34 C.F.R. § 99.

As part of their settlement, the parties agreed to resolve Plaintiffs' claims for damages, \nsubject to the Court's approval of Plaintiffs' infant compromise applications.  Id., at 16. \nPlaintiffs have now submitted 11 applications to the Court pursuant to Local Rule 83.2 \nfor an order approving the settlement of each of the Infants' damages claims in this action.

Forthereasonssetforthbelow,lfind \nthat the proposed settlements are fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Infants, and \ntherefore grant the motions and approve the settlements. \nA. Standards Applicable to an Infant Compromise \nIn determining whether an infant compromise should be approved, \"the Court's role is to \n'exercise the most jealous care that no injustice be done' to the infant.\" Southerland v. City of \nNew York, No. CV-99-3329 (CPS), 2006 WL 2224432, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2006) (quoting \nAnderson v. Sam Airlines, No. 94-CV-1935, 1997 WL 1179955 (E.D.N. Y. Apr. 25, 1997)).  In \nthis District, Local Rule 83.2(a)(l) requires that \n[a] n action by or on behalf of an infant or incompetent shall not be \nsettled or compromised ... without leave of the Court embodied in \nan order, judgment or decree. The proceeding upon an application \nto settle or compromise such an action shall conform, as nearly as \nmay be, to the New York State statutes and rules, but the Court, for \ncause shown, may dispense with any New York State requirement. \nAs Magistrate Judge Pitman recently observed in a comprehensive discussion of the \napplicable standards in this context, \" [c  ]onsistent with the applicable New York State statutes \nand rules, the analysis in this jurisdiction centers on 'whether: (1) the best interests of the infant \nare protected by the terms and conditions of the proposed settlement; and (2) the proposed \nThe parties have consented to my exercising plenary jurisdiction over the matter pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).

McKnight, No. 12-CV-4745 (HBP), 2013 WL 4400537, at *3 (Aug. \n15, 2013) (quoting Martegani v. Cirrus Design Corp., 687 F. Supp. 2d 373, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) \n(citing Local Civ. R. 83.2(a); N.Y. Jud. L. § 474; N.Y. C.P.L.R. §§ 1205-08); see also Edionwe \nv. Hussain, 7 A.D.3d 751, 753, 777 N.Y.S.2d 520, 522 (2d Dep't 2004) (required analysis is \nwhether settlement is \"fair and reasonable and in the infant plaintiffs best interests\"). \"There is \nno bright-line test for concluding that a particular settlement is fair.\"  Sch. for Language & \nCommc 'n Dev. v. New York State Dep 't ofE  duc., No. 02-CV-0269 (JS) (JO), 2010 WL 1740416, \nat *2 (E.D.N .Y. Apr. 7, 2010) (Report & Recommendation), adopted at 2010 WL 1752183 \n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2010) (citing Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689, 692-93 (2d Cir. 1972)). \nMoreover, the Second Circuit has noted that \"Rule 83.2 is hardly a rigid obligation imposed on \ndistrict courts.\" Neilson v.  Colgate-Palmolive Co., 199 F.3d 642, 655 (2d Cir. 1999).  Put \nanother way, \"[d ]istrict courts have broad discretion when conducting an infant compromise \nhearing.\" Wagner & Wagner, LLP v. Atkinson, Haskins, Nellis, Brittingham, Gladd & Carwile, \nP.C., 596 F.3d 84, 89 (2d Cir. 2010). \nDespite this broad discretion, a court cannot approve a proposed infant compromise \nunless it is \"fair, reasonable, and adequate,\" based on a comparison of \"the terms of the \ncompromise with the likely rewards of litigation.\"  Neilson, 199 F.3d at 654 (quoting Maywalt v. \nParker & Parsley Petroleum Co., 67 F.3d 1072, 1079 (2d Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  In making this determination, the court should \"'form an educated estimate of the \ncomplexity, expense, and likely duration of such litigation ... and all other factors relevant to a \nfull and fair assessment of the wisdom of the proposed compromise.\"' Martegani, 687 F. Supp. \n2d at 377 (alteration in original) (quoting Newman, 464 F.2d at 692).  These other factors \n3 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 113   Filed 01/14/15   Page 4 of 8\ninclude: the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; the risks of \nestablishing liability; the risks of establishing damages; the ability of the defendants to withstand \na greater judgment; the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best \npossible recovery; and the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery \nin light of all the attendant risks oflitigation. Allstate Ins. Co. v.  Williams, No. 04-CV-4575 \n(CLP), 2006 WL 2711538, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2006) (quoting City ofD  etroit v.

May 17, 2010) (quoting Ross v. A.H Robins Co., 700 F. Supp. 682, 683 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1988).  Additionally, it is a well-settled proposition that a settlement negotiated by the \nnatural guardian of an infant is presumptively fair and in the best interests of the child.  See, e.g., \nSch. for Language & Commc 'n Dev., 2010 WL 1740416, at *3  (citing Sabater v. Lead Indus. \nAss'n, Inc., No. OO-CV-8026 (LMM), 2001WL1111505, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y.

The Settlements Here Are Fair and Reasonable and in the Best Interests of the Infants \nApplying these standards, I conclude that the infant compromises proposed by Plaintiffs \nare fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Infants. \n4 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 113   Filed 01/14/15   Page 5 of 8\nFirst, there is no evidence of collusion in this case.  Rather, having presided over five \nsettlement conferences with the parties and having reviewed the Plaintiffs' submissions, which \ninclude declarations of all of the parent Plaintiffs and their attorneys in support of their motions, \nI am confident that the parties agreed to this compromise only after dealing extensively and \nexclusively at arm's length with each other. \nSecond, Plaintiffs' counsel are experienced in cases such as this one and have acted in \ntheir clients' best interests in negotiating this settlement. \nThird, I am satisfied that sufficient litigation has occurred to allow for an educated \nanalysis of the issues involved and the proposed compromises.  The parties were engaged in \ndiscovery at the time settlement discussions began.  In addition, Defendants had moved to \ndismiss the amended complaint on the ground that Plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their available \nadministrative remedies pursuant to the IDEA, as required before bringing a claim in federal \ncourt.  On June 30, 2014, I presided over the initial settlement conference during which the \nparent Plaintiffs attended, and at which their damage claims were fully discussed.3  I am satisfied \non the basis of that conference that the parties had a sufficient understanding of the facts to \nenable an intelligent evaluation of the risks and benefits of further litigation. \nFinally, there is nothing in the record to rebut the presumption that the settlements that \nthe parent Plaintiffs have agreed to are fair and in the best interests of the Infants. \nUnder the proposed settlements, each of the Infants and their parents will receive the \nfollowing: \n•  The damages settlement for T.H. and J.H. totals $111,908.20.  Of this total, \n$100,000 is compensation for J.H.'s emotional damages related to the removals of \nGiven that the parent Plaintiffs and their attorneys appeared in court and participated \nfully in the settlement conference, the Court will dispense with a hearing at this time, which \nwould otherwise be required under New York State law, pursuant to Local Rule 83.2(a)(l) \n(\"[T]he Court, for cause shown, may dispense with any New York State requirement.\"). \n5 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 113   Filed 01/14/15   Page 6 of 8\nJ.H. from his school, $10,000 is compensation for T.H.'s emotional damages \nrelated to these removals, and $1,908.20 is compensation for T.H.'s out of pocket \ncosts and lost wages related to the removals.

As \na threshold matter, upon the parties' reaching an impasse during the course of settlement \ndiscussions, the Court proposed a formula to calculate damages, to which the parties agreed. \nThese settlements are thus informed, at least in significant part, by the Court's own sense of their \nvalue.  Moreover, given the pendency of Defendants' motion to dismiss, and the fact that the \noutcome of litigation can never be predicted with certainty, the results here are reasonable under \n7 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 113   Filed 01/14/15   Page 8 of 8\nthe circumstances.  I note further that if this case had proceeded to trial, there would have been \nthe potential for trauma (or, at a minimum extreme discomfort) on the Infants in recounting their \nremovals from school.  All other things being equal, it is in the Infants' interests to avoid a trial \ngiven the reasonableness of these settlements.4 \nC.  Conclusion \nBased on all of the circumstances of this case, I conclude that the proposed settlements to \nresolve Plaintiffs' damages claims are fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Infants. \nPlaintiffs' motions are therefore granted and the settlements of the Infants' claims are approved. \nThe Clerk is hereby directed to close the motions at Docket Nos. 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, \n97, 100, 103, 106, and 110. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: New York, New York \nJanuary 14, 2015 \n4  The Court notes that the Stipulation and Order of Settlement explicitly leaves open \nPlaintiffs' claims for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  Dkt. No. 71, at 16.  By the terms of \nthe Stipulation, Plaintiffs are to make a demand within 45 days of entry of the Stipulation and the \nparties are then to make good-faith efforts to reach an agreement as to the amount of fees and \ncosts.

(Entered: 04/01/2014)\n04/01/2014 28  ORDER: On March 31, 2014, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint\nunder Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under Rule 15(a)(1)(B), a\nplaintiff has twenty−one (21) days after the service of a motion under Rule 12(b) to\namend the complaint once as a matter of course. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED\nthat plaintiff shall file any amended complaint by April 21, 2014. Plaintiff will not be\ngiven any further opportunity to amend the complaint to address issues raised by the\nmotion to dismiss. If plaintiff does amend, by three (3) weeks after the amended\ncomplaint is filed, defendant shall: (1) file an answer; (2) file a new motion to dismiss;\nor (3) submit a letter to the Court, copying plaintiff, stating that it relies on the\npreviously filed motion to dismiss. If defendant files an answer or a new motion to\ndismiss, the Court will deny the previously filed motion to dismiss as moot. Pursuant\nto the Case Management Plan (Docket No. 14) and the Endorsed Letter of March 19,\n2014 (Docket No. 22), it is further ORDERED that, if no amended complaint is filed,\nplaintiff shall serve any opposition to the motion to dismiss by April 21, 2014.\nDefendant's reply, if any, shall be served by April 30, 2014. At the time any reply is\nserved, the moving party shall supply the Court with one courtesy hard copy of all\nmotion papers by mailing or delivering them to the United States Courthouse, 40\nCentre Street, New York, New York. Finally, the parties are reminded that discovery is\nnot stayed pending a ruling on the motion. (Signed by Judge Jesse M. Furman on\n4/1/2014) (mro) (Entered: 04/02/2014)\n04/01/2014 Set/Reset Deadlines: Amended Pleadings due by 4/21/2014. (mro) (Entered:\n04/02/2014)\n04/02/2014 29  ORDER denying 23 and 27 Letter Motions for Local Rule 37.2 Conference. There is\nno need for a conference to address the parties' disputes as Plaintiffs' objections to the\nproposed releases are overruled. Defendants are entitled to the medical and mental\nhealth records they seek as Plaintiffs have put the medical and mental health of the\nstudent Plaintiffs directly into issue. The fact that Plaintiffs seek only \"garden variety\"\ndamages is of no moment, as Defendants are entitled to the records to contest liability.\nAnd any privacy interests are adequately addressed by the protective order that is in\nplace. (Docket No. 17). With respect to Plaintiffs' remaining objections − to the\nreleases for certain Plaintiffs' private school and private evaluation records and ACS\nrecords − Plaintiffs have not invoked any privilege, but appear to challenge only the\nrelevance of such records. Given the broad definition of relevance for purposes of\ndiscovery, those objections are without merit. Again, any privacy concerns are\nadequately addressed by the protective order. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs'\nobjections are overruled, and they are ordered to provide the releases at issue within\none week of this Order. (HEREBY ORDERED by Judge Jesse M.

Plaintiffs are children in New York City public schools whose educations \nhave been forcefully interrupted because their schools have summoned Emergency \nMedical Services (“EMS”) to have them removed by ambulances even though they were \nnot in need of emergency medical care.  In some instances, EMS personnel insisted on \ntransporting them to hospitals against the express wishes of their families. As a result, \nplaintiff students have not only been detained by school and EMS personnel against \ntheir wills, they have also been traumatized by unnecessary trips to emergency rooms \nand deprived of valuable instructional time.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 2 of 75\n \n2.  Plaintiffs are also the parents of these students.  School and EMS \nprocedures fail to allow parent plaintiffs to determine the nonemergency medical care \nfor their children.  In addition, school and EMS policies and practices cause these \nchildren to be detained and then removed against the wishes of parents and guardians.   \nFinally, school and EMS practices cause plaintiff parents to incur fees for ambulance \nand emergency room services that the plaintiff children did not need and that the \nfamilies cannot afford. \n3.  The plaintiffs’ ordeals have been caused by the schools’ failure to utilize \nthe systems already set up—as required by law--for evaluating children with perceived \ndisabilities, including behavioral issues, in addition to the schools’ pattern and practice \nof instead using EMS to remove students from their schools and forcing them to undergo \nemergency medical evaluations in nonemergency situations.  Plaintiff students, and their \nfamilies, remain at risk so long as these patterns and practices persist. At the same time, \nthe emergency resources of New York City are misdirected at children who are not \nfacing any emergency.  \n4.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to find that defendants’ conduct has violated their \nrights under federal statutory and Constitutional law, the New York State Constitution, \nand the New York City Human Rights Law; to enjoin defendants from continuing to \nviolate plaintiffs’ rights; and to award plaintiffs’ damages for the violation of their \nrights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n5.

Plaintiffs demand trial by jury in this action on each and every one of \ntheir claims. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \nThe United States Constitution  \n37.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution is made \napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment and provides that persons shall \nnot be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.  \n38.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects \nindividuals from deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process. \n39.  One of the liberties protected by the due process clause is the \nfundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control \nof their children, including the right to authorize and direct the medical care given to \ntheir children. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 8 of 75\n \n40.  The due process clause also protects the fundamental liberty interest of \nboth parents and children not be forcibly separated from each other, even temporarily, \nwithout due process. \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act \n41.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. \n§1400 et seq., governs how states and localities provide early intervention, special \neducation, and related services to children with disabilities.  \n42.  IDEA defines a child with a disability as “a child (i) with intellectual \ndisabilities, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, \nvisual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance (referred to in \nthis chapter as “emotional disturbance”), orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic \nbrain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and (ii) who, by \nreason thereof, needs special education and related services.” 20 U.S.C. §1401(3)(A). \n43.  Under IDEA, states must make available “a free appropriate public \neducation . . . to all children with disabilities residing in the State between the ages of 3 \nand 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or \nexpelled from school.”   20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(1)(A). \n44.  IDEA defines “free and appropriate education” as: “special education and \nrelated services that  (A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision \nand direction, and without charge; (B) meet the standards of the State educational \nagency; (C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school \neducation in the State involved; and (D) are provided in conformity with the \nindividualized education program required under section 1414(d) of this title.”  20 \nU.S.C.  §1401(9). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 9 of 75\n \n45.  The IDEA also mandates that “removal of children with disabilities from \nthe regular educational environment occur[] only when the nature or severity of the \ndisability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of \nsupplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C §1412(a) \n(5)(A). \n46.  Under the Child Find requirements of the IDEA, schools districts have an \naffirmative duty to locate, identify and evaluate students who may require special \neducation programs or services. 20 U.S.C §1412(a)(3). \n47.  Either a parent or guardian or a school can make a referral to have a child \nevaluated for special education supports and services in New York State. 20 U.S.C. \n§1414 (a)(1)(B); 34 C.F.R. §300.301(b); 8 N.Y.C.R.R. §200.4(a).  Schools must obtain a \nparent’s informed consent before performing an evaluation.  34 CFR § 300.300. \n48.  As part of an initial evaluation and subsequent reevaluations, each school \ndistrict is required to use “a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant \nfunctional, developmental, and academic information about the child” that may assist \nthe district in determining if the child is entitled to special education services and what \nthose services should be. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. §300.304 (b). \n49.  The school district is also required to assess the child in “all areas related \nto the suspected disability,” including, if appropriate, the emotional status of a child and \nhow behavioral factors impact the child. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (b)(3); 34 C.F.R. §300.304 \n(b)(4).  \n50.  Following an evaluation in all areas of suspected disability, a meeting \nmust be scheduled on written notice to the parent with a multidisciplinary team to \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 10 of 75\n \ndetermine if the student meets a classification under the IDEA and to develop an \nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) for the child. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (b)(4) and (5); \n34 C.F.R. §300.306.  \n51.  Parents are entitled to participate in an annual review of the IEP, to \ndiscuss and update the IEP and if appropriate to revise the programs, services and \nsupports. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (d)(4);  34 C.F.R. §300.324(b).  \n52.  Students have the right to be educated in the least restrictive environment \nwith appropriate supports and services. 20 U.S.C. §1412 (a)(5) and (5);  34 C.F.R. \n§300.114.  \n53.  For a child exhibiting behavioral issues that impact the student’s \neducational process, the school district must conduct appropriate assessments such as a \nfunctional behavior assessment (FBA) to determine the appropriate services to address \nthose behaviors. In addition, the school district should develop a behavioral intervention \nplan (BIP) on notice to and with the participation of the parent, to address the behavioral \nissues. 20 U.S.C. 1415 (k); 34 C.F.R. §300.530(f). \nThe Rehabilitation Act \n54.  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in programs receiving federal financial assistance.  29 U.S.C. §701 et seq.    \n55.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. §794, \nmandates that “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, \nas defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, \nbe excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . \n.”   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 11 of 75\n \n56.  The definition of “individual with a disability” for the purposes of \nSection 504 is cross-referenced to the definition found in the Americans with \nDisabilities Act: an individual with a disability is a person with a physical or mental \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; \nwith a record of such an impairment; or who is regarded as having such an impairment.  \n42 U.S.C. §12102(1). \n57.  The definition of “program or activity” for the purposes of Section 504 \nincludes all of the operations of both “a department, agency, special purpose district, or \nother instrumentality of a State or of a local government” and “a local educational \nagency (as defined in section 7801 of title 20), system of vocational education, or other \nschool system.” 29 U.S.C. §794(b). \n58.  Local educational agency is defined in 20 U.S.C. §7801 as “a public \nboard of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either \nadministrative control or direction of, or to perform a service function for, public \nelementary schools or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or \nother political subdivision of a State, or of or for a combination of school districts or \ncounties that is recognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public \nelementary schools or secondary schools.”  \n59.  34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a) requires that recipients of federal funds who \noperate elementary or secondary schools must “provide a free appropriate public \neducation to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction, \nregardless of the nature or severity of the person's handicap.” \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 12 of 75\n \n60.  Under 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(d), a recipient “may not exclude any qualified \nhandicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education . . . .” \n61.  Under 34 C.F.R. § 104.34(a), a recipient “shall provide for the education \nof each qualified handicapped person in its jurisdiction with persons who are not \nhandicapped to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person. \nA recipient shall place a handicapped person in the regular educational environment \noperated by the recipient unless it is demonstrated by the recipient that the education of \nthe person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services \ncannot be achieved satisfactorily.” \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act \n62.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. \n§12131 et seq., prohibits discrimination based upon disability by public entities.  \n63.  42 U.S.C. §12132 makes it unlawful for a qualified individual with a \ndisability, by reason of such disability, to be excluded from participation in or be denied \nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by any such entity. \n64.  Disability under the ADA is defined as a physical or mental impairment \nthat substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an \nimpairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.  42 U.S.C. §12102(1). \n65.  A public entity is defined by the ADA as, among other things, any State \nor local government or any department, agency, special purpose district, or other \ninstrumentality of a State or States or local government.  42 U.S.C. §12131(1). \n66.  The term \"qualified individual with a disability\" is defined as an \nindividual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 13 of 75\n \npolicies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation \nbarriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities \nprovided by a public entity.”  42 U.S.C. §12131(2). \n67.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(b)(3) bars public entities from utilizing methods of \nadministration that “have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability.” \n68.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(d) requires public entities to “administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities.” \n69.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(h) prohibits public entities from imposing safety \nrequirements based on “mere speculation, stereotypes or generalizations about \nindividuals with disabilities.” \nNew York State Constitution \n70.  Article I, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution guarantees the \nright of people to free of unreasonable searches and seizures.  \nNew York City Human Rights Law  \n71.  Pursuant to the New York City Human Rights Law, it is an unlawful \ndiscriminatory practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, \nsuperintendent, agent or employee of any place or provider of public accommodation \nbecause of the actual or perceived . . .  disability to refuse, withhold from or deny to \nsuch person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof . . . \n.”  Administrative Code of the City of New York §8-107(4)(a). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 14 of 75\n \n72.  The term “‘place or provider of public accommodation’ . . . include[s] \nproviders, whether licensed or unlicensed, of goods, services, facilities, \naccommodations, advantages or privileges of any kind, and places, whether licensed or \nunlicensed, where goods, services, facilities, accommodations, advantages or privileges \nof any kind are extended, offered, sold or otherwise made available.”  Administrative \nCode of the City of New York §8-102(9). \n73.  A private cause of action for violations of the New York City Human \nRights Law is created by Administrative Code of the City of New York §8-502. \n74.  Administrative Code of the City of New York §8-130 states that the \nHuman Rights Law should be construed “liberally for the accomplishment of the \nuniquely broad and remedial purposes thereof, regardless of whether federal or New \nYork State civil and human rights laws, including those laws with provisions \ncomparably-worded to provisions of this title have been so construed.”  \nNYCDOE Chancellor’s Regulations \n75.  Defendant  Fariña  and her predecessors have issued “Chancellor’s \nRegulations” to provide guidance to NYCDOE personnel regarding NYCDOE policies. \n76.  Each school must maintain a “school safety plan” detailing the school’s \npolicy regarding possible emergency situations.  Chancellor’s Regulation A-414. \n77.  Chancellor’s Regulation A-412, Security and the Schools, requires and \nauthorizes NYCDOE personnel to call 911 when a student requires immediate medical \nattention.  The principal must be contacted immediately after the 911 call and must \nproceed to the scene with a trained medical professional.  The student’s parent must also \nbe notified immediately.  If the parent is not present when the ambulance arrives, a \nschool employee must accompany the student to the emergency room.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 15 of 75\n \n78.  Chancellor’s Regulation A-701, School Health Services, also requires \nand authorizes NYCDOE personnel to call 911 when a student requires immediate \nmedical attention, mandates that the student’s parent be called, and mandates that a \nschool employee accompany the student to the emergency room if the parent is not \npresent when the ambulance arrives. \n79.  Chancellor’s Regulation A-443, Student Discipline Process, requires \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard before any student can be barred from attending \ntheir school.   \nFDNY Regulations \n80.  The FDNY has issued regulations to provide guidance to its EMS \npersonnel regarding interactions with minors.  \n81.  Section 106-05 of the FDNY EMS Operating Guide Procedures, dated \nMarch 15, 1999, describes the protocol for the “Treatment & Transport of a Minor from \nthe Scene of an Assignment.” \n82.  Section 106-05 authorizes transportation of minors by EMS over a \nparent’s objection only when the minor has a life-threatening condition or injury and it is \napparent that even a minor delay will jeopardize the life or health of the minor.  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nBackground \n83.  The problem of abuse of emergency medical services by public schools is \nwell-known to the city, NYCDOE, and the commissioner defendants. For almost a \ndecade, advocates and medical practitioners have raised concerns about the improper use \nof emergency medical services to forcibly remove children from public schools. See, \ne.g., New York Times SchoolBook, Sept. 23, 2013 (quoting an emergency room \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 16 of 75\n \nphysician stating “[i]t feels like we are being used as a dumping ground by the \nschools”); Hospitals Say City Schools Use them as a Cure-All, New York Times, May \n18, 2004 (quoting an emergency room physician as stating “[ s]o many of the school \nreferrals are ‘dumps’  of misbehaving children”); The New Craze Schools Using ERs as \nDumping Ground Educators Shuttling Surly Students to City’s White Coats, Daily \nNews, May 17, 2004 (quoting the head of one hospital’s Comprehensive Emergency \nServices as stating “Schools are overcrowded, teachers overworked, so they send us kids \nthey just don’t want to deal with –or don’t know how to deal with them. But the kids \naren’t having a mental crisis,” and quoting a Director of Pediatric Psychiatry as saying \n“A trip to the emergency room, even if it is done well, is the worst introduction to \nmental health services you can give a child.”).   \n84.  In response to the growing number of students being sent to hospital \nemergency rooms in seemingly non-urgent situations, the New York City Council \nEducation and Mental Health Committees conducted a public hearing to investigate this \nissue on May 1, 2012. \n85.  The New York City Public Advocate’s Office, under Mayor-Elect de \nBlasio, also raised concerns over the number of students removed from schools to \nhospital emergency rooms for behavioral issues. See, e.g., Public Advocate Seeks Data \non Children Sent to ER, Wall Street Journal, (April 9, 2013) (stating that “schools are \ncalling 911 to deal with behavioral outbursts and thousands of schoolchildren are being \nsent to hospitals at their parents’ expense”). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 17 of 75\n \n86.  Data maintained by the defendants further demonstrates that the practice \nof removing children from the public schools by ambulance because of difficult or \ndisruptive behaviors is both longstanding and widespread. \n87.    According to Fire Department data obtained by plaintiffs’ counsel \nthrough the Freedom of Information Law, the FDNY responded to approximately \n18,000 emergency calls for an emotionally disturbed person from New York City school \nlocations from 2005 through 2010 for an average of almost 3,000 calls per calendar year. \nThe 18,000 calls originated from over 1,000 schools from across all five boroughs.  \n88.  The FDNY data is consistent with NYCDOE data, also obtained by \nplaintiff’s counsel through the Freedom of Information Law, which shows that in each \nschool year from 2009-2010 through 2011-2012, over 3,000 calls were made to EMS \ndue to alleged disruptive behaviors.  Over those three school years, the number of calls \nto EMS by NYC public schools to respond to students with alleged disruptive behaviors \nincreased each year.  By 2011-2012, over 3,600 calls were made to EMS by NYC public \nschools to respond to alleged disruptive behaviors by students. These data also show that \nthe calls are made from hundreds of schools each year in all five boroughs. \n89.  Upon information and belief, the majority of students removed from New \nYork City public schools by EMS are students with disabilities or students perceived as \nhaving a disability.  \nJ.H. \n90.  Plaintiff J.H. is now six years old.  He began attending kindergarten at \nGrant Avenue Elementary School in the Bronx in September 2012, when he was five. \nHe is now in the first grade.  He lives with his mother, T.H., and his eight year old \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 18 of 75\n \nbrother and his thirteen year old sister in the Bronx.  J.H. has or is perceived by \nNYCDOE to have a disability.  \n91.  On October 26, 2012, the school called Ms. H. and told her that an \nambulance had been called for her son and that she should come to the school \nimmediately.  When Ms. H. asked what was going on, she was told it would be \nexplained when she got to the school.  \n92.  When Ms. H. arrived at the school, she was told that J.H. had already \nbeen taken to Lincoln Hospital.  When she asked why her son had been taken to the \nhospital, a staff member told her that he had been acting up and that there had been no \nother way to control him, but did not further explain what had happened. While she was \nat the school, she was given a form for the hospital to sign before J.H. could return to \nschool.  \n93.  Ms. H. then removed her older son, T.H., from his class at Grant Avenue \nElementary because she was concerned she would not return in time for his dismissal at \nthe end of the school day. Ms. H. and T.H. rushed to the emergency room at Lincoln \nHospital, where she found J.H. sitting calmly with a teacher’s aide. The aide could not \nor would not say what had happened at the school.  When Ms. H. asked J.H. what \nhappened, he told her, “They were bothering me.”  According to hospital records, J.H. \ntold hospital staff that he got into a fight with a security guard at the school when he \nwanted to go back to music class when he was not supposed to.  Those records also say \nthat throughout his interview with hospital staff J.H. was “well-behaved and easily \nredirected by prompts from his mother.”  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 19 of 75\n \n94.  When Ms. H. tried to leave the emergency room with J.H., a nurse told \nher that she could not leave until three different staff members had met with J.H.   \n95.  Ms. H. spent several hours in the emergency room with J.H. while he was \nseen by the three staff members who the hospital wanted to see him. Ms. H. desperately \nwanted to leave the hospital so she could pick up her daughter from school. She had no \nway to contact her daughter, who she knew did not have a key and would not be able to \nget into their apartment. She was concerned for her daughter’s safety because they live \nin an unsafe neighborhood. The hospital would not let her leave until she received the \ndischarge papers. When she tried to leave, hospital staff called the police and the police \nphysically blocked her from leaving the hospital. It took about an hour from the time she \ntried to leave until she got the discharge papers and was finally permitted to leave.   \n96.  By the time Ms. H., T.H. and J.H. left the hospital it was too late to pick \nup J.H.’s sister from school. She was waiting in their building, locked out of the \napartment.  \n97.  On the next school day, Ms. H. brought J.H. to school and gave the \nschool the form from the hospital.  She was given no written incident report for the \nOctober 26 incident and was told nothing more than that the school’s staff had been \nunable to calm him down and that he had been jumping, running around, and hitting \npeople.    \n98.  On November 13, 2012, the school again phoned Ms. H. and told her an \nambulance had been called for her son.  Ms. H. rushed to the school. This time, she \narrived at the school prior to J.H.’s being removed by EMS.  She found him between a \nwindow gate and a closed window in a stairwell surrounded by close to ten adults \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 20 of 75\n \nincluding EMS personnel, police, and school employees.  She coaxed him into her arms, \nbut when she said she wanted to bring him home, she was told by school employees and \nby EMS staff that he had to be taken to the hospital. \n99.  Ms. H. again removed T.H. from class so he could accompany her and \nJ.H. to the hospital. Ms. H. was again concerned that she would not be able to return to \nGrant Avenue Elementary in time for dismissal for T.H.   \n100.  Ms. H. and T.H. accompanied J.H. to Lincoln Hospital in the ambulance \nand this time the hospital signed the paperwork to permit J.H. to return to school and \nreleased him in less than an hour. Then they went home. According to hospital records, \nJ.H. was referred to the hospital for evaluation for “not listening” and because he \n“refused to sit on a rug.”   \n101.  Again, by the time they were permitted to leave the hospital, J.H.’s sister \nwas home from school, locked out of the apartment, and Ms. H. was unable to contact \nher. Because of these repeated incidents and in fear for her daughter’s safety, she bought \nher daughter a cell phone so that they could contact each other if Ms. H. had to go to the \nhospital with J.H. again. \n102.  On the next school day, Ms. H. brought J.H. to school and gave the \nschool the form from the hospital.  She was given no written incident report regarding \nwhat had happened on November 13 and was told only that he had been running, \njumping around, and hitting people. \n103.  After the November 13 incident, Ms. H. asked for and received \npermission to observe her son at school without his knowledge.  She did so on several \noccasions and never saw him engage in aggressive or out-of-control behavior. Ms. H. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 21 of 75\n \nwanted to try moving J.H. to another teacher to see if that would help with the behavior \nproblems, but the school would not permit J.H. to move, even though several other \nchildren had already been moved out of his classroom.   \n104.  On December 12, 2012, the school again called Ms. H. to tell her they \nhad called EMS to take J.H. to the hospital.  Ms. H. rushed to the school.  When she got \nthere, she was told that J.H. had already been taken to Lincoln Hospital by ambulance. \n105.  Ms. H. rushed to Lincoln Hospital, but when she arrived there, she was \ntold that her son was not there.  She frantically called the school, worried that the \nambulance might have been in an accident, and she was told that her son had actually \nbeen taken to St. Barnabas Hospital. It took her a long time to get to the correct hospital \nbecause she did not have money for a cab and had to take the bus to both hospitals. She \nhad to call a friend from Lincoln Hospital for directions because she did not know where \nSt. Barnabas Hospital was or which bus to take to get there.  \n106.  At St. Barnabas, she found J.H. in a psychiatric ward with six adults.  He \nhad been changed out of his clothes and into hospital-issued pajamas: a pajama shirt, \npajama pants, and slipper socks. A person from the school was there with him.  \n107.  According to hospital records, the aide told emergency room staff that \nJ.H. had been “out of control at school.  They didn’t know what to do.”  The same \nrecords state that J.H. was “playful” and “smiling” at the hospital. \n108.  After spending about an hour at the hospital, Ms. H. was permitted to \nbring J.H. home. Ms. H. was in a rush to leave the hospital because she was worried \nabout leaving in time to pick up T.H. from school.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 22 of 75\n \n109.  On the next school day, Ms. H. accompanied J.H. to school and gave the \nschool staff the necessary paperwork from the hospital.  Again, she was given no written \nincident report regarding what had happened on December 12. She was told only that \nJ.H. had not been listening, ran out of the classroom, and hit students and teachers. \n110.  On December 14, 2012, the school again called Ms. H and told her that \nthey had called an ambulance for J. H.  When she got to the school, she found J.H. \noutside, strapped down to a stretcher wearing only a t-shirt on the cold December day. \nAll of the staff members were wearing coats but J.H. was strapped to the stretcher crying \nwithout any coat or sweater. Ms. H. gave J.H. her coat. She became very upset at the \nschool staff and began crying herself. As she prepared to ride in the ambulance with J.H. \nto the hospital, she pulled T.H. out of school again because she was worried that she \nwould not be able to return in time to pick him up from school. T.H. was at lunch at that \ntime, so they brought his lunch with them and also brought J.H.’s lunch to the \nambulance. Ms. H., J.H., and T.H. all rode together in the ambulance to Lincoln \nHospital.  \n111.  According to hospital notes, J.H. was sent to the hospital because he had \nhit and kicked his teacher after she drew on his paper when he did not want her to.  He \ntold the hospital staff that his teacher does not like him and that she makes him angry a \nlot.  The notes also indicate that J.H. was “well-behaved and easily redirected by \nprompts from his mother.”  \n112.     After Ms. H., J.H., and T.H. spent an hour or two in the \nemergency room, she was given the signed clearance form she needed to give to the \nschool and was permitted to take J.H. home. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 23 of 75\n \n113.  On the next school day, Ms. H. brought J.H. to school and gave the \nschool the form from the hospital.  She was given no written incident report regarding \nwhat had happened on December 14 and was told nothing more than the school’s staff \nhad been unable to calm him down after he became upset over something his teacher \ndid. \n114.  School staff stopped calling EMS for J.H. after an attorney began \nadvocating on Ms. H. and J.H.’s behalf in late December 2012.The school instead \nrequired Ms. H. to pick J.H. up early almost every day for about a month. School staff \nthen required J.H. to attend school on a part-time schedule and J.H. only attended school \nuntil 11:00 a.m. for the rest of the 2012-2013 school year. School staff also prohibited \nhim from attending field trips unless accompanied by Ms. H.  \n115.  Ms. H. lost her job as a night guard at a homeless shelter. Ms. H. suffered \npoor work performance as a result of the nearly daily calls from school officials \nregarding J.H.’s behavior. Unable to get adequate sleep during the morning hours, she \nrepeatedly was too tired to stay awake at work. She then went on unemployment, went \ninto arrears with her rent and currently is facing eviction  She then got a job as a \ncustomer service representative in August 2013 but had to leave the job a month later \npartly due to multiple appointments she has to attend to regarding the eviction \nproceedings.  She has also received bills from the hospitals and from EMS, which she \nhas no way to pay.   \n116.  Ms. H. consented to have J.H. evaluated by the NYCDOE for special \neducation services in November 2012. The NYCDOE administered a psychological and \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 24 of 75\n \nan educational evaluation for J.H. but never conducted a psychiatric evaluation as part of \ntheir initial evaluation.  \n117.  Upon information and belief, while awaiting the completion of the \nspecial education evaluation process, school officials did not provide J.H. with any \nformal services or accommodations to address J.H.’s behaviors. \n118.  On January 18, 2013, an IEP meeting was held at the school and J.H. was \nfound to be eligible for special education services and J.H. was given a classification of \nemotional disturbance. For the 2013-2014 school year, J.H. is enrolled in a 12:1:1 \nspecial class program at Grant Avenue Elementary School.  \n119.  On or about November 1, 2013, school officials from Grant Avenue \nElementary School called Ms. H. and advised her that J.H. was acting out and Ms. H. \nneeded to go to the school right away. Ms. H. was also told that J.H. was in the guidance \ncounselor’s office. \n120.  Ms. H. proceeded to the school right after the phone call. Upon arriving \nat the school, Ms. H. proceeded to the guidance counselor’s office where she found her \nson J.H. being physically held by the school safety agent. Ms. H. asked the school safety \nagent to let J.H. go and she picked him up. Ms. H. spoke to the school safety agent who \nadvised her that J.H. would be sent to the emergency room. Ms. H. asked school staff \nwhy EMS was called if the school officials knew she was on her way to the school. The \nschool safety agent interjected and stated that it was her decision to call EMS.  \n121.  When EMS arrived, Ms. H. asked the EMT’s if they had to take J.H. and \nshe was told J.H. had to go to the hospital. Ms. H. then accompanied J.H. to Lincoln \nHospital along with T.H., whom she removed from school early again. Once at the \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 25 of 75\n \nhospital, the nurse gave Ms. H.  a document to sign to consent to the evaluation of J.H.. \nMs. H. declined to sign it because she did not believe J.H. needed an evaluation at that \ntime and left the hospital with her sons.  \n122.  J.H. received an in-school suspension as a result of this incident but \nreturned to school on the next school day. Ms. H. never received any documents related \nto the incident on November 1, 2013. \n123.  As a result of the school’s practice of repeatedly having J.H. removed by \nEMS, J.H. is no longer eager to go to school, is afraid of and dislikes the police, and is \nafraid of going to the hospital.  \nW.P. \n124.  W.P. is five years old and resides in Manhattan with his parents, K.P. and \nG.P. and his newborn brother.  Since September 9, 2013, he has attended kindergarten at \nNEST+M School (“NEST”) in Manhattan. W.P. has or is perceived by NYDOE as \nhaving a disability.  \n125.  On Friday, September 20, 2013, K.P. received a telephone call from the \nassistant principal for the Lower School.  Without providing any details or explanation, \nthe assistant principal informed K.P. that the school was unable to control W.P.’s \nbehavior and that they had called 911 to transport W.P. to the emergency room.  K.P., \nwho works in midtown Manhattan and at the time was nine months pregnant, was told \nshe had 10-20 minutes to get to the school before EMS would take W.P. to the hospital.  \nK.P. pleaded with the school to wait for her arrival before having W.P. removed.  The \nschool insisted they would not wait.  \n126.  K.P. alerted her husband, G.P., to the situation, and G.P. was able to \nreach the school before W.P. had been taken to the hospital.  Upon G.P.’s arrival at \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 26 of 75\n \nNEST, he found W.P. sitting calmly and quietly in the main school office with his feet \nup on a chair.  Five police officers stood at the entrance to the office.  G.P. immediately \nasked the police officers to call off the request for EMS.   \n127.  G.P. met with the assistant principal and the principal in the principal’s \noffice to discuss the incident.  G.P. was informed that W.P. had been “running around \nand almost broke a table,” and was like a “mini Hulk.”  W.P.’s teacher and the school’s \nguidance counselor subsequently joined the conversation in the principal’s office.  The \nschool representatives explained to G.P. that W.P. had been pulled out of class and was \nunable to “calm down.”  The assistant principal informed G.P. that in such situations, \nwhen there is allegedly concern for the child’s safety or the safety of others, it is the \nschool’s policy to call EMS.  The assistant principal described the policy in front of the \nprincipal, who nodded in agreement.  G.P. has since had at least one additional \nconversation in which this policy was reiterated by other school representatives. At \ntimes, school officials also stated that it is their policy to call the security guard, who in \nturn has been trained to call EMS.  \n128.  Despite W.P.’s calm demeanor, G.P. decided to take W.P. home for the \nrest of the day.  G.P. was able to coax an explanation from W.P. for his behavior, which \nevidently resulted from a simple disagreement with another student on the playground \nwho had refused to return a ball.   \n129.  Two weeks later, in the midst of K.P.’s giving birth to W.P.’s brother by \ncaesarian section, G.P. received a message that the school had again called EMS to \nremove W.P. from school.  After the birth of their new son, G.P. called the school and \nspoke to a police officer who was present at the school.  At this point, G.P. was told that \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 27 of 75\n \nW.P. was sitting calmly in the office, and G.P. informed the police officer again that he \ndid not want W.P. to be removed by EMS.  G.P. informed both the police officer and the \nassistant principal that his mother-in-law would arrive shortly at the school, since he was \nat the hospital with his wife, who had just given birth.  \n130.  K.P.’s mother arrived at NEST within twenty minutes, but W.P. had \nnonetheless already been taken to the Beth Israel emergency room, apparently by police \nofficers.  K.P.’s mother rushed to the hospital and reached W.P. before he had been \nformally admitted.  When she found him, W.P. was sitting quietly with two police \nofficers and a paraprofessional from NEST who had accompanied him to the hospital.    \n131.  After the October 3 incident, K.P.’s mother volunteered to spend time at \nNEST with W.P. for a few days in the hope that the school would avoid repeating such \ndrastic measures.   \n132.  On October 16, 2013, NEST’s guidance counselor again called G.P. to \ninform him that the school had once again called EMS to remove W.P.  G.P. contacted \nK.P., who rushed to the school with her two-week-old son.  Upon her arrival, K.P. found \nW.P. calmly sitting at a table with the principal and three police officers in the office. \n133.  K.P. requested immediately that the police officers call off the request for \nEMS; however, the ambulance arrived at the school nonetheless.  K.P. insisted that her \ncalm child need not be transported to the hospital and signed a release form at EMS’ \nrequest.  At K.P.’s suggestion, the principal allowed W.P., who had been sitting calmly, \nto rejoin his class.  \n134.  Despite multiple meetings with NEST administrators since the beginning \nof the school year about how to address W.P.’s behavioral issues, the school initiated no \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 28 of 75\n \nformal evaluation process until K.P. and G.P. submitted a formal written request for an \nIEP process on October 14, 2013.  Only then did NEST appear to have a social worker \nassigned to work on pursuing an evaluation for W.P.  Over the course of the past two \nmonths, K.P. and G.P. have spent considerable resources on private evaluations of W.P., \nas well as training of school staff.   \n135.  NEST’s excessive and reflexively dramatic response to W.P.’s behavioral \nproblems has created a situation in which K.P. and G.P. live in fear that the next phone \ncall will be notification that their frightened five-year-old son has been taken to the \nhospital by EMS or the police because he had some difficulty in the classroom.  W.P. \nhimself has expressed his worries that the police might take him away again.   \nJ.R. \n136.  J.R. is a five year old first grade student currently attending Public School \n149 in Manhattan. He lives with his mother, K.J., and grandmother, L.J., in Manhattan.  \nJ.R. has or is perceived by NYCDOE to have a disability.  \n137.  K.J. initially enrolled J.R. in kindergarten at PS 149 in January 2013. \nPrior to attending PS 149, J.R. attended a charter school. \n138.  Soon after K.J. enrolled J.R. at PS 149, K.J. began to receive almost daily \ntelephone calls from school staff at PS 149 regarding J.R.’s behavior. Most often, staff \nfrom PS 149 stated that J.R. was unfocused, not on task and acting up because he did not \nwant to be in school. Often, school staff requested that K.J. pick up J.R. and bring him \nhome prior to dismissal.  \n139.  If school staff were unable to reach K.J. by phone, they would call K.J.’s \nmother, L.J.  On a number of occasions, K.J. and L.J. were told that if they did not come \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 29 of 75\n \nto pick up J.R. immediately, the school would call an ambulance to take J.R. to an \nemergency room. \n140.  On one occasion, sometime between January 2013 and April 2013, \nschool staff contacted K.J. advising her that an ambulance had been called for J.R. \nbecause he was acting out. K.J. could not leave work immediately and arranged for L.J. \nto go to the school in response to the phone call. L.J. arrived at the school before the \nambulance and convinced school staff to allow J.R. to go home with her. \n141.  On April 29, 2013, J.R. was involved in an incident at PS 149. He \nbecame upset after his teacher grabbed his hand during recess. He began to scream, \njump on desks and throw himself against lockers. \n142.  Staff at PS 149 called 911 and also contacted K.J. by telephone to advise \nher that they had called an ambulance for J.R.  K.J. was advised by school officials that \nJ.R. could not return to the school until he was evaluated at the hospital. Because K.J. \nwas at work, she could not go immediately to the school.  Instead, she contacted J.R.’s \nfather, H.R.   He and L.J. then both proceeded to the school.  \n143.   L.J. arrived at school before H.R. and noticed that police officers and \nemergency medical technicians were all around J.R., were touching him, and had him \nsitting on the floor. L.J. asked the officers and technicians to get their hands off him.  \nL.J. was then able to calm J.R. down. L.J. stated that she was going to take him home. \nSchool staff, the police officers and the emergency medical technicians all stated that \nJ.R. had to go to the hospital. They stated that once an ambulance has been called to a \nschool, the student has to go to the hospital.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 30 of 75\n \n144.  H.R. then arrived at the school and he accompanied J.R. to Mount Sinai \nHospital in the ambulance. L.J. had to return to work and did not accompany them to the \nhospital.  \n145.  J.R. was admitted to the emergency room at Mt. Sinai at 12:45 p.m. The \ntreating physician noted that officials at PS 149 had called EMS because they could not \ncontrol his behavior and felt he needed an evaluation.  \n146.  When J.R. met with the doctor, he was sitting calmly and said he was no \nlonger angry. He said that when he is very upset, he throws tantrums. He said he did not \nwant to hurt himself or anyone else. The doctors diagnosed J.R. with disruptive behavior \ndisorder and discharged him at 2:51 p.m. His discharge plan stated that he could return \nto normal daily activities and his parents were given referrals for him to outpatient \nmental health services.  \n147.  After this incident, K.J. wanted to find outpatient psychiatric services for \nJ.R., but medical insurance issues prevented her from arranging an initial intake \nappointment for two months. Eventually, K.J. secured an initial appointment with a \npsychiatrist. However K.J. was concerned that the doctor immediately wanted to \nprescribe medication for J.R. without considering other options and decided to seek \ntreatment elsewhere.  \n148.  As a result of the incident on April 29, 2013, PS 149 issued an out of \nschool suspension to J.R.  He was sent to PS 144 in Manhattan for his suspension.  \n149.   On May 9, 2013, school staff from PS 144 contacted K.J. and advised \nher that J.R. was having an outburst. K.J. advised them that L.J. was going to the school \nto pick up J.R. Soon thereafter school officials then called back and stated that J.R. was \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 31 of 75\n \nbeing transported to the hospital.  K.J. asked if they could delay sending J.R. to the \nhospital until she arrived there because she was unable to leave work immediately and \nthe school official said no. L.J. arrived at PS 144 just as the emergency medical \ntechnicians were escorting J.R. out of the building. L.J. did not attempt to request that \nJ.R. be allowed to go home with her because she felt the EMT’s and the police would \nnot allow her. \n150.   J.R. was admitted to the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital \nat 1:35 p.m.  According to hospital records, he was calm, appeared well and was in no \ndistress. The records state that J.R. got in trouble at school for running in the hall with \nanother boy and was forced to sit at the “bad” table in the cafeteria. J.R. then got in \ntrouble for standing up when he was not supposed to and was sent to the principal’s \noffice where he became angrier and acted out by hitting staff, yelling kicking, and trying \nto run away.  The records also state that J.R. told an emergency medical technician that \nhe wanted to stab her.  According to his grandmother, J.R. said this in response to the \nEMT stating that J.R. was a “bad kid.” \n151.    J.R. was discharged at 3:41p.m., a little over two hours after he was \nadmitted. The discharge documents noted that he was diagnosed with disruptive \nbehavior disorder, not otherwise specified, and was cleared to return to normal activities. \n152.  On May 15, 2013, after J.R. had completed his suspension at PS 144 and \nhad returned to PS 149, K.J. was advised by staff at PS 149 that J.R. had been involved \nin another incident. She was told that J.R. had climbed on a cabinet during an outburst. \nThe school informed her that J.R. would be sent to the hospital. K.J. contacted her \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 32 of 75\n \nbrother S.J. and he was able to go to PS 149 right away.  K.J. asked school officials to \nrelease J.R. to S.J., but school officials denied K.J.’s request.  \n153.   K.J. left work early in order to respond to the situation at PS 149. When \nshe arrived at PS 149, K.J. observed EMS technicians and police officers with her son in \naddition to school staff. The EMS technicians, the police officers and school staff all \ntold K.J. that J.R. had no other option than to go to the hospital. K.J. did not attempt to \nask if she could take her son home because the police, school staff, and EMT’s all made \nit clear on this occasion and on prior occasions that he had to be transported to the \nhospital.  \n154.  EMS again transported J.R. to the emergency department at Mount Sinai \nwhere he arrived at 4:20 p.m.  The treating physician noted that J.R. was calm and \ncooperative during his interview. J.R. denied being depressed, suicidal or homicidal. J.R. \nwas unable to explain why he was aggressive at school but “nodded” in agreement that \nhe did not want to be aggressive again. \n155.  The treating physician at Mount Sinai administered a violence risk \nassessment to J.R. and determined there was a low risk of violence. K.J. was advised to \nfollow up with outpatient child psychiatry for J.R.’s disruptive behavior disorder. J.R. \nwas discharged at 7:51 p.m.  \n156.  In or about the middle of May 2013, PS 149 finally initiated an \nevaluation of J.R. to determine his eligibility for special education services. On June 21, \n2013, an IEP team met and determined that J.R. was eligible for special education \nservices.   J.R. was assigned a classification of emotional disturbance.  He has been \nassigned to a special class with a small student to staff ratio, but the school has \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 33 of 75\n \ncontinued to respond inappropriately to J.R.’s behavioral problems. As recently as \nNovember 18, 2013, K.J. was again told that if she did not pick up J.R. as soon as \npossible, PS 149 would call for an ambulance to transport J.R. to an emergency room, \n157.   K.J. often receives phone calls from PS 149 at work regarding J.R.’s \nbehavior issues. The calls have caused K.J. to experience significant stress, anxiety and \ndepression which affected her work performance. K.J. was suspended by her employer \nin May 2013 for poor work performance and has had to change her work schedule \nrepeatedly to be able to respond to the constant calls from PS 149.  \nJ.M. \n158.  Plaintiff  J.M. is  fifteen  years  old  and  is  in  the  tenth  grade  at  Astor \nCollegiate Academy in the Bronx.  He lives with his mother, C.J., in the Bronx. He was \npreviously enrolled at Lehman High School (“Lehman”) from the beginning of ninth \ngrade through March 2013.   \n159.  J.M. was diagnosed with ADHD when he was five.  In July 2012, his \ndiagnosis was changed to Asperger’s Syndrome.  J.M. has or is perceived to have by \nNYCDOE a disability.  \n160.  When J.M. was in middle school at I.S. 206 in the Bronx, an IEP was \ndeveloped for him.  The IEP included a crisis management paraprofessional, testing \naccommodations,  group  counseling,  and  a  Behavior  Intervention  Plan.    The  BIP \nincluded a provision permitting J.M. to call his mother during the day if he was feeling \nanxious as a last resort. \n161.  In  June  2012,  Ms.  J.  met  with  Mr.  Pagan,  a  guidance  counselor,  at \nLehman  to  select  classes  and  to  fill  out  paperwork  regarding  J.M.’s  high  school \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 34 of 75\n \nadmission.  Mr. Pagan asked Ms. J. if J.M. had an IEP, and Ms. J. responded that he did.  \nMs. J. asked Mr. Pagan if he was going to note this and he said he would, but he did not \ndo so in Ms. J.’s presence.  \n162.  In  July  2012  at  freshman  orientation,  before  J.M.  began  attending \nLehman, Ms. J. met Thomasina Brown, who she later found out was J.M.’s guidance \ncounselor, and Mr. Carucci, the assistant principal for the Anne Hutchinson Academy at \nLehman.  Ms.  J. had concerns about  Lehman, so she took  this opportunity to  ask \nquestions of both of them.  Mr. Carucci explained the different academies at Lehman.  \nMs.  Brown  answered  questions  about  the  school’s  orientation  presentation.  J.M.’s \ndisability and the IEP were not discussed. \n163.  On J.M.’s first day at Lehman in September 2012, Ms. J. saw Ms. Brown \nagain.   She  approached Ms.  Brown and  asked to  meet  with  all of J.M.’s teachers \nregarding his IEP.  During the rest of September, Ms. J. tried to reach Ms. Brown many \ntimes, but the phones at the school were not working properly so she was unable to \nreach her or leave a message.  \n164.  On September 28, 2012, Ms. J. was at Lehman for a Parent Association \nExecutive Board meeting in her capacity as Vice President of the Parent Association.  \nWhile she was at the school, she went to say hello to Ms. Brown and on the way, she ran \ninto Ms. Brown and Mr. Tirado, one of the deans for the Ann Hutchinson Academy. \nThey told her that they were glad that she “caught them in the hallway” and asked her if \nanyone had called her about J.M.  They told her that  J.M. had used inappropriate \nlanguage with a girl in the lunchroom.  As a result, they pulled her into a conference \nroom to an unplanned meeting with Ms. J. and Ms. Brown; Mr. Tirado; Mr. Carruci; Ms. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 35 of 75\n \nCabrejos,  the  Director  of  Student  Services;  and  Ms.  Cember,  the  Director  of  the \ncommittee on Special Education.  \n165.   At the meeting it became clear to Ms. J. that despite its being three \nweeks into the school year and even though she had already spoken to Ms. Brown twice \nabout J.M., no one at the meeting was familiar with J.M.’s IEP.  Each administrator \nseemed to be looking at the IEP for the first time.  Ms. Brown admitted that she had not \npreviously read the IEP.   \n166.  As they began to flip through the IEP, Ms. Brown said that the school had \nnever provided group counseling, which is one of the support services provided in J.M.’s \nIEP. Ms. Cember suggested that the testing accommodation in J.M.’s IEP be removed \nand his disability classification be changed. Ms. Cember asked for Ms. J.’s permission to \nchange J.M.’s IEP, but Ms. J. told them she was not interested in changes to the IEP \nbefore it had even been followed by school staff.  Rather, she expected them to first \ncomply with the IEP.  \n167.  On November 9, 2012, Ms. J. found out from J.M. that he had attended \nhis first group counseling session of the school year.  Ms. J. never received any notice \nfrom the school that the group counseling sessions had finally begun. \n168.  On November 13, 2012, J.M. took a geometry test without the testing \naccommodations required by his  IEP.  He felt he might have done poorly. Out of \nfrustration, he ran a pen down his forearm.  He did not cut or scratch himself, but after \nthis incident Ms. J. received a call from Principal Rose Lobianco, who told her that she \nhad the opportunity to pick J.M. up from school as a “courtesy” and if she did not the \nschool would call EMS to have him taken to a hospital. Ms. J. left to pick up J.M. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 36 of 75\n \nimmediately. She received a total of five phone calls from Ms. Brown and Principal \nLobianco as she was on her way to the school. They told her that J.M. hurt his arm. Ms. \nJ. thought he needed to go to the doctor and called J.M.’s pediatrician to make an \nappointment while she was in the cab; she cancelled it later when she was told by the  \nprincipal that the school nurse said J.M.’s arm was fine. She repeatedly asked to talk to \nJ.M. and she was eventually permitted to speak to J.M., who was in the guidance \ncounselor’s office, where the nurse had checked his arm. When Ms. J. got to the school, \nhe was still in the guidance counselor’s office and Ms. J. took him home. Ms. Cabrejo \nwanted to speak with Ms. J. and Ms. J. declined to speak to her. Ms. J. took J.M. home \nand he stayed home from school the next day so he could go to the psychiatrist. J.M. \nexplained to the psychiatrist that the reason for the incident was that he was frustrated \nand thought he did not do well on his test. \n169.  After J.M. returned to school on November 15, Ms. Cabrejo and Dean \nTirado repeatedly asked Ms. J. to provide a doctor’s note saying that it was okay for \nJ.M. to return to school.  Ms. J. declined to provide such a letter because she understood \nthat the school had no right to require her to do so.   \n170.  After she declined to provide a letter to the school, the staff at Lehman \nretaliated by reporting to the City Administration for Children’s Services (“ACS”) that \nshe was being neglectful of J.M.  The ACS investigator, Mr. Massaquoi, initially told \nher that staff at Lehman had accused her of neglecting J.M. because of scratches on his \narm.  Later, Mr. Massaquoi told her the school was also accusing her of neglect because \nshe was unwilling to reopen his IEP.   ACS’s investigation found the report of neglect to \nbe unfounded and the case was closed.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 37 of 75\n \n171.  Throughout the month of December, Ms. J. was repeatedly contacted by \nMs. Cember, who continually asked Ms. J. to re-open J.M.’s IEP.  Ms. J. continued to \nrefuse,  stating  that  she  expected  the  school  to  comply  with  the  IEP  before  any \nconsideration was given to modifying it.     \n172.  Because Ms. J. and J.M. were unhappy with Lehman, in December Ms. J. \nbegan the process of seeking a medical transfer to another school for J.M.’s sophomore \nyear.    \n173.  On January 9, 2013, Ms. J. was at the school regarding paperwork for the \ntransfer.  She had a disagreement Ms. Cabrejos, who was insisting on copies of all of the \npaperwork Ms. J. had to submit to the NYCDOE’s Office of Student Enrollment before \nshe would sign off on the transfer application.  Before Ms. J. left the school, she told \nJ.M. that school was giving her a hard time about the transfer. \n174.  J.M. was upset about the difficulty his mother was having regarding the \ntransfer application and, at around approximately 12:00 p.m., his English teacher noticed \nhe was agitated in class. He asked to call his mother, but his teacher refused.  Instead, \nshe asked him to write down why he was feeling anxious.  He wrote down his feelings \nand as he was putting them away in his binder, his teacher demanded that he give her \nwhat he had written.  \n175.  J.M. had written, “Honestly I feel like something is bothering me and I \ndon’t know what, and it’s making me get hype in a crazy way, and it’s in a bad way.  I \nget something bothering me and it just gets me to the point I feel like I want to scream.  \nUnable to work because of what’s happening.” \n176.  After English class, J.M. was able to call his mother from the main office \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 38 of 75\n \nbefore going to lunch and he then felt better.  J.M. continued throughout the rest of his \nschool day without incident, but at the end of gym class, the last class of the day, Mr. \nCarruci and Ms. Brown came and escorted him to the principal’s office. \n177.  At 3:30, Ms. J. got a phone call from the principal, who told that the \nschool had called EMS and that J.M. was going to be taken to the emergency room.  She \nreceived no “courtesy call” this time.  She asked why J.M. was being taken to the \nhospital and the principal told her she would find out when she got to the school.  While \non the way to the school, Ms. J. called back to see if the ambulance left yet, and she \nasked to speak to an EMS worker. She spoke to the EMT and he said that the ambulance \nhad  not  left  the  school  yet.  She  asked  them  to  take  J.M.  to  Montefiore  because \nMontefiore accepts her insurance and the EMS worker agreed. He said he would explain \nwhat happened when she got there. Ms. J. was not permitted to talk to J.M.  \n178.  Ms. J. arrived at the school around 3:50.  She asked if she could bring \nJ.M. to the psychiatrist and she was told she could not.  In response to her question about \nwhy EMS had been called, the EMS worker showed her a written statement from J.M.’s \nEnglish teacher in which she reported his agitation in her class and in which she claimed \nthat, “Towards the end of the period, a girl started screaming in the hallway.  [J.M.] \nturned abruptly to face the door, pointed his fingers toward the door as if his hand was \n[sic] a gun and then shouted the sounds of a shooting gun.” J.M. completely denies this.  \nHe has no recollection of anything even similar to this teacher’s account.  After his \nEnglish class, J.M. was permitted to continue with the rest of his school day without any \nintervention from the school’s administrators or teachers.  They did not take him to the \noffice or call EMS until two periods after English, until it was almost time for dismissal.   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 39 of 75\n \n179.  EMS transported J.M. to Montefiore Hospital accompanied by Ms. J.  \nAccording to an EMS worker, J.M.’s “chief complaint” was “I am fine.”  The EMS \nworker noted that through the transport to the hospital, JM was observed to be “in \nposition of comfort  w/o change in  status  or further incident[].”  The “presumptive \ndiagnosis” noted by the EMS worker was “behavioral eval for threatening remarks.”  \n180.  In the emergency room J.M. was evaluated by a nurse, a medical doctor \nand a psychiatrist.  Each evaluation notes that J.M. was alert, cooperative and calm.  JM \nwas discharged eight minutes after meeting with the emergency room psychiatrist.  The \npsychiatrist noted that J.M. had no current suicidal or homicidal ideation, plan or intent, \nthat he was soft spoken, and that he was not dangerous.  The psychiatrist detailed that \nduring the interview the “patient was calm and cooperative and responsive [illegible].”   \n181.  J.M. received no treatment from the hospital. J.M. was released without \nmedication prescription and was simply advised to follow up with his own psychiatrist \nand was permitted to return to school the following day.   \n182.  Ms. J. has not received a bill from the emergency room, but her insurance \nwas billed. \n183.  In a mediation on March 21, 2013 about J.M’s IEP, it was agreed that \nJ.M. would transfer out of Lehman. On April 4, Ms. J. went to the Student Enrollment \nOffice and found out he was transferring to Astor Collegiate Academy.  He began \nattending Astor on April 8, 2013.  \n184.  As part of the mediation, it was agreed that the school would develop a \nnew IEP for J.M. for the 2013-2014 school year. \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 40 of 75\n \nN.R. \n \n185.  N.R. is a six-year-old student who attends P.S. 19 in Queens.  He \npreviously attended P.S. 165, which is also in Queens. He resides with his mother, Y.P., \nin Queens.  N.R. has or is perceived to have by NYCDOE a disability.  \n186.  N.R. first enrolled at P.S 165 as a pre-kindergarten student during the \n2011-2012 school year. In September 2012, N.R. entered kindergarten at the school.  \n187.  At the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year, Y.P asked P.S 165 to \nevaluate N.R. for possible special education supports and services. She had made similar \nrequests the year before, including a request for counseling in or about March of 2012 \nwhen N.R. attended pre-kindergarten at the school. \n188.  On October 4, 2012, Y.P. received a telephone call from the school \ninforming her that N.R. was misbehaving by climbing under the table, jumping and \nthrowing things and walking away.  The school told her that the police had been called \nand threatened to have N.R. taken to the hospital.  Y.P. asked school officials not to \nhave N.R. taken to the hospital and to wait for her to get to the school from work, but \nthey refused.   Y.P. managed to contact her mother and asked her to go to the school to \npick up N.R. \n189.   When Y.P’s mother arrived at the school, N.R. was surrounded by police \nofficers and school personnel and was sitting calmly.  Nonetheless, the principal would \nnot allow N.R.’s grandmother to take him home.  Y.P. got on the phone with the school \nand demanded that N.R. be turned over to her mother.  The school refused and handed \nthe telephone over to the police.  Only after Y.P. got on the phone with the police and \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 41 of 75\n \ncomplained strenuously, did they release N.R. to his grandmother.   However, they \nthreatened to arrest N.R. if he misbehaved in the future. \n190.  Following this incident with the school, N.R. became fearful when he \nsaw police, heard sirens, or saw police cars or ambulances.  He told his mother that he \ndid not want to go to school because people at his school told him that they were going \nto call the police and the ambulance workers to come to get him. \n191.  On or about October 10, the school contacted Y.P. and told her that her \nson was again misbehaving by running and jumping around, going under the table, and \nhitting others. She was told to pick up N.R., so she left work to go to the school.  When \nY.P got there, she was told by school staff, Ms. Bonagura and Ms. Legions that N.R. \ncould not return to school until he was psychiatrically evaluated and cleared by a doctor.   \nThey suggested that Y.P. take N.R. to Long Island Jewish Hospital (LIJH) for evaluation \nand told her that there must be something psychiatrically or neurologically wrong with \nN.R.    \n192.  Because Y.P. could not bring her son for an evaluation until October, 12, \n2012, and because the school would not permit him to return without medical clearance, \nhe could not attend school for two days, October 11 and 12. \n193.  On October 12, Y.P. took N.R. to Long Island Jewish Hospital (“LIJH”) \nin order to comply with the school’s directive that he be evaluated and receive clearance \nbefore returning to school after the purported incident on October 10.  Doctors and other \nhospital staff met with N.R., spoke to his mother and contacted the school. Y.P. \nexplained that the behavior reported by the school was not consistent with his behavior \nat home. Hospital staff noted that NR was “cheerful, cooperative though restless during \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 42 of 75\n \ninterview” and found that NR “does not present as an imminent risk of hurting self or \nothers.”  LIJH released N.R. and sent him home with his mother. They provided Y.P. \nwith a referral for outpatient counseling for N.R. which she followed up on.   \n194.  On October 22, the school again called Y.P. at work and told her that \nEMS was at the school to take N.R. to the hospital. \n195.  Y.P. begged the school not to send her son to the hospital via EMS and \nasked school staff to wait for her to come and pick up her son.  She was told by the \nprincipal and other members of staff that the school was in the business of teaching, not \ntaking care of children and that they would not wait. \n196.  Y.P. contacted her mother and asked her to go to the school to be with \nN.R. N.R.’s grandmother met him at the school and accompanied him to the hospital \nwith EMS. Although N.R. was calm when his grandmother arrived, the principal and \nassistant principal would not let her take N.R. home and insisted that EMS take him to \nthe hospital. EMS workers removed N.R. against the wishes of his mother and \ngrandmother. \n197.  Y.P. left work and went to LIJH to meet her mother and N.R. at the \nhospital as soon as she could. \n198.  At the hospital, N.R. was seen by numerous hospital personnel, including \ndoctors and social workers. Hospital staff spoke to N.R., who was “calm and \ncooperative,” and called the school to find out why he had been sent by them.  They \nevaluated his condition and cleared him for release to his mother. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 43 of 75\n \n199.  At no time prior to the events of October 2012 did the NYCDOE convene \nan IEP  meeting or develop a Behavior Intervention Plan for N.R. nor, upon information \nand belief, did NYCDOE even complete a written evaluation of N.R. \n200.  In February 2013, an IEP review meeting took place at Y.P’s request and \na recommendation was made for a 12:1:1 program in a community school for N.R.  The \nIEP also mandated a one-to-one paraprofessional, counseling, speech and occupational \ntherapy services.   Thereafter, Y. P. enrolled N.R. at P.S 19 and he began attending a \n12:1:1 program at the school. \n201.  P.S. 19 failed to provide N.R. with a one-on-one paraprofessional and all \nof his mandated supports and services, despite Y.P’s requests that the school do so. Staff \nat the school stated that they lacked resources and indicated that they would send her son \nto the ER if he misbehaved.   In addition, shortly after N.R. arrived at P.S. 19, school \nofficials informed Y.P. that she would have to pick her son up from school each day at \n11:00 a.m.  Fearing that the school would resort to inappropriate EMS intervention \nwhich would further traumatize her son, Y.P complied with this demand and collected \nher son early each day. \n202.  The shortened school day caused Y.P. great hardship, forcing her to \nadjust her schedule at work and to work later hours in order to keep her job. \n203.   Toward the end of the school year, Y.P met with school officials and \nagain asked that NR receive all of his mandated IEP supports and services and that the \nschool allow him to attend full-time as do all of the other children at the school. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 44 of 75\n \n204.  N.R. continues to be enrolled at P.S. 19.   N.R. and Y.P fear that at any \nmoment the defendants may resort to inappropriate use of EMS to address N.R.’s special \nneeds and cause N.R to again be unnecessarily and unlawfully removed to the hospital.  \nD.E. \n205.  D.E. is a seven-year-old boy who was enrolled as a kindergarten student \nat P.S. K255 in Brooklyn for the 2011-2012 school year. He had just turned five on \nSeptember 6, 2011. It was his first year at P.S. K255. \n206.  D.E. is a special education student with an IEP.  D.E. has been diagnosed \nwith an autism spectrum disorder (“ASD”).  A Behavior Intervention Plan (“BIP”) had \nbeen developed and established for DE in conjunction with his IEP. For the 2009-2010 \nand 2010-2011 school years, DE attended a special education pre-school at P.S. M226.  \nD.E. has or is perceived to have by NYCDOE a disability.  \n207.  Though D.E. progressed remarkably well in terms of academic \nachievement and functional performance at P.S. M226, he exhibited social and \nbehavioral deficits commonly associated with ASD. D.E. has significant difficulty with \ntransitions, and becomes frustrated easily. D.E.’s frustration often manifests in the form \nof tantrums, which are common among children with ASD.  This information was well \nknown to NYCDOE, and was clearly discussed in his IEP. At P.S. M226, whenever \nD.E. had a tantrum, school personnel responded appropriately and helped him to calm \ndown, such that he would remain in school with his classmates. \n208.  On June 7, 2011, following an IEP meeting, NYCDOE offered D.E. a \nplacement in a 12:1:1 kindergarten classroom at P.S. K255. D.E.’s mother, M.E., \ncomplied with this recommendation. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 45 of 75\n \n209.  On September 22, 2011, after D.E. had been in kindergarten for about \ntwo weeks, he had tantrum at school.  P.S. K255 personnel notified Ms. E., and asked \nher to come to the school. When Ms. E. arrived, she spoke with school personnel, sat in \nclass with D.E., and then took him home. \n210.  On September 27, 2011, D.E. had another tantrum at school. D.E. showed \nno signs of injury. Nevertheless, P.S. K255 personnel summoned EMS and police, and \nthen notified Ms. E. When Ms. E arrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and \npolice in the school vestibule. D.E. was no longer having a tantrum, but a security guard \nwas pinning him to the ground.  \n211.  Ms. E rushed to comfort her terrified son, and asked if she could take \nD.E. home, but EMS told Ms. E that D.E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney \nIsland Hospital psychiatric ward. EMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. E rode in the \nambulance with D.E. and EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n212.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E. were sent \nthrough the adult emergency room to triage. Afterward, they were told to wait for a \npediatrician for a physical examination. The pediatrician only assessed D.E. and did not \ntreat him or prescribe medication. \n213.  D.E. and Ms. E. were then told to wait for a psychiatrist for a psychiatric \nconsultation. The psychiatrist only assessed D.E. and did not treat him or prescribe \nmedication. \n214.  D.E. was then allowed to proceed to discharge on the basis that he did not \nrequire emergency services. The ordeal lasted approximately six hours, in which D.E. \nand Ms. E. were not allowed to leave and were neither provided food nor any \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 46 of 75\n \nopportunity to get food. During that time, D.E. was hungry, tired, anxious, confused, and \ndesperate to leave the hospital. \n215.  On October 6, 2011, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no signs \nof injury, but P.S. K255 personnel again summoned EMS and the police, and then \nnotified Ms. E. Ms. E called her sister, Natasha Grall, and Ms. E and Ms. Grall each \nhurried to the school. Ms. Grall arrived in fifteen minutes. When she arrived, she found \nD.E., school personnel, EMS, and police in the principal’s office. D.E. was no longer \nhaving a tantrum.  \n216.  Ms. Grall wanted to take D.E. home, but EMS stopped Ms. Grall and told \nher that D.E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney Island Hospital psychiatric \nward. Within ten minutes of Ms. Grall’s arrival, Ms. E. arrived at the school by taxi. \nEMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. E. rode in the ambulance with D.E., Ms. Grall, \nand EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n217.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E. found \nthemselves in the same situation they had endured on September 27. First, they were \nsent through the adult emergency room to triage. Afterward, they were told to wait for a \npediatrician for a physical examination. The pediatrician only assessed D.E. and did not \ntreat him or prescribe medication. D.E. and Ms. E. were then told to wait for a \npsychiatrist for a psychiatric consultation. The psychiatrist only assessed D.E. and did \nnot treat him or prescribe medication. D.E. was then allowed to proceed to discharge on \nthe basis that he did not require emergency services. The ordeal lasted between four and \nsix hours, in which D.E. and Ms. E. were not allowed to leave and were neither provided \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 47 of 75\n \nfood nor any opportunity to get food. During that time, D.E. was just as hungry, tired, \nanxious, confused, and desperate to leave the hospital as he had been on September 27. \n218.  On October 12, 2011, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no signs \nof injury. P.S. K255 personnel again summoned EMS and police, and then notified Ms. \nE. When Ms. E arrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and police in a \nclassroom. DE was sitting under a table and was no longer having a tantrum, but he was \ncrying and saying that he was scared of going to jail. Ms. E. asked if she could take D.E. \nhome, but EMS told Ms. E that D.E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney Island \nHospital psychiatric ward. EMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. E. rode in the \nambulance with D.E. and EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n219.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E found \nthemselves in the same situation they had endured twice before. After triage, a physical \nexamination by a pediatrician, and a psychiatric consultation by a psychiatrist, D.E. was \nallowed to proceed to discharge on the basis that he did not require emergency services. \nThe ordeal again lasted between four and six hours without breaks or food. During that \ntime, D.E. was just as hungry, tired, anxious, confused, and desperate to leave the \nhospital as he had been on prior occasions. \n220.  While at Coney Island Hospital on October 12, a nurse referred Ms. E. to \na pediatric psychology walk-in clinic at Kings County Hospital Center. Ms. E. visited \nthe walk-in clinic the next day, October 13, but clinic staff told her to return the \nfollowing day, October 14. Ms. E. did so, and the walk-in clinic referred her to the \nDevelopmental Evaluation Clinic (“DEC”). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 48 of 75\n \n221.  On October 14, 2011, Ms. E. met with a social worker at DEC for intake \nand to set up appointments for D.E. to be evaluated. The evaluations, including \npsychological and neurological evaluations, were scheduled to take place in late October \nand early November. Soon thereafter, Ms. E. notified P.S. K255 that D.E. was being \nindependently evaluated. Ms. E had made attempts to have D.E. independently \nevaluated since September 28, the day after the first EMS incident, but had been denied \nservices because of problems with her insurance. \n222.  On October 26, 2011, while the DEC’s independent evaluation of D.E. \nwas ongoing, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no signs of injury. P.S. K255 \npersonnel again summoned EMS and police, and then notified Ms. E. When Ms. E. \narrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and police in the school library. Ms. \nGrall arrived separately at approximately the same time. D.E. was no longer having a \ntantrum. On this occasion, EMS told Ms. E. that she could take D.E. home. Ms. E. took \nD.E. home as permitted by EMS. \n223.  That evening, the Administration for Children’s Services contacted Ms. \nE. and told her that P.S. K255 personnel had filed an abuse and neglect report against \nher, alleging that Ms. E. had refused medical care for her son by refusing to allow EMS \nto take D.E. to Coney Island Hospital. ACS investigated the report but found it to be \nbaseless, amended the report to show it was unfounded, and legally sealed the report. \n224.  On November 9, 2011, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no \nsigns of injury. P.S. K255 personnel again summoned EMS and police, then notified Ms. \nE. When Ms. E arrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and police on the third \nfloor of the school. DE was no longer having a tantrum, but he was crying and saying \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 49 of 75\n \nthat he was scared of being in trouble. Ms. E. asked if she could take D.E. home, but \nEMS told Ms. E. that D.E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney Island Hospital \npsychiatric ward. EMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. E. rode in the ambulance with \nD.E. and EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n225.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E. found \nthemselves in the same situation they had endured three times before. After triage, a \nphysical examination by a pediatrician, and a psychiatric consultation by a psychiatrist, \nD.E. was allowed to proceed to discharge on the basis that he did not require emergency \nservices. The ordeal again lasted between four and six hours without breaks or food. \nDuring that time, D.E. was just as hungry, tired, anxious, confused, and desperate to \nleave the hospital as he had been on prior occasions. \n226.  In response to these incidents, D.E. became more and more resistant to \ngoing to school.  Ms. E was afraid that the pattern would never stop, and that whenever \nD.E. had a tantrum, P.S. K255 might contact EMS and police and further traumatize \nhim. Ms. E. was also afraid that P.S. K255 personnel would continue filing baseless \nreports with ACS. As a result, Ms. E. began keeping D.E. home from school more often. \nIf D.E. was acting up or having a bad day, Ms. E. decided that it was not worth the risk \nthat he might tantrum, and be subjected to another EMS ordeal. Ms. E. also kept D.E. \nhome unless she could accompany him to school, or was absolutely sure that, for the \nduration of the school day, either she or her sister would be close enough to the school to \nrespond in the event that they were notified of a tantrum. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 50 of 75\n \n227.  On December 21, 2011, DEC professionals responsible for D.E.’s \nindependent evaluation met to discuss their findings. On January 11, 2012, DEC \nreleased D.E.’s psychological evaluation report to P.S. K255 with Ms. E.’s permission. \n228.  On February 15, 2012, an IEP meeting was held at which the school-\nbased Committee on Special Education (“CSE”) proposed that D.E. attend a 6:1:1 class \nat a District 75 school with speech language therapy, occupational therapy, and a 1:1 \ncrisis paraprofessional. The program proposed by CSE would not be implemented until \nApril 13, 2012, until which time D.E. would remain in his current, inappropriate \nprogram. Ms. E was worried that if kept in that inappropriate program, D.E. would \ncontinue to have tantrums and P.S. K225 personnel would continue to summon EMS \nand police in response. \n229.  On February 17, 2012, in order to protect D.E. from further needless \ntrauma, Ms. E withdrew her son from P.S. K255 and the public school system. Ms. E \nmoved and re-enrolled D.E. in the public school system in Manhattan in April 2012. She \nwas offered a placement at P226@875 in a 6:1:1 class. Ms. E. viewed the program and \nfound it inappropriate for her son. \n230.  On or about May 4, 2012 Ms. E. filed an administrative Impartial \nHearing request under the IDEA, alleging the NYCDOE denied D.E. his right to a free \nand appropriate education for the 2011-2012 school year for the inappropriate actions of \nP.S. 255 and for the failure of the NYCDOE to recommend an appropriate program. Ms. \nE. sought prospective funding for a private school for children with autism at the DOE’s \nexpense for the remainder of the 2011-2012 school year and the 2012-2013 school year.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 51 of 75\n \n231.  On October 16, 2012, the Impartial Hearing Officer (“IHO”) issued a \ndecision granting the request that NYCDOE be required to pay for a private school \nplacement for D.E. for the 2012-2013 school year.   \nA.A. \n232.  A.A. is an eleven-year old boy. He lives with his mother, T.W.  in  \nBrooklyn.  In September 2013, A.A. entered the 6th grade at P.S. 141.  A.A. has or is \nperceived by NYCDOE to have a disability.  \n233.  A.A. is a special education student with an IEP.  He has been described in \nhis IEP’s as having Asperger’s Syndrome, emotional disturbance and ADHD.  In June \n2013, A.A. graduated from P.S. 4, and then attended their summer program for two \nmonths. In September 2013, A.A. entered the 6th grade at P.S. 141 in an 8:1:1 alternate \nassessment setting.  \n234.  In September or October 2013, A.A. had a tantrum at school. P.S. 141 \npersonnel notified Ms. W. at her workplace. Ms. W asked to speak to A.A. over the \nphone in order to try to calm A.A. down. After a few minutes on the phone with Ms. W., \nA.A. was no longer having a tantrum and then returned to his classroom. \n235.  On November 6, 2013, A.A. had a tantrum in the lunchroom. A.A. had a \ndisagreement with another student and threw his milk carton on the ground. A.A. \nrefused to sit back down next to the student and began eating his potato chips. P.S. 141 \npersonnel took A.A.’s potato chips from his hands and threw them in the garbage. A.A \nbecame upset and had a tantrum. \n236.  School personnel summoned EMS and the police, and then notified Ms. \nW. at her workplace in Canarsie, Brooklyn. School personnel told her A.A. was being \nsent to the hospital and Ms. W told school personnel she would come to the school. Ms. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 52 of 75\n \nW. knew that it would take her a substantial amount of time to travel to the school from \nher workplace, so she suggested that her 31-year old daughter S.W. go to the school to \nbe with A.A. until Ms. W. arrived. S.W. was already listed on A.A.’s blue emergency \ncontact card to be contacted in case of an emergency. The school staff member said this \nwas permissible. Ms. W. immediately notified her daughter S.W. of the situation. \n237.  In the cab on the way to the school, Ms. W. again called her daughter, \nwho was by then with A.A. at the school. S.W asked the EMS workers to allow her to \ntake A.A. home. Ms. W. could overhear EMS telling S.W. that they were only allowed \nto release A.A. to his parents or the principal. The school principal was not on the scene. \nMs. W. then asked S.W. to let her speak to EMS. EMS told Ms. W. that only if she \narrived at the school within 10 minutes, they could release A.A. to her. Ms. W. told \nE.M.S. that she would be unable to make it to the school within that timeframe from her \ncurrent location. EMS told Ms. W. that they would bring him to Interfaith Hospital and \nshe would have to sign a form at the hospital for A.A. to be released to her. School \npersonnel sent an aide with A.A. in the ambulance to the hospital. \n238.  At or about 3:00 p.m., Ms. W. arrived at Interfaith Hospital where she \nfound A.A. sitting near the desk in the emergency room with an EMS worker. A.A. was \ncrying;  however, when he saw Ms. W. he immediately stopped crying. A.A. asked his \nmother if he was in trouble. He was told no and became very relieved. Ms. W. signed a \nform that she believed EMS had mentioned to her earlier that she could sign in order for \nA.A. to be released. Ms. W then proceeded to attempt to leave the hospital with A.A. A \nhospital staff member, however, stopped Ms. W. and threatened to call the \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 53 of 75\n \nAdministration for Children’s Services if Ms. W. did not agree to wait to be seen by a \ndoctor at the hospital. Ms. W. complied, fearful of the hospital staff member’s threat.  \n239.  A.A. and Ms. W. waited approximately three hours before they saw a \nmedical doctor. Ms. W. explained to the doctor that A.A. has autism. The doctor \nexamined A.A. and asked him questions about the incident. The doctor did not note any \nbruises on A.A or other physical injuries. He did not prescribe medication, perform \nmedical tests, x-rays, MRI’s or conduct any other follow-up procedures. \n240.  A.A. and Ms. W. were then told to wait for a psychiatrist for a \nconsultation. A.A. and Ms. W. waited another two hours before seeing a psychiatrist. \nThe psychiatrist assessed A.A. and asked him to retell the events of the incident. The \npsychiatrist did not conduct evaluations or offer referrals.  \n241.  A.A. was then allowed to be discharged. He received no medical or \npsychiatric treatment or medication by the doctors. The ordeal lasted approximately six \nhours, during which A.A. and Ms. W. were not allowed to leave and were provided food \nonly upon repeated requests by Ms. W. During that time, A.A. was traumatized by the \nordeal. He was scared, hungry, tired, anxious, confused, and desperate to leave the \nhospital. He was also forced to miss half the day of instruction at school. \n242.   Ms. W. received a bill from the Fire Department of the City of New \nYork in the amount of $714.80 dated December 3, 2013, for the ambulance. Ms. W. also \nreceived a bill from Interfaith Medical Center in the amount of $1,096.30 dated \nDecember 30, 2013, for the emergency room visit. \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 54 of 75\n \nS.D.  \n243.  S.D. is an eight-year-old student with a Social Communication Disorder \n(SCD) and characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  He has an IEP and \nattends a third-grade general education class with related services at P.S 120 in Queens.   \nS.D.  began attending P.S 120 in the spring of 2013, when he was in second grade.    SD \nresides with his mother, A.D., in Queens.  S.D. has or is perceived by NYCDOE to have \na disability.  \n244.  A.D. has made a number of requests for additional supports and services \nfor her son since S.D. began school at P.S 120 in April 2013.  Among other requests, \nA.D. has asked for a more appropriate classroom program, reinstatement of speech \nservices and an appropriate behavior intervention plan (BIP). To date, NYCDOE has not \nprovided S.D. with an appropriate program or appropriate supports and services or a \nmeaningful behavior intervention plan formulated with appropriate input and \nparticipation of his parent.      \n245.   On October 31,  2013, A.D. dropped S.D. off at school.  Shortly after \nleaving, she received a telephone call from Jeng Feng, the guidance counselor at P.S \n120. A.D. was told that S.D. was very upset because he was not allowed to wear his \nHalloween mask and refused to take it off.  She told A.D. to come to the school right \naway.  \n246.  A.D.  rushed back to school and was brought to the guidance counselor’s \noffice where she found her son locked in with the assistant principal, the guidance \ncounselor and a security guard.  The security guard was standing in the doorway and \nwould not allow A.D. to come into the room.  A.D. could see and hear S.D. crying and \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 55 of 75\n \ncalling for his mother through the glass.  The security guard told A.D. through the \ndoorway that EMS had been called by the school and that S.D. would be transported to \nthe emergency room.  \n247.  Only after A.D. demanded that she be allowed in and permitted to \nconsole her son, did school officials open the door. Within minutes, S.D. had stopped \ncrying and was completely calm. The school told A.D. that S.D. had refused to take off \nhis Halloween mask, would not listen and had had a tantrum. \n248.  EMS workers arrived at the school shortly thereafter. Although SD was \ncalm at this point and A.D. was prepared to take him home, school officials insisted that \nS.D. be removed to the emergency room and evaluated in order to return to school.  \n249.  A.D. accompanied her son and EMS workers to Elmhurst Hospital via \nambulance.   Once at the hospital, S.D. was seen by a doctor, a nurse and other hospital \nstaff.  S.D. was not permitted to leave until all of the various hospital staff had spoken \nwith S.D. and his mother.   \n250.  Hospital staff found S.D. calm and cooperative and released him to his \nmother with a note authorizing him to return to school.  The ordeal lasted approximately \nfive hours from transport to release from the hospital and was exhausting for S.D. and \nA.D . As a result of this experience, S.D. became reluctant to go to school and expressed \nthat he did not feel loved by the school.   \n251.  A.D. received a statement that the hospital had billed approximately \n$1060.00 for their services, only a portion of which, $512.00, was covered by Medicaid.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 56 of 75\n \n252.  S.D. and his mother continue to fear that the school will contact EMS and \nwill resort to having S.D. inappropriately transported to the hospital in the future when \nno medical necessity exists. \nC.R. \n243.  C.R. is a six year old boy who attends first grade at P.S. 396 in the \nBronx.  He lives with his mother N.C.R. and his brother  in the Bronx.  C.R. has or is \nperceived by NYCDOE to have a disability. \n244.  C.R. has received special education services since the age of three and \ncurrently his IEP recommends that he attend an inclusion class in a community school. \nThe IEP provides a classification of autism for him and recommends that he also receive \nthe related services of occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. \n245.  The class that C.R. attends at PS 396 is part of a special program called \nASD Nest, a program for high functioning students with autism spectrum disorders \n(ASD). The program provides an integrated co-teaching class in a community school \nwith two teachers. The ASD Nest program is intended to help children learn how to \nfunction well academically, behaviorally and socially in school and in their community. \nC.R. has been attending the ASD Nest program at P.S. 396 since kindergarten in the \n2012-2013 school year. \n246.  Kindergarten was largely uneventful for C.R. until a few weeks before \nthe end of classes. At that time, an incident occurred where C.R. was kicking, spitting \nand became upset. School officials thought it might have been because  C.R. was \nconcerned about  some changes that had occurred in his classroom environment. During \nthe summer of 2013, C.R. attended the summer program for ASD Nest and he had two \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 57 of 75\n \nepisodes of tantrums. \n247.  Prior to the start of the school year in September 2013, administrators \nfrom P.S. 396 called N.C.R. and told her  that C.R. would have the same teachers from \nthe prior school year, Stacey Garzione and Ashley Auchmoody. School officials also \nasked C.R. to come to school to look at the class prior to the start of school to ensure he \nhad a proper adjustment to the new classroom. N.C.R. noticed that C.R. was not happy \nwhen he saw the classroom and she felt that C.R. appeared not to want to interact with \nthe teachers. \n248.  On or about September 12, 2013, officials from P.S. 396 called N.C.R. \nregarding an incident with C.R. N.C.R. immediately went to school and upon entering \nthe principal’s office she saw Theresa Castillo, the Nest Program Coach, restraining \nC.R. while the principal, Nicole Tine, was holding his ankles together on a bean bag. \nC.R. was not crying and appeared to be relaxed and not resisting. N.C.R. started crying \nbut made sure she was not seen by C.R. since he has never seen her cry. Principal Tine \nspoke to N.C.R., but N.C.R. does not recall what was said because she was extremely \nupset. N.C.R. eventually took C.R. home. N.C.R. never received any written \ndocumentation regarding the incident on September 12, 2013. Afterwards, C.R. \nexplained to N.C.R. that he does not like his teachers and that it is boring in the class. \n249.  On or about September 25, 2013, N.C.R. received a call from C.R.’s \nteacher stating that C.R. was out of control and Principal Tine was going to call EMS \nand then would call her. Principal Tine called N.C.R. and stated that if C.R. did not calm \ndown in ten minutes then they would call EMS. Principal Tine stated there were four \nsecurity guards with him and that C.R. might have to go to the emergency room because \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 58 of 75\n \nhe had threatened to kill her. N.C.R. asked her with what C.R. had threatened to kill her \nwith and the principal did not answer. N.C.R. told Principal Tine that she believed the \nschool ought to be able to deal with C.R. without needing EMS. Principal Tine \nresponded by saying, “I can't sit here all day with him, it is not my job” and the \nconversation ended. N.C.R. was at an appointment and was unable to go to the school. \nSchool officials called later  that day and stated that C.R. was placed in a kindergarten \nclass and he did better. \n250.  On or about September 28, 2013, N.C.R. raised concerns about her son’s \nbehaviors to school officials. Ms. Costello gave N.C.R. three options: get counseling for \nher son outside of school; have the school conduct a Functional Behavior Assessment \n(“FBA”); or have C.R. see a psychiatrist. N.C.R. chose the FBA option and made the \nrequest to school officials. Ms. Costello stated that she would be conducting the FBA. \n251.  At or about the end of October 2013, an IEP meeting was held for C.R. \nAt the meeting, N.C.R. suggested using a weighted vest as a way to calm C.R. down but \nMs. Auchmoody said it was not necessary. N.C.R. also suggested that C.R. be taken to \nthe gym to calm down when he gets upset. The school officials at the meeting seemed to \nignore all of her suggestions. \n252.  In or about October 2013, N.C.R. received a call from Ms. Tine regarding \nC.R. Ms. Tine stated that C.R. was screaming and would not calm down. She requested \nthat N.C.R. come to the school to pick him up . When N.C.R. arrived at the school, she \nsaw Ms. Tine restraining C.R. by straddling him on top of a bean bag. Ms. Tine told \nN.C.R. that C.R. had been kicking and screaming for the last forty-five minutes. N.C.R. \ncould see that C.R. had been crying. N.C.R. then proceeded to take her son home. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 59 of 75\n \n253.  In or about November 2013, N.C.R. learned that the school had not given \nC.R. a permission slip for a class trip. N.C.R. learned about the trip only when she went \nto school to check in on her son and noticed the entire class was ready to go on the trip \nand C.R. was not dressed to leave with the class. The teacher stated that he had been \ndefiant and would not be able to attend the class trip. In fact, the school has since \nmaintained a policy that, rather than providing a reasonable accommodation, it will not \npermit C.R. to go on any trips unless N.C.R. is available to accompany him. On three to \nfour occasions, N.C.R. has been unable to accompany C.R. and he was not allowed to \nattend the planned trips. \n254.  On November 15, 2013, C.R. was involved with an incident in his class \nduring which he became agitated because he wanted to leave the room and his teachers \nwould not let him do so. Ms. Garzione videotaped C.R. with her iPhone as he was trying \nto leave the room. Ms. Garzione provided a copy of the videotape to N.C.R. N.C.R. had \nnot provided permission to school officials to videotape her son. However, N.C.R. \nsigned a release granting permission for the school to videotape C.R. for educational \npurposes on November 18, 2013. \n255.  On November 25, 2013, at around 9:15 a.m., N.C.R. received a call from \nC.R.’s teacher, Ms. Auchmoody, who told her to come and pick up C.R. from the \nschool. N.C.R. told Ms. Auchmoody that it would take her more than an hour to arrive at \nthe school given her location and in addition, she had a 10:00 a.m. appointment.  Ms. \nAuchmoody proceeded to state that Principal Tine would call EMS if C.R. was not calm \nwithin the next 10 minutes.  N.C.R. believes C.R. was upset because the school officials \ndid not want to take C.R. on a field trip to the Museum of Natural History on that \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 60 of 75\n \nday.  Ms. Auchmoody sent N.C.R. an email earlier that morning stating that C.R. was \nwelcome to go on the trip only if N.C.R. accompanied him.  If not, C.R. was going to be \nplaced in a kindergarten classroom.  \n256.  In or about November 2013, based on the advice of school officials, \nN.C.R. took C.R. to the North Central Bronx Hospital emergency room to be seen by the \nCrisis Intervention Program.  The doctor at NCBH told N.C.R. that C.R. was fine, but \nthat the school should add a behavioral plan to his IEP.  N.C.R. relayed this information \nto school officials but instead of acting on this information, Ms. Costello gave N.C.R. a \nflyer and suggested that she take her son to see a psychiatrist at an agency called YAI.  \n257.  On or about December 12, 2013, Ms. Hollinger called N.C.R. and stated \nthat C.R. was in her office and that he was crying and carrying on badly. She requested \nthat N.C.R. come to the school. N.C.R. told her she was on her way but that she was far \naway from the school. Ms. Costello called soon after and said they had called an  \nambulance and C.R. might be at the hospital by the time she arrived. N.C.R. asked why \nthey had called for an ambulance. Ms. Costello said C.R. was hitting and kicking and \nspitting at staff members. During the phone conversation with Ms. Costello, N.C.R. \narrived at school and observed Ms. Fishman videotaping C.R. in Ms. Hollinger’s office \nthrough the glass windows of the door.  N.C.R. asked why they were videotaping C.R. \nMs. Fishman stated she was videotaping because she wanted show how C.R. was \nbehaving.  When N.C.R. looked into the room, she saw C.R. swing his arm after Ms. \nHollinger in an effort to make her leave him alone.  C.R. appeared not to be angry or \nextremely upset. N.C.R. then asked what happened and was told that C.R. had become \nupset at Ms. Fishman when she came to take him to his occupational therapy \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 61 of 75\n \nsession.  C.R. told N.C.R. that Ms. Fishman came to get him but he did not feel like \ngoing, and Ms. Fishman said in a loud voice, “It’s not a choice!” C.R. said he turned his \nback to her and she touched him.  He said he told her do not touch him, but she touched \nhim again a second time. After the third time, C.R. he repeated to her “do not touch me”  \nand then he turned around and scratched at Ms. Fishman.  N.C.R. asked Ms. Fishman \nwhy she would force him to go with her if he told her he did not want to and she \nresponded that occupational therapy is mandatory.  \n258.  As N.C.R. began to leave with C.R., Assistant Principal Rebecca Odessey \nstopped N.C.R. and said Principal Tine had said that N.C.R. and C.R. could not leave. \nN.C.R. would have to wait for the ambulance to arrive and to tell them she did not want \nC.R. to be taken to the hospital.  N.C.R. asked Ms. Odessey if she was required by law \nto stay and wait for the ambulance. Ms. Odessey proceeded to speak with Principal Tine \nand later told N.C.R. she could leave if she wanted to. \n259.  On December 18, 2013, N.C.R. received a call from school officials \nstating that C.R. was involved in an incident. N.C.R. proceeded to the school and \nlearned that the school had called for an ambulance. Upon her arrival, N.C.R. observed \nthat C.R. was calm  and that he was playing on an iPad in the guidance office. Two \npolice officers arrived in response to the call for the ambulance. Subsequently, an \nambulance arrived as well. N.C.R. refused treatment from the EMT’s. N.C.R. asked \nschool officials for an explanation about the incident and school officials did not provide \none. \n260.  Subsequently, in or about February 2014, N.C.R. received a school \ndocument stating that on December 18, 2013, C.R. had refused to wash his hands when \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 62 of 75\n \nasked and had started to hit, spit, kick and pinch the teacher. The document also states \nthat he head-butted the teacher and was shaking and screaming. When other staff \nmembers responded, C.R. allegedly engaged in the same behaviors with each staff \nmember. \n261.  On or about January 9, 2014, N.C.R. received a call from officials at P.S. \n396 stating that C.R. had kicked a teacher and that they were calling an ambulance. \nN.C.R. was at the school when the EMTs arrived. The EMTs encouraged N.C.R. to \nallow them to take C.R. to the hospital. N.C.R. refused the services and had to take C.R. \nhome because school officials would not allow C.R. back into the classroom. Later that \nday, N.C.R. received a call from Roxanne Batista, Administrator for Special Education \nfor the Children’s First Network 109, the network within NYCDOE that provides \nsupport for P.S. 396, advising her that C.R. would have to be picked up each day at \n12:00 noon because of his behaviors. \n262.  N.C.R. subsequently obtained a school document in or about February \n2014 stating that on January 9, 2014, C.R. was being aggressive towards three teachers \n(Meg Heubel, Stacey Pagan, Ashley Auchmoody) and the principal. The document \nstates that C.R. kicked, punched, pulled their hair, spit at them, and yelled, “die.” \n263.  On January 13, 2014, N.C.R. received a call from Ms. Hollinger who \nstated that C.R. needed to be picked up at noon. In response to N.C.R.’s objections, Ms. \nHollinger stated that the truncated school schedule was mandated for the remainder of \nthe school year.  \n264.  N.C.R. did not pick up her son at noon. Principal Tine called N.C.R. at \naround 12:45 p.m. and stated that C.R. had been “tantruming” for thirty minutes and that \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 63 of 75\n \nshe might have to call for an ambulance again. N.C.R. responded that she did not have \nthe cab fare to get to the school quickly so it would take at least thirty minutes. Principal \nTine responded that she would only wait twenty minutes for N.C.R. to arrive before she \ncalls for the ambulance. Principal Tine stated further that the school is not equipped to \ndeal with C.R.’s behavior. \n265.  Between October 2013 to January 2013, N.C.R. contacted school \nofficials to get updates on the progress of the FBA.  Anna Martinez Hollinger, the \nschool guidance counselor, told N.C.R. that “these things take time.” \n266.  On February 13, 2014, an IEP meeting was held at P.S. 396 to determine \nthe appropriate education program and services for C.R. The team agreed to defer C.R.’s \ncase to the Central Based Support Team for non-public school placement. At the \nmeeting, N.C.R. learned that the FBA and BIP had been completed in December \nalthough she was never involved in its development. \n267.  Between October 2013 and January 2014, N.C.R. was threatened on or \nabout fifteen separate occasions by school officials that they would send C.R. to the \nhospital emergency room if she did not go to the school and take C.R. home.  N.C.R. \nbelieves the school has been provoking C.R. The situation has severely affected her \nstudies and her sleep. She finds herself exhausted and nervous every day. She fears that \nevery time her phone rings it is the school calling her to pick up C.R. \nQ.A.  \n268.  Q.A. is twelve years old and is in the sixth grade.  He previously attended \nthe Young Scholars Academy.  He lives with his mother, I.S., in the Bronx. Q.A.  has or \nis perceived by NYCDOE to have a disability.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 64 of 75\n \n269.  On October 17, 2013, Q.A. was in the gym at the Young Scholars \nAcademy with a friend. The gym teacher told him not to do a back flip.  Q.A. did not \nfollow the teacher’s instructions. The teacher asked him to leave the gym and go to the \nSafe Schools against Violence in Education (“SAVE”) room, which in most schools is a \nroom the school uses for students who have misbehaved and for in-school suspensions.  \nQ.A  expressed his belief that he had not done anything wrong, and refused to go.  \n270.   The school contacted his aunt on the phone and told her that Q.A. did not \nwant to go to the SAVE room.  While she was on the phone with Q.A.’s aunt, the \nprincipal put her arm out to block Q.A. and he bumped into her.  Q.A.'s aunt spoke with \nhim and told him that he needed to apologize.  Q.A. did apologize. The principal told his \naunt on the phone that they were sending Q.A. to the hospital, that he had to leave the \nschool, and that they could not wait for his mother to arrive.  The school called EMS, \nand Q.A. was taken by ambulance to North Central Bronx Hospital, accompanied by the \nschool guidance counselor.  Q.A. expressed the desire to speak with his mother, but was \ntold he could not speak with her until he arrived at the hospital.   I.S. arrived at the \nhospital subsequently.   \n271.  Q.A. was seen by hospital staff. The admitting notes indicate that he was \nhostile and aggressive towards school staff. Q.A. was discharged the same day with \ninstructions that he return to school.   \nR.T. \n272. R.T. is a five-year-old boy enrolled in Kindergarten at P.S 86 in Queens.  He \nresides with his mother, R.M.T., in New York City.  R.T. has or is perceived by \nNYCDOE to have a disability.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 65 of 75\n \n273. During the 2012-2013 school year, RT attended prekindergarten at \nHeartshare in Queens, New York.  \n274. R.T. began attending school at P.S 86 in September 2013.  At the time of his \nenrollment, R.T. had an IEP classifying him as having a speech or language impairment \nand placing him in a 12:1:1 program. \n275. R.T. ’s IEP noted that he displays challenges with sensory integration that \nimpacts his need for movement and challenges his ability to focus and attend for longer \nperiods of time.  The IEP also notes that he has severe language delays, challenges with, \namong other things, visual motor activities, fine motor skills, transitioning, frustration \ntolerance and emotional control and transitioning.  He benefits from among other things \npositive reinforcement and multisensory learning, frequent breaks and an opportunity to \nget used to new situations. \n276. Shortly after beginning school at P.S 86, R.M.T. began receiving frequent \ncalls or verbal reports of R.T.’s behavioral issues at school.  On numerous occasions, \nR.M.T. was called and asked to bring R.T. home during the school day. \n277. According to school officials R.T. engaged in a variety of behaviors such as \nnot following instructions, climbing under desks, running around the classroom, \nknocking into things, throwing items and hitting.   \n278. R.M.T.  reached out to and met with school officials a number of times to \nattempt to address R.T.’s behavioral and learning needs and to make suggestions about \nhow to help him.   She also requested a functional behavior assessment, a behavior \nintervention plan, and additional supports for her child. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 66 of 75\n \n279. On October 17, 2013 RMT was at P.S 86 meeting with  Marilyn \nMaldonado, the school’s social worker for a social history.  She attended the meeting \nwith Michelle McCusker, a teacher who had worked with R.T. at his previous school, \nHeartshare.    The school principal disrupted the meeting by announcing that “[R.T.] is \nat it again.”   \n280. R.M.T. followed staff members downstairs and saw that R.T. was reluctant \nto go to speech therapy.  While staff members gathered around him and attempted to tie \nhis shoes, he kicked off his shoe.  Ms. Thurston and R.T.’s former teacher were able to \neasily redirect R.T. and explain that the new speech lady was just like the speech lady at \nhis old school.  R.T. complied with the request that he go to speech therapy after his \nmother and former teacher spoke with him clearly and calmly. \n281. Later that day, R.M.T. received a telephone call from the school informing \nher that the school had called EMS to take R.T. to the emergency room because he was \nmisbehaving and that she should meet him there.    \n282. Although the child was reportedly “calm and cooperative” when EMS \narrived, he was nonetheless removed to the hospital at the urging of the school. \n283. R.T. was seen by doctors and other hospital staff who spoke to him and \ncontacted the school.  The school purportedly told hospital staff that R.T. had engaged in \nbehavior that included running around, not listening to redirection, head butting, putting \nmagnets in his mouth and picking up scissors in the guidance counselor’s office “in a \nthreatening way.” \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 67 of 75\n \n284. Hospital staff reported that the R.T.’s behavior was cooperative, found no \nsuicidal or homicidal ideation and released R.T. to R.M.T.  The hospital visit lasted \napproximately four hours and confusing and stressful for both R.T. and R.M.T.  \n285. On November 15, 2013, R.T. was attending P. S  117, an alternative \neducation site where he was serving a suspension for purportedly stomping on a \nteacher’s foot.  Staff there contacted R.M.T. and told her they had  called EMS and were \nsending R.T. to the hospital because he was crying and having a tantrum.  R.M.T. \nbegged the school not to send her R.T. to the emergency room, but school staff refused \nto wait for R.T. to get to the school and said they had to send him to the hospital.  R.T. \nwas transported to the emergency room by EMS and a school aid for allegedly acting \nout and jumping on chairs, but he was calm when he arrived.  \n286. R.M.T. proceeded to the hospital.  When she arrived, R.T. was calm.  While \nat the hospital, R.T. was seen by various hospital staff.   \n287. The attending doctor noted that R.T. was calm and cooperative in the \nemergency room and was not depressed, manic or psychotic.  He was not found to be \nsuicidal or homicidal and was released to R.M.T. after spending  approximately three \nand a half hours in the emergency room. R.T. and R.M.T. were tired and hungry and \nupset by this experience.  \n288. After this second removal of R.T. to the emergency room, R.M.T. expressed \nher concern to school officials about the school’s practice of calling EMS to remove \nR.T. and instructed P.S 86 not to call 911 to have the child removed from the school  \nagain without her consent.   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 19   Filed 03/18/14   Page 68 of 75\n \n289.  On November 25, 2013, R.T.’s first day back at his home school, he was \nagain transported to the emergency room at the request of school officials at P.S 86 due \nto purported disruptive behavior without his parent’s consent.   \n290.  While at the hospital on November 25, R.T. again underwent evaluation by \nvarious doctors and hospital staff who spoke to him and also contacted the school.   \n291.  According to hospital records, the school purportedly told the hospital that \nR.T. had put batteries in his mouth.  The doctor noted that R.T. “impulsively puts things \nin his mouth at baseline and expressed no plan or intent to harm himself.”  According to \nhospital records, R.T. did not display signs of suicidality, homicidal thoughts or \naggressive behavior in the hospital and was hyperactive but cooperative and under \ncontrol in the emergency room.   \n292.  As a result of the removals of R.T. against her will, R.M.T. became \nincreasingly concerned about leaving R.T. with staff at the school and fears that \nDefendants will continue to inappropriately remove R.T. to the E.R .  The removals have \nalso been stressful and upsetting for R.M.T. and for R.T., who feels ostracized from his \nschool community and disliked by his teachers and other school staff and administrators.  \n293.  R.M.T. has received bills from FDNY for the trips to the emergency room \nwhich she cannot pay.  \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF: UNREASONABLE SEIZURE \n(On behalf of Plaintiffs J.H., J.R., N.R., J.M., D.E., A.A., \n S.D., Q.A., and R.T. against all defendants) \n \n294.

Plaintiffs are children in New York City public schools whose educations \nhave been forcefully interrupted because their schools have summoned Emergency \nMedical Services (\"EMS\") to have them removed by ambulances even though they were \nnot in need of emergency medical care.  In some instances, EMS personnel insisted on \ntransporting them to hospitals against the express wishes of their families. As a result, \nplaintiff students have not only been detained by school and EMS personnel against \ntheir wills, they have also been traumatized by unnecessary trips to emergency rooms \nand deprived of valuable instructional time. \n2.  Plaintiffs are also the parents of these students.  School and EMS \nprocedures fail to allow parent plaintiffs to determine the nonemergency medical care \nfor their children. In addition, school and EMS policies and practices cause these \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 2 of 19\nchildren to be detained and then removed against the wishes of parents and guardians. \nFinally, school and EMS practices cause plaintiff parents to incur fees for ambulance \nand emergency room services that the plaintiff children did not need and that the \nfamilies cannot afford. \n3.  The plaintiffs' ordeals have been caused by the schools' failure to utilize \nthe systems already set up-as required by law--for evaluating children with perceived \ndisabilities, including behavioral issues, in addition to the schools' pattern and practice \nof instead using EMS to remove students from their schools and forcing them to undergo \nemergency medical evaluations in nonemergency situations. Plaintiff students, and their \nfamilies, remain at risk so long as these patterns and practices persist. At the same time, \nthe emergency resources ofNew York City are misdirected at children who are not \nfacing any emergency. \n4.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to find that defendants' conduct has violated their \nrights under federal statutory and Constitutional law, the New York State Constitution, \nand the New York City Human Rights Law; to enjoin defendants from continuing to \nviolate plaintiffs' rights; and to award plaintiffs' damages for the violation of their \nrights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.

Plaintiffs demand trial by jury in this action on each and every one of \ntheir claims. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \nThe United States Constitution \n27.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution is made \napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment and provides that persons shall \nnot be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures. \n28.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects \nindividuals from deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process. \n29.  One of the liberties protected by the due process clause is the \nfundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control \nof their children, including the right to authorize and direct the medical care given to \ntheir children. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 7 of 19\n30.  The due process clause also protects the fundamental liberty interest of \nboth parents and children not be forcibly separated from each other, even temporarily, \nwithout due process. \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act \n31.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C.  · \n§1400 et seq., governs how states and localities provide early intervention, special \neducation, and related services to children with disabilities. \n32.  IDEA defines a child with a disability as \"a child (i) with intellectual \ndisabilities, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, \nvisual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance (referred to in \nthis chapter as \"emotional disturbance\"), orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic \nbrain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and (ii) who, by \nreason thereof, needs special education and related services.\" 20 U.S.C. §1401(3)(A). \n33.  Under IDEA, states must make available \"a free appropriate public \neducation ... to all children with disabilities residing in the State between the ages of 3 \nand 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or \nexpelled from school.\"  20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(1)(A). \n34.  IDEA defines \"free and appropriate education\" as: \"special education and \nrelated services that (A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision \nand direction, and without charge; (B) meet the standards of the State educational \nagency; (C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school \neducation in the State involved; and (D) are provided in conformity with the \nindividualized education program required under section 1414(d ) of this title.\"  20 \nu.s.c. \n§1401(9). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 8 of 19\n35.  The IDEA also mandates that \"removal of children with disabilities from \nthe regular educational environment occur[] only when the nature or severity of the \ndisability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of \nsupplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\" 20 U.S.C §1412(a) \n(5)(A). \n36.  Under the Child Find requirements of the IDEA, schools districts have an \naffirmative duty to locate, identify and evaluate students who may require special \neducation programs or services. 20 U.S.C §1412(a)(3). \n37.  Either a parent or guardian or a school can make a referral to have a child \nevaluated for special education supports and services in New York State. 20 U.S.C. \n§1414 (a)(l)(B); 34 C.F.R. §300.301(b); 8 N.Y.C.R.R. §200.4(a).  Schools must obtain a \nparent's informed consent before performing an evaluation.  34 CFR § 300.300. \n38.  As part of an initial evaluation and subsequent reevaluations, each school \ndistrict is required to use \"a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant \nfunctional, developmental, and academic information about the child\" that may assist \nthe district in determining if the child is entitled to special education services and what \nthose services should be. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. §300.304 (b). \n39.  The school district is also required to assess the child in \"all areas related \nto the suspected disability,\" including, if appropriate, the emotional status of a child and \nhow behavioral factors impact the child. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (b)(3); 34 C.F.R. §300.304 \n(b)(4). \n40.  Following an evaluation in all areas of suspected disability, a meeting \nmust be scheduled on written notice to the parent with a multidisciplinary team to \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 9 of 19\ndetermine if the student meets a classification under the IDEA and to develop an \nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) for the child. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (b)(4) and (5); \n34 C.P.R. §300.306. \n41.  Parents are entitled to participate in an annual review of the IEP, to \ndiscuss and update the IEP and if appropriate to revise the programs, services and \nsupports. 20 U.S.C. §1414 (d)(4);  34 C.P.R. §300.324(b). \n42.  Students have the right to be educated in the least restrictive environment \nwith appropriate supports and services. 20 U.S.C. §1412 (a)(5) and (5);  34 C.P.R. \n§300.114. \n43.  For a child exhibiting behavioral issues that impact the student's \neducational process, the school district must conduct appropriate assessments such as a \nfunctional behavior assessment (FBA) to determine the appropriate services to address \nthose behaviors. In addition, the school district should develop a behavioral intervention \nplan (BIP) on notice to and with the participation of the parent, to address the behavioral \nissues. 20 U.S.C. 1415 (k); 34 C.P.R. §300.530(f). \nThe Rehabilitation Act \n44.  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in programs receiving federal financial assistance.  29 U.S.C. §701 et seq. \n45.  Section 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. §794, \nmandates that ''No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, \nas defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, \nbe excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ... \n\" \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 10 of 19\n46.  The definition of\"individual with a disability\" for the purposes of \nSection 504 is cross-referenced to the definition found in the Americans with \nDisabilities Act: an individual with a disability is a person with a physical or mental \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; \nwith a record of such an impairment; or who is regarded as having such an impairment. \n42 U.S.C. §12102(1). \n47.  The definition of\"program or activity\" for the purposes of Section 504 \nincludes all of the operations of both \"a department, agency, special purpose district, or \nother instrumentality of a State or of a local goverrunent\" and \"a local educational \nagency (as defined in section 7801 of title 20), system of vocational education, or other \nschool system.\" 29 U.S.C. §794(b). \n48.  Local educational agency is defined in 20 U.S.C. §780 1 as \"a public \nboard of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either \nadministrative control or direction of, or to perform a service function for, public \nelementary schools or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or \nother political subdivision of a State, or of or for a combination of school districts or \ncounties that is recognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public \nelementary schools or secondary schools.\" \n49.  34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a) requires that recipients of federal funds who \noperate elementary or secondary schools must \"provide a free appropriate public \neducation to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction, \nregardless ofthe nature or severity of the person's handicap.\" \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 11 of 19\n50.  Under 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(d), a recipient \"may not exclude any qualified \nhandicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education ....\"  \n51.  Under 34 C.F.R. § 10 4.34(a), a recipient \"shall provide for the education \nof each qualified handicapped person in its jurisdiction with persons who are not \nhandicapped to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person. \nA recipient shall place a handicapped person in the regular educational environment \noperated by the recipient unless it is demonstrated by the recipient that the education of \nthe person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services \ncannot be achieved satisfactorily.\" \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act \n52.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131 et seq., prohibits discrimination based upon disability by public entities. \n53.  42 U.S.C. §12132 makes it unlawful for a qualified individual with a \ndisability, by reason of such disability, to be excluded from participation in or be denied \nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by any such entity. \n54.  Disability under the ADA is defmed as a physical or mental irnpainnent \nthat substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an \nimpairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.  42 U.S.C. §12102(1). \n55.  A public entity is defined by the ADA as, among other things, any State \nor local government or any department, agency, special purpose district, or other \ninstrumentality of a State or States or local government.  42 U.S.C. §12131(1). \n56.  The term \"qualified individual with a disability\" is defined as an \nindividual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 12 of 19\npolicies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation \nbarriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities \nprovided by a public entity.\" 42 U.S.C. §12131(2). \n57.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(b)(3) bars public entities from utilizing methods of \nadministration that \"have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability.\" \n58.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(d) requires public entities to \"administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities.\" \n59.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(h) prohibits public entities from imposing safety \nrequirements based on \"mere speculation, stereotypes or generalizations abou( \nindividuals with disabilities.\" \nNew York State Constitution \n60.  Article I, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution guarantees the \nright of people to free of unreasonable searches and seizures. \nNew York City Human Rights Law \n61.  Pursuant to the New York City Human Rights Law, it is an unlawful \ndiscriminatory practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, \nsuperintendent, agent or employee of any place or provider of public accommodation \nbecause of the actual or perceived . . . disability to refuse, withhold from or deny to \nsuch person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof ... \n. \"  Administrative Code of the City ofNew York §8-107(4)(a). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 13 of 19\n62.  The term '\"place or provider of public accommodation' ... include(s] \nproviders, whether licensed or unlicensed, of goods, services, facilities, \naccommodations, advantages or privileges of any kind, and places, whether licensed or \nunlicensed, where goods, services, facilities, accommodations, advantages or privileges \nof any kind are extended, offered, sold or otherwise made available.\"  Administrative \nCode ofthe City ofNew York §8-102(9). \n63.  A private cause of action for violations of the New York City Human \nRights Law is created by Administrative Code of the City ofNew York §8-502. \n64.  Administrative Code ofthe City ofNew York §8-130 states that the \nHuman Rights Law should be construed \"liberally for the accomplishment of the \nuniquely broad and remedial purposes thereof, regardless of whether federal or New \nYork State civil and human rights laws, including those laws with provisions \ncomparably-worded to provisions of this title have been so construed.\" \nDOE Chancellor's Regulations \n65.  Defendant Walcott and his predecessors have issued \"Chancellor's \nRegulations\" to provide guidance to DOE personnel regarding DOE policies. \n66.  Each school must maintain a \"school safety plan\" detailing the school's \npolicy regarding possible emergency situations.  Chancellor's Regulation A-414. \n67.  Chancellor's Regulation A-412, Security and the Schools, requires and \nauthorizes DOE personnel to call 911 when a student requires immediate medical \nattention.  The principal must be contacted immediately after the 911 call and must \nproceed to the scene with a trained medical professional.  The student's parent must also \nbe notified immediately. If the parent is not present when the ambulance arrives, a \nschool employee must accompany the student to the emergency room. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 14 of 19\n68.  Chancellor's Regulation A-701, School Health Services, also requires \nand authorizes DOE personnel to call 911 when a student requires immediate medical \nattention, mandates that the student's parent be called, and mandates that a school \nemployee accompany the student to the emergency room if the parent is not present \nwhen the ambulance arrives. \n69.  Chancellor's Regulation A-443, Student Discipline Process, requires \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard before any student can be barred from attending \ntheir school. \nFDNY Regulations \n70.  The FDNY has issued regulations to provide guidance to its EMS \npersonnel regarding interactions with minors. \n71.  Section 106-05 ofthe FDNY EMS Operating Guide Procedures, dated \nMarch 15, 1999, describes the protocol for the \"Treatment & Transport of a Minor from \nthe Scene of an Assignment.\" \n72.  Section 10 6-05 authorizes transportation of minors by EMS over a \nparent's objection only when the minor has a life-threatening condition or injury and it is \napparent that even a minor delay will jeopardize the life or health of the minor. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nBackground \n73.  The problem of abuse of emergency medical services by public schools is \nwell-known to the city, NYCDOE, and the commissioner defendants. For almost a \ndecade, advocates and medical practitioners have raised concerns about the improper use \nof emergency medical services to forcibly remove children from public schools. See, \ne.g., New York Times SchoolBook, Sept. 23,2013 (quoting an emergency room \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 15 of 19\nphysician stating \"[i]t feels like we are being used as a dumping ground by the \nschools\"); Hospitals Say City Schools Use them as a Cure-All, New York Times, May \n18, 2004 (quoting an emergency room physician as stating\"[ s]o many ofthe school \nreferrals are 'dumps' of misbehaving children\"); The New Craze Schools Using ERs as \nDumping Ground Educators Shuttling Surly Students to City's White Coats, Daily \nNews, May 17, 2004 (quoting the head of one hospital's Comprehensive Emergency \nServices as stating \"Schools are overcrowded, teachers overworked, so they send us kids \nthey just don't want to deal with -or don't know how to deal with them. But the kids \naren't having a mental crisis,\" and quoting a Director of Pediatric Psychiatry as saying \n\"A trip to the emergency room, even if it is done well, is the worst introduction to \nmental health services you can give a child.\"). \n74.  In response to the growing number of students being sent to hospital \nemergency rooms in seemingly non-urgent situations, the New York City Council \nEducation and Mental Health Committees conducted a public hearing to investigate this \nissue on May 1, 2012. \n75.  The New York City Public Advocate's Office, under Mayor-Elect de \nBlasio, also raised concerns over the number of students removed from schools to \nhospital emergency rooms for behavioral issues. See, e.g., Public Advocate Seeks Data \non Children Sent to ER, Wall Street Journal, (April 9, 2013) (stating that \"schools are \ncalling 911 to deal with behavioral outbursts and thousands of schoolchildren are being \nsent to hospitals at their parents' expense\"). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 16 of 19\n76.  Data maintained by the defendants further demonstrates that the practice \nof removing children from the public schools by ambulance because of difficult or \ndisruptive behaviors is both longstanding and widespread. \n77.  According to Fire Department data obtained by plaintiffs' counsel \nthrough the Freedom of Information Law, the FDNY responded to approximately \n18,000 emergency calls for an emotionally disturbed person from New York City school \nlocations from 2005 through 2010 for an average of almost 3,000 calls per calendar year. \nThe 18,000 calls originated from over 1,000 schools from across all five boroughs. \n78.  The FDNY data is consistent with NYCDOE data, also obtained by \nplaintiffs counsel through the Freedom oflnformation Law, which shows that in each \nschool year from 2009-2010 through 2011-2012, over 3,000 calls were made to EMS \ndue to alleged disruptive behaviors.  Over those three school years, the number of calls \nto EMS by NYC public schools to respond to students with alleged disruptive behaviors \nincreased each year.  By 2011-2012, over 3,600 calls were made to EMS by NYC public \nschools to respond to alleged disruptive behaviors by students. These data also show that \nthe calls are made from hundreds of schools each year in all five boroughs. \n79.  Upon information and belief, the majority of students removed from New \nYork City public schools by EMS are students with disabilities or students perceived as \nhaving a disability. \nJ.H. \n80.  Plaintiff J.H. is now six years old.  He began attending kindergarten at \nGrant A venue Elementary School in the Bronx in September 2012, when he was five. \nHe is now in the first grade.  He lives with his mother, T.H., and his eight year old \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 17 of 19\nbrother and his thirteen year old sister in the Bronx. J.H. has or is perceived by \nNYCDOE to have a disability. \n81.  On October 26, 2012, the school called Ms. H. and told her that an \nambulance had been called for her son and that she should come to the school \nimmediately. When Ms. H. asked what was going on, she was told it would be \nexplained when she got to the school. \n82.  When Ms. H. arrived at the school, she was told that J.H. had already \nbeen taken to Lincoln Hospital.  When she asked why her son had been taken to the \nhospital, a staff member told her that he had been acting up and that there had been no \nother way to control him, but did not further explain what had happened. While she was \nat the school, she was given a form for the hospital to sign before J .H. could return to \nschool. \n83.  Ms. H. then removed her older son, T.H., from his class at Grant Avenue \nElementary because she was concerned she would not return in time for his dismissal at \nthe end of the school day. Ms. H. and T.H. rushed to the emergency room at Lincoln \nHospital, where she found J.H. sitting calmly with a teacher's aide. The aide could not \nor would not say what had happened at the school.  When Ms. H. asked J.H. what \nhappened, he told her, \"They were bothering me.\" According to hospital records, J.H. \ntold hospital staff that he got into a fight with a security guard at the school when he \nwanted to go back to music class when he was not supposed to. Those records also say \nthat throughout his interview with hospital staff J.H. was ''well-behaved and easily \nredirected by prompts from his mother.\" \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 18 of 19\n84.  When Ms. H. tried to leave the emergency room with J.H., a nurse told \nher that she could not leave until three different staff members had met with J .H. \n85.  Ms. H. spent several hours in the emergency room with J.H. while he was \nseen by the three staff members who the hospital wanted to see him. Ms. H. desperately \nwanted to leave the hospital so she could pick up her daughter from school. She had no \nway to contact her daughter, who she knew did not have a key and would not be able to \nget into their apartment. She was concerned for her daughter's safety because they live \nin an unsafe neighborhood. The hospital would not let her leave until she received the \ndischarge papers. When she tried to leave, hospital staff called the police and the police \nphysically blocked her from leaving the hospital. It took about an hour from the time she \ntried to leave until she got the discharge papers and was finally permitted to leave. \n86.  By the time Ms. H., T.H. and J.H. left the hospital it was too late to pick \nup J .H.'s sister from school. She was waiting in their building, locked out of the \napartment. \n87.  On the next school day, Ms. H. brought J.H. to school and gave the \nschool the form from the hospital.  She was given no written incident report for the \nOctober 26 incident and was told nothing more than that the school's staff had been \nunable to calm him down and that he had been jumping, running around, and hitting \npeople. \n88.  On November 13, 2012, the school again phoned Ms. H. and told her an \nambulance had been called for her son.  Ms. H. rushed to the school. This time, she \narrived at the school prior to J .H.'s being removed by EMS. She found him between a \nwindow gate and a closed window in a stairwell surrounded by close to ten adults \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 19 of 19\nincluding EMS personnel, police, and school employees.  She coaxed him into her arms, \nbut when she said she wanted to bring him home, she was told by school employees and \nby EMS staff that he had to be taken to the hospital. \n89.  Ms. H. again removed T.H. from class so he could accompany her and \nJ.H. to the hospital. Ms. H. was again concerned that she would not be able to return to \nGrant Avenue Elementary in time for dismissal for T.H. \n90.  Ms. H. and T.H. accompanied J.H. to Lincoln Hospital in the ambulance \nand this time the hospital signed the paperwork to permit J.H. to return to school and \nreleased him in less than an hour. Then they went home. According to hospital records, \nJ.H. was referred to the hospital for evaluation for \"not listening\" and because he \n\"refused to sit on a rug.\" \n91.  Again, by the time they were permitted to leave the hospital, J.H.'s sister \nwas home from school, locked out of the apartment, and Ms. H. was unable to contact \nher. Because of these repeated incidents and in fear for her daughter's safety, she bought \nher daughter a cell phone so that they could contact each other if Ms. H. had to go to the \nhospital with J .H. again. \n92.  On the next school day, Ms. H. brought J.H. to school and gave the \nschool the form from the hospital.  She was given no written incident report regarding \nwhat had happened on November 13 and was told only that he had been running, \njumping around, and hitting people. \n93.  After the November 13 incident, Ms. H. asked for and received \npermission to observe her son at school without his knowledge.  She did so on several \noccasions and never saw him engage in aggressive or out-of-control behavior. Ms. H. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 1 of 19\nwanted to try moving J.H. to another teacher to see if that would help with the behavior \nproblems, but the school would not permit J .H. to move, even though several other \nchildren had already been moved out of his classroom. \n94.  On December 12, 2012, the school again called Ms. H. to tell her they \nhad called EMS to take J.H. to the hospital.  Ms. H. rushed to the school.  When she got \nthere, she was told that J.H. had already been taken to Lincoln Hospital by ambulance. \n95.  Ms. H. rushed to Lincoln Hospital, but when she arrived there, she was \ntold that her son was not there.  She frantically called the school, worried that the \nambulance might have been in an accident, and she was told that her son had actually \nbeen taken to St. Barnabas Hospital. It took her a long time to get to the correct hospital \nbecause she did not have money for a cab and had to take the bus to both hospitals. She \nhad to call a friend from Lincoln Hospital for directions because she did not know where \nSt. Barnabas Hospital was or which bus to take to get there. \n96.  At St. Barnabas, she found J.H. in a psychiatric ward with six adults. He \nhad been changed out of his clothes and into hospital-issued pajamas: a pajama shirt, \npajama pants, and slipper socks. A person from the school was there with him. \n97.  According to hospital records, the aide told emergency room staff that \nJ.H. had been \"out of control at school.  They didn't know what to do.\"  The same \nrecords state that J.H. was \"playful\" and \"smiling\" at the hospital. \n98.  After spending about an hour at the hospital, Ms. H. was permitted to \nbring J.H. home. Ms. H. was in a rush to leave the hospital because she was worried \nabout leaving in time to pick up T.H. from school. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 2 of 19\n99.  On the next school day, Ms. H. accompanied J.H. to school and gave the \nschool staff the necessary paperwork from the hospital.  Again, she was given no written \nincident report regarding what had happened on December 12. She was told only that \nJ.H. had not been listening, ran out of the classroom, and hit students and teachers. \n100.  On December 14, 2012, the school again called Ms. H and told her that \nthey had called an ambulance for J. H.  When she got to the school, she found J.H. \noutside, strapped down to a stretcher wearing only at-shirt on the cold December day. \nAll of the staff members were wearing coats but J .H. was strapped to the stretcher crying \nwithout any coat or sweater. Ms. H. gave J .H. her coat. She became very upset at the \nschool staff and began crying herself. As she prepared to ride in the ambulance with J .H. \nto the hospital, she pulled T.H. out of school again because she was worried that she \nwould not be able to return in time to pick him up from school. T.H. was at lunch at that \ntime, so they brought his lunch with them and also brought J.H. 's lunch to the \nambulance. Ms. H., J.H., and T.H. all rode together in the ambulance to Lincoln \nHospital. \n101.  According to hospital notes, J .H. was sent to the hospital because he had \nhit and kicked his teacher after she drew on his paper when he did not want her to. He \ntold the hospital staff that his teacher does not like him and that she makes him angry a \nlot.  The notes also indicate that J.H. was \"well-behaved and easily redirected by \nprompts from his mother.\" \n102.  After Ms. H., J.H., and T.H. spent an hour or two in the \nemergency room, she was given the signed clearance form she needed to give to the \nschool and was permitted to take J.H. home. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 3 of 19\n103.  On the next school day, Ms. H. brought J.H. to school and gave the \nschool the form from the hospital.  She was given no written incident report regarding \nwhat had happened on December 14 and was told nothing more than the school's staff \nhad been unable to calm him down after he became upset over something his teacher \ndid. \n104.  School staff stopped calling EMS for J.H. after an attorney began \nadvocating on Ms. H. and J.H.'s behalf in late December 2012.The school instead \nrequired Ms. H. to pick J .H. up early almost every day for about a month. School staff \nthen required J.H. to attend school on a part-time schedule and J.H. only attended school \nuntilll :00 a.m. for the rest of the 2012-2013 school year. School staff also prohibited \nhim from attending field trips unless accompanied by Ms. H. \n105.  Ms. H. lost her job as a night guard at a homeless shelter. Ms. H. suffered \npoor work performance as a result of the nearly daily calls from school officials \nregarding J.H.'s behavior. Unable to get adequate sleep during the morning hours, she \nrepeatedly was too tired to stay awake at work. She then went on unemployment, went \ninto arrears with her rent and currently is facing eviction She then got a job as a \ncustomer service representative in August 2013 but had to leave the job a month later \npartly due to multiple appointments she has to attend to regarding the eviction \nproceedings. She has also received bills from the hospitals and from EMS, which she \nhas no way to pay. \n106.  Ms. H. consented to have J.H. evaluated by the NYCDOE for special \neducation services in November 2012. The NYCDOE administered a psychological and \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 4 of 19\nan educational evaluation for J.H. but never conducted a psychiatric evaluation as part of \ntheir initial evaluation. \n107.  Upon information and belief, while awaiting the completion of the \nspecial education evaluation process, school officials did not provide J.H. with any \nformal services or accommodations to address J.H. 's behaviors. \n108.  On January 18, 2013, an IEP meeting was held at the school and J.H. was \nfound to be eligible for special education services and J.H. was given a classification of \nemotional disturbance. For the 2013-2014 school year, J.H. is enrolled in a 12:1:1 \nspecial class program at Grant A venue Elementary School. \n109.  On or about November 1, 2013, school officials from Grant Avenue \nElementary School called Ms. H. and advised her that J.H. was acting out and Ms. H. \nneeded to go to the school right away. Ms. H. was also told that J.H. was in the guidance \ncounselor's office. \n110.  Ms. H. proceeded to the school right after the phone call. Upon arriving \nat the school, Ms. H. proceeded to the guidance counselor's office where she found her \nson J.H. being physically held by the school safety agent. Ms. H. asked the school safety \nagent to let J.H. go and she picked him up. Ms. H. spoke to the school safety agent who \nadvised her that J.H. would be sent to the emergency room. Ms. H. asked school staff \nwhy EMS was called if the school officials knew she was on her way to the school. The \nschool safety agent interjected and stated that it was her decision to call EMS. \n111.  When EMS arrived, Ms. H. asked the EMT's if they had to take J.H. and \nshe was told J.H. had to go to the hospital. Ms. H. then accompanied J.H. to Lincoln \nHospital along with T.H., whom she removed from school early again. Once at the \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 5 of 19\nhospital, the nurse gave Ms. H.  a document to sign to consent to the evaluation of J.H .. \nMs. H. declined to sign it because she did not believe J.H. needed an evaluation at that \ntime and left the hospital with her sons. \n112.  J.H. received an in-school suspension as a result of this incident but \nreturned to school on the next school day. Ms. H. never received any documents related \nto the incident on November 1, 2013. \n113.  As a result of the school's practice of repeatedly having J.H. removed by \nEMS, J.H. is no longer eager to go to school, is afraid of and dislikes the police, and is \nafraid of going to the hospital. \nW.P. \n114.  W.P. is five years old and resides in Manhattan with his parents, K.P. and \nG.P. and his newborn brother.  Since September 9, 2013, he has attended kindergarten at \nNEST+M School (''NEST\") in Manhattan. W.P. has or is perceived by NYDOE as \nhaving a disability. \n115.  On Friday, September 20, 2013, K.P. received a telephone call from the \nassistant principal for the Lower School.  Without providing any details or explanation, \nthe assistant principal informed K.P. that the school was unable to control W.P.'s \nbehavior and that they had called 911 to transport W.P. to the emergency room. K.P., \nwho works in midtown Manhattan and at the time was nine months pregnant, was told \nshe had 10-20 minutes to get to the school before EMS would take W.P. to the hospital. \nK.P. pleaded with the school to wait for her arrival before having W.P. removed. The \nschool insisted they would not wait. \n116.  K.P. alerted her husband, G.P., to the situation, and G.P. was able to \nreach the school before W.P. had been taken to the hospital.  Upon G.P.'s arrival at \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 6 of 19\nNEST, he found W.P. sitting calmly and quietly in the main school office with his feet \nup on a chair. Five police officers stood at the entrance to the office.  G.P. immediately \nasked the police officers to call off the request for EMS. \n117.  G .P. met with the assistant principal and the principal in the principal's \noffice to discuss the incident.  G.P. was informed that W.P. had been \"running around \nand almost broke a table,\" and was like a \"mini Hulk.\"  W.P.'s teacher and the school's \nguidance counselor subsequently joined the conversation in the principal's office. The \nschool representatives explained to G.P. that W.P. had been pulled out of class and was \nunable to \"calm down.\" The assistant principal informed G.P. that in such situations, \nwhen there is allegedly concern for the child's safety or the safety of others, it is the \nschool's policy to call EMS.  The assistant principal described the policy in front of the \nprincipal, who nodded in agreement.  G.P. has since had at least one additional \nconversation in which this policy was reiterated by other school representatives. At \ntimes, school officials also stated that it is their policy to call the security guard, who in \nturn has been trained to call EMS. \n118.  Despite W .P. 's calm demeanor, G .P. decided to take W .P. home for the \nrest of the day. G.P. was able to coax an explanation from W.P. for his behavior, which \nevidently resulted from a simple disagreement with another student on the playground \nwho had refused to return a ball. \n119.  Two weeks later, in the midst of K.P. 's giving birth to W .P. 's brother by \ncaesarian section, G.P. received a message that the school had again called EMS to \nremove W.P. from school.  After the birth of their new son, G.P. called the school and \nspoke to a police officer who was present at the school.  At this point, G .P. was told that \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 7 of 19\nW.P. was sitting calmly in the office, and G.P. informed the police officer again that he \ndid not want W.P. to be removed by EMS.  G.P. informed both the police officer and the \nassistant principal that his mother-in-law would arrive shortly at the school, since he was \nat the hospital with his wife, who had just given birth. \n120.  K.P. 'smother arrived at NEST within twenty minutes, but W.P. had \nnonetheless already been taken to the Beth Israel emergency room, apparently by police \nofficers.  K.P.'s mother rushed to the hospital and reached W.P. before he had been \nformally admitted. When she found him, W.P. was sitting quietly with two police \nofficers and a paraprofessional from NEST who had accompanied him to the hospital. \n121.  After the October 3 incident, K.P. 's mother volunteered to spend time at \nNEST with W.P. for a few days in the hope that the school would avoid repeating such \ndrastic measures. \n122.  On October 16, 2013, NEST's guidance counselor again called G.P. to \ninform him that the school had once again called EMS to remove W.P.  G.P. contacted \nK.P., who rushed to the school with her two-week-old son. Upon her arrival, K.P. found \nW.P. calmly sitting at a table with the principal and three police officers in the office. \n123.  K.P. requested immediately that the police officers call off the request for \nEMS; however, the ambulance arrived at the school nonetheless. K.P. insisted that her \ncalm child need not be transported to the hospital and signed a release form at EMS' \nrequest.  At K.P. 's suggestion, the principal allowed W .P. , who had been sitting calmly, \nto rejoin his class. \n124.  Despite multiple meetings with NEST administrators since the beginning \nof the school year about how to address W .P. 's behavioral issues, the school initiated no \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 8 of 19\nformal evaluation process until K.P. and G .P. submitted a formal written request for an \nIEP process on October 14, 2013.  Only then did NEST appear to have a social worker \nassigned to work on pursuing an evaluation for W.P.  Over the course of the past two \nmonths, K.P. and G.P. have spent considerable resources on private evaluations ofW.P., \nas well as training of school staff. \n125.  NEST's excessive and reflexively dramatic response to W.P. 's behavioral \nproblems has created a situation in which K.P. and G .P. live in fear that the next phone \ncall will be notification that their frightened five-year-old son has been taken to the \nhospital by EMS or the police because he had some difficulty in the classroom.  W.P. \nhimself has expressed his worries that the police might take him away again. \nJ.R. \n126.  J.R. is a five year old first grade student currently attending Public School \n149 in Manhattan. He lives with his mother, K.J., and grandmother, L.J., in Manhattan. \nJ.R. has or is perceived by NYCDOE to have a disability. \n127.  K.J. initially enrolled J.R. in kindergarten at PS 149 in January 2013. \nPrior to attending PS 149, J.R. attended a charter school. \n128.  Soon after K.J. enrolled J.R. at PS 149, K.J. began to receive almost daily \ntelephone calls from school staff at PS 149 regarding 1. R.' s behavior. Most often, staff \nfrom PS 149 stated that J.R. was unfocused, not on task and acting up because he did not \nwant to be in school. Often, school staff requested that K.J. pick up J.R. and bring him \nhome prior to dismissal. \n129.  If school staff were unable to reach K.J. by phone, they would call K.J. 's \nmother, L.J.  On a number of occasions, K.J. and L.J. were told that if they did not come \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 9 of 19\nto pick up J.R. immediately, the school would call an ambulance to take J.R. to an \nemergency room. \n130.  On one occasion, sometime between January 2013 and April2013, \nschool staff contacted K.J. advising her that an ambulance had been called for J.R. \nbecause he was acting out. K.J. could not leave work immediately and arranged for L.J. \nto go to the school in response to the phone call. L.J. arrived at the school before the \nambulance and convinced school staff to allow J.R. to go home with her. \n131.  On April29, 2013, J.R. was involved in an incident at PS 149. He \nbecame upset after his teacher grabbed his hand during recess. He began to scream, \njump on desks and throw himself against lockers. \n132.  Staff at PS 149 called 911 and also contacted K.J. by telephone to advise \nher that they had called an ambulance for J.R.  K.J. was advised by school officials that \nJ.R. could not return to the school until he was evaluated at the hospital. Because K.J. \nwas at work, she could not go immediately to the school.  Instead, she contacted J.R.'s \nfather, H.R.  He and L.J. then both proceeded to the school. \n133.  L.J. arrived at school before H.R. and noticed that police officers and \nemergency medical technicians were all around J .R., were touching him, and had him \nsitting on the floor. L.J. asked the officers and technicians to get their hands off him. \nL.J. was then able to calm J.R. down. L.J. stated that she was going to take him home. \nSchool staff, the police officers and the emergency medical technicians all stated that \nJ.R. had to go to the hospital. They stated that once an ambulance has been called to a \nschool, the student has to go to the hospital. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 10 of 19\n134.  H.R. then arrived at the school and he accompanied J.R. to Mount Sinai \nHospital in the ambulance. L.J. had to return to work and did not accompany them to the \nhospital. \n135.  J.R. was admitted to the emergency room at Mt. Sinai at 12:45 p.m. The \ntreating physician noted that officials at PS 149 had called EMS because they could not \ncontrol his behavior and felt he needed an evaluation. \n136.  When J.R. met with the doctor, he was sitting calmly and said he was no \nlonger angry. He said that when he is very upset, he throws tantrums. He said he did not \nwant to hurt himself or anyone else. The doctors diagnosed J.R. with disruptive behavior \ndisorder and discharged him at 2:51p.m. His discharge plan stated that he could return \nto normal daily activities and his parents were given referrals for him to outpatient \nmental health services. \n13 7.  After this incident, K.J. wanted to find outpatient psychiatric services for \nJ.R., but medical insurance issues prevented her from arranging an initial intake \nappointment for two months. Eventually, K.J. secured an initial appointment with a \npsychiatrist. However K.J. was concerned that the doctor immediately wanted to \nprescribe medication for J.R. without considering other options and decided to seek \ntreatment elsewhere. \n138.  As a result of the incident on April29, 2013, PS 149 issued an out of \nschool suspension to J.R.  He was sent toPS 144 in Manhattan for his suspension.  · \n139.  On May 9, 2013, school staff from PS 144 contacted K.J. and advised \nher that J.R. was having an outburst. K.J. advised them that L.J. was going to the school \nto pick up J .R. Soon thereafter school officials then called back and stated that J .R. was \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 11 of 19\nbeing transported to the hospital.  K.J. asked if they could delay sending J.R. to the \nhospital until she arrived there because she was unable to leave work immediately and \nthe school official said no. L.J. arrived at PS 144 just as the emergency medical \ntechnicians were escorting J.R. out of the building. L.J. did not attempt to request that \nJ.R. be allowed to go home with her because she felt the EMT's and the police would \nnot allow her. \n140.  J.R. was admitted to the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital \nat 1:35 p.m. According to hospital records, he was calm, appeared well and was in no \ndistress. The records state that J.R. got in trouble at school for running in the hall with \nanother boy and was forced to sit at the \"bad\" table in the cafeteria. J.R. then got in \ntrouble for standing up when he was not supposed to and was sent to the principal's \noffice where he became angrier and acted out by hitting staff, yelling kicking, and trying \nto run away.  The records also state that J.R. told an emergency medical technician that \nhe wanted to stab her.  According to his grandmother, J.R. said this in response to the \nEMT stating that J. R. was a \"bad kid.\" \n141.  J .R. was discharged at 3:41p.m., a little over two hours after he was \nadmitted. The discharge documents noted that he was diagnosed with disruptive \nbehavior disorder, not otherwise specified, and was cleared to return to normal activities. \n142.  On May 15, 2013, after J.R. had completed his suspension at PS 144 and \nhad returned to PS 149, K.J. was advised by staff at PS 149 that J .R. had been involved \nin another incident. She was told that J. R. had climbed on a cabinet during an outburst. \nThe school informed her that J.R. would be sent to the hospital. K.J. contacted her \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 12 of 19\nbrother S.J. and he was able to go toPS 149 right away. K.J. asked school officials to \nrelease J.R. to S.J., but school officials denied K.J. 's request. \n143.  K.J. left work early in order to respond to the situation at PS 149. When \nshe arrived at PS 149, K.J. observed EMS technicians and police officers with her son in \naddition to school staff. The EMS technicians, the police officers and school staff all \ntold K.J. that J.R. had no other option than to go to the hospital. K.J. did not attempt to \nask if she could take her son home because the police, school staff, and EMT's all made \nit clear on this occasion and on prior occasions that he had to be transported to the \nhospital. \n144.  EMS again transported J.R. to the emergency department at Mount Sinai \nwhere he arrived at 4:20p.m.  The treating physician noted that J.R. was calm and \ncooperative during his interview. J.R. denied being depressed, suicidal or homicidal. J.R. \nwas unable to explain why he was aggressive at school but \"nodded\" in agreement that \nhe did not want to be aggressive again. \n145.  The treating physician at Mount Sinai administered a violence risk \nassessment to J.R. and determined there was a low risk of violence. K.J. was advised to \nfollow up with outpatient child psychiatry for J.R. 's disruptive behavior disorder. J.R. \nwas discharged at 7:51 p.m. \n146.  In or about the middle of May 2013, PS 149 fmally initiated an \nevaluation of J.R. to determine his eligibility for special education services. On June 21, \n2013, an IEP team met and determined that J.R. was eligible for special education \nservices.  J .R. was assigned a classification of emotional disturbance.  He has been \nassigned to a special class with a small student to staff ratio, but the school has \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 13 of 19\ncontinued to respond inappropriately to J.R. 's behavioral problems. As recently as \nNovember 18,2013, K.J. was again told that if she did not pick up J.R. as soon as \npossible, PS 149 would call for an ambulance to transport J.R. to an emergency room, \n147.  K.J. often receives phone calls from PS 149 at work regarding J.R.'s \nbehavior issues. The calls have caused K.J. to experience significant stress, anxiety and \ndepression which affected her work performance. K.J. was suspended by her employer \nin May 2013 for poor work performance and has had to change her work schedule \nrepeatedly to be able to respond to the constant calls from PS 149. \nJ.M. \n148.  Plaintiff J.M.  is fifteen  years  old and  is  in the tenth grade at  Astor \nCollegiate Academy in the Bronx.  He lives with his mother, C.J., in the Bronx. He was \npreviously enrolled at Lehman High School (\"Lehman\") from the beginning of ninth \ngrade through March 2013. \n149.  J.M. was diagnosed with ADHD when he was five.  In July 2012, his \ndiagnosis was changed to Asperger's Syndrome.  J.M. has or is perceived to have by \nNYCDOE a disability. \n150.  When J.M. was in middle school at I.S. 206 in the Bronx, an IEP was \ndeveloped for him.  The IEP included a crisis management paraprofessional, testing \naccommodations,  group  counseling,  and  a  Behavior  Intervention  Plan.  The  BIP \nincluded a provision permitting J.M. to call his mother during the day if he was feeling \nanxious as a last resort. \n151.  In June 2012,  Ms.  J.  met with Mr.  Pagan,  a  guidance  counselor,  at \nLehman to  select classes  and to  fill  out paperwork  regarding  J.M.'s  high  school \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 14 of 19\nadmission.  Mr. Pagan asked Ms. J. if J.M. had an IEP, and Ms. J. responded that he did. \nMs. J. asked Mr. Pagan if he was going to note this and he said he would, but he did not \ndo so in Ms. J. 's presence. \n152.  In  July  2012  at  freshman  orientation,  before  J.M.  began  attending \nLehman, Ms. J. met Thomasina Brown, who she later found out was J .M. 's guidance \ncounselor, and Mr. Carucci, the assistant principal for the Anne Hutchinson Academy at \nLehman.  Ms.  J. had concerns  about Lehman, so  she  took  this opportunity to  ask \nquestions of both of them.  Mr. Carucci explained the different academies at Lehman. \nMs.  Brown  answered  questions  about  the  school's  orientation  presentation.  J. M. 's \ndisability and the IEP were not discussed. \n153.  On J.M.'s first day at Lehman in September 2012, Ms. J. saw Ms. Brown \nagain.  She approached  Ms.  Brown and  asked to  meet with all of J .M. 's teachers \nregarding his IEP.  During the rest of September, Ms. J. tried to reach Ms. Brown many \ntimes, but the phones at the school were not working properly so she was unable to \nreach her or leave a message. \n154.  On September 28, 2012, Ms. J. was at Lehman for a Parent Association \nExecutive Board meeting in her capacity as Vice President of the Parent Association. \nWhile she was at the school, she went to say hello to Ms. Brown and on the way, she ran \ninto Ms. Brown and Mr. Tirado, one of the deans for the Ann Hutchinson Academy. \nThey told her that they were glad that she \"caught them in the hallway\" and asked her if \nanyone had  called her about J.M.  They told her that J.M.  had  used inappropriate \nlanguage with a girl in the lunchroom.  As a result, they pulled her into a conference \nroom to an unplanned meeting with Ms. J. and Ms. Brown; Mr. Tirado; Mr. Carruci; Ms. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 15 of 19\nCabrejos,  the  Director  of Student  Services;  and  Ms.  Cember,  the  Director of the \ncommittee on Special Education. \n155.  At the meeting it became clear to Ms.  J.  that despite its being three \nweeks into the school year and even though she had already spoken to Ms. Brown twice \nabout J.M., no one at the meeting was familiar with J.M.'s IEP.  Each administrator \nseemed to be looking at the IEP for the first time.  Ms. Brown admitted that she had not \npreviously read the IEP. \n156.  As they began to flip through the IEP, Ms. Brown said that the school had \nnever provided group counseling, which is one of the support services provided in J.M.'s \nIEP. Ms. Cember suggested that the testing accommodation in J.M.'s IEP be removed \nand his disability classification be changed. Ms. Cember asked for Ms. ! .' s permission to \nchange J.M.'s IEP, but Ms. J. told them she was not interested in changes to the IEP \nbefore it had even been followed by school staff.  Rather, she expected them to first \ncomply with the IEP. \n157.  On November 9, 2012, Ms. J. found out from J.M. that he had attended \nhis first group counseling session of the school year.  Ms. J. never received any notice \nfrom the school that the group counseling sessions had finally begun. \n158.  On November 13, 2012, J.M. took a geometry test without the testing \naccommodations required by his IEP.  He felt he might have done poorly. Out of \nfrustration, he ran a pen down his forearm.  He did not cut or scratch himself, but after \nthis incident Ms. J. received a call from Principal Rose Lobianco, who told her that she \nhad the opportunity to pick J.M. up from school as a \"courtesy\" and if she did not the \nschool would call EMS to have him taken to a hospital. Ms. J. left to  pick up J.M. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 16 of 19\nimmediately. She received a total of five phone calls from Ms. Brown and Principal \nLobianco as she was on her way to the school. They told her that J.M. hurt his arm. Ms. \nJ.  thought he needed to go to  the doctor and called J.M.'s pediatrician to make an \nappointment while she was in the cab; she cancelled it later when she was told by the \nprincipal that the school nurse said J.M. 's arm was fine. She repeatedly asked to talk to \nJ.M.  and  she was eventually permitted to  speak to J.M., who was in the guidance \ncounselor's office, where the nurse had checked his arm. When Ms. J. got to the school, \nhe was still in the guidance counselor's office and Ms. J. took him home. Ms. Cabrejo \nwanted to speak with Ms. J. and Ms. J. declined to speak to her. Ms. J. took J.M. home \nand he stayed home from school the next day so he could go to the psychiatrist. J.M. \nexplained to the psychiatrist that the reason for the incident was that he was frustrated \nand thought he did not do well on his test. \n159.  After J.M. returned to school on November 15, Ms. Cabrejo and Dean \nTirado repeatedly asked Ms. J. to provide a doctor's note saying that it was okay for \nJ.M. to return to school.  Ms. J. declined to provide such a letter because she understood \nthat the school had no right to require her to do so. \n160.  After she declined to provide a letter to the school, the staff at Lehman \nretaliated by reporting to the City Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\") that \nshe was being neglectful of J.M.  The ACS investigator, Mr. Massaquoi, initially told \nher that staff at Lehman had accused her of neglecting J.M. because of scratches on his \narm.  Later, Mr. Massaquoi told her the school was also accusing her of neglect because \nshe was unwilling to reopen his IEP.  ACS's investigation found the report of neglect to \nbe unfounded and the case was closed. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 17 of 19\n161.  Throughout the month of December, Ms. J. was repeatedly contacted by \nMs. Cember, who continually asked Ms. J. to re-open J.M. 's IEP.  Ms. J. continued to \nrefuse,  stating  that  she  expected  the  school  to  comply  with  the  IEP  before  any \nconsideration was given to modifying it. \n162.  Because Ms. J. and J.M. were unhappy with Lehman, in December Ms. J. \nbegan the process of seeking a medical transfer to another school for J.M.'s sophomore \nyear. \n163.  On January 9, 2013, Ms. J. was at the school regarding paperwork for the \ntransfer.  She had a disagreement Ms. Cabrejos, who was insisting on copies of all ofthe \npaperwork Ms. J. had to submit to the DOE's Office of Student Enrollment before she \nwould sign off on the transfer application.  Before Ms. J. left the school, she told J.M. \nthat school was giving her a hard time about the transfer. \n164.  J.M. was upset about the difficulty his mother was having regarding the \ntransfer application and, at around approximately 12:00 p.m., his English teacher noticed \nhe was agitated in class. He asked to call his mother, but his teacher refused.  Instead, \nshe asked him to write down why he was feeling anxious.  He wrote down his feelings \nand as he was putting them away in his binder, his teacher demanded that he give her \nwhat he had written. \n165.  J.M. had written, \"Honestly I feel like something is bothering me and I \ndon't know what, and it's making me get hype in a crazy way, and it's in a bad way.  I \nget something bothering me and it just gets me to the point I feel like I want to scream. \nUnable to work because of what's happening.\" \n166.  After English class, J.M. was able to call his mother from the main office \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 18 of 19\nbefore going to lunch and he then felt better.  J.M. continued throughout the rest of his \nschool day without incident, but at the end of gym class, the last class of the day, Mr. \nCarruci and Ms. Brown came and escorted him to the principal's office. \n167.  At 3:30, Ms. J. got a phone call from the principal, who told that the \nschool had called EMS and that J.M. was going to be taken to the emergency room.  She \nreceived no \"courtesy call\" this time.  She asked why J.M. was being taken to the \nhospital and the principal told her she would find out when she got to the school.  While \non the way to the school, Ms. J. called back to see if the ambulance left yet, and she \nasked to speak to an EMS worker. She spoke to the EMT and he said that the ambulance \nhad  not  left  the  school  yet.  She asked  them  to  take  J.M.  to  Montefiore because \nMontefiore accepts her insurance and the EMS worker agreed. He said he would explain \nwhat happened when she got there. Ms. J. was not permitted to talk to J.M. \n168.  Ms. J. arrived at the school around 3:50.  She asked if she could bring \nJ .M. to the psychiatrist and she was told she could not.  In response to her question about \nwhy EMS had been called, the EMS worker showed her a written statement from J.M.'s \nEnglish teacher in which she reported his agitation in her class and in which she claimed \nthat, \"Ta wards the end of the period, a girl started screaming in the hallway.  [J .M.] \nturned abruptly to face the door, pointed his fingers toward the door as if his hand was \n[sic] a gun and then shouted the sounds of a shooting gun.\" J.M. completely denies this. \nHe has no recollection of anything even similar to this teacher's account.  After his \nEnglish class, J .M. was permitted to continue with the rest of his school day without any \nintervention from the school's administrators or teachers.  They did not take him to the \noffice or call EMS until two periods after English, until it was almost time for dismissal. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-1   Filed 12/11/13   Page 19 of 19\n169.  EMS transported J.M.  to  Montefiore Hospital accompanied by Ms.  J. \nAccording to an EMS worker, J.M.'s \"chief complaint\" was \"I am fine.\"  The EMS \nworker noted that through the transport to the hospital, JM was  observed to be \"in \nposition of comfort w/o change  in status  or further incident[].\"  The \"presumptive \ndiagnosis\" noted by the EMS worker was \"behavioral eval for threatening remarks.\" \n170.  In the emergency room J.M. was evaluated by a nurse, a medical doctor \nand a psychiatrist.  Each evaluation notes that J.M. was alert, cooperative and calm.  JM \nwas discharged eight minutes after meeting with the emergency room psychiatrist.  The \npsychiatrist noted that J.M. had no current suicidal or homicidal ideation, plan or intent, \nthat he was soft spoken, and that he was not dangerous.  The psychiatrist detailed that \nduring the interview the \"patient was calm and cooperative and responsive [illegible].\" \n171.  J.M. received no treatment from the hospital. J.M. was released without \nmedication prescription and was simply advised to follow up with his own psychiatrist \nand was permitted to return to school the following day. \n172.  Ms. J. has not received a bill from the emergency room, but her insurance \nwas billed. \n173.  In a mediation on March 21, 2013 about J.M's IEP, it was agreed that \nJ.M. would transfer out of Lehman. On April 4, Ms. J. went to the Student Enrollment \nOffice and found out he was transferring to Astor Collegiate Academy.  He began \nattending Astor on April 8, 2013. \n174.  As part of the mediation, it was agreed that the school would develop a \nnew IEP for J.M. for the 2013-2014 school year. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 1 of 18\nN.R. \n175.  N.R. is a six-year-old student who attends P.S. 19 in Queens.  He \npreviously attended P.S. 165, which is also in Queens. He resides with his mother, Y.P., \nin Queens. N.R. has or is perceived to have by NYCDOE a disability. \n176.  N.R. first enrolled at P.S 165 as a pre-kindergarten student during the \n2011-2012 school year. In September 2012, N .R. entered kindergarten at the school. \n177.  At the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year, Y.P asked P.S 165 to \nevaluate N.R. for possible special education supports and services. She had made similar \nrequests the year before, including a request for counseling in or about March of2012 \nwhen N.R. attended pre-kindergarten at the school. \n178.  On October 4, 2012, Y.P. received a telephone call from the school \ninforming her that N .R. was misbehaving by climbing under the table, jumping and \nthrowing things and walking away. The school told her that the police had been called \nand threatened to have N.R. taken to the hospital.  Y.P. asked school officials not to \nhave N .R. taken to the hospital and to wait for her to get to the school from work, but \nthey refused.  Y.P. managed to contact her mother and asked her to go to the school to \npick up N.R. \n179.  When Y.P's mother arrived at the school, N.R. was surrounded by police \nofficers and school personnel and was sitting calmly. Nonetheless, the principal would \nnot allow N.R. 's grandmother to take him home.  Y.P. got on the phone with the school \nand demanded that N.R. be turned over to her mother. The school refused and handed \nthe telephone over to the police.  Only after Y.P. got on the phone with the police and \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 2 of 18\ncomplained strenuously, did they release N.R. to his grandmother.  However, they \nthreatened to arrest N.R. if he misbehaved in the future. \n180.  Following this incident with the school, N.R. became fearful when he \nsaw police, heard sirens, or saw police cars or ambulances.  He told his mother that he \ndid not want to go to school because people at his school told him that they were going \nto call the police and the ambulance workers to come to get him. \n181.  On or about October 10 , the school contacted Y .P. and told her that her \nson was again misbehaving by running and jumping around, going under the table, and \nhitting others. She was told to pick up N.R., so she left work to go to the school.  When \nY.P got there, she was told by school staff, Ms. Bonagura and Ms. Legions that N.R. \ncould not return to school until he was psychiatrically evaluated and cleared by a doctor. \nThey suggested that Y.P. take N.R. to Long Island Jewish Hospital (LIJH) for evaluation \nand told her that there must be something psychiatrically or neurologically wrong with \nN.R. \n182.  Because Y.P. could not bring her son for an evaluation until October, 12, \n20 12, and because the school would not permit him to return without medical clearance, \nhe could not attend school for two days, October 11 and 12. \n183.  On October 12, Y.P. took N.R. to Long Island Jewish Hospital (\"LIJH\") \nin order to comply with the school's directive that he be evaluated and receive clearance \nbefore returning to school after the purported incident on October 10.  Doctors and other \nhospital staff met with N.R., spoke to his mother and contacted the school. Y.P. \nexplained that the behavior reported by the school was not consistent with his behavior \nat home. Hospital staff noted that NR was \"cheerful, cooperative though restless during \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 3 of 18\ninterview\" and found that NR \"does not present as an imminent risk of hurting self or \nothers.\" LIJH released N.R. and sent him home with his mother. They provided Y.P. \nwith a referral for outpatient counseling for N.R. which she followed up on. \n184.  On October 22, the school again called Y .P. at work and told her that \nEMS was at the school to take N.R. to the hospital. \n185.  Y.P. begged the school not to send her son to the hospital via EMS and \nasked school staff to wait for her to come and pick up her son.  She was told by the \nprincipal and other members of staff that the school was in the business of teaching, not \ntaking care of children and that they would not wait. \n186.  Y.P. contacted her mother and asked her to go to the school to be with \nN.R. N.R.'s grandmother met him at the school and accompanied him to the hospital \nwith EMS. Although N.R. was calm when his grandmother arrived, the principal and \nassistant principal would not let her take N.R. home and insisted that EMS take him to \nthe hospital. EMS workers removed N.R. against the wishes of his mother and \ngrandmother. \n187.  Y.P.left work and went to LIJH to meet her mother and N.R. at the \nhospital as soon as she could. \n188.  At the hospital, N.R. was seen by numerous hospital personnel, including \ndoctors and social workers. Hospital staff spoke to N.R., who was \"calm and \ncooperative,\" and called the school to find out why he had been sent by them.  They \nevaluated his condition and cleared him for release to his mother. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 4 of 18\n189.  At no time prior to the events of October 2012 did the NYCDOE convene \nan IEP meeting or develop a Behavior Intervention Plan for N.R. nor, upon information \nand belief, did NYCDOE even complete a written evaluation ofN.R. \n190.  In February 2013, an IEP review meeting took place at Y.P's request and \na recommendation was made for a 12:1:1 program in a community school for N.R. The \nIEP also mandated a one-to-one paraprofessional, counseling, speech and occupational \ntherapy services.  Thereafter, Y. P. enrolled N.R. at P.S 19 and he began attending a \n12:1:1 program at the school. \n191.  P.S. 19 failed to provide N.R. with a one-on-one paraprofessional and all \nofhis mandated supports and services, despite Y.P's requests that the school do so. Staff \nat the school stated that they lacked resources and indicated that they would send her son \nto the ER if he misbehaved.  In addition, shortly after N.R. arrived at P.S. 19, school \nofficials informed Y.P. that she would have to pick her son up from school each day at \n11:00 a.m.  Fearing that the school would resort to inappropriate EMS intervention \nwhich would further traumatize her son, Y .P complied with this demand and collected \nher son early each day. \n192.  The shortened school day caused Y .P. great hardship, forcing her to \nadjust her schedule at work and to work later hours in order to keep her job. \n193.  Toward the end ofthe school year, Y.P met with school officials and \nagain asked that NR receive all of his mandated IEP supports and services and that the \nschool allow him to attend full-time as do all of the other children at the school. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 5 of 18\n194.  N.R. continues to be enrolled at P.S. 19.  N.R. and Y.P fear that at any \nmoment the defendants may resort to inappropriate use of EMS to address N.R. 's special \nneeds and cause N.R to again be unnecessarily and unlawfully removed to the hospital. \nD.E. \n195.  D.E. is a seven-year-old boy who was enrolled as a kindergarten student \nat P .S. K255 in Brooklyn for the 2011-2012 school year. He had just turned five on \nSeptember 6, 2011. It was his first year at P.S. K255. \n196.  D.E. is a special education student with an IEP.  D.E. has been diagnosed \nwith an autism spectrum disorder (\" ASD\").  A Behavior Intervention Plan (\"BIP\") had \nbeen developed and established for DE in conjunction with his IEP. For the 2009-2010 \nand 2010-2011 school years, DE attended a special education pre-school at P.S. M226. \nD.E. has or is perceived to have by NYCDOE a disability. \n197.  Though D.E. progressed remarkably well in terms of academic \nachievement and functional performance at P.S. M226, he exhibited social and \nbehavioral deficits commonly associated with ASD. D.E. has significant difficulty with \ntransitions, and becomes frustrated easily. D.E. 's frustration often manifests in the form \nof tantrums, which are common among children with ASD. This information was well \nknown to NYCDOE, and was clearly discussed in his IEP. At P.S. M226, whenever \nD.E. had a tantrum, school personnel responded appropriately and helped him to calm \ndown, such that he would remain in school with his classmates. \n198.  On June 7, 2011, following an IEP meeting, DOE offered D.E. a \nplacement in a 12:1:1 kindergarten classroom at P.S. K255. D.E.'s mother, M.E., \ncomplied with this recommendation. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 6 of 18\n199.  On September 22, 2011, after D .E. had been in kindergarten for about \ntwo weeks, he had tantrum at school.  P.S. K255 personnel notified Ms. E., and asked \nher to come to the school. When Ms. E. arrived, she spoke with school personnel, sat in \nclass with D.E., and then took him home. \n200.  On September 27, 2011, D.E. had another tantrum at school. D.E. showed \nno signs of injury. Nevertheless, P.S. K255 personnel summoned EMS and police, and \nthen notified Ms. E. When Ms. E arrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and \npolice in the school vestibule. D.E. was no longer having a tantrum, but a security guard \nwas pinning him to the ground. \n201.  Ms. E rushed to comfort her terrified son, and asked if she could take \nD.E. home, but EMS told Ms. E that D.E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney \nIsland Hospital psychiatric ward. EMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. Erode in the \nambulance with D.E. and EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n202.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E. were sent \nthrough the aduit emergency room to triage. Afterward, they were told to wait for a \npediatrician for a physical examination. The pediatrician only assessed D.E. and did not \ntreat him or prescribe medication. \n203.  D.E. and Ms. E. were then told to wait for a psychiatrist for a psychiatric \nconsultation. The psychiatrist only assessed D.E. and did not treat him or prescribe \nmedication. \n204.  D.E. was then allowed to proceed to discharge on the basis that he did not \nrequire emergency services. The ordeal lasted approximately six hours, in which D.E. \nand Ms. E. were not allowed to leave and were neither provided food nor any \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 7 of 18\nopportunity to get food. During that time, D.E. was hungry, tired, anxious, confused, and \ndesperate to leave the hospital. \n205.  On October 6, 2011, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no signs \nof injury, but P.S. K255 personnel again summoned EMS and the police, and then \nnotified Ms. E. Ms. E called her sister, Natasha Grall, and Ms. E and Ms. Grall each \nhurried to the school. Ms. Grall arrived in fifteen minutes. When she arrived, she found \nD.E., school personnel, EMS, and police in the principal's office. D.E. was no longer \nhaving a tantrum. \n206.  Ms. Grall wanted to take D.E. home, but EMS stopped Ms. Grall and told \nher that D .E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney Island Hospital psychiatric \nward. Within ten minutes of Ms. Grall's arrival, Ms. E. arrived at the school by taxi. \nEMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. E. rode in the ambulance with D.E., Ms. Grall, \nand EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n207.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E. found \nthemselves in the same situation they had endured on September 27. First, they were \nsent through the adult emergency room to triage. Afterward, they were told to wait for a \npediatrician for a physical examination. The pediatrician only assessed D .E. and did not \ntreat him or prescribe medication. D.E. and Ms. E. were then told to wait for a \npsychiatrist for a psychiatric consultation. The psychiatrist only assessed D.E. and did \nnot treat him or prescribe medication. D.E. was then allowed to proceed to discharge on \nthe basis that he did not require emergency services. The ordeal lasted between four and \nsix hours, in which D.E. and Ms. E. were not allowed to leave and were neither provided \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 8 of 18\nfood nor any opportunity to get food. During that time, D.E. was just as hungry, tired, \nanxious, confused, and desperate to leave the hospital as he had been on September 27. \n208.  On October 12, 2011, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no signs \nof injury. P.S. K255 personnel again summoned EMS and police, and then notified Ms. \nE. When Ms. E arrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and police in a \nclassroom. DE was sitting under a table and was no longer having a tantrum, but he was \ncrying and saying that he was scared of going to jail. Ms. E. asked if she could take D.E. \nhome, but EMS told Ms. E that D.E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney Island \nHospital psychiatric ward. EMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. E. rode in the \nambulance with D.E. and EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n209.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E found \nthemselves in the same situation they had endured twice before. After triage, a physical \nexamination by a pediatrician, and a psychiatric consultation by a psychiatrist, D.E. was \nallowed to proceed to discharge on the basis that he did not require emergency services. \nThe ordeal again lasted between four and six hours without breaks or food. During that \ntime, D.E. was just as hungry, tired, anxious, confused, and desperate to leave the \nhospital as he had been on prior occasions. \n210.  While at Coney Island Hospital on October 12, a nurse referred Ms. E. to \na pediatric psychology walk-in clinic at Kings County Hospital Center. Ms. E. visited \nthe walk-in clinic the next day, October 13, but clinic staff told her to return the \nfollowing day, October 14. Ms. E. did so, and the walk-in clinic referred her to the \nDevelopmental Evaluation Clinic (\"DEC\"). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 9 of 18\n·211.  On October 14, 2011, Ms. E. met with a social worker at DEC for intake \nand to set up appointments for D.E. to be evaluated. The evaluations, including \npsychological and neurological evaluations, were scheduled to take place in late October \nand early November. Soon thereafter, Ms. E. notified P.S. K.255 that D.E. was being \nindependently evaluated. Ms. E had made attempts to have D.E. independently \nevaluated since September 28, the day after the first EMS incident, but had been denied \nservices because of problems with her insurance. \n212.  On October 26,2011, while the DEC's independent evaluation ofD.E. \nwas ongoing, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no signs of injury. P.S. K255 \npersonnel again summoned EMS and police, and then notified Ms. E. When Ms. E. \narrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and police in the school library. Ms. \nGrall arrived separately at approximately the same time. D.E. was no longer having a \ntantrum. On this occasion, EMS told Ms. E. that she could take D.E. home. Ms. E. took \nD.E. home as permitted by EMS. \n213.  That evening, the Administration for Children's Services contacted Ms. \nE. and told her that P.S. K.255 personnel had filed an abuse and neglect report against \nher, alleging that Ms. E. had refused medical care for her son by refusing to allow EMS \nto take D.E. to Coney Island Hospital. ACS investigated the report but found it to be \nbaseless, amended the report to show it was unfounded, and legally sealed the report. \n214.  On November 9, 2011, D.E. had a tantrum at school. D.E. showed no \nsigns of injury. P.S. K255 personnel again summoned EMS and police, then notified Ms. \nE. When Ms. E arrived, she found D.E., school personnel, EMS, and police on the third \nfloor of the school. DE was no longer having a tantrum, but he was crying and saying \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 10 of 18\nthat he was scared of being in trouble. Ms. E. asked if she could take D.E. home, but \nEMS told Ms. E. that D.E. had to be taken by ambulance to the Coney Island Hospital \npsychiatric ward. EMS put D.E. in an ambulance, and Ms. E. rode in the ambulance with \nD.E. and EMS to Coney Island Hospital. \n215.  Upon arriving at Coney Island Hospital, D.E. and Ms. E. found \nthemselves in the same situation they had endured three times before. After triage, a \nphysical examination by a pediatrician, and a psychiatric consultation by a psychiatrist, \nD.E. was allowed to proceed to discharge on the basis that he did not require emergency \nservices. The ordeal again lasted between four and six hours without breaks or food. \nDuring that time, D.E. was just as hungry, tired, anxious, confused, and desperate to \nleave the hospital as he had been on prior occasions. \n216.  In response to these incidents, D.E. became more and more resistant to \ngoing to school.  Ms. E was afraid that the pattern would never stop, and that whenever \nD.E. had a tantrum, P.S. K255 might contact EMS and police and further traumatize \nhim. Ms. E. was also afraid that P.S. K255 personnel would continue filing baseless \nreports with ACS. As a result, Ms. E. began keeping D.E. home from school more often. \nIfD.E. was acting up or having a bad day, Ms. E. decided that it was not worth the risk \nthat he might tantrum, and be subjected to another EMS ordeal. Ms. E. also kept D.E. \nhome unless she could accompany him to school, or was absolutely sure that, for the \nduration of the school day, either she or her sister would be close enough to the school to \nrespond in the event that they were notified of a tantrum. \n\n.. \nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 11 of 18\n217.  On December 21, 2011, DEC professionals responsible for D.E. 's \nindependent evaluation met to discuss their findings. On January 11, 2012, DEC \nreleased D.E. 's psychological evaluation report to P.S. K255 with Ms. E.'s permission. \n218.  On February 15,2012, an IEP meeting was held at which the school \nbased Committee on Special Education (\"CSE\") proposed that D .E. attend a 6: 1: 1 class \nat a District 75 school with speech language therapy, occupational therapy, and a 1:1 \ncrisis paraprofessional. The program proposed by CSE would not be implemented until \nApril13, 2012, until which time D.E. would remain in his current, inappropriate \nprogram. Ms. E was worried that if kept in that inappropriate program, D.E. would \ncontinue to have tantrums and P.S. K225 personnel would continue to summon EMS \nand police in response. \n219.  On February 17, 2012, in order to protect D .E. from further needless \ntrauma, Ms. E withdrew her son from P.S. K255 and the public school system. Ms. E \nmoved and re-enrolled D.E. in the public school system in Manhattan in April2012. She \nwas offered a placement at P226@875 in a 6:1:1 class. Ms. E. viewed the program and \nfound it inappropriate for her son. \n220.  On or about May 4, 2012 Ms. E. filed an administrative Impartial \nHearing request under the IDEA, alleging the DOE denied D.E. his right to a free and \nappropriate education for the 2011-2012 school year for the inappropriate actions ofP.S. \n255 and for the failure of the DOE to recommend an appropriate program. Ms. E. sought \nprospective funding for a private school for children with autism at the DOE's expense \nfor the remainder ofthe 2011-2012 school year and the 2012-2013 school year. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-08777-JLC   Document 1-2   Filed 12/11/13   Page 12 of 18\n221.  On October 16, 2012, the Impartial Hearing Officer (\"IHO\") issued a \ndecision granting the request that DOE be required to pay for a private school placement \nfor D.E. for the 2012-2013 school year. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF: UNREASONABLE SEIZURE \n(Oh behalf of Plaintiffs J.H., J.R., N.R. and D.E. against all defendants) \n222.
