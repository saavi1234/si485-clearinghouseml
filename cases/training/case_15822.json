    "summary": "<p>According to the press release issued by the Justice Department regarding this case, the facts were as follows: On December 7, 2007, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) began an investigation into the care and treatment of mental health patients at Kings County Hospital Center (KCHC)'s Behavioral Health Service (BHS). \"The investigation uncovered systemic deficiencies that violated the constitutional and civil rights of patients with psychiatric disabilities. These violations included failure to protect patients from harm, failure to treat the psychiatric disabilities of patients, the use of drugs to sedate rather than treat patients, failure to provide adequate and individualized discharge planning and follow-up services, falsification of patient medical records, and failure to respond promptly to medical emergencies.\" These violations and others contributed to the death of at least one patient during the course of the investigation. The DOJ notified the defendants of their findings in a letter on January 30, 2009. </p><p>The parties spent a year negotiating an agreement, with the understanding that that DOJ would file a lawsuit. The suit and the settlement were then filed together. The purpose of this was to memorialize the suit and allow the court to enforce the settlement. On January 7, 2010, the U.S. filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiff sued the City of New York, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and the Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, New York under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act and the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. The plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief to improve conditions at KCHC and remedy the conduct alleged in the findings letter. The court assigned District Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto to the case. </p><p>On January 8, 2010, the court issued a consent judgment. The judgment stated that in entering into the agreement, the defendants did not admit any violation of federal law, and that the agreement was not to be used as evidence of their liability in other legal proceedings. </p><p>The agreement set out minimum remedial measures for the defendants to implement, including provisions for protection from harm, mental health care, behavioral management, medical and nursing care, quality assurance, fire and life safety, discharge and aftercare planning, KCHC hospital policies, and staff training and policy manuals and accountability. The agreement stated that the defendants would implement the necessary reforms immediately. It stipulated that the defendants appoint a Settlement Agreement Coordinator at KCHC to oversee compliance with the agreement, who would provide the DOJ with reports regarding compliance. Within 45 days of the consent judgment, the defendants would provide a plan for implementation. The agreement set out a termination date five years out, so long as the United States certified that the defendants had complied with all the provisions of the agreement for a year prior to termination. </p><p>On February 23, 2010, the defendants alerted the Court that they had created a plan. The defendants filed an amended plan on December 16, 2010. The plaintiff sent expert compliance teams to evaluate KCHC's progress. These reports were filed twice a year for the first three years. The letter of December 23, 2013 noted some areas for improvement in most of the areas covered in the agreement. After the December 23 visit, the court ordered the defendant to provide a plan to comply with correcting the noted deficiencies. A similar letter was sent in July of 2014, and the court sent another order to the defendant requesting a plan to comply. The biannual visits resumed from 2014 to 2016. On January 10, 2017, the expert compliance team filed a report stating that the defendant had maintained compliance for one year, and requested that the case be closed. Judge Matsumoto closed the case on January 17, 2017.</p><p></p>",

After an on-site review, the DOJ issued a findings letter in 2008 concluding that the facilities were deficient in several areas including protection from harm, mental health care, medical care, quality assurance, and safety. The State of New York, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and KCHC worked with the DOJ to come up with an agreement to address the issues at KCHC. The DOJ filed a complaint in 2010 and a consent judgment was filed the following day with the terms of the agreement. KCHC was monitored by compliance experts twice a year until 2016. In 2017, the compliance team alerted the court that KCHC had been in compliance for one year, and requested that the case be closed. The case was subsequently closed. ",

The report details the level of \nthe BHS’s compliance with the Consent Judgment entered in this action on January 7, 2010.   The \nreport is attached to this letter, which is being hand-delivered to the Court because of its size.  \n \n  We are pleased to inform the Court that, as described below, the BHS has achieved and \nmaintained substantial compliance with the Consent Judgment for the past year.  Accordingly, the \nparties request that the Court issue an order closing this case.1   \n \nIt has been seven years since the parties signed the Consent Judgment.  The United States’ \nsubject matter experts agree that, since then, the BHS has greatly improved the quality of care and \ntreatment and effectively addresses the critical needs of the vulnerable, seriously mentally ill \npopulation in the socio-economic catchment area served by the BHS.  In many respects, the BHS has \nsurpassed the requirements of the Consent Judgment and become a model acute care psychiatric \nfacility.  Below, we summarize the improvements in care and treatment in each section of the United \nStates’ Consent Judgment. \n \nA.      Protection From Harm \n \nWhen we commenced this action, one of the most glaring deficiencies was the BHS’ failure \nto properly identify and address patient aggression.  The frequency of violence, suicide and self-harm \n                                                 \n1 The plaintiffs’ attorneys in the related Hirschfeld action will be contemporaneously filing a letter concurring  \nin the United States’ request and seeking to have the Court close that case as well.  The Consent Judgment in \nthat action incorporates the United States’ Consent Judgment by reference but also contains additional terms.   \n \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 22   Filed 01/10/17   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 273\nwas alarming.  The BHS did not identify patients at risk of such harmful behavior or take steps to \nprevent it.  Hospital Police (discussed in section H. below) were posted on the units ostensibly to \nprevent violence, but their presence often made conditions worse.  Officers often acted with \nunnecessary physical force. \n \nToday, aggression on the units, while not completely eliminated, has greatly diminished.  \nThe BHS has developed clinical approaches to identify and address potential aggression and self- \nharm.  Hospital Police are no longer present on the units.  Instead, non-uniformed Behavioral Health \nAssociates (BHAs), who have clinical training, are responsible for addressing potential violence and \nall staff have been trained in techniques to de-escalate agitated patients.  The BHS has also developed \nan innovative peer counseling program, in which former patients at the BHS work with current \npatients.  As a result of these changes, rates of suicide attempts and self-harm have dropped \nsignificantly.  The BHS also has developed a comprehensive Quality Assurance/Performance \nImprovement system (discussed below) that readily and effectively addresses incidents, including \naggression, when they occur, to identify root causes and develop and monitor corrective action.  \n \nIn the past, the BHS used physical restraints to control and discipline patients.  As a direct \nresult of the reduction in aggression, the BHS’ use of physical restraints also has dropped to record \nlows.  One unit we visited on our trip in September had not used restraints since January.  The BHS \nnow uses restraints only when there is an immediate threat of harm to self or others that cannot be de-\nescalated.  It carefully monitors and removes patients from restraints at the earliest possible time.   \n \nB.      Mental Health Care \n \nTreatment at the BHS has been revolutionized in the past seven years.  No longer driven \nsolely by psychiatrists’ boilerplate assessments about what is best to control patients’ behavior, \ntreatment is interdisciplinary, individualized and focused on patients’ needs and recovery goals.  \nUpon admission to the psychiatric emergency room, or Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency \nProgram (CPEP), patients are quickly triaged to assess their current psychiatric condition and related \nissues such as intoxication, potential for harm to self or others and acute medical conditions.  \nAssessments and diagnoses in the CPEP are clinically appropriate and thorough.  Diagnoses and \ntreatment, including medication regimens, are generally appropriate, timely, and refined over time as \npatients’ conditions change. \n \nAs we noted in our reports to the Court over the past seven years, Treatment Planning has \nbeen a core concern.  When we conducted our investigation in 2008 and 2009, patients with very \ndifferent problems received identical treatment plans.  The plans rarely supported discharge back to \nthe community at the earliest possible time into the most integrated setting appropriate to patients’ \nneeds.   \n \nAlthough treatment plans remain somewhat uneven, the BHS has made significant \nimprovements have been made in this area, particularly within the last year,  Most treatment plans \nnow are individualized, person centered and recovery oriented.  Importantly, patients and, as \nappropriate, family members, not just clinical staff, are encouraged to and do have input into \ntreatment plans.  The BHS also has a well-developed program for psychosocial and therapeutic \nrehabilitation that allows patients to learn important coping skills.  Exercise and physical activities \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 22   Filed 01/10/17   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 274\nalso are available as part of the overall treatment program. \n \n  Medication management has also changed substantially. The BHS has hired a dedicated \npsycho-pharmacist who ensures that the BHS engages in safe and effective pharmacological \ntreatment.  No longer does the BHS administer medications for their secondary sedative effects, i.e., \nchemical restraint, a practice which caused patient harm and was a substitute for proper therapeutic \ninterventions.  \n \nC.      Behavioral Management \n \nThe BHS had almost no behavioral management program when we first visited the facility in \n2007.   Inappropriate behaviors were addressed with medication, physical restraints or close \nmonitoring by staff on a 1:1 basis.  As noted above, the BHS no longer uses chemical restraint and \nphysical restraints are used much less frequently.  In their place, the BHS has developed programs to \nhelp patients learn to control inappropriate behaviors.  Central to this is the Behavioral Support Team, \nmade up of clinical professionals who work with patients to help them address potentially \nproblematic behaviors.  The BHS also employs a neuropsychologist who helps to identify and adapt \ntreatment and discharge plans for patients with cognitive impairments or learning problems.  \n \nD.    Medical and Nursing Care \n \nMany of the patients admitted to the CPEP or the inpatient units in the BHS have co-existing \nmedical conditions, including diabetes, asthma and obesity.   In the past, these conditions were often \noverlooked and their relationship and interaction with psychiatric disorders disregarded.  Medical \ncare at the BHS now is of the same quality and depth as psychiatric care.  Every patient has a medical \nexamination within twenty-four hours of admission, and physicians and nurses play a significant role \nin determining treatment and discharge plans.  \n \nIn 2007, partly out of fear of patient violence, nurses minimized interactions with patients.  \nNurses now have become increasingly important in the lives of patients, embracing their role as front \nline caregivers.  They also play an important role in treatment planning.  Although nursing leadership \nstill needs to continue to develop further, nursing practices have improved significantly over the last \nseven years. \n \nOne important note: the BHS faces significant challenges ensuring sufficient staffing levels, \nparticularly in nursing and psychiatry.  We have learned that, because of a shortage of psychiatrists \nand psychologists, nurse practitioners and psychologists are being assigned Unit Chief duties.  This \nhas not produced any specific concerns at this time, but the BHS must be vigilant to ensure that staff \nare not given responsibilities for which they are not qualified.   \n \nE.  Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement \n \nIn order for any health care facility to identify its strengths and areas that need improvement, \nit must have strong data collection and analysis processes.  Effective self-monitoring is the hallmark \nof good healthcare systems. In 2009, we found that the BHS’s quality assurance and performance \nimprovement programs were poorly organized and that it failed to analyze the data it did collect for \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 22   Filed 01/10/17   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 275\ntrends and underlying causes.  In addition, the BHS lacked adequate procedures for investigating \nincidents, including those which caused serious injuries.  Our consultants found that staff conducted \nlittle or no follow-up to determine the cause of an incident, its effect on the patient, or how similar \nincidents might be avoided in the future.  As a result, patients continued to be exposed to actual and \npotential harm. \n \nToday, the BHS has institutionalized a culture of continued performance improvement which \npermeates the entire system of care.  Several committees meet regularly to review reports, analyze \nincidents and determine appropriate remedial action.  Overall, the Quality Assurance and \nPerformance Improvement processes at the BHS now help to identify and address deficiencies in care \nand treatment, thereby substantially reducing the possibility of future patient harm. The BHS must \nremain vigilant and continue to strengthen its ability to identify and act on trends that may reflect \nsystemic improvement opportunities.    \n \nF.  Fire and Life Safety  \n \nThe physical environment and sanitation in the BHS are significantly improved from when we \nfirst visited in 2008.   At that time, the BHS was in the “G” Building, an antiquated, unsanitary \nfacility.   In the “G” Building, linens and mattresses were stained, worn and torn.  Patients’ clothes \nwere not washed or disinfected before being stored and in the CPEP, patients’ clothes were stored on \nthe floor.  There were inadequate fire safety protocols.  Hazardous materials, including medical \nwaste, were not discarded consistent with generally accepted methods. Food was prepared in an \nunsanitary manner.   \n \nThe BHS is now housed in the new “R” Building, which opened in late 2009.   This new  \nbuilding is clean, light and airy, and provides patients with a more positive and therapeutic \nenvironment.  Linens and laundry are kept clean, and patients’ clothes are stored in closets.   Medical \nwaste is handled properly.  Food is maintained in warming units until it is distributed in a comfortable \ndining room.   Like much of the new BHS, the “R” Building is intended to help people recover and \nreturn to the community.  \n \nG.  Discharge Planning \n \nA critical aspect of any successful inpatient mental health treatment program is discharge \nplanning.  That is, from the moment a patient is admitted into the BHS, treatment and treatment \nplanning should be focused on setting achievable goals to allow him or her to return to the \ncommunity as soon as possible, and to successfully reintegrate and remain in the community. When \nwe first visited the BHS in 2008, the BHS had virtually no discharge planning process at all.  \nTreatment teams typically did not consider or integrate criteria for discharge into treatment planning.  \nConsequently, many patients whose psychiatric conditions were stabilized remained hospitalized \nunnecessarily.  The BHS, an acute care facility designed to expeditiously return individuals to the \ncommunity, had an average inpatient length of stay of more than 30 days.  Patients who were \ndischarged were often sent back into the community without continuity of care or follow up by the \nBHS beyond ensuring that the individual reached his or her designated destination.  As a result, \nindividuals often were readmitted to the BHS within a few weeks of discharge. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 22   Filed 01/10/17   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 276\nDischarge planning is now robust and an integral part of treatment planning.  Social workers, \nwho are responsible for coordinating discharge plans, are important members of interdisciplinary \ntreatment teams.  The teams work to ensure that patients are discharged to an appropriate setting in \nthe community, consistent with the community integration requirements of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.  Even in the face of shortages of appropriate community housing and services, the \nBHS has reached out to service providers and developed a network of contacts that facilitates quality \ncommunity placements.  The focus on community outreach has helped to make the BHS a focal point \nfor community providers in the area.    \n \nThe BHS has also created a Repeat Admission Review Committee (RARC) that assesses and \nattempts to address underlying reasons that particular individuals do not succeed in the community \nand are repeatedly re-admitted for treatment.  It also has a Monitoring, Referral and Linkage (MRL) \nUnit that tracks discharged individuals up to 90 days, to ensure successful transitions back to the \ncommunity.  \n \nH.  Hospital Police \n \n  When we conducted our investigation in 2007 and 2008, the Hospital Police lacked a \ncomprehensive, coherent set of policies that were effectively communicated to officers.  Supervision \nand training of officers was inadequate, particularly when engaging mental health patients.  KCHC \nalso lacked a coherent and effective system for receiving, reviewing and investigating incidents and \ncomplaints against the Hospital Police.  This resulted in inappropriate conduct by officers, including \nassaults on patients and handcuffing patients to beds and even radiators.   \n \n  By July 2014, we determined that the Hospital Police had been substantially reformed. \nHospital Police now perform only law enforcement duties.  It has developed comprehensive policies \nand procedures that provide clear guidance for officer conduct.  It is headed up by a retired NYPD \nsupervisor and is professional and appropriately supervised.  Hospital Police have no clinical role in \nthe BHS. In fact, they have virtually no interaction with BHS patients, other than to monitor the \nentrances to the BHS and take crime reports on units when called upon by clinical staff.   \n \nI.  Training and Policy Manuals and Accountability \n \nIn 2009, BHS policies were vague, accountability was not clear, and training for staff was \nvirtually non-existent.  Currently, the policies are well written and reviewed in a timely manner, and \naccountability is clear.  BHS has developed competency based orientation programs for all \nemployees, annual update trainings to ensure continued competency, and ongoing continuing \neducation opportunities for all staff.  Participation rates for all of these educational offerings are \ntracked to ensure that staff avail themselves of the training opportunities that are vital to support \npatient care improvements.     \n   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 22   Filed 01/10/17   Page 6 of 6 PageID #: 277\n \nAs set forth in more detail in the attached report, we find that the BHS has maintained \nsubstantial compliance over the past six-month period since we last wrote to the Court.  Accordingly, \npursuant to the terms of the Consent Judgment, we respectfully submit that this case should be closed.  \nAs always, the parties are available to the Court to answer any questions or address any concerns it \nmay have.  \n \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n              ROBERT L.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nSpecial Litigation Section - PHB \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC  20530 \nJune 18, 2008\n \nVia Electronic and US Mail\n \nEmily Sweet, Esq.\n\nDeborah Dorfman, Esq.\n\nThe City of New York\n\nLaw Department\n\n100 Church St.\n \nNew York, NY  10007\n \nRe: Investigation of Kings County Hospital Center\n \nDear Counsel:\n \nWe write to memorialize the concerns raised during our May\n\n20-23, 2008 tour of the Kings County Hospital Center (“KCHC”).\n\nAs you know, that investigatory tour was conducted pursuant to\n\nour authority under two federal statutes:  the Civil Rights of\n\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (“CRIPA”), and\n\nthe pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control\n\nand Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“14141”).\n \nAs noted during our exit briefing, we have not yet reached a\n\nconclusion as to whether KCHC is engaging in a pattern or\n\npractice of violating the constitutional and federal statutory\n\nrights of patients.  However, we did note the following concerns\n\nregarding fire safety and sanitation issues which pose risks of\n\nserious harm and should be addressed immediately. \n\n1.  Inadequate Fire Safety.  The present fire safety system\n\nused for evacuating patients and staff in case of fire is\n\ninadequate and exposes both patients and staff to an\n\nunnecessarily high risk of harm, including death.  During the\n\ntour, we observed two mock fire drills during which staff failed\n\nto act appropriately, including:  failing to inquire as to the\n\nlocation of the fire; failing to bring fire extinguishers to the\n\nsite; delays in pulling fire alarms; failing to supervise\n\npatients properly; and failing to evacuate patients to a safe\n\negress in a timely manner.  In addition, we found a\n\nnon-operational smoke alarm in Unit G-31. The result is that the\n\nfacility is not adequately prepared should an actual fire occur. \n\n\n- 2 ­\nThis is especially critical in the G building, which is an older\n\nbuilding that is not equipped with sprinklers.\n \n2.  Inadequate Sanitation.  The present system for handling\n\nand disposing of hazardous materials also is inadequate and\n\nexposes patients, staff, and the Kings County community to risk\n\nof harm.  During our tour, we found open red hazardous carts\n\n(which are apparently used to store hazardous waste until it can\n\nbe properly disposed) as well as hazardous waste bags in the\n\noutside dumpster areas.  Leaving material in such a manner\n\npotentially exposes members of the community to infectious\n\ndisease and injury.  Such material should be disposed of in an\n\nappropriate manner.\n \nAs noted above, these conditions were raised during the exit\n\ninterview, and we were given assurances that they would be\n\naddressed expeditiously.  Accordingly, we would appreciate an\n\nupdate on KCHC’s efforts to address the concerns as soon as\n\npossible, but no later than June 30.\n \nFinally, we appreciate the cooperation and professionalism\n\ndemonstrated by counsel and KCHC staff at KCHC during the tour\n\nand we look forward to working with you on the upcoming KCHC tour\n\nin July.  If you have any questions, please contact either of us,\n\nCathleen Trainor at (202) 616-9009, or Laura M.

Ensure that foods are served and maintained at proper temperatures. \nG.\t  Discharge And Aftercare Planning \nKCHC shall actively pursue the appropriate discharge of Patients and create discharge and \naftercare plans designed to satisfy the requirement that Patients receive services in the most \nintegrated, appropriate setting in which Patients reasonably can be accommodated, as \nclinically appropriate, that is consistent with their needs.  KCHC shall ensure that the \ndischarge and aftercare plan developed for Patients is Patient-driven, recovery-oriented, and is \ncreated with the participation of and input from the Patient, (unless the Patient refuses to \nparticipate) and, as feasible, any representatives of the Patient’s choice.  Discharge and \naftercare planning shall be provided consistent with federal law, and to the extent that it has \nthe ability to, KCHC will take appropriate steps, as set forth in paragraph 7 below, so that \ncommunity placement services are provided consistent with federal law.  Discharge planning \nshall begin at admission and continue throughout the course of the Patient’s hospitalization \nuntil the Patient is discharged. More particularly, KCHC will: \n1. \t Utilize appropriate interdisciplinary discharge planning forms and aftercare \ninstructions, which shall be clearly and precisely explained to the Patient in the \nperson’s language of preference, or using appropriate interpretation and translation \nservices. \n2.\t  At admission or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, identify and address in \ntreatment planning the criteria that likely will foster appropriate discharge for a \nparticular Patient, including but not limited to: \na. \t       The individual Patient’s symptoms of mental illness or psychiatric distress; \nb.\t  Any other barriers preventing the individual Patient from transitioning to a \nmore integrated environment, especially difficulties raised in previously \nunsuccessful placements; and \nc.\t  Those factors which would likely foster successful discharge, including the \nPatient’s strengths, preferences personal life goals, and support network. \n3. \t Ensure that, consistent with generally accepted professional standards, each Patient \nhas a professionally developed discharge and aftercare plan that is integrated within \nthe Patient’s plan of care, including the treatment plan, that addresses his or her \nparticular discharge considerations, and that includes: \na. \t Measurable interventions regarding these discharge considerations; \nb. \t The staff responsible for implementing the interventions; \nc. \t The time frames for completion of the interventions; \nd.\t  A statement of the Patient’s need, if any, for supervision, medication, aftercare \nservices, and assistance in finding employment; \n20\n \n\ne.\t  A specific recommendation of the type of residence in which the Patient is to \nlive and a listing of services and supports available to the Patient in such \nresidence; \nf.\t  A listing of organizations, facilities, and individuals who are available to \nprovide services and supports in accordance with the identified needs of the \nPatient; \ng.\t  The notification of the appropriate school district and the committee on special \neducation regarding the proposed discharge or release of a Patient under 21 \nyears of age, consistent with applicable federal and state laws relating to \nconfidentiality of such information; and \nh.\t  An evaluation of the Patient’s need and potential eligibility for public benefits \nfollowing discharge, including public assistance, Medicaid, Medicare and \nSupplemental Security Income, in cooperation with local social service \ndistricts. \n4.\t  Include in treatment interventions the development of skills necessary to live in the \nsetting in which the Patient will be placed, and otherwise prepare the Patient for his or \nher new living environment.   \n5.\t  Ensure that, beginning at the time of admission and throughout the individual’s stay at \nKCHC, the Patient is an active participant in the discharge and aftercare planning \nprocess, to the fullest extent possible, given the individual’s level of functioning. \n6.\t  To the extent that it is able, consistent with paragraph 7 below, ensure that \nprofessional judgments about the most integrated setting appropriate to meet each \nPatient’s needs are implemented and that appropriate aftercare services are provided \nthat meet the needs of the Patient in the community. \n7. \t Provide transition supports and services consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards. In particular, KCHC shall \na. \t Ensure that Patients who have met discharge criteria are discharged \nexpeditiously, subject to the availability of suitable placements; \nb. \t Provide adequate assistance to individual Patients in transitioning to the new \nsetting; \nc. \t Take appropriate steps so that there is continuity of care with appropriate  \ncommunity providers in order to minimize the risk of decompensation and \nreinstitutionalization; \nd. \t Develop policies and procedures and prepare and cause to be implemented, \npost-discharge follow-up procedures, including but not limited to case  \nmanagement, designed to: \n21 \n\n(i) \t    Determine whether the residence in which the former Patient is living is \n          adequate and appropriate for the needs of such individual; \n(ii) \t   Coordinate with agencies and providers to assure that the services \n          specified in the discharge plan are being implemented, or that \n          alternative clinically appropriate and indicated services are being \n provided; and \n(iii) \t  Recommend, and, where indicated, take reasonable steps to assure, \n          provision of, alternative services. \nNothing in this section shall be construed to require KCHC to provide such \nservices if the Patient, so long as he or she is competent, chooses not to accept \nthem. \n8.\t  Create or revise, as appropriate, and implement a quality assurance or utilization \nreview process to evaluate the discharge and post-discharge follow-up process. \n9.\t  Develop and implement policies and procedures to address Patients who return to \nKCHC, either to the CPEP or to an inpatient unit in less than 90 days and/or who have \nmore than three (3) admissions within a calendar year.  Such processes shall include \nthe identification of specific factors relating to each Patient’s repeated admissions as \nwell as a plan for attempting to address such factors so as to reduce the likelihood of \nfuture admissions. \n10.\t  Maintain and analyze data on Patients who return to KCHC, either to the CPEP or to \nan inpatient unit, in less than 90 days and/or who have more than three (3) admissions \nwithin a calendar year.  For such patients, KCHC shall develop a plan to address \nidentified factors for each Patient.  The plan shall be placed prominently in the \npatients’ chart and shall document the identified factors. \n11.\t  The Defendants shall designate an independent clinical staff member or members to \nserve as a repeat admissions review coordinator or a committee (the “RARC”).  \na.\t  Every Patient admitted with three (3) or more admissions in a twelve month \nperiod or more than five (5) total admissions to KCHC shall have a “repeat \nadmissions review” conducted by the RARC or the RARC’s staff (if the RARC \nis an individual) or a designated member of the RARC (if the RARC is a \ncommittee), that is consistent with generally accepted professional standards. \nThe review shall, at a minimum, identify barriers to successful discharge, \nreasons for repeat admissions, and recommended strategies to promote \nsuccessful discharge; \nb.\t  The findings of the repeat admissions review shall be supplied to the treatment \nteam promptly but no more than seven days after the patient’s admission to the \ninpatient unit; \nc.\t  The treatment team shall consider the findings of the RARC and shall address \nthe findings of the repeat admissions review in writing in the treatment plan, \nincluding specific reasons for adopting or rejecting the recommendation made \n22 \n\nin the repeat admissions review;  \nd.\t  Upon request by any treatment team, the RARC will attend the treatment \nplanning meeting to assist with discharge and aftercare planning; and \ne.\t  The RARC shall participate in the quality assurance or utilization review of \nKCHC’s discharge and aftercare process. \nH.\t  KCHC Hospital Police Policies, Procedures and Practices \nKCHC shall provide policing services with respect to Patients that comport with the \nrequirements of the United States Constitution and laws, as well as with generally accepted \nprofessional standards for peace officers providing hospital security services.  To that end, \nKCHC shall: \n1. \t Develop and implement a coherent, comprehensive, integrated set of Hospital Police \npolicies and procedures that provides clear guidance for officer conduct, including but \nnot limited to policies to guide Hospital Police officers’ interactions with Patients and \nHospital Police officers’ use of force; \n2. \t Develop and implement a comprehensive training program, including adequate field \ntraining for new officers and adequate in-service training for all officers, that is \nappropriately documented and reviewed by supervisory and command personnel; \n3. \t Develop and implement comprehensive policies and procedures and training on \nsupervisory oversight of line officers, including supervisory and command review of \nuse of force and other incidents that involve hospital police intervention or \nenforcement actions; \n4. \t Establish an adequate record management system whereby all incidents involving the \nHospital Police, including but not limited to uses of force, as well as all other types of \ninteractions with Patients, are documented, recorded, and assigned discrete control \nnumbers; \n5.\t  Develop and implement a coherent and comprehensive set of policies and procedures \nregarding the duties of Behavioral Health Associates (“BHAs”), including but not \nlimited to policies to guide BHAs’ interactions with Patients and to deploy BHAs to \ninteract with Patients.  BHAs shall perform, as part of the clinical team and in addition \nto their clinical functions, safety and security duties in all psychiatric units, including \nthe CPEP. BHAs shall, among other things, be trained to perform CPR and shall be \nsupervised in performing this function by the Department of Nursing.  The BHAs will \nnot wear police uniforms, and will not be armed with any weapon or tool regularly \nemployed for law enforcement purposes by individuals having peace officer or police \nofficer status, including but not limited to batons of any nature; \n6.\t  Develop and implement policies defining those events which require a formal \ninvestigation.  Establish: time requirements for conducting such investigations; \nprotocols for supervisory and command review; and procedures for appropriate \nrecording and documentation of interviews of police personnel, clinical or other staff, \nand other parties whose statements might be relevant to said investigation; and   \n23 \n\n7.\t  Ensure that Hospital Police perform only law enforcement duties; Hospital Police shall \nnot participate in physical or chemical restraints of Patients in clinical situations and, \nin particular, shall not restrain Patients in order for the Patients to be medicated. \nNothing in this paragraph shall be construed to restrict the Hospital Police’s legitimate \nlaw enforcement responsibilities. \nI.\t  Training and Policy Manuals and Accountability \nThe Defendants shall require all staff to successfully complete competency-based training \nnecessary to implement the terms of this Agreement. Such training shall, where appropriate, \nbe ongoing and/or include regular in-service refresher training to ensure continued          \ncompetency.  KCHC also shall develop, maintain and regularly update comprehensive          \npolicies and practice manuals in accordance with generally accepted professional standards \nfor all clinical staff.  In addition, KCHC shall develop and implement policies and procedures \nto ensure staff accountability. \nIV. IMPLEMENTATION OF AND COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT \nThe Defendants shall implement all reforms necessary to effectuate this Agreement.  The \nimplementation of this Agreement shall begin immediately upon the Effective Date. \nA.\t  Within two weeks of the Effective Date, the Defendants shall communicate the provisions set \nforth in this Agreement to KCHC officials, employees, agents, and independent contractors \ninvolved in providing care to the Patients at KCHC. \nB.\t  The Defendants shall comply with all federal and State licensing requirements applicable to \nthe KCHC. \nC.\t  The Defendants shall ensure that Patients admitted prior to the Effective Date of this \nAgreement and still hospitalized at KCHC are afforded all of the requirements provided by \nthis Agreement. \nD.\t  The Defendants shall appoint a Settlement Agreement Coordinator at KCHC to oversee \ncompliance with this Agreement and to serve as a point of contact for the United States during \nreview of compliance with this Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement Coordinator shall \nprovide DOJ with reports regarding compliance with this Agreement.  With the reports, the \nSettlement Agreement Coordinator will provide the raw data upon which the compliance \nreports are based, along with any reports prepared by the Defendants’ technical consultants \nregarding compliance with this Agreement and any other reports routinely submitted to the \npoint of contact regarding compliance with this Agreement.  KCHC shall provide such reports \nand data to DOJ and the subject matter experts (described in section G. below) 45 days before \neach DOJ site visit to KCHC.  If DOJ provides KCHC less than 45 days’ notice of a site visit, \nthe Settlement Agreement Coordinator shall provide reports regarding compliance no less \nthan 14 days before the site visit.  If less than 45 days’ notice is provided, the parties will \nwork out a reasonable schedule for the production of documents. \nE.\t  Within 45 days of the Effective Date of this Consent Judgment, the Defendants shall provide \nthe United States with a plan of correction agreement (“POCA”) to implement the provisions \nof the Consent Judgment. The POCA shall set forth specific goals, objectives, and tasks to be \ncompleted to implement the provisions of the Judgment; target and deadline dates for \n24 \n\nimplementation of goals, objectives, and tasks; and compliance assessment methods and \nrequirements to ensure compliance with the POCA and the Judgment in a timely and effective \nmanner. \n1.\t  The POCA shall also designate persons responsible for oversight and implementation \nof tasks outlined in the POCA. \n2. \t The POCA shall set forth specific data to be collected and maintained and identify \nreports from such data to be provided to the United States and the subject matter \nexperts. \n3.\t  The POCA shall set forth any additional reports regarding Defendants’ compliance \nwith this agreement that will be provided to the United States and the subject matter \nexperts. \n4.\t  If the United States has any objection to the POCA, it will provide its objections and \nrecommended modifications to the POCA within two weeks of receipt of the POCA \nfrom the Defendants.  If the POCA states with respect to any area that KCHC will \ndevelop a policy or procedure with respect to a particular area covered by the POCA, \nthe United States will have two weeks from the date of establishment of the specific \npolicy or practice to object or comment.  The parties shall have two weeks to resolve \nany disagreements regarding the POCA after the United States provides its objections \nand recommended modifications.  If they are unable to reach agreement, the Court will \nresolve the dispute.  The parties agree that minor or de minimis differences in the \nterms of the POCA will not be brought before the Court.  However, regardless of the \nterms of the POCA, Defendants shall nonetheless be responsible for substantially \ncomplying with the terms of this Agreement, as provided herein. \n5. \t All policies and procedures developed in accordance with this Agreement shall be \nconsidered part of the POCA.  The POCA, once finalized, shall be considered part of \nthis Consent Judgment. \nG.\t  Compliance with this Agreement shall be assessed by a team of subject matter experts \nselected by the United States (the “compliance review team”).  Defendants and MHLS shall \nhave input on the composition of the compliance review team.  Defendants shall bear all \nreasonable fees and costs of the subject matter experts on the compliance review team.  The \nparties recognize the importance of ensuring that the fees and costs borne by the City are \nreasonable, and accordingly, fees and costs will be one factor considered in selecting the \nexpert consultants. In the event that any dispute arises regarding the payment of the experts’ \nfees and costs, the parties will attempt to resolve such dispute cooperatively.  If they are \nunable to reach agreement, the Court will resolve the dispute. \nH.\t  The parties acknowledge that conditions at KCHC are the subject of a lawsuit filed by Mental \nHygiene Legal Service of New York State, Hirschfeld o/b/o L.D. et al. v. New York City \nHealth and Hospitals Corp., et al., Civil Action No. CV-07-1819 (KAM) (E.D.N.Y.).  This \nlawsuit challenges conditions of confinement at KCHC similar to many of the conditions \nfound to exist in the United States’ investigation, and that this Agreement is designed to \nremedy.  Accordingly, the Parties shall raise no objection if MHLS elects to use the same \nsubject matter experts to assess compliance with its own agreement with the City, at its own \nexpense. To the extent that any agreement between MHLS and the City calls for review of \n25 \n\nmatters other than those identified in this Agreement, the experts shall prepare separate \nreports regarding those matters. \nI.\t  In the event that MHLS elects to employ the same subject matter experts on its compliance \nreview team that compose the compliance review team for this Agreement, the United States \nwill coordinate efforts with MHLS to ensure, to the extent practicable, that the experts’ \nreports are consolidated. \nJ.\t  In order to assess the Defendants’ implementation of each substantive provision of this \nAgreement, the compliance review team will conduct regular compliance reviews to ensure \nthat Defendants have implemented and continue to implement all measures required by this \nAgreement.  The first compliance review will be conducted approximately three months from \nthe Effective Date.  Thereafter, compliance reviews will be conducted approximately every \nsix months, unless the United States determines that a different schedule is appropriate, until \nthis Agreement is terminated.  The compliance review team will prepare a report to the United \nStates and a consolidated report which will be provided to the Defendants. \nK.\t  For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with this Agreement, the compliance review team, \nthe United States and its attorneys, subject matter experts and agents shall have reasonable \naccess to:  all of the relevant KCHC buildings and facilities; relevant KCHC documents and \nrecords; relevant KCHC officials, employees, agents, and independent contractors; and \nKCHC Patients, including the right to meet with Patients privately.  Such access shall \ncontinue until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the termination provisions \nherein.  Within 30 days of receipt of written questions from the United States concerning the \nDefendants’ compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, the Defendants shall \nprovide the United States with written responses and any requested documents.  The \nDefendants shall provide copies of all documents reasonably requested by the United States \nwithout charge. \nL.\t  The United States and the compliance review team shall provide the Defendants with \ntechnical assistance designed to help the Defendants achieve substantial compliance with the \nAgreement.  \nM.\t  The Defendants shall notify the United States immediately of serious incidents as defined in \nIII.A.6.  The Defendants shall forward to the United States copies of all incident reports and \nfinal reports of investigations related to such incidents, as well as any autopsies, mortality \nreviews, and death summaries. \nN.\t  The Parties and all of their agents shall, to the fullest extent allowed by law, maintain the \nconfidentiality of Patients’ medical and personal information.  All non-public information \nobtained by the United States shall be maintained in a confidential manner. \nThe provision of any confidential and/or privileged materials to the United States pursuant to \nthis Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of confidentiality or a waiver \nof any privilege by HHC, the City of New York or any City agency, including their officials, \nemployees, representatives and agents, or the successors or assigns of any of the foregoing. \nO.\t  To evaluate compliance with § III.G. above, the United States might visit community \nplacements to which Patients of KCHC have been or may be discharged.  The Defendants \nshall assist in facilitating the visits to such community placements.  \n26 \n\nP.\t  In addition to the involvement of MHLS in the selection of the compliance review team in \nthis case as set forth in Section G. above, throughout the term of this Agreement, the Parties \nshall consult with MHLS regarding the status of the Defendants’ compliance with this \nAgreement.  Specifically, the parties agree that: \n1.\t  The Defendants shall provide MHLS with access to all documents and materials \nprovided to the United States or to the compliance review team in connection with the \nassessment of compliance with this Agreement; \n2.\t  MHLS will be given an opportunity to comment and provide input into the \nassessments made by the United States and/or the compliance review team towards the \ndetermination of substantial compliance with this Agreement. \nQ. \t      MHLS shall be entitled to provide information to the United States that it believes in good       \n           faith is relevant to the instant action or the City’s compliance with this action. \nV. MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION \nA.\t  If, at any time, any party to this Agreement desires to modify it for any reason, that Party \nshall notify all other Parties to this Agreement, in writing, of the proposed modification and \nthe reasons therefor.  If the Parties reach agreement on the requested modification, it shall be \nreduced to writing, signed, and filed with the Court for approval. \nB.\t  With the exception of conditions or practices that pose an immediate and serious threat to the \nlife, health, or safety of Patients, during the term of this Agreement, if the United States \nbelieves that the Defendants have failed to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement, the \nUnited States shall, before initiating any court proceeding to remedy such failure, give written \nnotice of the failure to the Defendants setting forth the basis for its conclusion, including \nspecific findings in the subject matter experts’ compliance assessment reports, if any, and any \ndata, documents or reports supporting the determination such a belief is based upon.  \n1.\t  With the exception of an immediate or serious threat to life, health, or safety of \nPatients served by the facilities, the Defendants shall have 30 days from the date of \nsuch notice to cure the failure and provide the United States with sufficient proof of its \ncure or a plan to cure the failure and proof of implementation of that plan.  If the \nParties agree that modification of this Agreement is required to cure the failure, the \nmodification shall be reduced to writing, signed, and filed with the Court for approval. \nThe Parties shall attempt to resolve any differences regarding the identified non­\ncompliance during this period.  \n2.\t  If the parties cannot resolve any such differences within the thirty-day cure period, the \nUnited States may move this Court for an order enforcing the provisions of this \nAgreement. The United States shall bear the burden of proving that the alleged non­\ncompliance is systemic.   \n3. \t If the parties agree to a plan to cure an alleged violation and the United States believes \nthat the violation has still not been cured, the United States must provide at least thirty \n(30) days notice before any motion is made for enforcement of this Agreement. \n27\n \n\nC.\t  In the event that conditions or practices at KCHC appear to pose an immediate and serious \nthreat to the life, health, or safety of Patients confined to those facilities, and, as a result, the \nUnited States believes that the Defendants have failed to fulfill any obligation under this \nAgreement that could mitigate such threat, the notice and cure provisions outlined in the \npreceding paragraph shall not apply to any court action initiated by the United States. \nD.\t  This Agreement shall terminate five years after the Effective Date of this Agreement, if the \nUnited States certifies at that time that the Defendants have maintained Substantial \nCompliance with all provisions of this Agreement for the previous twelve months. \n“Substantial Compliance” indicates that the Defendants have achieved compliance with most \nor all requirements of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  Any alleged noncompliance \nmust be systemic.  Noncompliance with mere technicalities, or temporary failure to comply \nduring a period of otherwise sustained compliance, shall not constitute failure to maintain \nsubstantial compliance.  At the same time, intermittent compliance during a period of \nsustained noncompliance shall not constitute substantial compliance. \nE. \t This Agreement may terminate prior to the five year date if the United States certifies that the \nDefendants have substantially complied with each of the provisions of the Agreement and \nhave maintained Substantial Compliance for at least two years.  The burden shall be on \nDefendants to demonstrate this level of compliance. \nF. \t If, after the end of the five year period described in Section D. above, the United States \ndetermines that Defendants are not in Substantial Compliance, and Defendants dispute that \ndetermination, Defendants may move for relief from this Court.  Defendants may also move \nfor termination if the United States takes no action at the end of the five year period.  In any \nsuch motion, Defendants shall bear the burden of demonstrating that they are in Substantial \nCompliance as set forth in section D above. \nG.\t  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs D through F above, that portion of this \nAgreement regarding the KCHC Hospital Police, set forth above at Section III.H., may \nterminate if the United States certifies that the Defendants have maintained Substantial \nCompliance with the requirements of that section for two years, regardless of whether the \nUnited States has certified that KCHC has maintained Substantial Compliance with respect to \nthe other provisions of this Agreement.  \nH.\t  In the event that Defendants believe that they have maintained Substantial Compliance with \nsome of the requirements of this Agreement, the parties agree to discuss the possibility of \nrequesting that the Court release defendants from the requirements of those portions with \nwhich Defendants have maintained Substantial Compliance.  Defendants recognize that the \nUnited States is not required to agree to such a release and that one basis for not agreeing to \nsuch a release may be that the various portions of this Agreement are inextricably intertwined. \nI.\t  Forty-five months after the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Court will conduct a status \nconference regarding the Defendants’ compliance with this Agreement.  At this status \nconference, the Court will entertain requests for supplemental relief with respect to any area \nwhere it appears to the United States that the Defendants may not attain substantial \ncompliance with the Agreement within five years of the Effective Date.  If the United States \nbelieves that the Defendants have failed to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement, the \n28\n \n\nUnited States shall, no less than 30 days before the status conference, give written notice of \nthe failure to the Defendants setting forth the basis for its conclusion, including specific \nfindings in the subject matter experts’ compliance assessment reports, if any, and any data \nsupporting the determination. \nVI. GENERAL PROVISIONS \nA.\t  This Agreement is enforceable only by the Court and the Parties and is binding upon the \nParties, by and through their officials, agents, employees, assigns, and successors. \nB.\t  The Defendants agree that they shall not retaliate against any person because that person has \nfiled or may file a complaint, provided assistance or information, or participated in any other \nmanner in the United States’ investigation of the KCHC or in proceedings related to this \nAgreement.  The Defendants agree that they shall timely and thoroughly investigate any \nallegations of retaliation in violation of this Agreement and the non-retaliation provision of \nCRIPA, and take any necessary corrective actions identified through such investigations. \nC.\t  “Notice” under this Agreement shall be provided by electronic mail and overnight delivery \nand shall be provided as follows to: Martha Calhoun, Esq. and Emily Sweet, Esq., New York \nCity Law Department, 100 Church Street, New York, New York  10007. \nD.\t  If an unforeseen circumstance occurs that causes a failure to timely fulfill any requirement of \nthis Agreement, the Defendants shall notify the United States in writing within 20 calendar \ndays after the Defendants become aware of the unforeseen circumstance and its impact on the \nDefendants’ ability to perform under the Agreement.  The notice shall describe the cause of \nthe failure to perform and the measures taken to prevent or minimize the failure.  The \nDefendants shall take all reasonable measures to avoid or minimize any such failure.    \nE.\t  Failure by any Party to enforce this entire Agreement or any provision thereof with respect to \nany deadline or any other provision herein shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to \nenforce other deadlines and provisions of this Agreement. \nF.\t  The Parties agree to defend the provisions of this Agreement.  The Parties shall notify each \nother of any court or administrative challenge to this Agreement within a time period \nsufficient for the other party to act in response to that challenge.  In the event any provision of \nthe Agreement is challenged in any city or state court, the Parties agree to seek removal to \nfederal court.  In the event any provision of the Agreement is declared invalid, for any reason \nby a court of competent jurisdiction, said finding shall not affect the remaining provisions of \nthis Agreement. \nG.\t  Notwithstanding the requirement that no modification to this Agreement will occur unless \nthere is written Agreement by all Parties, to the extent any other federal authority, statute, or \nregulation amends, supercedes, or modifies this Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended, \nsuperceded, or modified accordingly. \nH.\t  This Agreement shall constitute the entire integrated agreement of the Parties.  With the \nexception of the United States’ findings letter referenced in paragraph I.B., no prior drafts or \nprior or contemporaneous communications, oral or written, will be relevant or admissible for \npurposes of determining the meaning of any provisions in this Agreement. \n29\n \n\nI.

      "title": "Re: Investigation of Kings County Hospital Center",
      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nSpecial Litigation Section - PHB \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC  20530 \nAugust 22, 2008\n \nVia Electronic and US Mail\n \nEmily Sweet, Esq.\n\nDeborah Dorfman, Esq.\n\nThe City of New York\n\nLaw Department\n\n100 Church St.\n \nNew York, NY  10007\n \nRe:  Investigation of Kings County Hospital Center\n \nDear Counsel:\n \nWe write to memorialize the concerns we raised during our\n\nJuly 28, 2008 through August 1, 2008 tour of the Kings County\n\nHospital Center (“KCHC”).  As you know, we conducted this initial\n\ninvestigatory tour pursuant to our authority under the Civil\n\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997\n\n(“CRIPA”).1\n \nAs we noted during the post-tour briefing we held with you\n\nand your clients, the City of New York (“City”) and the Health\n\nand Hospital Corporation (“HHC”), we have not yet reached a\n\nconclusion as to whether KCHC is engaging in a pattern or\n\npractice of violating the constitutional and federal statutory\n\nrights of patients.  However, as set forth below, there are\n\nseveral policies and practices at KCHC which pose imminent risks\n\nof serious harm to patients and which should be addressed\n\nimmediately. \n\n1\n  As you also know, we have a concurrent investigation of\n\nKCHC pursuant to the pattern or practice provision of the Violent\n\nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141\n\n(“14141”).\n \n\n- 2 ­\n1.  Inadequate Mental Health Assessments. \n\nFrequently, patients with mania are not being clearly\n\ndiagnosed and assessed by KCHC physicians.  As a result, these\n\npatients, instead of receiving appropriate mood stabilizers, are\n\nbeing treated with anti-depressants.  This improper treatment\n\nserves to exacerbate rather than treat the patients’ mania.\n\nPhysicians and other staff should be trained immediately as to\n\nhow to assess and treat mania to avoid further harm to patients\n\nwith this disorder.\n  \n2.  Inappropriate Drug Combinations. \n\nKCHC physicians are routinely prescribing both Thorazine\n\n(chlorpromazine) and Seroquel (quetiapine) to both children and\n\nadults.  This is a potentially dangerous drug combination which\n\ncan cause hypotension (decreased or lowered blood pressure) and\n\nresult in falls and injuries.  Prescribing these two medications\n\ntogether is contrary to generally accepted professional\n\nstandards.  KCHC should discontinue this practice immediately or,\n\nat a minimum, implement strict controls and monitoring on the use\n\nof this combination of drugs.\n \n3.  Inappropriate Use of Drugs for Sedative Effect. \n\nKCHC physicians also routinely prescribe medications\n\napparently only for their secondary sedative effect, including\n\nAtivan (lorazepam),  Thorazine (chlorpromazine) and Seroquel\n\n(quetiapine).  The dosage  levels at which KCHC prescribes these\n\nmedications do not have therapeutic value to address the\n\npatients’ underlying disorder.  Prescribing such medications\n\nprimarily for their sedative effects – and not to treat or\n\naddress a patient’s underlying disorder – is inappropriate and\n\nviolates generally accepted professional standards. \n\n4.  Inadequate Medical Care for Patients With Diabetes. \n\nWe have serious concerns regarding the adequacy of KCHC’s\n\nmedical management of patients with diabetes.  For example, we\n\nreviewed the records of a patient on Unit G-53 who had\n\nuncontrolled diabetes; her blood sugar readings ranged from 40 to\n\n400 over the course of one 24-hour period.  The patient’s charts \n\n\n- 3 ­\nindicated that nothing was done to stabilize her condition.  This\n \nput the patient at immediate risk of harm, including diabetic\n\ncoma or shock.  Given the metabolic changes that some medications\n\ncause, including atypical anti-psychotic drugs, KCHC must also\n\npay more careful attention to the treatment and care of patients\n\nwith diabetes.  It should also develop policies to screen and\n\nmanage metabolic issues relating to the use of anti-psychotic\n\ndrugs. \n\n5.  Inadequate Medical Emergency Response. \n\nOur review of records and materials, including videotape, in\n\nconnection with the death of Esmin G. in KCHC’s CPEP unit on June\n \n19, 2008, raises substantial concerns regarding the adequacy of\n\npatient supervision and the monitoring of patients by the staff,\n\nincluding medical personnel and hospital police, and systems of\n\naccountability which appeared to have failed.  Specifically, we\n\nnote that, although medical and hospital police staff apparently\n\nobserved Esmin G. lying on the floor of the CPEP waiting area,\n\nduring the course of the entire hour she lay there, no one\n\napproached her to check on her status.  Further, it appears that\n\nvideo monitors which should have conveyed images of Esmin G. on\n\nthe floor were not adequately monitored. \n\nWe also have concerns regarding the conduct of medical staff\n\nin running the emergency code operation beginning at\n\napproximately 6:40 A.M.  As an initial matter, it appears that no\n\none was clearly in charge of coordinating or directing the code\n\nfor several potentially crucial minutes.  From the video, it also\n\nappears - contrary to generally accepted medical practice  - \n\nmedical staff did not address airway, breathing or cardiac\n\nissues, but rather, first took a “finger stick” to assess Esmin\n\nG.’s blood sugar. \n\nOur review of emergency medical code drills procedures\n\nduring our recent tour buttresses these preliminary findings.\n\nDuring these drills, KCHC staff failed to respond in an\n\nappropriate manner and staff apparently were not adequately\n\ntrained in conducting medical codes. \n\n\n- 4 ­\nAccordingly, we urge the City to take immediate measures to\n\nensure that:  1) KCHC mental health patients are adequately\n\nsupervised and monitored at all times; 2) medical emergencies are\n\nresponded to swiftly and adequately; and 3) KCHC staff are\n\nadequately trained in dealing with medical codes and emergencies.\n\nWe make this recommendation with the recognition that KCHC\n\nalready has begun to implement changes to try to address these\n\nissues.  We encourage KCHC to continue to take all necessary\n\nmeasures to ensure the safety and appropriate medical treatment\n\nof all patients in the CPEP. \n\n6.  Falsification of Medical Records.\n \nFinally, we note that the entries in Esmin G.’s medical\n\nrecords are directly contradicted by the video.  Specifically,\n\nthe records state that she was walking around and went to the\n\nbathroom at 6:00 A.M., at a time that she is seen in the video\n\nlying prostrate on the CPEP floor.  Additionally, during our site\n\nvisit, we were also informed by HHC President Alan  Aviles that\n\nHHC staff had discovered that a nurse had falsified a restraint\n \nrecord of patient Patricia R.  These incidents raise serious\n \nconcerns about the reliability of medical records in the mental\n\nhealth units.  Intentionally or otherwise inaccurate records can\n\ncause error in treatment resulting in patient harm.  We urge KCHC\n\nto take immediate measures to address not only the two incidents\n\ndescribed in this paragraph, but also to ensure that medical\n\nrecords accurately reflect treatment.  This should include\n \ntraining and education of mental health staff regarding the\n\nimportance of accurate record-keeping and the potential harm to\n\npatients if false or inaccurate entries are made in patients’\n\ncharts.\n \nAs noted above, these conditions were raised during our\n\nrecent tour, and we were given assurances that they would be\n\naddressed expeditiously.  Accordingly, we would appreciate an\n\nupdate on KCHC’s efforts to address the concerns as soon as\n\npossible, but no later than September 2, 2008.\n \n\n- 5 ­\nFinally, we appreciate the cooperation and professionalism\n\ndemonstrated by counsel and KCHC staff during the tour.

Matsumoto \nUnited States District Judge \nEastern District of New York  \n225 Cadman Plaza East \nBrooklyn, New York  11201 \n \nRe:  United States of America  v. City of New York (Kings County Hospital Center) \n    Civil Action No. CV-10-0060 (KAM)                                                                  \n \nDear Judge Matsumoto: \n \n  The United States respectfully submits this letter, with the approval of all the parties in \nthis action and the related Hirschfeld action, to summarize the report of the expert compliance \nassessment team from their most recent tour of Kings County Hospital Center’s Behavioral \nHealth Service (“KCHC”).  The compliance report details the level of KCHC’s compliance with \nthe Consent Judgment entered in this action on January 7, 2010.   A copy of the experts’ report is \nattached to this letter, which is being hand-delivered to the Court because of its size.  \n   \nAs reflected in the report, KCHC has made enormous progress in the last six months.  In \na nutshell, although KCHC still has work to do in some areas, it has become a good facility, and \nhas the potential to become a model for other hospitals in New York City and the country.  \nKCHC is now in at least partial compliance with all requirements of the Consent Judgment, and \nin many areas, in compliance.  The following is a summary of the findings of the expert \nconsultants’ tour: \n \nA.  Protection from Harm \n \nOverall, KCHC has made significant progress in almost all areas related to Protection \nfrom Harm.  It appropriately assesses patients to determine if they are at risk of harm or causing \nharm to others.  Violence reduction protocols, including early intervention to avoid escalation, \nare in place, and are being effectively carried out.  As a result, overall patient aggression is \nsignificantly lower than in the past, and KCHC is using data analysis to recognize and address \naggression and reduce it further.  KCHC does need to do more work to ensure that it properly \nintegrates risk assessment into treatment planning.  Additionally, some work needs to be done to \nimprove the use of psychosocial interventions to address risks for aggression, sexual \nviolence/victimization and suicide. \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 14   Filed 12/23/13   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 226\nSerious incident investigations continue to be strong, and documentation and review of \npatient injury events, including assaults, has improved.  KCHC needs to improve coordination \nand monitoring of the investigatory process.  KCHC has substantially improved its quality \nimprovement (“QI”) and data collection processes.  Data is now collected and analyzed \nregarding all aspects of care and treatment, and KCHC generates data reports which drive \nimprovements in patient care and which address patient concerns and complaints.  \n \nB.  Mental Health Care \n \n1.  Assessments and Diagnoses \nKCHC is now in substantial compliance with several of the Consent Judgment’s \nrequirements regarding initial assessment and diagnosis of patients, and is very close to \nsubstantial compliance with a number of other provisions.  Upon admission, patients are timely \nassessed through a triage process that commences upon admission to the CPEP, and which is \nappropriately followed up and updated throughout individuals’ time at KCHC.  The CPEP \nperforms timely cognitive testing to identify individuals who may have developmental \ndisabilities and ensure that they are treated appropriately.  For the most part, the CPEP properly \nassesses individuals who are determined to be intoxicated, but some additional training is \nrequired to ensure that staff uses the assessment tools properly.  Minors admitted to the CPEP \nreceive appropriate special attention. However, KCHC needs to take additional steps to increase \nfamily participation in the treatment planning process.   \nOn the inpatient units, KCHC is conducting effective interdisciplinary assessments which \nare individualized and appropriate.  Some greater involvement of psychology is needed, \nhowever.  Psychiatric diagnoses are now justified far more often than in the past, with specific \ndiagnostic criteria.  Documentation supporting diagnoses has substantially improved.  Treatment \nand medication regimens are modified over time and the use of inappropriate medications and \npolypharmacy has dropped significantly.  However, diagnoses are not always supported by \ndocumented DSM-V criteria.  KCHC needs to more judiciously diagnose adults as having \nschizoaffective disorder and more evidence is required before children are diagnosed as having \nADHD.  In addition, treatment is not consistently modified based on the patient’s response to \ntreatment or changes in the patient’s condition or needs.      \n2.  Treatment Planning \nKCHC  has  made  substantial  progress  in  treatment  planning,  an  area  of  significant \nweakness in the past.  It has now achieved at least partial compliance in a significant number of \nthe provisions in this area.  KCHC has developed an effective methodology for developing \ntreatment plans (now called Individual Recovery Plans (“IRPs”)) and its approach to developing \nIRPs is appropriately interdisciplinary and integrated.  KCHC is increasingly using the “recovery \nmodel” for treatment, meaning that the goal is not simply to control behaviors, but to work in a \npatient centered environment to assist the patient towards quickly recovering and successfully re-\nintegrate  into  the  community.  This  is  still  a  work  in  progress,  however.  KCHC  needs  to \naccomplish some greater individualization of treatment plans and treatment teams still vary too \nmuch, particularly with respect to ensuring patients’ objectives are included in the IRP.  Our on \nsite  review  of  charts  reflects  that  changes  in  symptoms,  while  better  documented,  do  not \nconsistently  lead  to  appropriate  changes  in  diagnoses.    Responses  or  lack  of  responses  to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 14   Filed 12/23/13   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 227\nmedication are not consistently used to help refine diagnoses.  Psychosocial rehabilitation is \nincreasingly used in treatment, but it needs to be more individualized and psychologists need to \nplay a greater role in developing treatment plans.  The Behavioral Support Team (“BST”) has \nbecome effective in conducting behavioral assessments and developing individualized behavioral \nplans, but it needs to give more attention to identifying patients who could benefit from such \nplans. \n3.  Medication Management and Monitoring \nKCHC has invested significant time and creativity to improve the quality of medication \nmanagement and monitoring.  A full-time, dedicated psychopharmacologist is assigned to the \nBehavioral Health Service, and this has resulted in substantial improvements, including ensuring \nthat medications are prescribed in only therapeutic amounts and that prescriptions are clinically \njustified and tailored to each patient’s individual symptom.  Psychiatrists newly hired by KCHC \nhave been vigorously trained in the new model of treatment planning and prescribing.  As a \nresult, polypharmacy is substantially reduced.  When it is used, it is carefully monitored and \nreviewed  regularly.    KCHC  uses  STAT  medications  appropriately,  for  the  most  part  and \nmedications are no longer being used for their secondary sedative effect.  Treatment teams show \nsome inconsistency in adherence to patients’ psychopharmacological plans of care, and more \ntraining is needed to ensure that treatment team decisions incorporate appropriate standards for \nprescribing. \nC.  Behavioral Management \n  KCHC’s BST director continues to be a major institutional strength.  The BST has developed \nexcellent policies and its behavioral philosophy is being spread throughout the disciplines at \nKCHC, particularly nursing.  However, the quality of behavioral programming has suffered \nbecause of staff turnover in the BST.  There has been an increased reliance on unit psychologists, \nwho need to become more consistently effective in helping patients learn adaptive techniques to \naddress behavioral issues.  Behavioral plans are more often integrated into IRPs, but some \nadditional work needs to be done in this area \n \n  The data that the experts reviewed reflects that overall, KCHC is using mechanical restraints \nfar less frequently in the past, and when it does use restraint, uses only four point restraints, as \nthe Consent Judgment requires.  KCHC terminates restraints at the earliest possible time, and \nwithout the requirement that a doctor approve.  Restraints are almost never used as punishment, \nbut KCHC needs to develop a monitoring or other tool to ensure that restraints are not used as an \nalternative to active treatment.  KCHC continues to reduce use of close observation (e.g., 1:1, \nobservation every 15 minutes).  However, KCHC needs to develop better monitoring tools to \nensure that it uses these techniques only when necessary. \n \nD.  Medical and Nursing Care \nKCHC has significantly improved its monitoring of acute medical conditions and has \nincluded medical assessment in the initial treatment planning process.  This has led to improved \ncoordination, integration of information and enhanced patient care, reducing the potential for \nmedical emergencies and crises.  Complete medical assessments are usually conducted on a \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 14   Filed 12/23/13   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 228\ntimely basis within the first 24 hours of admission.  KCHC has developed an effective program \nto address medical emergencies.  Medical documentation has improved, but the electronic \nmedical record system remains confusing and difficult to use. \n \nMedical care on the children’s and adolescent units is not at the same level as on the adult \nservices.  There is still no consistent pediatric leadership provided relative to youth medical \nneeds.  Pediatric leadership is still not involved in monitoring and evaluating the practices of \npediatricians in BHS.  The expert team expressed serious concerns about whether young patients \nwere receiving care based on clinicians’ understanding of patients’ comprehensive needs and \nadequate involvement in developing coordinated recovery plans.  The coordination of care and \nintegration of medical issues with behavioral health issues remains compromised in spite of well-\nconsidered attempts to improve these areas.   \n \nOverall, nursing has improved significantly at KCHC.  Nursing is better integrated into \nall levels of the organization, particularly in treatment planning.  Nursing leadership is now very \nstrong, and there is ongoing coaching, training and supervision, creating a new environment in \nwhich nurses are more engaged with patients.  There are still too many patients in bed during the \nday, but nursing staff is employing new strategies to address this problem.  Further, KCHC’s \nHuman Resources Department has presented barriers to improvement in the BHS nursing unit.  \nThere are too many sustained nursing vacancies and serious hiring delays.  Also, where nursing \nmanagement has found that nurses have not met job standards, including in situations involving \nallegations of staff abuse or neglect, the Human Resources department has not supported \nmanagement by taking timely and appropriate action.   \n \nE.  Quality Assurance/ Performance Improvement \n \nBHS has maintained and strengthened the robust Quality Assurance/Performance \nImprovement (“QA/PI”) system that was present during the last tour, and is closer to achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this requirement.  The QA/PI system is even further integrated \nthroughout the BHS, providing insight into all disciplines’ strengths and areas which need \nimprovement.  Very few additional refinements in QI are required—KCHC needs only to \ncontinue to collect its data and sharpen its analytical tools, such as its inter-rater reliability \nmethodology (inter-rater reliability is a measure of reliability used to assess the degree to which \ndifferent judges or raters agree in their assessment decisions).  \n \nF.  Fire And Life Safety \n \nKCHC is in substantial compliance in this area.  The one issue from the last review of \nthis area, the need to hire additional fire safety officers, has been resolved.  Fire drills are \nconducted properly and KCHC properly documents all of its fire safety reviews.  Emergency \nkeys are properly marked and consistently stored in a quickly accessible location.  Overall, the \nfacility is clean and well maintained.  Linens and other laundry are kept clean.  The food service \nis well run, and food is maintained and served at proper temperatures. \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 14   Filed 12/23/13   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 229\nG.  Discharge and Aftercare Planning \n \nKCHC’s discharge planning process remains strong.  Discharge planning begins at \nadmission and is an integral part of treatment planning from the onset.  The facility needs to do a \nbetter job of identifying barriers to discharge and skills which will ensure a successful discharge \nto the community.  KCHC needs to develop additional measurable goals to ensure that it is \ncomplying with the requirements of the Consent Judgment and, more importantly, effectively \nconducting discharge planning.  Significant gaps in certain community services and supports \ncontinue to exist and result in repeat admissions and greater lengths of hospitalization than \nnecessary.  The lack of sufficient community resources still significantly restricts KCHC’s \ndischarge planning process and causes lengths of stay to be too long, but social work \nmanagement continues to work hard to develop new contacts and identify appropriate resources.  \nKCHC’s Monitoring Referral Linkage Unit (“MRLU”), which is responsible for ensuring that \npatients who are discharged receive continuity of care and are linked with and follow up with \ncommunity resources and treatment, is increasingly effective.  \n \nH.   KCHC Hospital Police Policies, Procedures and Practices \n \nAs we have noted in our previous reports, the Hospital Police (“HP”) at KCHC has \nimproved dramatically.  The department now has only very limited contact with psychiatric \npatients, and officers are not allowed on BHS units unless they are called by clinical staff to \ninvestigate a criminal incident.  The HP is efficiently and professionally managed, and has a \ncomprehensive set of policies and procedures.  Officers receive appropriate training prior to \nbeing released to patrol duty, and supervisors ensure that officers receive substantial guidance.  \nOfficers maintain logbooks and other documentation properly, and these are reviewed regularly \nby supervisory personnel.    \n \nHowever, HP is now only in partial compliance with in the training requirements of the \nConsent Judgment.  HP trains its officers in Crisis Intervention policies only once, upon hiring, \nand does not provide regular a refresher course to officers, something that should occur at least \nonce every two years.  Similarly, KCHC does not provide annual Fire/Safety training for \nHospital Police.  Fire Safety certification is awarded to HP staff based upon the results of a \nwritten test.  If an officer passes the test, she is not required to undergo any training.  Further HP \nrecords reflect that only about half of the HP officers even took the Fire/Safety test in 2012 and \n2013.  All HP officers should receive fire safety training annually.   \n \nI.  Training \n \nKCHC has made substantial progress during this reporting period.  It now has a Staff \nDevelopment Director who can build on KCHC’s existing foundation for an  appropriate training \nprogram. Interdisciplinary training has advanced with a special focus on violence reduction \nprotocols and treatment planning.  The percentage of staff members who are trained in all \ncompetency areas has increased, but needs to improve further.  \n \nIn sum, conditions of treatment at KCHC are much better than even a year ago.  If KCHC \ncontinues to improve, and corrects the remaining deficiencies identified in our report, there is \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00060-KAM-RML   Document 14   Filed 12/23/13   Page 6 of 6 PageID #: 230\nevery expectation that KCHC will come into substantial compliance with all the requirements of \nthe Consent Judgment.  However, as is evident from the Report and the Compliance Summary \nChart,  there  are  areas  of  the  Consent  Judgment  where  KCHC  is  currently  only  in  partial \ncompliance.  KCHC needs to continue to improve and take additional steps into order to achieve \ncompliance with all the requirements of the Consent Judgment.    \nWe will continue to monitor KCHC’s implementation of the requirements of the Consent \nJudgment.  As always, the parties are available to the Court to answer any questions or address \nany concerns it may have.  \n \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n              LORETTA E.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nSpecial Litigation Section - PHB \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC  20530 \nNovember 7, 2008\n \nVia Electronic and US Mail\n \nMartha Calhoun, Esq.\n\nEmily Sweet, Esq.\n\nThe City of New York\n\nLaw Department\n\n100 Church St.\n \nNew York, NY  10007\n \nRe:  DOJ Investigation of Kings County Hospital Center\n \nDear Counsel:\n \nWe write to memorialize our concerns raised by recent\n\nserious incidents in the inpatient mental health units at Kings\n\nCounty Hospital Center (“KCHC”).1  As you know, we have been\n\ninvestigating conditions in KCHC’s inpatient mental health units\n\npursuant to our authority under the Civil Rights of\n\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (“CRIPA”).2\n \nAs we noted during the two post-tour briefings we conducted\n\nwith you and your clients, the City of New York (“City”) and the\n\nNew York City  Health and Hospitals Corporation (“HHC”), we have\n\nnot yet reached a conclusion as to whether KCHC is engaging in a\n\npattern or practice of violating the constitutional and federal\n\nstatutory rights of mental health patients at KCHC.  However, the\n\nincidents described below evidence conditions at KCHC which pose\n\nimminent risk of serious harm to patients and therefore require\n\nimmediate attention.\n \n1\n  We note that this is our third letter detailing\n\nconditions at KCHC that pose imminent risk of serious harm to\n\npatients.\n \n2\n  As you also know, we have a concurrent investigation of\n\nKCHC pursuant to the pattern or practice provision of the Violent\n\nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141\n\n(“14141”).\n \n\n- 2 ­\n1.  The Recent Incidents\n \nTwo recent incidents have precipitated our concerns.  The\n \nfirst involves inappropriate sexual activity on the boys’\n\nadolescent unit.  As you have reported to us, on the evening of\n\nSeptember 25, 2008, two 14-year-old youths, A.Z. and B.Y.,\n\nengaged in “consensual”3\n anal and oral sex in the room of a third\n\npatient, C.X., even though both B.Y. and A.Z. were supposed to be\n\non constant fifteen minute observation.4  On the morning of\n\nSeptember 26, 2008, a 16-year-old youth, E.V., also assigned to\n\none-to-one supervision by KCHC staff, is alleged to have forced\n\nA.Z. to engage in oral sex with him.5  In addition, according to\n\nhis chart, A.Z. also attempted suicide on two occasions, on\n\nSeptember 22, 2008, and September 27, 2008.\n \nThe second incident occurred on October 15, 2008.  Five\n \npatients on Unit G-41 reportedly engaged in a brawl.  One of the\n \npatients, D.W., sustained a compound fracture of his thumb which\n\nrequired surgery, as well as injury to his forehead.\n \n2.  KCHC Does Not Adequately Protect Patients from Harm\n \nPatients at KCHC have a right to live in reasonable safety.\n\nSee Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315, 322 (1982).  Our\n \nreview of documentation from the recent incidents at KCHC\n \nsuggests that KCHC is not adequately protecting patients’ safety.\n\nThe incidents reveal inadequate, ineffective, and\n\ncounterproductive treatment resulting in serious harm, including\n\nfrequent patient assaults and unchecked self-injurious behavior.\n\nThe harm KCHC patients experience is multi-faceted and includes\n\nphysical and psychological injury.  The facility’s ability to\n\naddress this harm is hampered by inadequate incident, risk, and\n\nquality management, including deficient investigative practices. \n\n3  The medical records describe the incident as\n \n“consensual.”  This classification is questionable especially in\n\nview of the ages of the boys and their mental status.\n \n4\n  To protect the patients’ identities, we use fictitious\n\ninitials throughout this letter.  We will separately transmit to\n\ncounsel a schedule cross-referencing the fictitious initials with\n\nthe patients’ names.\n \n5\n  Most notably, it appears that KCHC staff did not become\n\naware of these incidents until September 27, 2008, almost two\n\ndays after the first incident and more than 24 hours after the\n\nsecond. \n\n\n- 3 ­\nThese problems are serious and recurring and need to be addressed\n\nimmediately. \n\nWe highlight two areas where the problems are particularly\n\nacute:  failure to identify and control patient aggression and to\n\naddress suicidal ideation and attempts.\n \na.\t  Patient Aggression and Assaultive\n\nBehaviors Are Not Controlled\n \nPatient aggression is not adequately controlled on many of\n\nthe units at KCHC.  In both of the sexual misconduct incidents\n \ndescribed above, staff failed to properly monitor patients and\n\nfailed to proactively address potentially aggressive behavior.\n\nWith respect to the incident on the boys’ adolescent unit, B.Y.\n\nand A.Z. were supposed to be observed every fifteen minutes;\n\nE.V., the apparent aggressor in the second sexual incident, was\n\nsupposedly on one-to-one constant observation.  If such\n \nobservations were conducted properly, the incidents should have\n\nbeen prevented.  KCHC’s failure to properly monitor and supervise\n\nthese youths is both disturbing and unacceptable. \n\nMoreover, the incident reports and medical records we\n\nreviewed are inconsistent.  Critical information is omitted from\n \nsome or all of the records.  For example, it appears that B.Y. is\n\nHIV positive -- no notations of this are contained anywhere in\n\nthe records of either A.Z. or E.V..  Similarly, it appears that\n\nE.V., the 16-year-old youth, was a gang member known to\n\nintimidate younger patients.  This information, while contained\n\nin B.Y.’s medical record, is missing from E.V.’s own medical\n\nrecord.  Accordingly, KCHC fails to provide treatment teams with\n\nreadily available critical information necessary to provide\n\nappropriate care.\n \nThe October 15, 2008, five-patient brawl also demonstrates\n\nKCHC’s failure to control and ensure patient safety.  Apparently,\n\nstaff was unable to de-escalate the conflict before it ignited.\n\nMoreover, the conflict escalated into a fight without any\n\nintervention by staff. \n\nStaff, as well as patients, are often the victims of\n\nassaultive behavior.  In addition to the October 15, 2008,\n\nincident, our review of the critical incidents recently provided\n\nto us revealed several serious incidents of patient aggression\n\nagainst staff.  For example, on unit G-31, on October 5, 2008, a\n\npatient assaulted staff members, striking one nurse in the face.\n\nThe patient also struck another nurse with a chair.  Again, there\n\nwas no staff or security intervention at all.\n \n\n- 4 ­\nb.\t  Suicidal Ideation and Attempts Are Not\n\nAddressed Appropriately\n \nA significant number of patients are admitted to KCHC for\n\nstabilization and protection because of suicidal ideation or\n\nattempts.  Our preliminary review of recent incidents reveals a\n\ntroubling number of patients who obtained the means to attempt\n\nsuicide and/or who inflicted serious self-harm despite being\n\nadmitted because of suicidal ideation or after declaring an\n\nintent to harm themselves. \n\nThe medical record of one of the youths involved in the\n\nsexual incident is illustrative of the problem.  A.Z., a\n\n14-year-old youth, was assessed on admittance as being\n\n“suicidal.”  He had a history of six past psychiatric admissions\n\nat KCHC, most recently from March to May 2008.  A.Z.’s medical\n \nrecord details a history of A.Z. threatening to hurt himself,\n\nincluding threats to end his life.  His most recent admission, on\n\nAugust 21, 2008, lists “aggressive and impulsive behaviors” and\n\n“danger to himself and others” as the reason for his admission to\n\nKCHC. \n\nOn September 21, 2008, A.Z. was involved in a physical\n\naltercation with E.V., the 16-year-old patient who would later\n\nsexually assault him.  No actions or changes were made to his\n\ntreatment plan except that the next day, A.Z. was placed on\n\none-to-one observation.  Later that day, September 22, 2008, A.Z.\n\nattempted suicide by wrapping a video game controller wire around\n\nhis neck. \n\nOn September 25, 2008, A.Z. was taken off constant\n\none-to-one observation and placed on 15-minute observation.\n\nThere is no explanation in the chart for the change in status.\n\nThat same day, September 25, 2008, A.Z. was involved in the\n\n“consensual” sexual incident described above.  The following day,\n\nSeptember 26, 2008, E.V. forced A.Z. to engage in sexual conduct\n\nwith him. \n\nOn September 27, 2008, after KCHC officials learned of the\n\nsexual incidents, A.Z. was again placed on one-to-one constant\n\nobservation.  Later that same day, A.Z. again attempted to kill\n\nhimself by wrapping a video game controller wire around his neck.\n\nThe incident reports state merely that the patient was upset due\n\nto “previous incident earlier that day” but fails to describe or\n\nanalyze the assault incidents, note the fact that patient was on\n\nconstant observation, or that the patient had previously\n\nattempted suicide.\n \n\n- 5 ­\nOur review of the recent reports provided to the New York\n\nState Office of Mental Health revealed several other incidents of\n \nattempted suicide, some of which occurred while patients were on\n\nconstant Level I one-on-one observation.6\n \nGenerally, we have observed no adjustments in patients’\n\ntreatment plans as a result of patients’ assaultive and\n\nself-injurious behavior.  The repeated and significant level of\n\naggression and self-injurious behavior on the units suggests a\n\nfundamental failure to address the root causes of patients’\n\ninappropriate behavior and demonstrates a failure to intervene\n\nadequately to prevent future incidents.  Additionally, incident\n\ninvestigation is inadequate.  The investigations are cursory,\n\nincomplete, and lack critical information necessary to address\n\nclinical deficiencies.  Accordingly, we urge the City to take\n\nimmediate measures to ensure that: \n\n1) \t KCHC mental health patients are adequately supervised\n\nand monitored at all times; \n\n2) \t KCHC patients identified as being vulnerable to\n\nphysical or sexual attack are adequately protected and\n\nthat patients who are attacked receive appropriate\n\ntreatment and care; \n\n3) \t KCHC create or revise, as appropriate, and implement\n\ncomprehensive, consistent incident management policies\n\nand procedures regarding patient aggression and suicide\n\nideation or attempts; \n\n4) \t KCHC provide clear guidance regarding reporting\n\nrequirements and the categorization of incidents,\n\nincluding requiring all staff to complete\n\ncompetency-based training in the revised reporting\n\nrequirements;\n \n5)\t  KCHC develop and implement policies and procedures that\n\naddress the root causes of patients’ aggression and\n\nsuicide ideation or attempts including appropriate\n\ninterventions to prevent future incidents;\n \n6)\t  KCHC develop and implement appropriate policies and\n \n6\n  KCHC does not have appropriate policies and procedures\n\nthat comport with generally accepted professional standards\n\nregarding one-to-one observation and 15-minute checks.  Nor are\n \nsuch observations and monitoring conducted properly. \n\n\n- 6 ­\nprocedures in accordance with generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards regarding patient monitoring,\n\nincluding one-to-one observation and 15-minute patient\n\nchecks;\n \n7)\t  KCHC develop and implement appropriate policies and\n\nprocedures regarding the investigation of incidents. \n\nWe request an update on KCHC’s efforts to address the\n\nconcerns expressed above, as soon as possible, but no later than\n\nNovember 17, 2008.

Bloomberg\n\nCity Hall\n\nNew York, NY  10007\n \nRe:  CRIPA Investigation of Kings County Hospital Center\n \nDear Mayor Bloomberg:\n \nWe are writing to report the findings of the Civil Rights\n\nDivision and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern\n\nDistrict of New York regarding our joint investigation of\n\nconditions and practices at the inpatient psychiatric units and\n\npsychiatric emergency room at Kings County Hospital Center\n\n(“KCHC”) located in Brooklyn, New York.  On December 7, 2007, we\n\nnotified you that we were initiating an investigation pursuant to\n\nthe Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”),\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997, and a parallel investigation of the KCHC\n\nHospital Police pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law\n\nEnforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“§ 14141”).  The\n \nDepartment of Justice is authorized under CRIPA to seek a remedy\n\nfor a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the\n\nconstitutional or federal statutory rights of patients with\n\nmental illness who are treated in public institutions.  Section\n \n14141 authorizes the Department of Justice to seek a remedy for a\n\npattern or practice of police misconduct that violates citizens’\n\nconstitutional rights.1\n \nAs part of our investigation, during the spring, summer and\n\nfall of 2008, we conducted three on-site reviews of care and\n\ntreatment at KCHC and of the Hospital Police.  On these tours, we\n\nwere aided by expert consultants in the fields of psychiatry,\n\npsychology, psychiatric nursing, protection from harm, life\n \n1\n  Section 14141 does not mandate issuance of “findings.”  We\n \nhave not, however,  concluded our review of incidents involving the\n\nHospital Police and therefore have not yet determined whether\n\nHospital Police are engaging in a pattern or practice of excessive\n\nuse of force. \n\n\n- 2 ­\nsafety, discharge planning and community placement, and hospital\n\npolice and security.  While on-site, we interviewed\n\nadministrative staff, mental health care providers, hospital\n\npolice staff and patients, and examined the physical living\n\nconditions at the facility.  Additionally, before, during, and\n\nafter our on-site inspection tours, we reviewed an extensive\n\narray of documents, including policies and procedures, incident\n\nreports, and medical and mental health records.  Consistent with\n \nour commitment to provide technical assistance and conduct\n\ntransparent investigations, we concluded our tours with extensive\n\ndebriefings at which our consultants conveyed their initial\n\nimpressions and concerns to counsel, KCHC administrators and\n\nstaff, and City officials.\n \nWe appreciate the cooperation we received from the New York\n\nCity Health and Hospitals Corporation (“HHC”) and the New York\n\nCity Corporation Counsel’s office.  We also wish to thank the\n \nadministration and staff at KCHC for their professional conduct,\n\ntheir responsiveness to our information requests, and the\n\nextensive assistance they provided during our tour.  Further, we\n\nwish to especially thank those individual KCHC staff members,\n\nboth newly appointed and longstanding employees, who make daily\n\nefforts to provide appropriate care and treatment.  Those efforts\n \nwere noted and appreciated by the Department of Justice, the\n\nUnited States Attorney’s Office and our expert consultants.  We\n \nhope to continue to work cooperatively with HHC, KCHC and the\n\nCity of New York to address the deficiencies found at the\n\nfacility.\n \nIn accordance with statutory requirements, we now write to\n\nadvise you formally of the findings of our investigation, the\n\nfacts supporting them, and the minimum remedial steps that are\n\nnecessary to remedy the deficiencies set forth below.  42 U.S.C.\n \n§ 1997b(a). \n\nWe note, at the outset, however, that conditions at KCHC are\n\nparticularly disturbing.  Substantial patient harm occurs\n\nregularly due to KCHC’s failure to properly assess, diagnose,\n\nsupervise, monitor, and treat its mental health patients.  We are\n \nparticularly troubled by the patient death that occurred in June\n\n2008, where a patient was left unattended and died face down on\n\nthe floor as staff and security guards ignored her.  Further, we\n\nfind that the number of incidents of patient-on-patient\n\naggression is extraordinarily high and is continuing with little\n\nor no abatement.  Conditions at KCHC are highly dangerous and\n\nrequire immediate attention.  As a result, we issued three\n\nimmediacy letters (see attached) during the course of our\n \n\n- 3 ­\ninvestigation.2  In the first, dated June 18, 2008, we wrote to\n\nexpress our concerns regarding serious fire safety and sanitation\n\nissues in the mental health units.  On August 22, 2008, we sent a\n\nsecond immediacy letter, which cited several policies and\n\npractices at KCHC which posed imminent risks of serious harm to\n\npatients, including inadequate mental health assessments,\n\ninappropriate drug combinations, and inappropriate use of drugs\n\nsolely for their secondary sedative effect.  Each of these\n \ndeficiencies resulted in no treatment, or minimal treatment, for\n\nmentally ill patients.  We also identified in this letter\n \ninadequate care for patients with diabetes, inadequate medical\n\nemergency responses due to inadequate supervision and monitoring\n\nof patients and poorly trained personnel that contributed to the\n\ndeath of a patient in the psychiatric emergency room, and the\n\nfalsification of medical records.\n \nWe issued a third immediacy letter on November 7, 2008.\n\nThat letter detailed three recent serious incidents in the\n \ninpatient mental health units which posed imminent risk of\n\nserious harm to patients.  That risk of harm was generated in\n\nlarge part by inadequate, ineffective, and counterproductive\n\ntreatment and the resulting failure to identify and control\n\npatient aggression and to address suicidal ideation and\n\nattempts.3  Actual harm resulted from the incidents described in\n \nthe letter.  In one, a 14-year-old adolescent patient was\n\nsexually assaulted by another adolescent patient.  In the other,\n\nsix patients engaged in a brawl which resulted in one patient\n\nrequiring surgery to fix a fractured finger.\n \nMoreover, in addition to the notice we provided while\n\non-site, KCHC has been on notice for some time of many of the\n\nfindings we make in this letter, having been notified previously\n\nof deficiencies in the mental health service by other agencies.\n\nFor example, the United States Department of Health and Human\n\nServices, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in August\n\n2008, surveyed KCHC and described KCHC’s failure to meet federal\n\nregulatory standards regarding:  (1) protection from harm; \n\n2\n  In each of the letters, we noted that we had not yet\n\nreached a conclusion as to whether KCHC was engaging in a pattern or\n\npractice of violating the constitutional and federal statutory\n\nrights of patients, but nevertheless, the issues were being raised\n\nat that time due to the imminent risks of serious harm to patients\n\nthat required immediate attention.\n \n3\n  We note that once notified, KCHC began to take action to\n\naddress the deficiencies.\n \n\n- 4 ­\n(2) mental health treatment; (3) nursing and health care; and\n\n(4) specialized needs services, resulting in injuries to\n\npatients, including death.

New York City\n\nHealth and Hospitals Corp., et al., Civil Action No. CV-07-1819\n\n(KAM) (E.D.N.Y. May 2, 2007)).  This lawsuit challenges\n\nconditions of confinement at KCHC, including staff violence,\n\nfailure to provide adequate psychiatric and medical care, the use\n\nof physical and chemical restraints for punishment, and physical\n\nconditions.  In addition, the news media has reported on\n\nconditions at KCHC.5  Throughout this letter, we include specific\n\nreferences to past findings by these entities, where\n\nappropriate.6\n \n4  The Protection and Advocacy (“P&A”) system is a nationwide\n\nnetwork of federally mandated disability rights agencies.

BACKGROUND\n \nKCHC is a public acute care hospital operated by HHC, a\n\npublic benefit corporation created by New York State legislation\n\nin 1970 to oversee the public health system throughout the five\n\nboroughs of New York City.7  The psychiatric facility at KCHC\n\nconsists of:  (1) a dedicated psychiatric emergency department,\n\nwith a maximum capacity of 25 patients, as well as six Extended\n\nObservation Beds, known as the Comprehensive Psychiatric\n\nEmergency Program (“CPEP”); (2) a 160-bed adult inpatient unit;\n\nand (3) a 46-bed child and adolescent inpatient unit.  For\n \npurposes of this findings letter, “KCHC” refers to only these\n\nthree units, although the hospital itself provides a full range\n\nof other medical services.\n \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS\n \nThe Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause requires state\n\nmental health care facilities to provide patients with “adequate\n\nfood, shelter, clothing, and medical care,” along with conditions\n\nof reasonable care and safety, reasonably nonrestrictive\n\nconfinement conditions, and such treatment as may be reasonable\n\nin light of their constitutionally-based liberty interests.\n\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315, 319, 322, 324 (1982); see\n\nWoe v. Cuomo, 638 F.

New York City Department of Social Services,\n\n649 F.2d 134, 141 (2d Cir. 1981)(“[t]he law makes clear that\n\n‘[w]hen individuals are placed in custody or under the care of\n\nthe government, their governmental custodians are sometimes\n\ncharged with affirmative duties, the non-feasance of which may\n\nviolate the constitution’”); Society for Good Will to Retarded\n\nChildren, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1245, 1247 (2d Cir.\n\n1984).\n \n7\n  HHC provides medical, mental health and substance abuse\n\nservices through its 11 acute care hospitals, which include Kings\n\nCounty Hospital Center, four skilled nursing facilities, six large\n\ndiagnostic and treatment centers and more than 80 community based\n\nclinics.  HHC Health and Home Care division also provides home\n\nhealth care services, including nursing, physical therapy, speech\n\npathology, personal care, and housekeeping services.

Patients have a due process right\n\nto have all major decisions regarding their treatment made in\n\naccordance with the judgment of qualified professionals acting\n\nwithin professional standards.  Messier v. Southbury Training\n\nSchool, 562 F. Supp.2d 294, 301 (D. Conn. 2008); see also Hughes\n\nv. Cuomo, 862 F. Supp. 34, 37 (W.D.N.Y. 1994). \n\nIn addition, patients’ constitutional right to reasonable\n\nsafety compels public entities to provide reasonable protection\n\nfrom harm in mental health hospitals.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at\n \n315-16.  The Due Process Clause requires individualized treatment\n\nthat will give patients “a reasonable opportunity to be cured or\n\nimprove [their] mental condition.”  Donaldson v.

Public entities are also\n \ncompelled by the Constitution to ensure that patients are free\n\nfrom hazardous drugs which are “not shown to be necessary, used\n\nin excessive dosages, or used in the absence of appropriate\n\nmonitoring for adverse effects.”  Thomas S. v.

Further, it is a substantial departure\n\nfrom professional standards to rely routinely on seclusion and\n\nrestraint rather than behavior techniques, such as social\n\nreinforcement, to control aggressive behavior.  Thomas S., 699 F.\n \nSupp. at 1189.  Seclusion and restraint should be used only as a\n\nlast resort.  Id.\n \nFederal Medicare/Medicaid regulations governing certified\n\npsychiatric hospitals, such as KCHC, also require adequate\n\nstaffing, record keeping, care, treatment, and discharge\n\nplanning.  42 C.F.R. §§ 482-483.\n \nFinally, KCHC must provide services to qualified individuals\n\nwith disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to\n\ntheir needs.

L.C., 527 U.S.\n\n581 (1999).\n \n\n- 7 ­\nIII.  FINDINGS\n \nSignificant and wide-ranging deficiencies exist with respect\n\nto KCHC’s provision of care to its mental health patients.\n\nCertain conditions and services at KCHC substantially depart from\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards, and therefore violate\n\nthe constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients who\n\nreside there.\n \nA principal example of KCHC’s failure to provide care\n\nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards is the\n\nwell-publicized collapse and death of 49-year-old patient Esmin\n\nGreen.8   Ms. Green was admitted to the CPEP on June 18, 2008.\n\nShe remained there for almost 24 hours, without a bed, until\n\napproximately 5:30 a.m. on June 19, 2008.  At that time, she\n\ncollapsed from her chair and lay prone on the floor, limbs askew.\n\nShe remained face down on the floor for approximately one hour\n\nwithout any attention from staff. \n\nDuring that hour, surveillance video shows that several\n\nstaff members, including one doctor and two Hospital Police\n\nofficers, entered the waiting area, appeared to observe Ms. Green\n\nlying on the floor, and then left without offering any\n\nassistance.  In addition, although the video image was broadcast\n\nto surveillance monitors, the monitors’ images were either\n\nignored or unwatched by staff. \n\nAlthough Ms. Green can be observed on the surveillance video\n\nmoving occasionally while she lay on the floor, she appears to\n\nhave died before a medical code was called.  When staff responded\n\nto the code, the surveillance video shows a disorganized, and\n\nlargely medically inappropriate, emergency response.  Further,\n\nafter the incident, it was discovered that medical documents\n\nregarding the circumstances of Ms. Green’s death had been\n\nfalsified.9\n \nWhile perhaps unique in the extent of the harm that\n\nresulted, the tragic case of Ms. Green typifies the patterns of\n\ninadequate care and treatment of patients at KCHC.  In\n \nparticular, we find that KCHC:  (1) fails to adequately protect\n\nits patients from harm; (2) fails to provide adequate mental\n\nhealth care; (3) fails to provide adequate behavioral management\n \n8\n  We use Ms. Green’s full name herein because the\n \ncircumstances surrounding her death are matters of public record. \n\n9\n  We describe different aspects of KCHC staff’s handling of\n\nMs. Green’s collapse and death throughout this letter.\n \n\n- 8 ­\nservices; (4) fails to provide adequate medical and nursing care;\n\n(5) has inadequate quality management practices; (6) fails to\n\nprovide a safe physical environment; (7) has inadequate clinical\n\nleadership; and (8) fails to adequately develop discharge plans.\n\nMany of these deficiencies stem from a system that has neither\n\nclear, specific standards of care nor an adequately trained\n\nsupervisory, professional, and direct care staff.\n \nA.\t  Inadequate Protection From Harm\n \nPatients at KCHC have a right to live in reasonable safety.\n\nSee Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 322.  Generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards require that facilities appropriately\n\nmonitor and supervise patients in order to ensure their\n\nreasonable safety.  KCHC fails to provide a living environment\n\nthat complies with this constitutional mandate or generally\n\naccepted professional practices.  There are widespread patient-\n\nagainst-patient assaults and unchecked self-injurious behaviors.\n\nIn addition, the housing units contain environmental hazards,\n\nsome of which pose risks of serious injury, illness, and death.\n\nThe harm KCHC patients experience as a result of these\n\ndeficiencies is multi-faceted, and includes physical injury;\n\npsychological harm; excessive and inappropriate use of\n\nrestraints; inadequate, ineffective, and counterproductive\n\ntreatment; and frequent re-admissions leading to excessive\n\nhospitalizations.  The facility’s ability to address this harm is\n\nhampered by inadequate incident management and quality assurance\n\nsystems.\n \nIn addition, KCHC’s policies and practices with respect to\n\nmonitoring and supervising patients in its custody, especially\n\npatients assessed to be at risk, are inappropriate, ineffective,\n\nand often cause patient harm.  As discussed below, KCHC largely\n\nuses close (“one-to-one”) observation and physical and chemical\n\nrestraints to control patients who exhibit dangerous behavior,\n\noften to the exclusion of techniques which are less intrusive,\n\nless harmful, and often more effective.  The frequency and extent\n\nof use of these measures also is inappropriate.\n \n1.\t  Failure to Control Patient Aggression and Assaultive\n\nBehaviors \n\nPatient aggression is not adequately controlled on many of\n\nthe units at KCHC.10  Indeed, physical and sexual assaults are\n \n10\n  We notified counsel for KCHC of our concerns about patient\n\naggression and assaultive behaviors not being adequately controlled\n\nin our November 7, 2008 immediacy letter.\n \n\n- 9 ­\nnot uncommon at KCHC.  Several recent incidents reported to us by\n\nKCHC counsel are illustrative:\n \n•\t  On September 25, 2008, two 14-year-old youths, A.Z. and\n\nB.Y., engaged in reportedly consensual anal and oral sex in\n\nthe room of a third patient, C.X., even though both B.Y. and\n\nA.Z. were supposed to be checked every fifteen minutes by\n\nstaff.11  The next morning, A.Z. was assaulted by a\n\n16-year-old youth, E.V., who allegedly forced A.Z. to engage\n\nin oral sex with him.  E.V. was reportedly assigned to\n\nconstant one-to-one supervision by KCHC staff.  Notably,\n\nstaff learned of their activity only after another patient\n\ndisclosed the information two days after the first event.12\n \n• \t  On October 15, 2008, six patients on Unit G-41, all\n\nondifferent levels of observation, engaged in a brawl.  One\n \nof the patients, D.W., sustained an injury to his forehead\n\nand a compound fracture of his thumb which required surgery.\n \n•\t  On August 21, 2008, staff discovered a male patient standing\n\nin the activity room of Unit G-33 behind a female patient,\n\nF.A., engaged in sexual intercourse.  During patient\n\ninterviews by staff following the incident, the female\n\npatient reported that she had not consented to the sex.  The\n \nmale patient was arrested and charged with rape.\n \n•\t  On November 22, 2008, patient G.B., an 18-year-old male\n\npatient with mental retardation and autism, was admitted to\n\nthe CPEP.  On November 30, 2008, eight days later, he\n\nremained in the CPEP.13  On that date G.B. was found\n \n11  As we noted in our November 7, 2008 immediacy letter,\n\nalthough the medical records described this sexual behavior as\n\nconsensual, we believe this classification is questionable given the\n\nages of the boys and their mental status. \n\n12  To protect the patients’ identities, we use fictitious\n\ninitials throughout this letter.  We will separately transmit to\n\ncounsel a schedule cross-referencing the fictitious initials with\n\nthe patients’ names.\n \n13\n  We note that the length of this patient’s stay in the CPEP\n\nviolates the New York State Mental Hygiene Law and the Preliminary\n\nInjunction Consent Order dated July 2, 2008 issued by United States\n\nDistrict Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto in the Hirschfeld action.  Section\n \n9.40 of the New York State Mental Hygiene Law prohibits a hospital\n\nfrom keeping a patient in a CPEP for more than 24 hours without\n\neither an assignment to one of the six Extended Observation  beds in\n \nthe CPEP, or admission to one of the inpatient units.\n \n\n- 10 ­\nkneeling in a restroom in the CPEP in front of another male\n\npatient, apparently performing oral sex.  From the reports\n\nwe have received, G.B. did not consent to the sex; indeed,\n\nhe may not have had the mental capacity to consent.\n \nIn each of the incidents described above, our review of\n\nincident reports and patient records indicated that staff failed\n\nto properly monitor patients and failed to proactively address\n\npotentially aggressive behavior.  This problem requires immediate\n\nattention.14\n \n2.\t  Failure to Protect Patients Expressing Suicidal\n\nIdeation and Attempting Self-Harm\n \nA significant number of patients are admitted to KCHC for\n\nstabilization and protection because of suicidal ideation or\n\nsuicide attempts.  Our review reveals a troubling number of such\n\npatients who nonetheless obtained the means to attempt suicide\n\nand/or who inflicted serious self-harm.15\n \nThe medical record of one of the youths involved in the\n\nsexual incident which occurred on September 25 and 26, 2008, is\n\nillustrative of the problem.  A.Z., a 14-year-old youth, was\n\nassessed on admittance as being “suicidal.”  He had a history of\n\nsix previous psychiatric admissions at KCHC, most recently from\n\nMarch to May 2008.  A.Z.’s medical record details a history of\n\nA.Z. threatening to hurt himself, including threats to end his\n\nlife.  His most recent admission, on August 21, 2008, lists\n\n“aggressive and impulsive behaviors” and “danger to himself and\n\nothers” as the reason for his admission to KCHC. \n\n14  KCHC informs us that it has recently instituted a new\n\n“Violence Reduction Program” (“VRP”).  The VRP fails to promote an\n\nunderstanding of the etiology of the violent behavior or to guide\n\nthe treatment of aggressive patients accordingly.  Instead, it\n\nfocuses on patient self-management skills and serves as an advance\n\ndirective regarding medications that might be used pro re nata\n\n(“PRN”) or “as needed” as opposed to regularly scheduled\n\nmedications.  Violence prevention is not integrated into routine\n\nassessment, reassessment, and treatment planning. \n\n15\n  We notified counsel for KCHC of these serious concerns in\n \nour November 7, 2008 immediacy letter. \n\n\n- 11 ­\nOn September 21, 2008, A.Z. was involved in a physical\n\naltercation with E.V., the 16-year-old patient who would later\n\nsexually assault him.  No actions or changes were made to his\n\ntreatment plan16\n  until the next day, when A.Z. was placed on\n\nconstant one-to-one observation.17  Later that day, September 22,\n\n2008, A.Z. attempted suicide by wrapping a video game controller\n\nwire around his neck. \n\nOn September 25, 2008, A.Z. was taken off constant\n\none-to-one observation and placed on 15-minute observation.\n\nAlthough generally accepted professional standards require that\n\nsuch a change in status, including the rationale for the change,\n\nbe documented in the patient’s medical record, there is no such\n\nexplanation in the chart.  That same day, September 25, 2008,\n\nA.Z. was involved in the sexual incident described above.  The\n \nfollowing day, September 26, 2008, E.V. forced A.Z. to engage in\n\nsexual conduct with him. \n\nOn September 27, 2008, after KCHC officials learned of the\n\nsexual incidents, A.Z. was again placed on constant one-to-one\n\nobservation.  Later that same day, A.Z. again attempted to kill\n\nhimself by wrapping a video game controller wire around his neck.\n\nThe incident reports state merely that the patient was upset due\n \n16  A treatment plan is essentially a detailed roadmap of a\n\npatient’s entire course of treatment.  Generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards require that an adequate treatment plan be\n\ndeveloped under the direction of the treating psychiatrist, with\n\ninput from all disciplines involved in the treatment of the patient,\n\nas well as from the individual patient.  The treatment plan should\n\ncontain, at a minimum:  (1) an accurate diagnosis based on adequate\n\nassessments conducted by all relevant clinical disciplines; (2) a\n\nlist of problems caused by the patients’ illnesses; (3) clearly\n\narticulated goals for the patient, designed to ameliorate problems\n\nand promote functional independence; (4) a list of appropriate\n\ninterventions to guide staff in helping the patient achieve his or\n\nher stated goals; and (5) ongoing assessments and, as warranted,\n\nrevision of the treatment plan.  See Section III.B.2 infra for a\n \nmore detailed discussion of treatment planning issues.\n \n17\n  Constant one-on-one observation is a form of supervision\n\nin which a staff member must continually keep a patient in view.\n\nDOH’s July 2008 survey and CMS’ August 2008 survey note several\n\nincidents in which patients classified as suicidal appeared to be\n\nunsupervised in the CPEP for hours.  No evidence could be found\n \nshowing contact between the suicidal patients and physician or\n\nnursing staff eleven to twelve hours after admission. \n\n\n- 12 ­\nto a “previous incident earlier that day” but fails to describe\n\nor analyze the assault incidents, note the fact that patient was\n\non constant observation, or that the patient had previously\n\nattempted suicide.\n \nMoreover, our review of recent KCHC reports and incidents\n\nrevealed several other incidents of attempted suicide, some of\n\nwhich occurred while patients were on constant one-on-one\n\nobservation.  Examples include:\n \n•\t  H.C., a patient diagnosed with “psychosis NOS” and “rule out\n\nschizoaffective disorder,”18  began cutting herself with a\n\npaper clip and then swallowed the clip the morning of May\n\n28, 2008, while under close observation.  Later that day,\n\nwhile under constant one-to-one observation, H.C. was\n\nobserved tying a torn hospital gown around her neck.  The\n \ngown was taken away by staff and H.C. walked away, took\n\nstaples from a desk and then swallowed the staples in the\n\npresence of staff.  Both incidents were not labeled as a\n \nsuicide attempt but rather as a “minor self-inflicted\n\ninjury.”  Her record reflects no change in her treatment\n\nplan.  Changes to the treatment plan are necessary when\n\nthese types of incidents occur, to eliminate or address the\n\nself-destructive behavior.\n \n•\t  I.J. is a 47-year-old male with a history of drug abuse who\n\nwas brought to the CPEP on August 7, 2008 for psychiatric\n\nevaluation after reports were received that he was suicidal.\n\nI.J. was subsequently admitted to the adult inpatient\n \n18  “Psychosis NOS” means “psychosis, not otherwise\n\nspecified.”  This means that the patient’s symptoms fit within a\n\ngeneral diagnosis of psychosis (a severe mental disorder that\n\ninvolves a profound loss of contact with reality, including\n\ndelusions and hallucinations), but that the evaluating physician is\n\nunable to come up with a more specific diagnosis based on the\n\npatient’s symptoms.  “Rule out schizoaffective disorder” is not an\n \nofficial diagnosis, but rather a directive to assess the patient for\n\nsymptoms of schizoaffective disorder in order to eliminate it, or\n\n“rule it out,” from the list of possible diagnoses. (Schizoaffective\n\ndisorder is a disorder in which a patient exhibits symptoms of two\n\ndiseases at once:  (1) a mood disorder, such as depression; and (2)\n\nschizophrenia, which is a complex collection of symptoms persisting\n\nover time that include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized\n\nspeech and behavior, etc.  See Section III.B.1 infra for further\n \ndiscussion of the problems associated with “NOS” and “rule out”\n\ndiagnoses.\n \n\n- 13 ­\nservice and was placed on constant one-to-one suicidal\n\nobservation.  On August 11, 2008, I.J. attempted to tie a\n\nsheet around his neck and kill himself.  Although the staff\n\nmember assigned to the one-to-one observation ultimately\n\nintervened and removed the sheet, no action was taken to\n\nprevent the patient from tying the sheet around his neck in\n\nthe first instance.  During a post incident interview, I.J.\n\nstated that “he wanted to take his life.”  A subsequent\n\nreview by the Special Incident Review Committee (October 2,\n\n2008) concluded that the patient was appropriately monitored\n\nand that staff intervention was immediate and accordingly\n\nclosed the case with no recommendations for further actions.\n \nThe repeated and significant level of both aggressive and\n\nself-injurious behavior on the units suggests a fundamental\n\nfailure to address the root causes of patients’ inappropriate\n\nbehavior and demonstrates that KCHC fails to intervene adequately\n\nto prevent future incidents.  Moreover, despite the overuse of\n\nclose observation noted in Section III.C.1 infra, these incidents\n\nhighlight the inadequate oversight and monitoring of those with\n\naggressive or self-injurious behavior. \n\n3.  Inadequate Incident Management and Recordkeeping\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that\n\nfacilities have transparent and effective systems for\n\nidentifying, tracking, and correcting problems, adverse events,\n\nfaulty treatment, and staff adherence to policies and procedures.\n\nTo protect its patients, KCHC should have in place an incident\n\nmanagement system that helps to prevent incidents and ensures\n\nappropriate corrective action when incidents do occur.  An\n \neffective incident management system consists of several\n\nelements, including accurate reporting, thorough investigations,\n\ntracking, trending, analysis of data, and implementation and\n\nmonitoring of effective corrective and/or preventive actions.\n\nThe incident management system at KCHC falls significantly short\n\nof these standards.19  As a result, patients continue to be The\n\nexposed to actual and potential harm.\n \n19\n  As noted above, CMS, OMH, and DOH cited KCHC for its lack\n\nof adequate incident management and review systems.  Specifically,\n\nin its August 2008 survey, CMS cited KCHC for failing to analyze\n\ndata collected regarding adverse patient events.  OMH’s November\n \n2008 letter finds KCHC noncompliant with standards requiring, inter\n\nalia, identification of “patterns and trends through the compilation\n\nand analysis of incident data” and reviewing “patterns and trends to\n\nidentify appropriate preventive or corrective action.”  This is a\n \nrepeat citation by OMH from its May 2007 survey.  Finally, DOH also\n\ncited KCHC for the same problem in its July 2008 survey.\n \n\n- 14 ­\nIn addition, we note that KCHC’s incident investigations are\n\ninadequate.  The documentation of investigations that we have\n\nreviewed is cursory, incomplete, and lacks critical information\n\nnecessary to address clinical deficiencies.  Further, we found no\n\ndocumentation or other evidence to indicate that KCHC\n \nsystematically tracks staff adherence to policies and procedures,\n\nsuch as use of one-to-one observation and chemical or physical\n\nrestraints.  Similarly, we found no evidence that adverse events,\n\nsuch as use of Code Orange calls (KCHC terminology for calling\n\nfor emergency assistance) or staff or patient injuries, are\n\nuniformly tracked and that corrective actions are taken where\n\nneeded.\n \nB.  Failure To Provide Adequate Mental Health Care\n \nKCHC patients have a constitutional right to receive\n\nadequate mental health treatment.  Donaldson, 493 F.2d at 520.\n\nThe mental health services at KCHC, however, substantially depart\n\nfrom generally accepted professional standards.\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that the\n\ntreatment planning process incorporate a logical sequence of\n\ninterdisciplinary care:  (1) the formulation of an accurate\n\ndiagnosis based on adequate assessments conducted by all relevant\n\nclinical disciplines; (2) identification of the problems caused\n\nby patients’ illnesses; (3) establishment of goals designed to\n\nameliorate problems and promote functional independence;\n\n(4) identification of appropriate interventions to guide staff as\n\nthey work toward those goals; and (5) ongoing assessments and, as\n\nwarranted, revision of the treatment plan.  To be effective, the\n\ntreatment plan should be comprehensive and include input from\n\nvarious disciplines, as well as the individual patient, where\n\nappropriate, under the active direction and guidance of the\n\ntreating psychiatrist.\n \nKCHC treatment planning substantially departs from these\n\nstandards and fails to meet the fundamental requirements for the\n\ntreatment and rehabilitation of its patients.  As a result,\n\npatients’ actual illnesses are not properly assessed and\n\ndiagnosed; patients are not receiving appropriate treatment and\n\nrehabilitation; patients are at risk of harm from themselves and\n\nothers; patients are subject to excessive use of restrictive\n\ntreatment interventions; patients are at increased risk of\n\nrelapses and repeat hospitalizations; and patients’ options for\n\ndischarge are significantly limited, resulting in unnecessary\n\nhospitalization.\n \n\n- 15 ­\n1.  Inadequacy of Psychiatric Assessments and Diagnoses\n \na.  Inadequate Psychiatrist Assessments\n \nMental health treatment begins at the time of admission.\n\nThe admissions process is designed to establish the initial\n\ndiagnosis and sets forth the course of treatment.  Thus, an\n\naccurate assessment is crucial to proper treatment.  Clinicians\n \nmust perform thorough assessments to identify patients’ problems,\n\nstrengths and needs.  Proper assessment also is vital to identify\n\npotential risks from patients who are aggressive or may engage in\n\nself-injurious behavior, who are potential victims, or who\n\npresent high risks due to substance abuse or certain medical\n\nconditions.  Adequate assessments are essential to the\n\ndevelopment of a person-centered plan that can direct\n\nrehabilitation, treatment, and care while the patient resides in\n\nthe hospital, and to formulate an adequate discharge and\n\ntransition plan for the patient’s return to the community.\n\nGenerally accepted professional standards require that\n\npsychiatry, medicine, nursing, psychology and social work all\n\nprovide an assessment.\n \nAt a minimum, an initial assessment should include:  (1) an\n\nadequate review of the patient’s symptoms and mental status;\n\n(2) a provisional diagnosis and differential diagnosis that\n\npermits diagnosis and treatment options to be clarified over\n\ntime; and (3) a plan of care that includes specific medication\n\nand/or other interventions to ensure the safety of the patient\n\nand others. \n\nAs more information becomes available, the assessment must\n\nbe updated to include:  (1) a history of the patient’s presenting\n\nsymptoms; (2) the progression of the symptoms and setting within\n\nwhich the symptoms occur; (3) the relevant historical findings\n\nregarding the patient’s biopsychosocial (biological,\n\npsychological and social) functioning; (4) a review and critical\n\nexamination of diagnostic conclusions made in the past in light\n\nof new information; (5) a review of medical and neurological\n\nproblems, if any, and their impact on the current status of\n\nsymptoms and treatment; and (6) a complete mental status\n\nexamination. \n\nNumerous deficiencies exist in the initial assessments we\n \nreviewed at KCHC.  In many cases, initial assessments are cursory\n\nand untimely.  Patient histories and medical status are often\n \nincomplete and inadequate.  In addition, they are devoid of\n\ncommon psychiatric symptoms such as insomnia or loss of appetite\n \n\n- 16 ­\nand fail to document mania, depression, or anxiety.  They fail\n\nto identify the strengths of the patient.  They also frequently\n\nfail to assess substance abuse history, vocational and\n\neducational history, and history of community living and prior\n\nplacements.  The absence of this important information in the\n\nmedical record seriously impedes or limits the treatment team’s\n\nability to create an effective and appropriate treatment plan,\n\nwhich can lead to serious harm. \n\nAs a result of these flawed assessments, diagnoses are\n\nroutinely tentative, unspecified, or inconsistent with the\n\npatient’s symptoms.  We found many diagnoses listed as “rule out”\n\nor “not otherwise specified” (“NOS”).  These diagnoses are used\n\nby KCHC merely as catch-all categories.  They are not appropriate\n\nlong-term substitutes for genuine individualized assessments.\n\nHowever, in many cases, rule out and NOS diagnoses persist with\n\nno further diagnostic refinement.  We also saw evidence of\n \nmisdiagnoses which have not been adjusted to conform to patient\n\nbehavior and symptoms.  The medical record of patient J.P. is\n\nillustrative:\n \n•\t  J.P., who has had multiple re-admissions to KCHC,\n\nexemplifies the inadequacy of KCHC’s assessments.  He was\n \noriginally brought to the CPEP by police on December 21,\n\n2007, when he received a diagnosis of Psychosis NOS, and\n\nafter denying “suicidal and homicidal ideas...hallucinations\n\nand delusions,” was released.  He returned to KCHC on\n \nJanuary 26, 2008, after talking about jumping out a window.\n\nAfter again denying suicidal or homicidal ideation, J.P. was\n\nreleased.  He returned to KCHC on June 13, 2008 and was\n\ngiven a diagnosis of mood disorder NOS.  There is no\n \naccompanying psychiatric note or evaluation of his prior\n\nadmissions.  Several days later, pursuant to KCHC’s\n\ntreatment plan for him, he began receiving medication that\n\nhe failed to take and had failed to take previously.  He was\n \nreleased again on July 3, 2008 after denying suicidal or\n\nhomicidal ideation.  Ten days later, on July 13, 2008, J.P.\n\nwas readmitted.  Even though he was diagnosed as manic, with\n\na mood disorder, he was diagnosed upon this admission with\n\npsychosis NOS and rule out bipolar disorder.  The absence of\n \na definitive diagnosis has perpetuated a generic treatment\n\napproach that has repeatedly failed this patient.  J.P.’s\n \nrecord reflects the absence of meaningful assessment,\n\nreassessment, or targeted treatment.  The patient was\n\nrepeatedly discharged and readmitted with no reflection on\n\nthe reasons for his recidivism and no change in treatment.\n \n\n- 17 ­\nb.  Inadequate Nursing Assessments\n \nWe found that nursing assessments also were deficient.\n\nNurses are a primary source of information regarding patients who\n\nneed medical attention, as they are often the first clinician to\n\nsee and evaluate the patient.  We found that initial nursing\n\nassessments at KCHC are cursory, and the assessment process and\n\nthe nursing assessment form used by KCHC do not permit for\n\ncomprehensive or individualized assessments.  The assessment form\n \ndoes not have sufficient space to allow nurses to write\n\nindividualized findings, and there is no summary section for risk\n\nfactors that would prompt nurses to think about the patient’s\n\nneeds in a comprehensive way. \n\nSome examples of inadequate nursing assessments, which in\n\nturn often leads to inadequate treatment, include:\n \n•\t  The nursing assessments we reviewed for patient H.C. lacked\n\ncritical information.  Upon her admission to the inpatient\n\nunit, there were no notes in her assessment indicating\n\nsocial or medical problems.  However, other documentation\n\ncontained in H.C.’s chart raised clear concerns about her\n \nsocial history and medical problems.  She was noted to be\n \nassaultive, abusive, electively mute, upset about her\n\nroommate, and had been sexually abused by her brother in the\n\npast.  In addition, she has asthma, Hepatitis C, and seizure\n\ndisorder.  None of these are noted in the nursing\n\nassessments.\n \n•\t  Thirty-seven-year-old W.H. was admitted with a history of\n\nmental illness and substance abuse.  The CPEP nursing\n\nassessments of W.H. were largely illegible.  Where they were\n\nlegible, the assessments were not adequate in that they\n\nprovided insufficient detail.  For example, her speech was\n\ndescribed merely as “incoherent” with no further details.\n\nHer thought content was described as “unable to assess”\n\nalthough W.H. was apparently communicating on some level.\n\nThe rest of the nursing assessment stated “unable to\n\nassess,” though the record indicates that the social worker\n\nelicited information the nurse failed to capture.\n \n•\t  Patient X.I. was admitted in July 2008 for disorganized\n\nbehavior and delusions.  Most of the nursing assessment was\n\nleft blank, even in sections where staff could have assessed\n\nX.I. without his cooperation.\n \n\n- 18 ­\nKCHC’s failures in the preliminary stages of assessment and\n\ndiagnosis, as well as its failure to reassess patients to refine\n\ndiagnoses, grossly depart from generally accepted professional\n\nstandards.  Patients receive, or are at risk of receiving,\n\ntreatment that, at best, is unnecessary and, at worst, may\n\nactually exacerbate their mental illnesses.  The result is that\n \nthe actual mental illness is often unaddressed, placing patients\n\nat risk of prolonged institutionalization and/or repeated\n\nadmissions to the facility. \n\n2.  Inadequate Treatment Plans\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that\n\ntreatment plans be individualized and specifically connected to\n\npatient problems and needs.  The KCHC population presents severe\n\npsychopathology and behavioral disturbances that require\n\nindividualized and intensive treatment programs that are\n\ncustomized to address the cognitive disabilities that are a key\n\npart of their illnesses.  However, just as KCHC does not conduct\n\nassessments that address patients’ specific problems or needs, it\n\nalso uses boilerplate forms and checklists which require staff\n\nonly to check off problems and treatment recommendations or\n\nbriefly fill in blanks, rather than write individualized\n\nnarratives.20\n   \nAs a result, treatment plans do not specifically address\n\nproblems that have led patients to be hospitalized.  Many of the\n\ncharts our experts reviewed reflected that patients with very\n\ndifferent problems, which by generally accepted professional\n\nstandards would require individualized treatment plans, instead\n\nreceive exactly the same treatment plans.  Moreover, patients\n\nwith specialized needs do not have treatment plans specifically\n\ntailored to their needs and are not being adequately treated,\n\nincluding those with severe behavioral problems, those with\n\nsuicidal ideation and self-injurious behaviors, and those who are\n\ndually diagnosed with mental illness and substance abuse or\n\ndevelopmental disabilities. \n\nMoreover, just as KCHC’s assessments do not properly\n\ngenerate appropriate treatment plans, treatment plans do not link\n \n20\n  Various treatment planning failures by KCHC were in cited\n\nin OMH’s September 2004, June 2005, January 2006, September 2007,\n\nand August 2008 reports, such as lack of treatment goals in\n\ntreatment plans, pre-dated treatment plans, failure to identify\n\nactivity and therapy groups in treatment plans, missing treatment\n\nplan reviews, and a lack of interdisciplinary involvement in\n\ntreatment planning.\n \n\n- 19 ­\nto discharge needs.21  Discharge plans, in turn, focus almost\n\nentirely on placement options and neglect what the patient needs\n\nin order to get placed and to reduce the risk of re­\nhospitalization. \n\nFailure to provide appropriate and effective treatment\n\ntargeted to specific patient needs is harmful in a number of\n\nways.  It permits dangerous behaviors to persist, it fails to\n\naddress behavioral and psychiatric problems that led to\n\nhospitalization, it lengthens stays unnecessarily, it leads to\n\nthe use of chemical and mechanical restraints, and it increases\n\nthe likelihood of relapse and re-hospitalization. \n\nNursing involvement is particularly important in the\n\ntreatment planning process.  Yet, nurses at KCHC do not appear to\n\nhold a central or consistent role in treatment planning.  Nurses\n \nare largely relegated to medication management and assuring\n\nimplementation of close observations, which are often deficient,\n\nas described in Section III.C.1 infra.  There is also a lack of\n \nprofessional nurse interventions in any consistent manner, or in\n\na manner that reflects nursing leadership in the care and\n\ntreatment of patients. \n\nExamples of inappropriate treatment include: \n\n•\t  R.E. is a 46-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder.\n\nOver the course of a one month stay, he had ten episodes\n\nthat led to placement in four-point restraints and the use\n\nof STAT medications.22  Notably, there was no change in his\n\ntreatment plan to address his behavior, and the plan was\n\nlimited to a boilerplate reference to a number of individual\n\ncontacts with nursing staff and a small number of unit-wide\n\ntreatment groups.\n \n•\t  V.O. is a 37-year-old male diagnosed with bipolar disorder\n\nwith mania.  The medical record contains the standard\n \ntreatment plan:  mandating of twenty minutes of individual\n\nand group therapy three times per week.  His treatment plan\n\nreflects no changes over time, despite nursing and doctor's\n \n21\n  An adequate treatment plan will address goals and plans\n\nfor a patient after he or she is discharged from the hospital, both\n\nto aid the patient in making a successful transition to the\n\ncommunity, and to prevent or minimize future hospitalizations.\n\nKCHC’s treatment plans fail to adequately cover these elements.\n \n22\n  STAT is a medical term meaning “immediate.”  A STAT\n \nmedication is one that is to be given immediately in response to an\n\nemergency or other urgency. \n\n\n- 20 ­\nnotes that consistently indicate that V.O. remains agitated,\n\ndisorganized, and threatening to staff and others.\n \n•\t  Z.U. is a 49-year-old male with schizophrenia, multiple\n\nhospitalizations and a history of substance abuse.  His\n \ntreatment plan states that “pt. will participate in groups\n\n3xs per week for at least 45 min to improve reality\n\norientation.”  Our medical record review covered three\n \nseparate admissions.  His diagnosis changed across the\n\nadmissions, but there was no substantive change in his\n\ntreatment plan upon each admission to address his specific\n\nmental illness.\n \n•\t  R.Q. is a 20-year-old male diagnosed with schizoaffective\n\ndisorder and mental retardation.  He has had multiple\n\nadmissions and a previous diagnosis of autism.  R.Q. has a\n\nhistory of violence and his medical record documents\n\nmultiple episodes in which he was assaulted by other\n\npatients or he assaulted others.  There is no specific\n\ntreatment plan to deal with his acting out or being\n\nvictimized, except that he was transferred between units on\n\nmultiple occasions.  The treatment plan does not address his\n\ndiagnoses of mental retardation and autism or his history of\n\nviolence.\n \n•\t  L.R. is a 33-year-old male diagnosed as psychotic and\n\ndelusional.  Nursing notes consistently report he spends\n\nexcessive time in the bathroom and he was seen repeatedly\n\ninducing vomiting, but his treatment plan fails to address\n\nthese behaviors.  The record also notes multiple falls, but\n\nthere was no treatment response.  A medical consult,\n\nconducted after L.R. was on the unit for almost three weeks,\n\ndocumented polydipsia23\n  (excessive drinking of water). \n\nHowever, there were no nursing notes in his treatment plan\n\nregarding his water consumption.  He was transferred to the\n \nmedical unit and then to an inpatient psychiatric unit,\n\nwhere notes indicate he was incontinent of urine and feces. \n\nThere is no specific treatment plan for these behavior\n\nproblems, either.\n \nWe also reviewed the records of ten other patients who were\n\ndually diagnosed with mental illness and substance abuse.  These\n \npatients were not provided any specific substance abuse\n \n23\n  Polydipsia is a common disorder characterized by drinking\n\nexcessive amounts of water to quench a constant thirst.  This\n \ncondition is prevalent in patients who spend significant amounts of\n\ntime in psychiatric facilities, particularly those patients\n\ndiagnosed with schizophrenia.  This condition may cause\n\nincontinence, vomiting, seizures, water intoxication, or even death.\n \n\n- 21 ­\ntreatment.  They were provided only once a week, unit-wide\n\nsubstance abuse groups.  This treatment is not sufficiently\n\nfrequent or individualized to address the needs of individuals\n\nwith substance abuse problems. \n\n3.  Lack of Systematic, Ongoing Assessment\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that all\n\npatients be assessed not just at admission, but on an ongoing\n\nbasis.  It is extremely difficult to diagnose patients fully at\n\ntime of admission when they are acutely ill, uncooperative, and\n\nmay be under the influence of alcohol or street drugs.\n\nAccordingly, diagnoses and problem lists should change as\n\npatients stabilize and become more comfortable admitting problems\n\nand symptoms.\n \nAppropriate updating and revisions of diagnoses is uncommon\n\nat KCHC.  KCHC has no systematic review or evaluation process for\n\npreparing diagnoses, and boilerplate forms make it too easy for\n\nstaff to copy the language of previous diagnoses.  Indeed, intake\n\ndiagnoses and problem lists are often unmodified throughout\n\npatient stays, even as new information about patients becomes\n\navailable over time.  This contributes, as noted in the next\n\nsection of this letter, to unmodified treatment plans, even as\n\npatients’ conditions change.\n \n4.  Failure to Modify Treatment Plans\n \nA direct result of KCHC’s failure to conduct ongoing\n\nassessments is that it does not modify treatment plans to address\n\nchanges in patient behavior or condition.  Generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards require regular review of treatment plans\n\nwith adjustments contingent on progress or the lack of progress.\n\nKCHC medical records contain updated treatment planning forms,\n\nbut the updates generally do not reflect substantive clinical\n\nreviews with modifications based on patient response.  We found a\n \nnumber of charts in which patients exhibited significant,\n\npersistent behavior problems over time, but no changes were made\n\nin the treatment plan.  In many cases, regardless of their\n\nefficacy, treatment plans for various patients used exactly the\n\nsame language repeatedly, despite clear notations in the progress\n\nnotes that there was no change in inappropriate behavior.\n\nOverall, the records do not suggest a sense of urgency to provide\n\nactive treatment to deal with recurrent problems, and there is no\n\nevidence that treatment teams explore options or seek\n\nconsultations with colleagues or outside experts.\n \n\n- 22 ­\nExamples of non-responsive treatment planning include:\n \n•\t  N.S. is a 14-year-old male.  The medical record notes more\n \nthan 20 episodes of four-point restraint and administration\n\nof IM (intramuscular) medication for threatening behavior\n\nand verbal abuse during his more than seven-month stay at\n\nKCHC.  On August 15, 2008, his attending psychiatrist\n\nreported that “[N.S.’s] continued stay in the acute setting\n\nis detrimental to his well-being.  He will likely continue\n\nto have acting out behavior.  It is recommended that he be\n \nin a program that is able to meet his special needs.”\n\nNonetheless, his treatment plan was identical for the entire\n\nseven-month stay.\n \n•\t  T.F. is a 46-year-old female with paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nShe is unable to care for herself and needs an interpreter\n\nas she speaks no English.  The treatment plan we reviewed\n\nwas minimal and not suited to her illness or her inability\n\nto speak English.  While the treatment plan updates note a\n\nlack of progress, there is no substantive change in the\n\ntreatment plan that could lead to such progress or\n\nimprovement.\n \n•\t  M.M. is a 16-year-old male with a diagnosis of schizophrenia\n\nor bipolar disorder.  He was on the child and adolescent\n \nunit for six months with repeated reports of aggressive\n\nacting out and disruptive behavior.  He was placed in\n\nrestraints multiple times for assaultive behavior, but there\n\nwas virtually no change in his treatment plan.\n \n5.\t  Ineffectiveness of Treatment Team Process\n \nA significant reason for the deficiencies cited above is\n\nthat KCHC’s treatment team process does not comport with\n\ngenerally accepted practices.  Generally accepted professional\n\nstandards call for treatment to be guided by a multi-disciplinary\n\nteam in which diverse professional expertise and observations are\n\nemployed, in an inter-disciplinary process, to evaluate patients\n\nand develop treatment plans. \n\nAlso, contrary to generally accepted professional standards,\n\nit appears that, at KCHC, treatment planning by the different\n\ndisciplines is done in isolation rather than in an integrative\n\nmanner.  Staff members spend most of their time in treatment team\n\nmeetings describing events that occurred the previous day or\n\nentering notes into patient’s charts.  There is little discussion\n \nof treatment or substantive discussion of patients’ conditions.\n\nPatients do not regularly participate.  There is little \n\ninter-disciplinary interchange. \n\n\n- 23 ­\nThe fact that team meetings are not used to share expertise\n\nand ideas significantly limits the ability of staff to develop\n\nsuitable treatment plans and contributes to the failure of many\n\nplans.  It also diminishes the ability of staff to effectively\n\nrevise plans that are not working.\n \nWe also find that nurses’ involvement in treatment\n \nactivities was not adequate.  We found that treatment on the\n \nadult inpatient units appears to be largely generic and\n\ncustodial.  Additionally, the nursing activity schedule for the\n\nunits does not reflect treatment groups run by other disciplines.\n\nPatients’ records also fail to consistently reflect participation\n\nin such groups.  Further, there was no documentation summarizing\n\nan individual patient’s treatment activities reflected in either\n\nthe treatment plan or the discharge plan summary.\n \nFinally, KCHC does not appear to track or review individual\n\npatients who are not making progress or who repeatedly exhibit\n\nthe same problematic behaviors.  This lack of oversight permits\n\nineffective treatment to continue without detection or\n \ncorrection.  This presents a clear danger to patients and staff\n\nbecause it permits faulty practices to be repeated, with no\n\ncorrective action taken.  We were told that new policies,\n\nsystems, and procedures were being put in place by some of the\n\nnew administrative and supervisory staff, but there is no\n\nevidence as to when and how these changes will be implemented. \n\n6.  Inadequate Medication Management and Monitoring\n \nMedication practices at KCHC substantially depart from the\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards require that the pharmacological component\n\nof a treatment plan reflect the exercise of professional judgment\n\nfor medication treatment including:  diagnosis, target symptoms,\n\nrisks and benefits of particular medications, and consideration\n\nof alternate treatments.  The rationale for each patient’s course\n\nof treatment should be included in the physician’s progress\n\nnotes.  Psychotropic medications should be used as an integral\n\npart of a treatment program to manage specific behaviors in the\n\nleast restrictive manner, to eliminate targeted\n\nbehaviors/symptoms, and to treat specific psychiatric disorders.\n\nAdditionally, medications should be integrated with any\n\nbehavioral intervention plan.  Medications should be carefully\n\nmonitored and tracked.  Medication changes, as well as the\n\nrationale for the changes, should be documented in a physician’s\n\norder.  All lengthy administrations of medication should be\n \n\n- 24 ­\nperiodically re-evaluated to assess their efficacy.  KCHC’s\n \npractices fall far short of all of these requirements.24\n \nKCHC’s practices have led to the inappropriate use of\n\nmedication.  As noted above, assessments are deficient.  As a\n \nresult, the rationale justifying why certain medications are\n\nprescribed is not stated in patients’ charts or is stated very\n\ngenerally (e.g., “psychosis”).  In addition, medications at KCHC\n\nare frequently prescribed in reaction to events without an\n\nassessment or modification of the treatment plan.  KCHC therefore\n \nfrequently administers PRN (pro re nata or “as needed”)\n\nmedication that is not targeted to specific symptoms of mental\n\nillness, and lacks adequate justification.  For example, T.Z. is\n\na 16-year-old adolescent with an IQ of 40.  He has been both a\n \nvictim and perpetrator of violence prior to and during his\n\nhospital stay.  Most recently, he was admitted due to assaultive\n\nbehavior.  T.Z. continues to receive a variety of PRN medications\n\nthat are not targeted to alleviate or address any specific\n\nsymptoms. \n\nIn addition, KCHC contemporaneously uses multiple\n\nmedications in the same class to treat the same condition\n \n(usually referred to as intraclass polypharmacy) without a\n\nclinical justification.  This falls outside of generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards.  The problem is recognized by KCHC in a\n\nmemorandum to “All Prescribers” dated March 28, 2008 on the\n\nsubject “Applied Psychopharmacology.”  The memorandum prohibits\n\nthe then-common practice of simultaneous intramuscular injection\n\nof two antipsychotics.  Nonetheless, KCHC physicians continue to\n\nroutinely use drug combinations of anticholinergics,\n\nantipsychotics, and benzodiazapines that are not clinically\n\njustified.  This can cause substantial patient harm, including\n\noverdose and serious side effects.\n \nMoreover, rather than prescribing antipsychotic medications\n\nand benzodiazepines for their specific purpose -- medications to\n\nalleviate or minimize symptoms of psychosis and anxiety -- it\n\nappears that clinicians inappropriately prescribe these\n\nmedications to sedate and control patients, and as a substitute\n\nfor appropriate therapeutic interventions.  This too is\n \n24\n  Notably, CMS’s August 2008 letter cites KCHC’s failure to\n\nprovide appropriate evaluation of care -- including medication\n\nmonitoring -–  for each patient.  As an example, it notes that a\n\nnurse responsible for entering progress notes on six patients\n\nacknowledged to CMS surveyors that she did not know the diagnosis or\n\nmedications of any of those patients.\n \n\n- 25 ­\ninappropriate, and can cause patient harm, by subjecting patients\n\nto unnecessary medication.\n \nAdditionally, generally accepted professional standards\n\nrequire that facilities like KCHC adopt and incorporate the\n\nnecessary protections and safeguards to ensure that patients are\n\nafforded safe and effective pharmacological treatment.  Hospitals\n\nsuch as KCHC must have mechanisms to:  (1) monitor practitioners’\n\nadherence to specific and current guidelines in the use of each\n\nmedication; (2) report and analyze adverse drug reactions; and\n\n(3) report, analyze, and document actual and potential variations\n\nin the prescription, transcription, procurement/storage,\n\ndispensing and administration of medications.  To the extent that\n \nthese mechanisms exist at KCHC, they are inadequate.  Because\n \nKCHC’s psychiatrists rarely analyze the use of PRN and STAT\n\nmedications or patients’ reactions to them, they cannot refine\n\npatients’ diagnoses and adjust routinely administered\n\nmedications.  Without such monitoring, patients are at risk of\n\nbeing overly and/or improperly medicated.  This practice\n\nconstitutes chemical restraint, which violates federal\n\nregulations.  See 42 C.F.R. § 482.13.  This practice also\n\nsubstantially departs from generally accepted professional\n\nstandards.\n \nKCHC’s current system to track and analyze adverse drug\n\nreactions also is deficient and seriously under-reports problems.\n\nNo data is compiled regarding basic components, such as a\n\ndefinition of an adverse drug reaction, a severity scale, a\n\nprobability scale, or a description of patient outcome.  There\n \nare no established thresholds triggering analysis of adverse drug\n\nreactions.  There is no data analysis to indicate individual or\n\ngroup practitioner trends.  And, there is no evidence that any\n\ndata on adverse drug reactions have been used for performance\n\nimprovement activities.  For example, drug utilization\n\nevaluations (“DUEs”) are not used to track and analyze adverse\n\ndrug reactions.\n \nC.  Inadequate Behavioral Management Services\n \nBehavioral management is the use of systematic behavioral\n\n(social learning) strategies.  These are often the best, and\n\nonly, non-intrusive approaches to eliminate dangerous behaviors\n\nand teach patients more adaptive ways to behave.  Accordingly,\n\nbehavioral plans should, in accordance with generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards, contain certain basic elements, including\n\nan analysis of the reasons for the behavior and its frequency,\n\nand its causes.  The plan should also identify specific\n\ninterventions by trained staff in order to address and modify the\n \n\n- 26 ­\nbehavior.  The behavior plan should thereafter be integrated with\n\nthe patient’s overall plan of care. \n\nKCHC fails to provide adequate behavioral management.\n\nBehavioral management plans are not well integrated into overall\n\ntreatment, and staff lacks the skills and training necessary to\n\nhandle the large number of very impaired patients who are\n\ndangerous to themselves or others or who have specialized needs.\n\nContrary to generally accepted professional standards, staff at\n\nKCHC is focused primarily on controlling patients with\n\ninappropriate behavior rather than treating them and teaching\n\nthem alternative, adaptive behavior.  Accordingly, in lieu of\n\nappropriate treatment, staff resort to close observation (which\n\nis often lax as demonstrated by serious incidents described in\n\nSection III.A.2 supra), restraint, and inappropriate medication\n\npractices.  Indeed, KCHC fails to use systemic behavioral (social\n\nlearning) strategies to eliminate dangerous behaviors and teach\n\npatients more adaptive ways to behave.  This problem is\n\nexacerbated by KCHC’s failure to provide a centralized system of\n\noversight, review, feedback, and expert consultation, where\n\nnecessary, to protect patients and ensure that adequate treatment\n\nis provided.  The result is that patients with the most severe\n\nneeds receive inadequate therapeutic care and treatment.\n \n1.  Inappropriate Use of Close Observation\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that close\n\nobservation of mental health patients be used only when\n\nnecessary.  It is sometimes appropriate for patients who are at\n\nhigh risk of engaging in self-harm or harm to others.  However,\n\nit is costly to use and removes staff from other therapeutic\n\nactivities, is stigmatizing for patients, it restricts privacy\n\nand freedom, and it is often disruptive to clinical units.\n\nMoreover, it is a management procedure, not a treatment\n\nprocedure, and does not teach patients more adaptive ways to\n\nbehave. \n\nKCHC does not use close observation consistent with these\n \nprinciples.  Rather, it purportedly uses close observation\n\nexcessively and performs it incorrectly.  At KCHC, close\n\nobservation is initiated for almost all new patients who have\n\nsuicidal ideation or are potentially violent.  A large proportion\n\nof patients are maintained at this level of observation\n\nthroughout their stay at KCHC whether or not warranted by their\n\nbehavior.  Indeed, it appears to be standard operating procedure\n\nat KCHC to use one-to-one in lieu of proper treatment; however,\n\nits use has been ineffective.  For example (as described above):\n \n\n- 27 ­\n•\t  The three adolescent youths who were involved in sexual\n\nactivity on September 25, 2008 and September 26, 2008 were\n\nall on close observation by a different staff member prior\n\nto the incident.  Each observation of the patients was\n\nindicated in the patients’ charts with the initials of the\n\nstaff members responsible for the observation, presumably\n\nsignifying that the required observation had occurred.\n\nHowever, neither incident was detected at the time it\n\noccurred.  In fact, the incidents became known to staff only\n\nwhen another boy reported it two days later.  Based on the\n \nincidents that transpired, it is implausible that KCHC staff\n\nwas appropriately performing the required observations.\n \n2.\t  Inappropriate Use of Four-Point Restraints and\n\nEmergency (STAT) Medications To Manage Patient Behavior\n \nThe right to be free from undue bodily restraint is the core\n\nof the liberty protected from arbitrary governmental action by\n\nthe Due Process Clause.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 316.  Thus, KCHC\n\nmay not restrain mental health patients “except when and to the\n\nextent professional judgment deems this necessary to assure\n\n[reasonable] safety [for all residents and personnel within the\n\ninstitution] or to provide needed training.”  Id. at 324.\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that\n\nrestraints:  (1) will be used only when persons pose an immediate\n\nsafety threat to themselves or others and after a hierarchy of\n\nless restrictive measures have been attempted; (2) will not be\n\nused in the absence of, or as an alternative to, active\n\ntreatment, as punishment, or for the convenience of staff;\n\n(3) will not be used as a behavioral intervention; and (4) will\n\nbe terminated as soon as the person is no longer a danger to\n\nhimself or others.  KCHC's use of restraints substantially\n\ndeparts from these standards and exposes patients to excessive\n\nand unnecessarily restrictive interventions.\n \nNew York Mental Hygiene Law § 33.04 and generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards require that restraints be used only when\n\nless restrictive procedures have not been effective.  We found\n \nthat KCHC does not consistently follow these standards.  KCHC\n \nexcessively relies upon four-point restraints and STAT\n\nmedications to deal with patients who aggressively act out,\n\nregardless of whether the patients pose a continuous threat.  Our\n \nexperts also found little evidence that less restrictive means\n\nwere employed before restraints were applied, such as proactive\n\nassessment to identify risky situations, moving patients to quiet\n\nareas, or calming conversations with trained staff.  It also\n \nappears that restraints are often used even though the patient\n \n\n- 28 ­\nhas changed his or her behavior and does not pose any further\n\nrisk. \n\nKCHC policy also requires that restraints may not be applied\n\nfor more than two hours and that patients should be released\n\nsooner if they are no longer agitated or dangerous.  Most\n \nexamples we reviewed indicate that patients remained in\n\nrestraints for two full hours regardless of changes in their\n\nbehavior.  There is also no indication in the progress notes or\n\nrestraint orders that patients are clearly told why they are\n\nbeing put in restraints and what the criteria are for release.\n\nAbsent clear communication to the patient and absent evidence of\n\ncontinued risk, four-point restraint serves as a punishment for\n\nacting out rather than as a therapeutic vehicle or a safety\n\nstrategy.25\n \n3. \t Inappropriate Transfers of Patients In Lieu of\n\nTreatment\n \nInstead of providing appropriate behavioral interventions,\n\nKCHC resorts to inappropriate transfers of patients between units\n\nas a response to inappropriate behaviors.  Moving patients is\n\nstigmatizing, clinically disruptive, and generally does not\n\nimprove patient behavior.  Although moving a patient can be\n\nclinically appropriate at times, the medical records we reviewed\n\ndo not indicate that transfers at KCHC are implemented with any\n\nclinical rationale.  Rather, transfers appear to be used largely\n\nto remove a patient who engages in aggressive behavior or who is\n\na victim of patient aggression.  Moreover, patients are being\n\ntransferred in lieu of providing appropriate treatment.  The\n \nfollowing examples are illustrative:\n \n•\t  V.G. is an 18-year-old woman with a diagnosis of bipolar\n\ndisorder with mania who has been admitted to KCHC four times\n \nin six months.  She was repeatedly agitated, intrusive,\n\nhostile, and sexually preoccupied.  While there is no\n \nspecific treatment plan for these problems or her sexual\n\npreoccupation, V.G. has repeatedly transferred from unit to\n\nunit due to these problems.\n \n•\t  M.T. is a 52-year-old male with a diagnosis of\n\nschizoaffective disorder.  In six weeks at KCHC, he resided\n \n25\n  OMH cited KCHC for its overuse of restraints in its\n \nNovember 2008 and April 2006 surveys.  Specifically, OMH found that\n\nrestraints are not used “only when absolutely necessary to protect\n\nthe patient or others from injury.”\n \n\n- 29 ­\nin three different units.  He was admitted to one unit, but\n\ntransferred to a second unit after an altercation with\n \nstaff.  He was then transferred to a third unit for\n \nassaultive behavior on the second unit.  While on the third\n \nunit, he attacked a peer.  M.T.’s treatment plan fails to\n\naddress his aggressive behavior. \n\nD.\t  Failure to Provide Adequate Medical and Nursing Care\n \n1. \t Inadequate Assessments and Monitoring\n \nAs with psychiatric treatment, effective medical services\n\ndepend on timely, thorough assessments and monitoring.  KCHC\n \nstaff often fail to provide even the most basic care, opting\n\ninstead for a reactive approach in which they address patients’\n\nmedical needs only after problems develop.  This exposes patients\n\nto a significant risk of harm and causes patients often to suffer\n\npreventable injuries and illnesses. \n\nFor example, we found that patient weights, although taken\n\non admission, do not seem to be monitored consistently.  Nor do\n \nnurses appear to note Body Mass Index values with any\n\nconsistency, despite a KCHC policy requiring the capture and\n\nrecording of this data.  Monitoring weight gain in psychiatric\n\npatients is particularly important because many medications can\n\nproduce rapid weight gain, which in turn can lead to medical\n\nproblems, including diabetes and hypertension, that are\n\nexacerbated by excess weight. \n\nWe highlighted one example of KCHC’s failure to provide\n\nadequate basic medical care in our August 22, 2008 immediacy\n\nletter (attached).  In that letter, we described a patient on\n\nUnit G-53 who had uncontrolled diabetes.  Her blood sugar\n\nreadings ranged from 40 to 400 over the course of one 24-hour\n\nperiod.26  Her chart indicated that nothing was done to stabilize\n\nher condition.  This put the patient at immediate risk of harm,\n\nincluding diabetic shock or stroke.\n \nAdditional examples include:\n \n•\t  Patient R.R. was admitted on October 2, 2007 with a\n\npsychiatric diagnosis of bipolar, mixed with psychotic \n\n26\n  The normal/safe range for blood sugar is 100 or less.\n\nThe failure to control sugar levels can result in blindness,\n\nstroke and other serious or even life-threatening conditions.\n \n\n- 30 ­\nfeatures, and a history of substance abuse.  R.R. also had\n \nother serious medical issues, including obesity (he weighs\n\n425 lbs.), hypertension, lipidemia (the presence of excess\n\nfat in the blood), and diabetes.  R.R.’s treatment plan did\n\nnot address any of his medical issues.  Eight days after his\n\nadmission, he was taken to the medical emergency room after\n\nhe suffered a stroke.  Only after he returned to the\n\nbehavior health service was his medical record corrected to\n \nnote his history of hypertension and diabetes.\n \n•\t  O.L. is a 41-year-old man who has been admitted to KCHC 55\n\nprevious times since 1983 and has multiple medical records.\n\nAlthough he has a history of hypertension and heart\n\narrhythmia, the medical section of his treatment plan was\n\nblank.  Accordingly, he failed to receive an adequate\n\nmedical assessment. \n\n•\t  Q.M. walked into to the CPEP and reported that he was\n\nhearing voices telling him to hurt someone, and that the\n\nprevious week voices told him to jump in front of a subway.\n\nThe assessment performed by KCHC personnel did not find any\n\nrisk for self harm. \n\n2.  Failure to Provide Adequate Emergency Responses\n \nAnother essential component of adequate medical care is the\n\nability to provide sufficient care in emergency situations.\n\nGenerally accepted professional standards require that all staff\n\nshould be well-trained in emergency preparedness, know what\n\nemergency materials are available and where they are located, and\n\nconduct sufficient practice emergency drills (called “Mock Code\n\nDrills” at KCHC) to be able to perform adequately when confronted\n\nwith an actual emergency.  Appropriate emergency medical response\n\nalso includes physical plant readiness, e.g., having the proper\n\nequipment available at all times. \n\nKCHC practices and procedures regarding emergency\n\npreparedness deviate substantially from generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards.27  This deficiency was brought very\n\nclearly into focus by the death of patient Esmin Green in the\n\nCPEP on June 19, 2008 (described above).  Our review of records\n \nand materials, including surveillance video, in connection with\n\nthe death of Ms. Green indicated that, contrary to generally\n \n27\n  The August 2008 CMS survey of KCHC documented numerous\n\ndeficiencies with KCHC’s emergency response to medical codes,\n\nspecifically in the case of Ms. Green’s death.\n \n\n- 31 ­\naccepted professional standards, no one was clearly in charge of\n\ncoordinating or directing the code for several potentially\n\ncrucial minutes.  From the video, it also appears -- contrary to\n\ngenerally accepted medical practice -- that medical staff failed\n\nto immediately address airway, breathing or cardiac issues\n\n(“ABCs”), but rather, first took a “finger stick” to assess\n\nMs. Green’s blood sugar.28\n   \nKCHC’s lack of emergency preparedness goes beyond this\n\nsingle event, however.  For example, we found a significant lack\n\nof Mock Code Drills at KCHC.  There were no Mock Code Drills run\n \nin 2007, and none occurred during the first quarter of 2008.  Two\n \nMock Code Drills were run in the third quarter of 2008.  However,\n\nboth clearly reflected a failure to meet professional standards\n\nof practice.  The following deficiencies were noted:  (1) delays\n\nin initiating CPR; (2) staff had to be reminded to use the\n\nAutomatic Emergency Defibrillator (“AED”) and delayed using it;\n\n(3) staff did not call for assistance, and a physician failed to\n\nadequately respond when called; (4) ABC’s were not followed; and\n\n(5) staff responder forgot to bring the crash cart.  Notably,\n\nmany of these same deficiencies were present in the Esmin Green\n\nincident. \n\nGiven the multiple deficiencies noted on the two Mock Code\n\nDrills run since Ms. Green’s death, KCHC’s medical emergency\n\npreparedness is clearly inadequate.\n \n3. \t Failure to Provide and Maintain Adequate Medical\n\nDocumentation\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that\n\nclinical records be complete, accurately documented, readily\n\naccessible, and systematically organized.  The records should be\n \nsufficiently detailed to provide for continuity of care.  KCHC\n \nfails to ensure that patients’ medical records completely and\n\naccurately reflect their care.  Our investigation revealed\n\nnumerous instances of inadequate or absent documentation by\n\nmedical and nursing staff, leading to harm or the risk of harm to\n\nKCHC patients.29  For example:\n \n28\n  In addition, as we pointed out in our August 22, 2008\n\nimmediacy letter, the video also shows a nurse, when she first\n\nresponds to Ms. Green, nudging her with her foot.\n \n29\n  KCHC has been cited for inadequate or missing\n\ndocumentation in other surveys.  In September 2006, the New York\n\nState Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons with\n \n\n- 32 ­\n•\t  H.C.’s chart indicated no medical problems even though this\n\npatient, who apparently has been admitted multiple times to\n\nKCHC, has asthma, Hepatitis C, and a seizure disorder.  Her\n \nnursing assessments were incomplete on earlier admissions.\n \n•\t  P.K. arrived in the CPEP in an acute psychosis, and\n\nexhibiting paranoia and poor hygiene.  He was noted to be\n \nHIV-positive, to have a seizure disorder, and a history of\n\nsubstance abuse.  The nursing assessment documentation was\n\nincomplete, and there were no social problems or treatment\n\ndischarge issues noted, despite P.K.’s obvious history of\n\npsycho-social problems.\n \nAs noted above in the section on treatment planning,\n\ntreatment plans were also inadequately documented by nursing\n\nstaff.  We reviewed a number of records where the treatment goals\n\nwere omitted even though the patient’s particular problem had\n\nbeen identified.  This was especially true with those patients\n\nwhose social problems increase the likelihood of repeat\n\nhospitalizations. \n\nFurther, nurses do not consistently record information in\n\npatients’ charts properly.  Notes are not made directly below the\n\nlast entry, nor do nurses commonly use hand drawn lines to cross\n\nout blank space within the record.  This kind of charting creates\n\na situation where, as noted below, post-dating the record becomes\n\npossible. \n\n4. \t Falsification of Medical Records\n \nDisturbingly, we have become aware of at least three\n\ninstances of falsification of records.30  The need for accurate,\n \nDisabilities, an independent New York State governmental agency\n\ncharged with improving the lives of people with disabilities, noted\n\nirregularities between KCHC’s report to OMH of the number of hours\n\nbetween patients’ arrivals at the CPEP and their departure or\n\nadmission to an inpatient unit for 2005 and 2006.  It requested an\n\nexplanation of “how this misrepresentation was able to occur.”  In\n \naddition, JCAHO found progress notes and medical records with\n\nillegible entries which it described as “precluding effective\n\nwritten communication between caregivers regarding the patient’s\n\ncondition and progress.”\n \n30\n  Falsification of documents related to the death of patient\n\nEsmin Green was also cited in CMS’s August 2008 letter and DOH’s\n\nJuly 2008 letter.\n \n\n- 33 ­\ntruthful record-keeping should be self-evident.  Without accurate\n \nrecords, it is impossible for patients to receive appropriate\n\nclinical intervention, and substantial harm can arise.  Moreover,\n\ngiven the pattern of false records that we have observed, we\n\ncannot be certain of the veracity or reliability of the records\n\nthat have been presented to us.  The following constitutes three\n\nknown instances of falsification:\n \n••\t  When Esmin Green died on the morning of June 17, 2008, after\n\nlying unattended on the floor of the waiting area in the\n\nCPEP between 5:30 and 6:30 a.m., nursing notes asserted\n\nthat, during that hour, Ms. Green was repeatedly observed\n\nalert and awake.  Video surveillance tapes we reviewed\n\ndemonstrated that this was patently false, and that no one\n\nattempted to assist her throughout the time she lay on the\n\nfloor.31\n \n•\t  During our site visit in July 2008, we requested the records\n\nof patient H.C.  We were told that one of the nurses\n \nresponsible for delivering the chart to us had altered the\n\nrecord at the direction of her supervisor, an Associate\n\nDirector of Nursing.32\n  \n•\t  The medical records for patient G.B., who was found on his\n\nknees in a bathroom in the CPEP apparently engaged in oral\n\nsex with another patient indicate that the Psychiatric\n\nHealth Associate (“PHA”) had, as per policy, conducted\n\nregular 15 minute checks on both patients.  However, KCHC\n\nhas informed us that surveillance video of the CPEP shows\n \nthat the PHA falsified the records, and did not, in fact,\n\nconduct the 15 minute checks. \n\nE. \t Inadequate Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement\n \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that a\n\nfacility like KCHC develop and maintain an integrated system to\n\nmonitor and ensure quality of care across all aspects of care and\n\ntreatment.  An effective quality management program must\n\nincorporate adequate systems for data capture, retrieval, and\n\nstatistical analysis to identify and track trends.  The program\n \n31\n  We notified counsel for HHC of this serious concern in our\n \nAugust 22, 2008 immediacy letter. \n\n32\n  The fact that this patient’s medical record was altered\n\nwas brought to our attention by HHC officials at the end of our site\n\nvisit in July 2008.\n \n\n- 34 ­\nalso should include a process for developing a corrective action\n\nplan and a process for monitoring the effectiveness of corrective\n\nmeasures that are taken.  Throughout this letter, we have\n\nenumerated various failures by KCHC to provide adequate care and\n\ntreatment for its patients.  With few exceptions, KCHC has failed\n\nto identify these problems independently, or formulate and\n\nimplement remedies to address them.  Consequently, actual and\n\npotential sources of harm to KCHC’s patients continue\n\nunaddressed.\n \nAn adequate quality management program has two components:\n\n(1) quality assurance (“QA”), which focuses on evaluating\n\ncompliance with basic standards of quality that are either\n\ninternally or externally imposed; and (2) performance improvement\n\n(“PI”), which focuses on identifying missed opportunities to\n\nimprove care, identifying preventive actions, and delineating\n\nremedial measures to improve the care and delivery of treatment\n\nand services provided to patients. \n\nKCHC has failed to implement an appropriate quality\n\nassurance and performance improvement program.  As a result, KCHC\n\noften does not identify or analyze deficiencies in the treatment\n\nand services provided to patients or in systems and procedures\n\ndesigned to protect patients from harm in a timely or adequate\n\nmanner.\n \nKCHC’s quality assurance and performance improvement\n\nprograms often are poorly organized and fail to establish\n\npriorities to identity the particular issues that need to be\n\naddressed.  The hospital does not establish criteria for\n\nanalyzing the variety of data that they routinely collect, and\n\nfails to analyze appropriately the data for trends and underlying\n\ncauses. \n\nMoreover, as indicated above, KCHC also lacks adequate\n\nprocedures for investigating untoward events, serious injuries,\n\nand important or critical events.  Our consultants found that\n \nstaff conduct little or no follow-up to determine the cause of an\n\nincident, its effect on the patient, or how similar incidents\n\nmight be avoided in the future.  As a result, patients continue\n\nto be exposed to actual and potential harm.33\n \n33\n  Our interview with a consultant recently hired by KCHC to\n\nreview the QA/PI process confirms our findings.  The consultant\n \nfound the current QA/PI process to be inadequate and recommended a\n\nreview and revision of all QA/PI to conform to generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards:  “real time” monitoring, with the\n \n\n- 35 ­\nF.  Unsafe Physical Environment\n \nThe Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause requires public\n\nmental health care facilities to provide patients with “adequate\n\nfood, shelter, [and] clothing,” along with conditions of\n\nreasonable care and safety.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324.\n \n1.  Inadequate Fire Safety Planning and Training\n \nIn accordance with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards, KCHC must have an adequate fire safety plan and\n\nprovide adequate training to its staff to respond to fire\n\nemergencies.  Hospital staff must be adequately trained to\n\nrespond to reports of fire or smoke, and be able to safely\n\nevacuate the patients within their care.  We find that the\n \npresent fire safety planning and training is wholly inadequate\n\nand exposes both patients and staff to an unnecessarily high risk\n\nof harm, including death. \n\nStaff are critically deficient in their training and\n\nresponse to fire.  We observed two unannounced mock fire drills\n \nduring which all involved staff made potentially life-threatening\n\nerrors.  For example, staff failed to inquire about the location\n\nof the fire, failed to pull a fire alarm to alert others to\n\nrespond to the location, and, when other staff did respond, they\n\nfailed to bring portable fire extinguishers to the site.\n\nMoreover, actions to evacuate patients were woefully\n\ninadequate.34  The staff also were unaware of any policy or\n\nprocedure as to how to address patients who refused to leave the\n\nbuilding in an emergency.35  Moreover, KCHC’s fire safety\n\ndocumentation is poorly designed, inapplicable to the areas used\n\nfor behavioral health services, and lacking in appropriately\n \nrequirement of contemporaneous documentation of activities; in-\n\nservice training of KCHC staff on QA/PI; a massive culture change\n\nthat needed to be built into all levels by all disciplines; and\n\nstrong leadership and commitment.\n \n34\n  During the course of the drills, we observed a physician\n\nleading patients down the hallway toward the fire location, and\n\npatients wandering unchecked by staff down the hall toward the fire.\n\nOne unit supervisor did not know how to access the locked emergency\n\nexit stairwell, although we were told that the supervisor should\n\nhave a key to the stairwell. \n\n35\n  We notified counsel for KCHC of these serious concerns in\n \nour June 18, 2008 immediacy letter.\n \n\n- 36 ­\ncritical assessments or feedback to improve the fire safety\n\nprogram.\n \n2.  Inadequate Handling and Disposal of Hazardous Materials\n \nKCHC’s present system for handling and disposing of\n\nhazardous materials, including medical waste materials, exposes\n\npatients, staff, and the Kings County community to risk of harm.\n\nGenerally accepted professional standards require that discarded\n\nmaterials saturated in blood or other potentially infectious\n\nmaterials be placed in red biohazard bags, and securely stored to\n\nprevent access.\n \nDuring our tour, we found several red biohazard waste bags\n\nas well as a clear plastic bag that appeared to contain bloody\n\nlinens outside in open waste carts.  These bags were not secured,\n\nand were accessible to anyone who might walk by.  In fact, a\n\nhomeless person was observed sleeping approximately fifty feet\n\nfrom the carts.  This is a violation of biohazard waste storage\n\nand handling practices and places individuals who may come in\n\ncontact with these wastes at serious risk of injury or disease\n\ntransmission.36\n \n3.  Inadequate Environmental Infection Control\n \nKCHC fails to take appropriate steps to prevent the spread\n\nof infectious agents through laundering practices, storage of\n\npatient clothing, linen replacement, and basic housekeeping\n\nmeasures.  We learned during our site tour in May 2008 that\n\nmethicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”) has been\n\nidentified at KCHC, although not at high levels.37  Environmental\n \nconsiderations, such as laundry, are critical in preventing the\n\nspread of this organism. \n\n36 Id.\n \n37\n  MRSA is a highly contagious bacteria commonly found in\n\ninstitutional settings that is resistant to certain antibiotics,\n\nincluding methicillin.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n\nat http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ar_mrsa_ca_public.html.  The\n \ndisease presents itself at first as a boil or sore on the skin, and\n\nis easily spread through contact with an infected person or with a\n\nsurface the person has touched.  Id.  In some cases, MRSA can lead\n\nto serious complications, including surgical wound infections,\n\nbloodstream infections, and pneumonia.  Id. \n\n\n- 37 ­\nThe Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) recommend that\n\nlaundry be washed in water at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit.  The\n \nwashing machines on units available for patients provide water at\n\nonly 107 degrees.  This creates a significant risk that patients’\n\npersonal clothing may spread MRSA or other pathogens even after\n\nbeing laundered.  Moreover, KCHC does not properly store\n\npatients’ clothing.  Patients’ stored clothing is not routinely\n\nlaundered or disinfected before being stored.  In the CPEP,\n\npatients’ clothing is stored on the floor.  On the child and\n \nadolescent unit, patients’ clothing is stored in mesh bags,\n\nclosely packed together in a closet, where mouse excrement was\n\nlater observed.\n \nIn addition, KCHC uses worn bedding which cannot be properly\n\ncleaned and disinfected between uses.  For the purpose of\n\ninfection control, bedding and similar items should be replaced\n\nregularly once they reach the end of their service lives.\n \n4.  Unsafe Food Handling and Preparation Practices\n \nPursuant to generally accepted professional standards, KCHC\n\nis obligated to provide adequate food to patients consistent with\n\nsafe preparation and handling practices.  Proper cooking,\n\nholding, and serving temperatures and time frames are critical to\n\nprevent the risk of food borne illness.  We found deficiencies in\n \nfood handling at KCHC that put patients at risk for transmission\n\nof food borne illnesses.\n \nFood temperatures are not being routinely monitored at\n\nserving locations.  The pantry in the second floor of the adult\n\ninpatient building lacked a thermometer and temperature logs.\n\nWhen questioned about this, food service staff members indicated\n\nthat thermometers were missing from several pantries, and the\n\nfood service director was unable to produce any temperature logs\n\nfrom serving locations for the month of May 2008.  Patients who\n \nwere served this food were placed at risk of food borne illness.\n \n5.  Failure to Address Suicide Hazards in Patient Areas\n \nDue to the nature of the patient population, KCHC should\n\nproactively address suicide hazards and vigilantly observe\n\npatients to minimize the risk of suicide.  We acknowledge that\n\nKCHC has taken some steps to reduce suicide hazards, but many of\n\nthe problems still remain, especially in the CPEP.\n \nThe CPEP is a high risk area for suicides due to its\n\nbuilding fixtures and overpopulation.  For example, the male and\n\nfemale bathrooms both have sink handles and shower control knobs\n \n\n- 38 ­\nthat could easily be used by a patient to tie a shoelace or some\n\nother ligature around, place the other end in a noose around his\n\nor her neck, and sit down, asphyxiating him or herself.  In\n \naddition, these areas are not constantly visible to staff nor\n\nregularly monitored by staff.38\n  \nG.  Inadequate Clinical Leadership\n \nThe major role of clinical leadership in any institution is\n\nto ensure that professional standards of practice and\n\naccountability are maintained.  Specifically, clinical leadership\n\nshould respond, in a timely manner, to identified problems and\n\noffer stable, consistent administrative guidance and supervision.\n\nKCHC fails to provide such adequate clinical leadership.\n\nLeadership in all of the major disciplines at KCHC appears to be\n\noverwhelmed and reacts primarily to escalating crises.   Repeated\n\nfailure by leadership to implement timely appropriate corrective\n\naction plans have led to significant harmful situations.\n \nAgencies such as CMS, OMH and other outside consultants have\n\ncited deficiencies at KCHC, including inadequate programming, the\n\nexcessive use of seclusion and restraint, and unsafe clinical\n\nsituations that have resulted in injuries to patients, including\n\ndeath.  Despite these clear findings of repeated deficiencies,\n\nthese conditions remain unabated.  Despite repeated “plans of\n\ncorrection” and leadership’s verbalization of an understanding of\n\nthe extant deficits, the system of care remains in disarray with\n\nno sense of urgency of the need for things to change.  Patient\n \nand staff injuries continue to occur with an alarming regularity\n\nwithout adequate leadership intervention.  The critical incidents\n \nthat occurred in the CPEP and on the child and adolescent unit\n \nreflect the egregious consequences of the failure of the existing\n\nleadership to address effectively burgeoning problems.\n \n38\n  KCHC has been notified on many prior occasions about the\n\npresence of suicide hazards.  The September 2004, January 2006, May\n\n2006, May 2007, and November 2008 OMH surveys described various\n\nsuicide hazards in patient areas.  Similarly, JCAHO’s July 2008\n\nsurvey also noted the presence of suicide hazards.  We do note that\n \nKCHC plans to move all of its mental health patients to a new\n\nbuilding commencing sometime in early 2009, which may ameliorate\n\nsome of these physical plant defects. \n\n\n- 39 ­\nH.\t  Inadequate Discharge Planning And Placement In The Most\n\nIntegrated Setting\n \nWithin the limitations of court-imposed confinement, federal\n\nlaw requires that KCHC actively pursue the timely discharge of\n\npatients to the most integrated, appropriate setting that is\n\nconsistent with the patients’ needs.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.\n\nThus, at the time of admission and throughout a patient’s stay,\n\nKCHC should:  (1) identify, through professional assessments, the\n\nfactors that likely will foster viable discharge for the patient,\n\nand (2) use these factors to drive treatment planning and\n\nintervention.  Treatment planning must be directed toward\n\nreturning the patient to the community as quickly as possible.\n\nConsequently, generally accepted professional standards call for\n\nassessment of the recovery environment, identification of\n\nproblems related to adaptation in the community and efforts to\n\nenhance the prospects for recovery.  This must begin at admission\n\nand include important members of the individual's natural and\n\nprofessional support system.  Readmission within a brief time\n \nshould be treated as a failure of the discharge planning process\n\nand should be tracked as part of the hospital's outcome measures.\n\nWithout clear and purposeful identification of such factors and\n\nrelated issues, patients will be denied rehabilitation and other\n\nservices and supports that will help them acquire, develop,\n\nand/or enhance the skills necessary to function in a community\n\nsetting.\n \nThe discharge planning process at KCHC falls significantly\n\nshort of these generally accepted professional standards of care.\n\nTreatment teams typically do not consider or integrate criteria\n\nfor discharge into treatment planning.  Consequently, many\n\npatients whose psychiatric conditions are largely under control\n\nremain hospitalized because of poor daily living skills,\n\naggressive conduct, incontinence, inadequate dietary management,\n\nfailure to take medication, and/or other behaviors that prevent\n\ndischarge and community reintegration.  Although such behaviors\n\noften can be resolved with proper treatment, KCHC rarely\n\naddresses these issues in patients’ treatment plans or in the\n\nfacility’s discharge planning.  This leads to frequent re­\nadmissions, which in turn suggests a failure of discharge\n\nplanning.  Examples include:\n \n•\t  S.D., who has been admitted to KCHC 12 times in nine years\n\nand has made another seven visits to the CPEP during that\n\ntime period. \n\n•\t  J.P., who had been repeatedly admitted and discharged during\n\nthe past year without any meaningful assessment,\n\nreassessment, or targeted treatment. \n\n\n- 40 ­\n•\t  W.H., who has had five admissions in less than three months.\n\nHer record reflects KCHC’s failure to:  adequately assess\n\nprior admissions; reach a clear differential psychiatric\n\ndiagnosis; adequately assess the clinical efficacy of past\n\nmedication interventions; adequately address her repeated\n\naggressive behavior and its relation to mania or mixed\n\nstates and resulting poor judgment; and conduct appropriate\n\nmental status exams.  Accordingly, W.H. has been subjected\n\nto a range of shifting combinations of anti-psychotics and\n\ndischarges to settings that are inappropriate for her needs.\n \nThe failure to provide adequate, individualized treatment\n\nand discharge planning for these and other patients deviates from\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards and contributes to\n\nextended hospitalizations, unsuccessful community placements, and\n\na high likelihood of readmission.  Patients are harmed or exposed\n\nto the risk of harm by the effects of prolonged\n\ninstitutionalization and by being denied a reasonable opportunity\n\nto live successfully in the most integrated, appropriate setting.\n \nIV.  FINDINGS PURSUANT TO § 14141\n \nIn furtherance of our investigation pursuant to § 14141, we\n\nand our expert consultants in police and hospital security\n\npractices reviewed relevant documents, including policy memoranda\n\nand training materials.  As in the case of our CRIPA\n \ninvestigation, we toured KCHC with our expert consultants, and\n\ninterviewed a cross-section of Hospital Police supervisors and\n\nofficers as well as clinical staff, including hospital\n\nadministrators, doctors, nurses, and other behavioral health\n\nstaff.  We also interviewed representatives from HHC.\n \nOur investigation has revealed a number of serious policy\n\nand procedure deficiencies in the KCHC Hospital Police\n\nDepartment.39  Most significantly, the Department lacks a\n\ncomprehensive, coherent set of policies and procedures and those\n\npolicies which do exist are not effectively communicated\n\nto officers.  As a result, there is confusion among Hospital\n\nPolice officers and clinicians regarding the role of Hospital\n\nPolice.  This can result in inappropriate conduct by officers.\n\nOne clear example is the complete failure by two Hospital Police\n\nofficers to assist patient Esmin Green as she lay on the floor of\n\nthe CPEP on the morning of June 19, 2008. \n\n39\n  We will be sending under separate cover a Technical\n\nAssistance letter regarding the KCHC Hospital Police Department.\n \n\n- 41 ­\nIn addition, we have determined that supervision and\n\ntraining of new officers is inadequate.  As will be detailed in\n \nour Technical Assistance letter, new officers are poorly trained,\n\nparticularly with respect to engaging mental health patients, and\n\nsupervision is lax.  Finally, KCHC lacks a coherent and effective\n\nsystem for receiving, reviewing and investigating incidents and\n\ncomplaints involving the Hospital Police.\n \n**********************\n \nVI. RECOMMENDED REMEDIAL MEASURES \n\nTo remedy the deficiencies discussed above and to protect\n\nthe constitutional and federal statutory rights of the patients\n\nat KCHC, KCHC should promptly implement the minimum remedial\n\nmeasures set forth below: \n\nA. \t Protection From Harm\n \nKCHC should provide its patients with a safe and humane\n\nenvironment and protect them from harm.

Such policies and procedures shall\n\ninclude requirements that investigations of such\n\nincidents be undertaken and that they be comprehensive,\n\ninclude consideration of staff's adherence to\n \nprogrammatic requirements, and be performed by\n\nindependent investigators;\n \n7. \t Require all staff involved in conducting investigations\n\nto complete successfully competency-based training on\n\ntechnical and programmatic investigation methodologies\n\nand documentation requirements necessary in mental\n\nhealth service settings;\n \n8. \t Monitor the performance of staff charged with\n\ninvestigative responsibilities, and provide technical\n\nassistance and training, whenever necessary to ensure\n\nthe thorough, competent, and timely completion of\n\ninvestigations of serious incidents;\n \n9. \t Develop and implement a reliable system to identify the\n\nneed for, and monitor the implementation of,\n\nappropriate corrective and preventative actions\n\naddressing problems identified as a result of\n\ninvestigations;\n \n10. \tReview, revise, as appropriate, and implement policies\n\nand procedures related to the tracking and trending of\n\nincident data, including data from patient aggression\n\nand abuse and neglect allegations, to ensure that such\n\nincidents are properly investigated and appropriate\n \n\n- 43 ­\ncorrective actions are identified and implemented in\n\nresponse to problematic trends; and \n\n11.\t Develop and implement a comprehensive quality\n\nimprovement system consistent with generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards of care. At a minimum, such a\n\nsystem should: \n\na.  collect information related to the adequacy of the\nprovision of the protections, treatments,\nservices, and supports provided by KCHC, as well\nas the outcomes being achieved by patients; \nb.  analyze the information collected in order to\nidentify strengths and weaknesses within the\ncurrent system; and \nc.  identify and monitor implementation of corrective\nand preventative actions to address identified\nissues and ensure resolution of underlying\nproblems. \n12. \tConduct a thorough review of all units to identify any\n\npotential environmental safety hazards, and develop and\n\nimplement a plan to remedy any identified issues.  At a\n \nminimum, KCHC should:\n \na.\t  Ensure that suicidal patients are housed in an\n\narea that is safe for them with appropriate\n\nsupervision and observation by staff.\n \nb.\t  Identify and eliminate all suicide hazards in all\n\nareas accessible to patients, including patient\n\nbedrooms and bathrooms.\n \nB.\t  Mental Health Care\n \n1.  Assessments and Diagnoses\n \nKCHC shall ensure that their patients receive accurate,\n\ncomplete, and timely assessments and diagnoses, consistent with\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards, and that these\n\nassessments and diagnoses drive treatment interventions.  More\n \nparticularly, KCHC shall:\n \na. \t Develop and implement comprehensive policies and\n\nprocedures regarding the timeliness and content of\n\ninitial psychiatric assessments and ongoing\n\nreassessments; and ensure that assessments include\n \n\n- 44 ­\na plan of care that outlines specific strategies,\n\nwith rationales, including adjustment of\n\nmedication regimens and initiation of specific\n\ntreatment interventions.\n \nb.\t  Ensure that psychiatric reassessments are\n\ncompleted within time-frames that reflect the\n\npatient’s needs, including prompt reevaluations of\n\nall patients requiring restrictive interventions.\n \nc.\t  Develop diagnostic practices, consistent with\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards, for\n\nreliably reaching the most accurate psychiatric\n\ndiagnoses.\n \nd.\t  Conduct interdisciplinary assessments of patients\n\nconsistent with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards, and ensure that nursing assessments in\n\nparticular are adequately thorough and\n\nindividualized.  Expressly identify and prioritize\n\neach patient’s individual mental health problems\n\nand needs, including, without limitation,\n\nmaladaptive behaviors and substance abuse\n\nproblems.\n \ne.\t  Develop a clinical formulation of each patient\n\nthat integrates relevant elements of the patient’s\n\nhistory, mental status examination, and response\n\nto current and past medications and other\n\ninterventions, and that is used to prepare the\n\npatient’s treatment plan.\n \nf.\t  Ensure that the information gathered in the\n\nassessments and reassessments is used to justify\n\nand update diagnoses, and establish and perform\n\nfurther assessments for a differential diagnosis.\n \ng.\t  Review and revise, as appropriate, psychiatric\n\nassessments of all patients, providing clinically\n\njustified current diagnoses for each patient, and\n\nremoving all diagnoses that cannot be clinically\n\njustified.  Modify treatment and medication\n\nregimens, as appropriate, considering factors such\n\nas the patient’s response to treatment,\n\nsignificant developments in the patient’s\n\ncondition, and changing patient needs.\n \n\n- 45 ­\nh.\t  Develop a monitoring instrument to ensure a\n\nsystematic review of the quality and timeliness of\n\nall assessments according to established\n\nindicators, including an evaluation of initial\n\nassessments, progress notes, and transfer and\n\ndischarge summaries, and require each clinical\n\ndiscipline’s peer review system to address the\n\nprocess and content of assessments and\n\nreassessments, identify individual and group\n\ntrends, and provide corrective action.\n \n2.  Treatment Planning\n \nThe KCHC shall develop and implement an integrated treatment\n\nplanning process consistent with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards.  More particularly, the KCHC shall:\n \na.\t  Develop and implement policies and procedures\n\nregarding the development of individualized\n\ntreatment plans consistent with generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards of care;\n \nb.\t  Review and revise, as appropriate, each patient’s\n\ntreatment plan to ensure that it is current,\n\nindividualized, factors in the patient’s\n\nparticular strengths, is outcome-driven, emanates\n\nfrom an integration of each discipline’s\n\nassessments of patients, and that goals and\n\ninterventions are consistent with clinical\n \nassessments.  Revise each patient’s treatment plan\n\nif it is not effective.\n \nc.\t  Require all clinical staff to complete\n\nsuccessfully competency-based training on the\n\ndevelopment and implementation of individualized\n\ntreatment plans, including skills needed in the\n\ndevelopment of clinical formulations, needs, goals\n\nand interventions as well as discharge criteria.\n \nd.\t  Ensure that individualized treatment plans are\n\nimplemented in a consistent manner in accordance\n\nwith generally accepted professional practices.\n \ne.\t  Ensure that the medical director timely reviews\n\nhigh-risk situations such as individuals requiring\n\nrepeated use of seclusion and restraints.\n \n\n- 46 ­\nf.\t  Provide adequate and appropriate psychiatric and\n\nother mental health services, including adequate\n\npsychological services and behavioral management,\n\nin accordance with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards.  Behavioral management should focus on\n\nteaching alternative, adaptive behaviors.\n \ng.\t  Develop and implement psychological evaluations to\n\nassess each patient’s cognitive deficits and\n\nstrengths to ensure that treatment interventions\n\nare selected based on the patient’s capacity to\n\nbenefit.\n \nh.\t  Develop and implement treatment goals that will\n\nestablish an objective, measurable basis for\n\nevaluating patient progress.\n \ni.\t  Develop and implement policies to ensure that\n\npatients who are dually diagnosed as mentally\n\nill/developmental disabilities or mentally\n\nill/substance abuse, and patients with behavioral\n\nproblems, are appropriately evaluated, treated,\n\nand monitored in accordance with generally\n\naccepted professional standards.\n \nj.\t  For patients identified as suicidal, develop and\n\nimplement a clear and uniform policy for patient\n\nassessment and treatment.\n \nk.\t  Ensure that staff receive adequate training to\n\nserve the needs of patients requiring specialized\n\ncare.\n \nSuch training shall include:\n \n1.\t  competence in performing behavioral\n\nassessments, including the functional\n\nanalysis of behavior and appropriate\n\nidentification of target and replacement\n\nbehaviors;\n \n2.\t  the development and implementation of clear\n\nthresholds for behaviors or events that\n \ntrigger referral for a behavioral assessment;\n \n3.\t  timely review of behavioral assessments by\n\ntreatment teams, including consideration or\n\nrevision of behavioral interventions, and\n \n\n- 47 ­\ndocumentation of the team’s review in the\n \npatient’s record;\n \n4. \t the development and implementation of\n\nprotocols for collecting objective data on\n\ntarget and replacement behaviors; and \n\n5. \t assessments of each patient’s cognitive\n\ndeficits  and strengths to ensure that\n\ntreatment interventions are selected based on\n \nthe patient’s capacity to benefit.\n \nl.\t  Ensure full participation by the patient in the\n\ntreatment planning process.\n \nm.\t  Ensure that treatment plans address repeated\n\nadmissions and adjust the plans accordingly to\n\nexamine and address the factors that led to re­\nadmission.\n \nn. \t Ensure that treatment plans are consistently\n\nassessed for their efficacy and reviewed and\n\nrevised when appropriate.\n \no.\t  Ensure that the treatment planning process is\n\nguided by a multi-disciplinary team in which\n\ndiverse professional expertise and observations\n\nare employed, in an inter-disciplinary process, to\n\nevaluate patients and develop treatment plans.\n \n3. \tMedication Management and Monitoring\n \nKCHC shall provide adequate psychiatric supports and\n\nservices for the treatment of its patients, including medication\n\nmanagement and monitoring of medication side-effects in\n\naccordance with generally accepted professional standards.  More\n \nparticularly, KCHC shall:\n \na.\t Develop and implement policies and procedures\n\nrequiring clinicians to document their analyses of\n\nthe benefits and risks of chosen treatment\n \ninterventions;\n \nb.\t Ensure that the treatment plans at KCHC include a\n\npsychopharmacological plan of care that includes\n\ninformation on purpose of treatment, type of\n\nmedication, rationale for its use, target behaviors,\n\nand possible side effects.  KCHC should also reassess\n \n\n- 48 ­\nthe diagnosis in those cases that fail to respond to\n\nrepeat drug trials.\n \nc.\t Ensure that all psychotropic medications are:\n \n1.\t prescribed in therapeutic amounts;\n \n2.\t tailored to each patient’s individual symptoms;\n \n3.\t monitored for efficacy against clearly-identified\n\ntarget variables and time frames;\n \n4.\t modified based on clinical rationales; and\n \n5.\t properly documented.\n \nd.\t Institute systematic monitoring mechanisms regarding\n\nmedication use throughout the facility.  In this\n \nregard, KCHC shall:\n \n1.\t Develop, implement, and continually update a\n\ncomplete set of medication guidelines in\n\naccordance with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards that address the indications,\n\ncontraindications, screening procedures, dose\n\nrequirements, and expected individual outcomes for\n\nall psychiatric medications in the formulary;\n \n2.\t Ensure that the pharmacological component of a\n\ntreatment plan reflects the exercise of\n\nprofessional judgement for medication treatment\n\nincluding:  diagnosis, target symptoms, risks and\n\nbenefits of particular medications, and\n\nconsideration of alternate treatments;\n \n3.\t Ensure that the rationale for each patient’s\n\ncourse of treatment is included in the physician’s\n\nprogress notes;\n \n4.\t Ensure that psychotropic medications are used as\n\nan integral part of a treatment program to manage\n\nspecific behaviors in the least restrictive\n\nmanner, to eliminate targeted behaviors/symptoms,\n\nand to treat specific psychiatric disorders;\n \n5.\t Develop and implement a policy and procedure\n\ngoverning the use of PRN medications that includes\n\nrequirements for specific identification of the\n \n\n- 49 ­\nbehaviors that result in PRN administration of\n \nmedications, a time limit on PRN uses, a\n\ndocumented rationale for the use of more than one\n \nmedication on a PRN basis, and physician\n\ndocumentation to ensure timely, critical review of\n\nthe patient’s response to PRN treatments and\n\nreevaluation of regular treatments as a result of\n\nPRN uses;\n \n6.\t  Develop and implement a policy and procedure, in\n\naccordance with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards, governing clinical justification of\n\npolypharmacy, which should include attention to\n\nthe special risks associated with the use of\n\nbenzodiazepines, anticholinergic agents, and\n\nconventional and atypical antipsychotic\n\nmedications;\n \n7.\t  Ensure that all medications, in accordance with\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards, are\n\nbeing prescribed for their specific purpose and\n\nnot solely for their secondary effects.\n \n8. \t Adopt and incorporate the necessary protections\n\nand safeguards to ensure that patients are\n\nafforded safe and effective pharmacological\n\ntreatment.  To this end, KCHC shall, at a minimum,\n\nestablish mechanisms to:\n \na.\t  monitor practitioners’ adherence to specific\n\nand current guidelines in the use of each\n\nmedication;\n \nb.\t  report and analyze adverse drug reactions;\n\nand\n \nc.\t  report, analyze, and document actual and\n\npotential variations in the prescription,\n\ntranscription, procurement/storage,\n\ndispensing and administration of medications.\n \nC.\t  Behavioral Management\n \nKCHC should ensure the use of systematic behavior (social\n\nlearning) strategies.  To this end, KCHC should:\n \n1.\t  Ensure that behavioral plans, in accordance with\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards, contain\n\ncertain basic elements, including:\n \n\n- 50 ­\na.\t  an analysis of the reasons for the behavior and\n\nits frequency and causes;\n \nb.\t  identification of specific interventions developed\n\nand implemented by trained staff in order to\n\naddress and modify the behavior; and\n \nc.\t  full integration of the behavior plan into the\n\npatient’s overall plan of care.\n \n2.\t  Ensure that close observation and restraints are used\n \nin accordance with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards.  Absent exigent circumstances -- i.e., when\n\na patient poses an imminent risk of injury to himself\n\nor a third party -- any device or procedure that\n\nrestricts, limits or directs a person's freedom of\n\nmovement (including, but not limited to, chemical\n\nrestraints, mechanical restraints, physical/manual\n\nrestraints, time out procedures, and over-reliance on\n\nthe use of close observation) should be used only after\n\nother less restrictive alternatives have been assessed\n \nand exhausted.  To this end, KCHC should:\n \n3.\t  Ensure that restraints:\n \na. \t Are used only when persons pose an immediate\n\nthreat to themselves or others and after a\n \nhierarchy of less restrictive measures has been\n\nexhausted;\n \nb. \t Are not used in the absence of, or as an\n\nalternative to, active treatment, as punishment,\n\nor for the convenience of staff;\n \nc. \t Are not used as part of a behavioral intervention;\n \n \nd. \t Are terminated as soon as the person is no longer\n\nan imminent danger to himself or others; and\n \ne. \t Are used in a reliably documented manner.\n \n4.\t  Create or revise, as appropriate, and implement\n\npolicies and procedures consistent with generally\n\naccepted professional standards that cover the\n\nfollowing areas: \n\na. \t The range of restrictive alternatives available to\n\nstaff and a clear definition of each; and\n \n\n- 51 ­\nb. \t The training that all staff receive in the\n\nmanagement of the patient crisis cycle, the use of\n\nrestrictive measures, and the use of\n\nless-restrictive interventions.\n \nc. \t Limitations on the use of four-point restraints\n\nand STAT emergency medications to address patient\n\nbehaviors.\n \n5. \t Ensure that if restraint is initiated, the patient is\n\nassessed within an appropriate period of time and an\n\nappropriately trained staff member makes a\n\ndetermination of the need for continued restraint.\n \n6. \t Ensure that a physician's order for restraint includes: \n\na. \t The specific behaviors requiring the procedure; \n\nb. \t The maximum duration of the order; and \n\nc. \t Behavioral criteria for release, which, if met,\n\nrequire the patient's release even if the maximum\n\nduration of the initiating order has not expired.\n \n7. \t Ensure that the patient's attending physician is\n\npromptly consulted regarding the restrictive\n\nintervention.\n \n8. \t Ensure that at least every thirty minutes, patients in\n\nrestraint be re-informed of the behavioral criteria for\n \ntheir release from the restrictive intervention.\n \n9. \t Ensure that immediately following a patient being\n\nplaced in restraint, the patient's treatment team\n\nreviews the incident, and the attending physician\n\ndocuments the review and the reasons for or against\n\nchange in the patient's current pharmacological,\n\nbehavioral, or psychosocial treatment.\n \n10. \tComply with 42 C.F.R. § 483.360(f) as to assessments by\n\na physician or licensed medical professional of any\n\nresident placed in restraints.\n \n11. \tEnsure that staff successfully complete\n\ncompetency-based training regarding implementation of\n\nseclusion and restraint policies and the use of\n\nless-restrictive interventions.\n \n\n- 52 ­\n12.  Ensure that, with respect to the use of close\n\nobservation:\n \na.  Develop and implement a comprehensive policy and\nprocedure that would restrict the use of close\nobservation to only those situations where it is\nnecessary to protect a patient from self-harm or\nharm to others; \nb.  Ensure that staff successfully complete\ncompetency-based training on the correct\napplication of close observation. \nc.  Develop a quality improvement mechanism to\nmonitor the use of close observation. \n13.\t Ensure that KCHC will not transfer patients between\n\npsychiatric units in lieu of proper treatment.  To this\n \nend, KCHC shall:\n \na.\t  develop and implement a comprehensive policy and\n\nprocedure that would limit the transfer of\n\npatients from one unit to another in lieu of\n\nproper treatment and require that all such\n\ntransfers be approved centrally;\n \nb.\t  review and assess the necessity of all transfers\n\nwith members of the treatment teams and the\n \npatient.  In this review, the problem behaviors\n\nand effective and ineffective intervention\n \nstrategies should be discussed and the efficacy of\n\ntransfer be evaluated. \n\nD.\t  Medical and Nursing Care\n \nKCHC shall provide medical and nursing services to its\n\npatients consistent with generally accepted professional\n\nstandards.  Such services shall result in KCHC patients receiving\n\nindividualized services, supports, and therapeutic interventions,\n\nconsistent with their treatment plans.

The Attorney General files this Complaint on behalf of the United \nStates of America pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 1997, to enjoin the named Defendants from depriving \npersons institutionalized at the Kings County Hospital Center inpatient \npsychiatric units and the Kings County Hospital Center Comprehensive \n\nPsychiatric Emergency Program (collectively, “KCHC”), located in Brooklyn, \nNew York, of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.  This Complaint is also filed \npursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, \n42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“§ 14141”), which gives the Attorney General authority to \nfile suit to remedy a pattern or practice of misconduct by law enforcement \nofficers that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or \nprotected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1345. \n3.  The United States is authorized to initiate this action pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1997a. \n4.  The Attorney General has certified that all pre-filing requirements \nspecified in 42 U.S.C. § 1997b have been met.  The Certificate of the Attorney \nGeneral is appended to this Complaint as Attachment A and is incorporated \nherein. \n5.  Venue in the Eastern District of New York is proper pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1391.   \n- 2 ­\n\nDEFENDANTS \n6.  Defendant City of New York (“City”) is responsible for the oversight \nof  the public health care system in all five boroughs of New York City and as \nsuch  has responsibility for the protections, services, and supports provided to \npatients at KCHC, an inpatient facility housing individuals in need of \nemergency and long-term psychiatric inpatient services.      \n7.  Defendant Health and Hospitals Corporation (“HHC”) is a public \nbenefit corporation which owns and operates KCHC.  HHC provides medical, \nmental health and substance abuse services and is responsible for the care \nand treatment provided to KCHC patients. \n8.  Defendant Kings County Hospital Center is a public, full-service \nacute care hospital located in Brooklyn, New York and operated by the HHC.  \nThe Kings County Hospital Center encompasses and controls the day-to-day \noperations of the inpatient psychiatric service and the Comprehensive \nPsychiatric Emergency Program (“CPEP”).  References to KCHC in the \nComplaint and Consent Judgment are understood by the parties to mean the \nCPEP and the inpatient psychiatric service only, as described herein in \nparagraph 1. \n9.  Defendant ALAN AVILES  is the President of the HHC and has \nauthority over the Kings County Hospital Center and over the care of \n- 3 ­\n\npatients at the Kings County Hospital Center.  Defendant AVILES is sued in \nhis official capacity. \n10.  Defendant ANTONIO MARTIN is the Executive Director of the \nKings County Hospital Center and is responsible for the day-to-day \noperations of KCHC.  Defendant MARTIN is sued in his official capacity. \n11.  Defendant JOSEPH P. MERLINO, M.D., is the Deputy Executive \nDirector for Behavioral Health Services at the Kings County Hospital Center \nand is responsible for the day-to-day administration of behavioral health \nservices at KCHC.  Defendant Merlino is sued in his official capacity. \n12.  Defendants are legally responsible, in whole or in part, for the \noperation and conditions of KCHC, and for the health and safety of persons \ninstitutionalized at KCHC. \n13.  Defendants are governmental authorities or agents thereof with \nresponsibility for the administration of KCHC within the meaning of \n42 U.S.C. § 1997a and 42 U.S.C. § 14141(a). \n14.  At all relevant times, the Defendants or their predecessors in office \nhave acted or failed to act, as alleged herein, under color of law. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n15.  KCHC  is an institution within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1997(1). \n- 4 ­\n\n16.  Individuals are confined to, or reside at, KCHC because they have \nbeen determined by the courts or Defendants to have mental illness or other \ndisabilities requiring protections, supports, and services. \n17.  Defendants are obligated to operate KCHC in a manner that does \nnot infringe upon the federal rights, as protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States and by other federal \nlaw, of KCHC patients. \n18.  The protections, supports, and services at KCHC substantially \ndepart from generally accepted professional standards of care, thereby \nexposing the individuals residing there to significant risk of harm, and in \nsome cases, to actual harm, as set forth in the letter issued by Acting \nAssistant Attorney General Loretta King on January 30, 2009, detailing the \nUnited States’ investigative findings of conditions at KCHC (“Findings \nLetter”).  The Findings Letter is appended to this Complaint as Attachment \nB and is incorporated by reference herein. \n19.  The protections, supports, and services substantially depart from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care in the following specific \nrespects, among others, and detailed in the Findings Letter: \na.\t  the provision of reasonably safe conditions, including \nprotection from harm and environmental conditions, so as \n- 5 ­\n\nto ensure the reasonable safety and personal security of \nKCHC patients; \nb.  the provision of adequate treatment planning, necessary \nto protect KCHC patients’ liberty interests, sufficient to \nensure their safety and freedom from undue or \nunreasonable restraint; \nc.  the provision of adequate psychiatric, psychological and \nmedical and nursing care services to KCHC patients; \nd.  the provision of adequate and appropriate hospital \npolicing services; and \ne.  the provision of adequate discharge planning and \ncommunity placement services.  \n20.  KCHC patients are “qualified individual[s] with a disability” \nunder the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, 12131. \n21.  The City and the City of New York Health and Hospitals \nCorporation are “public entities” under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131. \n  22.  Defendants have violated the ADA by excluding KCHC patients, \nby reason of their disability, from placement in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs by failing and continuing to fail to ensure that \n- 6 ­\n\nKCHC patients are adequately evaluated for placement in the most \nintegrated setting; that those individual patients whom professionals \ndetermine should be placed in community programs are placed in such \nprograms, when appropriate; and that KCHC patients are served in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to each patient’s individual needs. \nVIOLATIONS ALLEGED \n23.  The United States incorporates by reference the allegations set \nforth in Paragraphs 1 through 22, as if fully set forth herein. \n24.  The acts and omissions alleged in Paragraphs 18 and 19 and \noutlined in the Findings Letter constitute a pattern or practice and infringe \nupon the KCHC patients’ legal rights and substantive liberty interests and \nconstitute resistance to their full enjoyment of their rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured or protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States and by other federal law, and deprive \nKCHC patients of such rights, privileges, or immunities. \n25.  The acts and omissions alleged in Paragraph 22 and outlined in \nthe Findings Letter violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101 et seq., and the regulations promulgated thereto, 28 C.F.R. Part 35, \nby failing to administer services, programs, or activities to KCHC patients in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  \n- 7 ­\n\n26.  Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to \nengage in the acts and omissions set forth in Paragraphs 18, 19, and 22 and \nin the Findings Letter that deprive KCHC patients of rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured or protected by the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n27.  The Attorney General is authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 1997 to \nseek equitable and declaratory relief. \nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that this Honorable Court \nenter an order permanently enjoining Defendants, their officers, agents, \nemployees, subordinates, successors in office, and all those acting in concert \nor participation with them from continuing the acts, omissions, and practices \nset forth in paragraphs 18, 19, and 22 above, and that this Court require \nDefendants to take such actions as will ensure lawful conditions are afforded \nto patients at KCHC.  The United States further prays that this Court grant \nsuch other and further equitable relief as it may deem just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s Erich H.
