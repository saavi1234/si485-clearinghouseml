Following five years of research and general legal support to community-based education advocacy groups, in August 2015, the Center (with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and the national law firm Latham &amp; Watkins) filed suit on behalf of two community organizations and three parents against the Halifax County Board of Commissioners. The lawsuit seeks to vindicate right of all Halifax County&rsquo;s schoolchildren under the North Carolina Constitution a sound basic education by urging the consolidation of the three, small racially segregated school districts within Halifax County. For years, these have been some of the state&rsquo;s lowest academically performing districts. The case was dismissed on a 12(b)(6) motion, and is currently pending before the North Carolina Court of Appeals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
