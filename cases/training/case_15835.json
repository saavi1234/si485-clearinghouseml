Werber Bryan Psychiatric Hospital (Bryan Hospital), along with a non-profit corporation that advocates for the rights of people with disabilities - Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities Inc - filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. This lawsuit was brought against the South Carolina Department of Mental Health and the South Carolina Mental Health Commission, which operated Bryan Hospital. The plaintiffs, represented by the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities Inc, and private counsels, claimed violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had a practice of arbitrarily preventing patients the opportunity to discharge from Bryan Hospital despite those patients being stable and capable of integrating with society. Furthermore, the defendants had a practice of isolating these patients, preventing them from contacting family and friends, and charging $503.00 daily for those that did not have access to medical insurance. The case was assigned to Judge Richard Gergel. </p><p>On July 27, 2017, the court issued a scheduling order for discovery proceedings. The scheduling was amended twice.</p><p>On April 3, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. The plaintiffs sought the class to be defined as: “All current and future adult, non-forensic residents of G. Werber Bryan Psychiatric Hospital (“Bryan”) who, with appropriate supports and services, would now or in the future be able to live in an integrated community setting and who do not oppose living in an integrated community setting.” The parties informed the court that they had begun mediation in July of 2018, but discovery continued during this time. </p><p>The court denied the plaintiffs' motion to certify the class on August 21, 2018, and subsequently denied their motion to reconsider the issue on September 7, 2018. Discovery and mediation continued into 2019. </p><p>On February 25, 2019, after the death of one of the plaintiffs, plaintiffs' counsel stipulated to dismissal of the claims only so far as they related to that plaintiff. Two days later, on February 27, 2019, the attorneys for the defendants submitted a letter informing the court that the mediation had resulted in a successful settlement of the claims. That same day, the court dismissed the case without prejudice for 60 days, giving both parties the opportunity to reopen the action if the settlement was not consummated. The contents of the private settlement agreement were not made publicly available. On March 14, 2019, after stipulation to dismissal, the case was dismissed with prejudice. This case is now closed. </p>",

Every  day,  adults  with  mental  disabilities  are  unnecessarily  and  illegally  segregated  in \nSouth  Carolina’s  G.  Werber  Bryan  Psychiatric  Hospital  (“Bryan”  or  “Bryan  Hospital”).  These \nadults  remain  in  this  isolating  institution  because  Defendants  have  failed  to  develop  sufficient \ncommunity-based  mental  health  services.\naL?-tv-Q1346-RMG  Date Filed  O5/2  Entry  Number  Page 2  oF  53 \n2.  These  residents  of Bryan  Hospital  experience  the  type  of “[u|njustified  isolation”  that the \nSupreme  Court  calls  “discrimination  based  on  disability.”  Olmstead  v.  L.C.,  527  U.S.  581,  597 \n(1999). \n3.  Contrary  to  modern  and  generally  accepted  methods  of providing  mental  health  care,  this \nisolation  at  Bryan  may  last  for  years,  possibly  decades.  All  too  often,  this  isolation  happens  not \nbecause  it  is  necessary to  facilitate  care,  but  rather  because  Defendants  have  not  provided  the \nservices,  programs,  and  activities  to  support these  individuals  in  the  community  where  Plaintiffs \ncan  live  healthy,  productive  lives. \n4.  Individual  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  on  their  behalf and  on  the  behalf of others  similarly \nsituated  under  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”)  and  Section  504  of the \nRehabilitation  Act  (“Section  504”)  to  require  the  Defendants  to  administer  “services,  programs, \nand  activities  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities.”  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130  (d);  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51  (d).  Protection  and  Advocacy  for  People \nwith  Disabilities,  Inc.  (“P&A”)  brings  this  action  on  behalf of its  constituents. \n5.  Defendants  violate  their  obligation  to  comply  with  the  ADA  and  Section  504  by: \na.  unjustifiably  isolating  and  segregating  individuals  at  Bryan  Hospital; \nSs  failing  to  consistently  provide  adequate  integrated  services  in  the  community; \nc.  overly  and  inappropriately  relying  upon  segregated  residential  facilities  for  outpatient \ntreatment; \nd.  failing  to  develop  and  maintain  a working  plan  for  implementing  the  ADA’s \nintegration  mandate; \ne.  employing  policies  and  practices  that  create  arbitrary  barriers  to  discharge  and  access \nto  community  mental  health  services,  programs,  and  activities;  and\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG  Date  Filed  05/24/17  Entry  Number1  Page 3  of  53 \nf.  charging  the  Plaintiffs  fees  of $503  per  day  for  unnecessary  and  unjustified \nhospitalization,  creating  a perpetual  burden  of debt that  will  follow  them  to  their \ndeath,  making  any  attempt  at  accumulating  wealth  and  planning  for  inheritance \npotentially  meaningless. \nThe  Defendants’  policies  and  practices,  their  failure  to  remove  discriminatory  barriers,  and  their \nfailure  to  reasonably  modify their  programs  and  services  to  make  integrated  community  mental \nhealth  services  available,  have  consigned  individuals  at  Bryan  to  prolonged  and  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. \n6.  Individual  Plaintiffs,  Plaintiff class,  and  P&A  constituents!  are  harmed  by  the  isolation \nand  segregation  caused  by  the  Defendants.  This  isolation  “perpetuates  unwarranted  assumptions \nthat  persons  so  isolated  are  incapable  or  unworthy  of participating  in  community  life”  and \n“severely  diminishes  the  everyday  life  activities  of individuals,  including  family  relations,  social \ncontacts,  work  options,  economic  independence,  educational  advancement,  and  cultural \nenrichment.”  Olmstead,  527  U.S.  at  600. \nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n7.  This  is  an  action  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief for violations  of Title  II  of the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act  of  1990  (ADA),  42  U.S.C.  §  12132,  et  seg.  and  Section  504  of \nthe  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973  (Section  504),  29  U.S.C.  §  794,  et  seq. \n8.  Jurisdiction  for  these  claims  is  based  on  28  U.S.C.  §§  1331,  1343  (a)  (3)  and  (4). \n9.  Plaintiffs’  claims  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief are  authorized  by  28  U.S.C.  §§ \n2201,  2202  and  Rule  65,  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure. \n  \n'  Hereinafter  individual  Plaintiffs,  Plaintiff class,  and  P&A  constituents,  collectively,  shall  be \nreferred  to  as  “Plaintiffs.”\n10.  Venue  is  proper  in  the  District  of South  Carolina pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391  (b) \nbecause:  Defendants  reside,  operate,  and  perform  their  official  duties  in  this  District;  a \nsubstantial  part  of the  actions  and  omissions  of which  Plaintiffs  complain  occurred  in  this \nDistrict;  and  Plaintiffs  are  institutionalized  in  this  District. \n11.  Venue  is  proper  in  the  Charleston  Division  because  the  Defendants  do  business  in  this \nDivision  relating  to  the  events  and  omissions  alleged  in  this  complaint  and  where  a  substantial \npart  of the  events  and  omissions  giving  rise  to  the  claim  occurred. \nPARTIES \nIndividual  Plaintiffs \n12.  Each  named  plaintiff is  a patient  of Bryan  Hospital.  For  each  named  plaintiff, \ncommunity  based  services  and  supports  would  be  appropriate.  None  of the  named  plaintiffs \noppose  community  based  treatment.  Each  named  plaintiff has  been  involuntarily  committed  to \nBryan  Hospital. \nAW \n13.  AW  was  born  in  1983.  He  is  from  Georgetown  County. \n14.  AW  has  lived  at  Bryan  the  majority  of his  adult  life,  starting  in  2007. \n15.  AW  1s  aperson  with  a mental  disability. \n16.  AW  1s  substantially  limited  in  his  ability to  learn  and  to  care  for  himself.  He  has  a \nlearning  disability that  affects  his  ability  to  read  and  write. \n17.  | AW  1s  qualified  to  receive  services  from  SCDMH  and  does  receive  services  from \nSCDMH.\n18.  In  his  most  recent  admission,  AW  was  admitted  to  Bryan  on  December  3,  2013.  He  has \nspent the  last  forty-one  months  in  a  locked  ward  at  Bryan,  except  for  periods  of time  where  he \nwas  temporarily  released  into  the  care  of family,  known  as  going  on  a  “pass.” \n19.  —  As  of April  24,  2017,  AW’s  bill  for  his  care  during  his  current  admission  at  Bryan  is \nestimated  at  $621,708.  The  total  bill  for  his  care  since  2007  may  exceed  a  million  dollars. \n20.  | AW  loves  art  and  working.  Bryan  staff limits  his  access  to  art  in  both  time  and  the \nmediums  with  which  he  is  allowed  to  work.  He  wants  to  be  discharged  so  that  he  can  pursue  his \nart  whenever  he  wants.  He  also  wants  to  work  in  the  community. \n21.  AW’s  treatment team  has  attempted  to  get  his  mother  to  accept  him  into  her  care,  but  she \nhas  not  been  able  to  do  more  than  to  allow  him  to  come  home  for  extended  passes.  Because  he \ndoes  not  have  a place  to  live  and  a way  to  receive  the  level  of services  he  needs,  he  remains  at \nBryan. \n22.  AW  could  be  safely  discharged  to  live  in  the  community  if Defendants  provided  adequate \nservices  to  meet  his  needs,  as  is  required  of the  Defendants  under  the  ADA  and  Section  504. \nWL \n23.  WL  was  born  in  1952  in  Hartsville,  South  Carolina.  She  was  left  at the  State  Hospital  in \nColumbia  at  age  twelve  and  remained  there  until  she  turned  twenty-four.  Since  then  she  has  had \nmany  hospitalizations,  but  she  has  also  had  times  where  she  received  adequate  services  in  the \ncommunity  and  succeeded  in  the  community. \n24.  WL  is  aperson  with  a mental  disability. \n25.  |  WL  is  substantially  limited  in  her  ability to  work  and  to  care  for  herself.  She  also  needs \nassistance  with  walking  and  uses  a walker  to  assist  her  and  reduce  the  risk  of falls.\n2:1y-cv-O1S46-RMG  Date  Filed  OD/e  Entry  Numoe  Page  5  of  53 \n26.  WL  is  qualified  to  receive  services  from  SCDMH  and  does  receive  services  from \nSCDMH. \n27.  In  her  most  recent  admission,  WL  was  admitted  to  Bryan  on  September  26,  2015.  She \nhas  been  at  Bryan  for  twenty  months.  Her treatment team  has  been  seeking  discharge  the \nmajority  of that  time,  but  they  have  not  been  able  to  identify  a place  where  she  could  live  and \nhave  her  needs  met. \n28.  As  of April  24,  2017,  WL’s  bill  for  her  care  for  her  current  admission  at  Bryan  is \nestimated  at  $289,225.  Given  her  prior  admissions,  the  total  amount  of what  she  owes  SCDMH \nmay  exceed  a million  dollars,  including  charges  for  days  she  was  in  the  hospital  but  did  not \nrequire  hospitalization. \n29.  WL  is  frustrated  with  the  time  she  has  spent  in  the  hospital.  She  knows  that  she  has \nbecome  dependent  upon  the  care  she  receives  but  wants  to  live  more  independently.  She  would \nlike  to  live  in  a  situation  where  she  would  share  a  house  with  someone  who  could  assist  her  with \ntransportation  and  help  her  if she  has  a  seizure. \n30.  WL  could  be  safely  discharged  to  live  in  the  community  if Defendants  provided  adequate \nservices  to  meet  her  needs,  as  is  required  of the  Defendants  under  the  ADA  and  Section  504. \nRC \n31.  RC  was  born  in  1975.  He  is  from  Williamsburg  County. \n32.  |RCisaperson  with  a mental  disability. \n33.  RC  1s  substantially  limited  in  his  ability to  work  and  to  care  for  himself. \n34.  RC  is  qualified  to  receive  services  from  SCDMH  and  does  receive  services  from \nSCDMH.\n35.  RC  was  admitted  to  Bryan  on  September  29,  2015.  He  has  been  at  Bryan  for  twenty \nmonths. \n36.  As  of April  24,  2017,  RC’s  bill  for  his  care  during  his  current  admission  at  Bryan  is \nestimated  at  $287,716. \n37.  RC  wants  out  of Bryan  and  has  been  frustrated  with  many  delays.  The  most  recent  delay \nmay  last  for  ninety  days  because  he  needs  to  apply  to  be  eligible  for  a  state  benefit.  His \ntreatment team  has  been  seeking  his  discharge  for  several  months,  but  because  his  benefits  need \nto  be  initiated,  his  discharge  has  been  delayed. \n38.  RC  could  be  safely  discharged  to  live  in  the  community  if Defendants  provided  adequate \nservices  to  meet  his  needs,  as  is  required  of the  Defendants  under  the  ADA  and  Section  504. \nMJ \n39.  MJ  was  born  in  1960.  He  is  from  Richland  County. \nAQ.  MJ  is  aperson  with  a mental  disability,  according  to  his  physician. \nAl.  MJ  is  substantially  limited  in  his  ability to  work.  He  does  not  have  any  significant job \nhistory. \n42.  MJ  1s  qualified  to  receive  services  from  SCDMH  and  does  receive  services  from \nSCDMH. \n43.  For  his  most  recent  admission  to  Bryan,  MJ  was  admitted  on  October  14,  2010. \n44.  As  of April  24,  2017,  MJ’s  bill  for  his  care  during  his  current  admission  at  Bryan  is \nestimated  at  $1,197,643. \n45.  He  would  like  to  be  discharged  to  have  more  control  over  his  life.  He  hopes  to  get  a job \nand  be  able  to  get  dentures.\n  \n46.   MJ’s  treatment  team  has  been  working  with  his  family  on  a  discharge  plan,  wanting  his \nfamily  to  provide  the  care  and  supervision  he  needs.  Because  those  plans  with  family  have  not \nbeen  able  to  be  finalized,  he  remains  in  Bryan. \nA7.  MJ  could  be  safely  discharged  to  live  in  the  community  if Defendants  provided  adequate \nservices  to  meet  his  needs,  as  is  required  of the  Defendants  under  the  ADA  and  Section  504. \nCM \nA8.  CM  was  born  in  1990.  She  is  originally  from  the  Charleston  area. \n49,  CM  is  a person  with  a mental  disability. \n50.  CM  is  substantially  limited  in  her  ability to  work.  She  has  very  little  work  history,  but \nshe  did  work  a  few  hours  a week  in  one  facility  where  she  was a  resident. \n51.  CM  is  qualified  to  receive  services  from  SCDMH  and  does  receive  services  from \nSCDMH. \n52.  CM  was  admitted  to  Bryan  on  May  11,  2011,  at the  age  of  19.  She  will  soon  turn  27.  She \nhas  spent  the  past  72  months  in  a  locked  unit  at  Bryan. \n53.  In  May  of 2017,  she  agreed  to  go  on  a  “pass”  to  spend  several  weeks  living  in  a \nHomeshare,  which  is  similar to  an  adult  foster  home.  A  “pass”  is  when  a  patient  leaves  the \nhospital  for  a period  of time.  After  the  pass  expires,  CM  may  be  discharged,  or  she  may  return  to \nBryan.  During  the  pass,  she  remains  a patient  at  Bryan  and  does  not  receive  services  from  the \nCommunity  Mental  Health  Center  (CMHC). \n54.  As  of April  24,  2017,  CM’s  bill  for  her  care  during  her  current  admission  at  Bryan  may \nbe  as  high  as  $1,059,318.  Upon  information  and  belief,  she  continues  to  accrue  charges  while \nshe  is  on  a pass.\n55.  |  CM  realizes  that  she  has  missed  much  of her  youth  while  at the  hospital  to  the  point that \nshe  is  dependent  upon  the  hospital  even  though  it  is  not  necessary.  She  desires  to  receive  the \nsupports  she  needs  to  transition  to  living  in  the  community.  Even  though  she  1s  currently  in  a \nHomeshare  setting,  she  hopes  to  be  live  in  her  own  apartment with  assistance  in  learning \nindependent  living  skills  and  to  work  on  having  her  poetry  published. \n56.  CM’s  treatment  team  feels  she  is  not  only  ready  for  discharge,  but  also  that  continued \nhospitalization  has  a negative  impact  on  her  ability  to  live  independently. \n57.  CM  could  be  safely  discharged  to  live  in  the  community  if Defendants  provided  adequate \nservices  to  meet  her  needs,  as  is  required  by  the  Defendants  under the  ADA  and  Section  504. \nHH \n58.  HH  was  born  in  1958.  He  is  from  Charleston  County. \n59.  HH  is  a person  with  a mental  disability. \n60.  HH  is  substantially  limited  in  his  ability to  work  and  to  care  for  himself. \n61.  | HH  is  qualified  to  receive  services  from  SCDMH  and  does  receive  services  from \nSCDMH. \n62.  | HH  was  admitted  to  Bryan  on  October  12,  2014.  He  has  been  at  Bryan  for  thirty-one \nmonths. \n63.  As  of April  24,  2017,  HH’s  bill  for  his  care  during  his  current  admission  at  Bryan  is \nestimated  at  $462,257. \n64.  | HH  has  been  frustrated  with  the  CRCF  options  he  has  had  for  discharge.  The  most  recent \noption  provided  to  him  was  discharge  at  a  facility  with  70  beds.  He  did  not  like  that  facility,  and \nhe  wants  to  have  his  own  place  with  services.\n65.  | HH  could  be  safely  discharged  to  live  in  the  community  if the  Defendants  provided \nadequate  services  to  meet  his  needs,  as  is  required  of the  Defendants  under  the  ADA  and  Section \n504. \nP&A \n66.  P&A  is  an  independent,  statewide,  non-profit  corporation  that  is  authorized  to  seek  legal \nand  equitable  relief. \n67.  P&A  is  designated  to  protect  and  advance  the  legal  rights  of people  with  disabilities, \nincluding  the  right  of people  with  disabilities  to  live  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate. \n68.  P&A  is  part  of a nationwide  network  of protection  and  advocacy  agencies  located  in  all \nfifty  states,  the  District  of Columbia,  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  federal  territories.  The  protection  and \nadvocacy  system  comprises  the  nation’s  largest  provider  of legally  based  advocacy  services  for \npeople  with  disabilities. \n69.  Since  September  of  1977,  pursuant to  federal  law,  P&A  has  been  the  designated \nprotection  and  advocacy  system  for  people  with  disabilities,  designated  by  then-South  Carolina \nGovernor  James  Edwards.  In  1979,  P&A,  then  known  as  Advocacy  for  Handicapped  Citizens, \nwas  designated  by  legislation  as  the  federally  mandated  protection  and  advocacy  system  in  South \nCarolina.  S.C.  Code  Ann.  §  43-33-310  to  43-33-400. \n70.  As  the  protection  and  advocacy  system  for  South  Carolina,  P&A  serves  as  the  designated \nagency  to  implement the  Protection  and  Advocacy  for  Individuals  with  Mental  Illness  Act \n(PAIMI),  42  U.S.C.  §§  10801  —  10807,  10821  -  10827;  the  Protection  and  Advocacy  for \nIndividuals  with  Developmental  Disabilities  Act  (PAIDD),  42  U.S.C.  §§  15041-15045;  the \nProtection  and  Advocacy  for  Individuals  with  Traumatic  Brain  Injury Act  (PATBI),  42  U.S.C.  § \n300d-53;  and  the  Protection  and  Advocacy  for  Individual  Rights  Act  (PAIR),  29  U.S.C.  §  794e. \n10\nPursuant to  federal  law,  P&A  has  the  statutory  authority  to  pursue  legal,  administrative,  and \nother  appropriate  remedies  to  advocate  for the  rights  and  interests  of people  with  disabilities. \nLikewise,  under  state  law,  P&A  “shall  protect  and  advocate  for  the  rights  of all.  .  .  handicapped \npersons  by  pursuing  legal.  .  .  remedies  to  insure  the  protection  of the  rights  of these  persons.” \nS.C.  Code  Ann.  §  43-33-350(1). \n71.  The  federal  regulations  governing  the  P&A  network  provide  that  each  P&A  system  is \nauthorized  to  bring  “lawsuits  in  its  own  right to  redress  incidents  of abuse  or  neglect, \ndiscrimination  and  other  rights  violations  impacting  on  individuals  with  mental  illness  and  when \nit  appears  on  behalf of individual  plaintiffs  or  a  class  of plaintiffs  for  such  purposes.”  42  C.F.R. \n§  51.6  (f). \n72.  As  required  by  42  C.F.R.  §  51.23,  P&A  has  a PAIMI  Advisory  Council  that  meets \nquarterly  and  advises  P&A’s  Board.  Sixty  percent  of the  members  of the  Advisory  Council  must \nbe,  and  are,  people  with  mental  disabilities  or  people  who  have  a  family  member  with  a mental \ndisability.  The  chair  of the  Advisory  Council  must  be,  and  is,  a person  with  a mental  disability \nor  a  family  member  of a  person  with  a mental  disability.  The  Advisory  Council  solicits  public \ninput  and  recommends  priorities  to  P&A’s  Board.  The  chairperson  of the  Advisory  Council  is  a \nmember  of the  P&A’s  Board  of Directors. \n73.  A  majority  of the  members  of P&A’s  Board  of Directors  are  people  with  disabilities  or \npeople  with  family  members  with  disabilities.  The  Board  of Directors  is  responsible  for  the \noverall  management  of P&A  and  for  setting  case  and  advocacy  priorities,  with  advice  from  the \nAdvisory  Council. \n74.  P&A,  the  Board  of Directors,  and  the  Advisory  Council  seek  input  from  P&A’s \nconstituents,  people  with  disabilities,  and  others  on  P&A’s  goals  and  priorities.  This  process  of \n1]\nseeking  input  includes  a yearly  meeting  at  Bryan  Hospital,  attended  by  Bryan  residents.  The \nmost  recent  meeting  of this  kind  was  held  on  August  22,  2016. \n75.  Atthe  yearly  meeting  at  Bryan  on  P&A’s  goals  and  priorities,  residents  of Bryan  are \nprovided  with  information  regarding  P&A’s  current  priorities  and  information  on  how  to  provide \ninput  on  P&A’s  future  priorities.  Residents  frequently  mention  their  desire  to  be  discharged  and \ncomment  on  problems  with  delays  in  discharge.  Because  of this  input  and  input  from  the \nAdvisory  Council  and  others,  one  of P&A’s  priorities  is  promoting  inclusion  in  the  community— \n“To  facilitate  the  cornmmunity  integration  of mdividuals  with  disabilities  by  protecting  their  rights \nto  receive  appropriate  supports  and  service,  in  the  most  integrated  settings.”  Protection  and \nAdvocacy  for  People  with  Disabilities,  Inc.  2016-2017  Goals,  available  at \nhttp://www. pandasc.org/about/priorities/  Gast  viewed  April  14,  2017). \n76.  Based  upon  P&A’s  goals  and  priorities,  P&A  supports  and  represents  people  with  mental \ndisabilities  at  Bryan  Hospital,  including  advocating  for  their  discharge.  P&A  also  serves  people \nwho  receive  mental  health  services  in  the  community. \n77.  P&A  constituents  include  all  of the  individual  Plaintiffs,  members  of the  Plaintiff class, \nand  others  who  could  bring  an  action  against  the  Defendants  on  their  own  behalf under  the  ADA \nand  Section  504. \n78.  For  the  past  several  years,  P&A  has  visited  Bryan  Hospital  approximately  50  times  per \nyear.  At  Bryan,  P&A  meets  with  clients;  monitors  the  facility;  attends  treatment team  meetings; \nadvocates  for the  individuals  living  in  the  facility,  including  advocating  for  timely  and \nappropriate  discharge;  and  investigates  allegations  of abuse,  neglect,  and  exploitation. \n79.  For  the  last  decade,  P&A  has  worked  with  44  constituents  in  Bryan  Hospital  on  issues \nrelated  to  their  discharge.  For  individuals  living  in  the  community,  P&A  has  advocated  for \n12\nincreased  access  to  community  mental  health  services,  including  bringing  two  cases  through  the \ninternal  grievance  process  developed  by  the  Defendants.  In  addition  to  specific  case  by  case \nadvocacy,  P&A  has  also  advocated  for  a  resolution  to  the  issues  raised  in  this  complaint  by \nparticipating  on  committees,  issuing  reports,  and  writing  letters  to  and  meeting  with  the \nDefendants. \n80.  AW,  WL,  RC,  MJ,  CM,  and  HH  are  P&A  constituents. \n81.  Many  of P&A’s  constituents  have  faced  discrimination  by  being  isolated  and  segregated \nat  Bryan  Hospital.  P&A  constituents  include  individuals  who: \na.  Need  nursing  home  care  (a  less  restrictive  setting  than  Bryan),  but  Defendants,  who \noperate  nursing  homes  will  not  admit them; \nb.  Have  become  intensely  dependent  upon  the  hospital  to  the  point that  even  though \ndischarge  is  what they  want,  they  are  fearful  of being  discharged; \nc.  Deteriorate  while  waiting  on  placement  because  of the  length  of time  it takes; \nd.  Become  depressed  because  they  see  no  hope  that they  will  live  in  any  other  setting; \nand/or \ne.  Cannot  be  discharged  because  Defendant’s  discharge  planning  relies  heavily  on \ndischarge  to  CRCF  settings  and  the  constituents  have  needs,  such  as  the  management \nof sliding-scale  insulin,  which  cannot  be  addressed  in  a  CRCF  setting. \n82.  P&A  has  successfully  asserted  its  associational  standing  to  vindicate  the  rights  of people \nwith  disabilities,  including  in  class  action  litigation,  and  specifically  the  rights  of people  with \nmental  disabilities. \n13\nDefendants \n83.  Defendant  John  H.  Magill  (“Magill”  or  “Defendant”)  is  the  State  Director  of Mental \nHealth  and  chief executive  of the  South  Carolina  Department  of Mental  Health  (SCDMH). \n“Subject to  the  supervision  and  control  of the  Mental  Health  Commission,  the  state  director \nshall  administer  the  policies  and  regulations  established  by  the  commission.”  S.C.  Code  Ann. \n§  44-9-40. \n84.  Magill  is  appointed  by  the  South  Carolina Mental  Health  Commission  (“Commission” \nor  “Defendant’”).  S.C.  Code  Ann.  §  44-9-40. \n85.  Magill  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity  only. \n86.  Magill  has  control  and  responsibility  over  SCDMH,  as  directed  by  the  Commission. \n87.  SCDMH,  as  an  agency  of South  Carolina,  was  created  by  S.C.  Code  Ann.  §  44-9-10. \n88.  SCDMH  has  “jurisdiction  over  all  of the  State’s  mental  hospitals,  clinics  and  centers, \n[and] joint  State  and  community  sponsored  mental  health  clinics  and  centers....”.  S.C.  Code \nAnn.  §  44-9-10. \n89.  As  adepartment  of the  State  of South  Carolina,  SCDMH  is  a public  entity  covered  by \nTitle  Il  of the  ADA.  42  U.S.C.  §  12131  (1);  28  C.F.R.  §  35.104. \n90.  SCDMH  is  a recipient  of federal  funds,  including  funds  from  the  Medicaid  and  Medicare \nprogram  and  the  mental  health  block  grant  program. \n91.  The  Commission  is  the  governing  body  of the  SCDMH  and  has jurisdiction  over  the \nstate's  public  mental  health  system. \n92.  The  Commission  has  seven  members  who  are  appointed  for  five-year terms  by  the \ngovernor  with  the  advice  and  consent  of the  Senate.  S.C.  Code  Ann.  §  44-9-30. \n14\n93.  The  Commission  determines  policies  and  has  authority  “to  promulgate  regulations \ngoverning  the  operation  of the  department  and  the  employment  of professional  and  staff \npersonnel.”  S.C.  Code  Ann.  §  44-9-30  (C). \n94.  By  statute,  the  Commission  is  required  “to  provide  a  statewide  system  for  the  delivery  of \nmental  health  services  to  treat,  care  for,  reduce,  and  prevent  mental  illness  and  provide  mental \nhealth  services  for  citizens  of this  State,  whether  or  not  in  a hospital.  The  system  must  include \nservices  to  prevent  or  postpone  the  commitment  or  recommitment  of citizens  to  hospitals.”  S.C. \nCode  Ann.  §  44-9-90. \n95.  The  Commission  may  require  reports  from  the  director  of a  state  hospital  “relating  to  the \nadmission,  examination,  diagnosis,  discharge,  or  conditional  discharge  of a  patient...  .”  S.C. \nCode  Ann.  §  44-9-100. \n96.  |The  Commission,  through  its  director,  Magill,  operates  SCDMH  (Commission,  Magill, \nand  SCDMH,  collectively,  shall  be  referred  to  as  “Defendants”).  Together,  the  Commission  and \nMagill  have  control  over  the  direction  of SCDMH. \n97.  Defendants  are  subject to  the  requirements  of Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act \nbecause  SCDMH  receives  federal  funds. \n98.  Defendants  administer  mental  health  services  in  institutional  settings  and  in  the \ncommunity. \n99.  Defendants  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  individuals  with  disabilities  who  are \nqualified  for  SCDMH  services  are  served  in  accordance  with  federal  law,  including  the  ADA  and \nSection  504. \n100.  .SCDMH  is  divided  administratively  into  two  divisions—inpatient  services  and  outpatient \nServices. \n15\n101.  SCDMH’s  inpatient  division  operates  two  state  psychiatric  hospitals,  three  nursing \nhomes,  one  alcohol  and  drug  addiction  treatment  center,  and  one  sexually  violent  predator \nprogram.  Two  additional  nursing  homes  are  being  planned. \n102.  The  state  hospitals  operated  by  Defendants  are  Bryan  Hospital  in  Columbia  and  Patrick \nB.  Harris  Psychiatric  Hospital  (“Harris  Hospital”)  in  Anderson. \n103.  Bryan  Hospital  (licensed  for  530  beds)  and  Harris  Hospital  (licensed  for  200  beds)  make \nup  over  40%  of all  the  psychiatric  hospital  beds  in  the  state.  These  two  hospitals  are  the  largest \npsychiatric  hospitals  in  the  state. \n104.  Defendants  divide  the  state  into  four  geographical  areas  called  regions,  each  designated \nby  aletter:  Region  A,  Region  B,  Region  C,  and  Region  D.  Regions  A,  C,  and  D  are  in  the \neastern  or  lower  portion  of the  state.  Region  B  is  in  the  western  or  upstate  portion  of the  state. \n105.  Individuals  from  Regions  A,  C,  and  D  who  need  to  receive  services  from  a  state  hospital \nare  usually  confined  at  Bryan  Hospital.  Individuals  from  Region  B,  the  upstate  region,  who  need \nto  receive  services  from  a  state  hospital,  are  usually  confined  at  Harris  Hospital. \n106.  SCDMH’s  outpatient  division,  also  known  as  the  division  of community  mental  health \nservices,  operates  seventeen  CMHCs.  Each  center  is  responsible  for  a  “catchment  area”  of the \nstate,  and  oversees  the  various,  albeit  limited,  community  based  services  that  operate  in  the \ncatchment  area.  Each  catchment  area  is  assigned  to  a Region. \n107.  The  services  that  are  provided  and  the  services  that  are  available  are  not  consistent  at \neach  of the  seventeen  CMHCs.  The  SCDMH  outpatient  division  offers  a  limited  and \ninconsistent  array  of services,  office  hours,  and  options  throughout the  CMHC  system. \n16\nCLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n108.  Pursuant to  Rule  23(a)  and  (b)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Plaintiffs  bring \nthis  action  on  behalf of themselves  and  other  individuals  similarly  institutionalized  in  Bryan \nHospital,  which  is  operated  by  the  Defendants.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief \nindividually  and  on  behalf of the  class  to  remedy  and  prevent  their  needless  institutionalization  in \nBryan  Hospital. \n109.  The  proposed  class  consists  of current  and  future  adult,  non-forensic  residents  of Bryan \nHospital  who,  with  appropriate  supports  and  services,  would  now  or  in  the  future  be  able  to  live \nin  an  integrated  community  setting  and  who  do  not  oppose  living  in  an  integrated  community \nsetting. \n110.  Numerosity.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that joinder  of all  members  is  impracticable.  As  of \nMay  2017,  152  adults  were  confined  at  the  adult  services  portion  of Bryan.  According  to  the \n2016/2017  budget,  the  number  of beds  is  increasing  from  140  to  160  in  the  2016/2017  state  fiscal \nyear. \n111.  Commonality.  There  are  questions  of law  and  fact  common  to  the  class  including: \na.  Whether  Defendants  are  violating  the  ADA  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act  by  failing  to \nprovide  services  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of the \nPlaintiffs. \nb.  Whether  Defendants  are  violating  the  ADA  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act  by  utilizing \nmethods  of administration  in  their  mental  health  system  resulting  in  isolation  and \nsegregation  of the  Plaintiffs. \n17\nfone wet  wt \nc.  Whether  Defendants  are  violating  the  ADA  by  failing  to  make  reasonable \nmodifications  to  programs  and  services  to  provide  the  Plaintiffs  integrated  community \nservices  needed  to  end  unnecessary  hospitalization. \nd.  Whether  Defendants  are  violating  the  ADA  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act  by  overly  and \ninappropriately  relying  upon  segregated  facilities,  namely  Community  Residential \nCare  Facilities  (CRCFs),  for  outpatient treatment. \ne.  Whether  the  Defendants  are  violating  the  ADA  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act  by  failing \nto  have  a  comprehensive  and  effective  working  plan  for  serving  Plaintiffs  in  the  least \nrestrictive  setting  appropriate  to  their  needs—an  Olmstead plan.  See  Olmstead v. \nL.C.,  527  U.S.  581,  587  (1999). \nf.  Whether  the  Defendants  should  be  enjoined  from  issuing  or  collecting  on  bills \ndirected  to  Plaintiffs  which  were  accrued  when  the  Plaintiffs  were  hospitalized  but \ndesired  discharge,  were  ready  to  be  discharged,  and  could  have  been  discharged  if the \nDefendants  had  provided  services  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate. \n112.   Typicality.  The  individual  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  typical  of the  class,  such  that  the \nindividual  Plaintiffs  will  adequately  and  fairly  represent  the  interests  of the  class  members. \n113.  Adequate  Representation.  The  individual  Plaintiffs  will  fully  and  vigorously  prosecute \nthis  action.  The  individual  Plaintiffs  do  not  have  any  interests  antagonistic  to  those  of other  class \nmembers.  By  filing  this  action,  the  individual  Plaintiffs  have  displayed  an  interest  in  vindicating \ntheir  rights,  as  well  as  the  rights  of others  who  are  similarly  situated. \n114.  Attorneys  representing  the  individual  Plaintiffs  are  experienced  in  and  knowledgeable \nabout  civil  rights  litigation,  the  ADA,  Section  504,  the  management  of class  action  litigation,  and \npractice  and  procedure  in  the  federal  courts. \n18\n115.  The  individual  members  of the  class  would  have  difficulty  pursuing  their  own  claims  or \nremedying  systematic  violations  on  their  own. \n116.  Defendants  have  administered  the  South  Carolina  mental  health  system  in  a way  that \ndiscriminates  against  persons  with  mental  disabilities  by  failing  to  provide  the  community-based \nservices  required  to  prevent  unnecessary  institutionalization,  including  needlessly  prolonged  or \nrepeated  institutionalization  of the  Plaintiffs.  Therefore,  the  Defendants  have  acted  or  refused  to \nact  on  grounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  making  injunctive  and/or  corresponding \ndeclaratory  relief appropriate  with  respect  to  the  class  as  a whole.  As a  result,  and  consistent \nwith  similar  civil  rights  actions,  the  Plaintiffs  seek  certification  pursuant to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23 \n(b)(2). \nFACTS \nBryan  Hospital  and  the  Hospital  Discharge  Process \n117.  South  Carolina has  a  long,  unfortunate  history  of confining  people  with  mental \ndisabilities  to  isolated  asylums  where  they  are  segregated  from  their  homes  and  communities. \n118.  The  former  South  Carolina  State  Hospital,  located  in  Columbia  on  the  Bull  Street \ncampus,  was  one  of the  first  public  mental  health  hospitals  established  in  the  United  States.  The \nState  Hospital  on  Bull  Street  has  closed;  South  Carolina’s  discriminatory  practices  continue. \n119.  Ten  miles  from  the  Bull  Street  campus,  Defendants  have  planned,  supported,  constructed, \nand  expanded  Bryan  Hospital.  Licensed  for  530  beds,  Bryan  serves  the  same  function  as  the \nState  Hospital. \n120.  A  new  32-bed  unit  was  included  in  the  Defendant’s  proposed  budget  for the  2017/2018 \nstate  fiscal  year. \n19\n121.  Just  as  they were  at  the  State  Hospital,  individuals  with  mental  disabilities  are \nwarehoused  at  Bryan,  isolated  from  their  families,  friends,  and  communities. \n122.  Bryan’s  licensed  beds  are  classified  as  “adult  services,”  including  both  long-term  units \nand  acute  units;  “forensics”;  and  “children’s  acute  care.”  Adults  who  are  not  involved  in  the \ncriminal justice  system  are  typically  assigned  to  “adult  services”  beds.  This  Complaint  focuses \non  the  individuals  assigned  to  adult  services,  non-forensics  beds. \n123.  Most  of the  approximately  152  residents  of the  adult  care  lodges  at  Bryan  Hospital  face \nneedless  delays  in  discharge.  Some  individuals  may  wait  years  to  be  discharged.  At  any  given \nmoment,  as  many  as  half of the  152  residents  of the  adult  care  portion  of Bryan  are  stable  and \ncould  be  discharged  to  a  less  restrictive  setting,  if adequate  supports  were  readily  available  in  the \ncommunity. \n124.  The  residents  of Bryan  get  stuck  at the  hospital  because  of the  Defendants’  policies, \npractices,  and  procedures—including  an  over-reliance  on  institutional  placements.  These \n“stuck”  individuals  are  being  warehoused  at  Bryan  because  of Defendants’  acts  and  omissions \nand  not  because  they  require  hospitalization. \n125.  Adults  confined  at  the  non-forensic  portion  of Bryan  Hospital  are  held  in  separate  units. \nThe  units  are  called  “lodges.”  There  are  five  lodges.  Each  lodge  is  further  divided  into  three \n“pods.”  Each  pod  contains  three  bedrooms  and  a  central  common  area.  Up  to  four  individuals \nsleep  in  a room. \n126.  All  non-forensic  adults  confined  at  Bryan  Hospital  remain  behind  the  locked  doors  of the \nlodges  for  the  majority  of the  day.  Individuals  who  have  violated  the  rules  of the  lodges  are  not \nallowed  to  leave  the  lodge  at  any time  of the  day—sometimes  referred  to  as  being  “on \nrestriction.”  Individuals  who  are  not  “on  restriction”  are  allowed  to  leave  the  lodges  only  in \n20\nsupervised  groups  to  go  to  the  cafeteria,  the  canteen,  any  activities,  and  the  facility’s  library. \nThese  trips  are  limited  based  upon  staff availability  and  the  weather. \n127.  Each  lodge  has  a  central  paved  atrium  with  no  roof.  The  atriums  contain  only  metal \nbenches.  Access  to  the  paved  atrium  is  limited  based  upon  weather  conditions. \n128.  Movement  is  even  limited  in  the  lodge.  During  the  day,  individuals  are  not  allowed  free \naccess  to  their  rooms  or the  common  area portion  of the  pods.  All  access  is  controlled  by  locked \ndoors. \n129.  Residents  of Bryan  Hospital  have  almost  no  interaction  with  members  of the  community \nor  choices  about their  day-to  day-activities.  While  confined  at  Bryan,  adults  with  mental  health \ndisabilities  are  cut  off from  the  people  they  care  about  and  the  people  who  care  about them.  They \nmay  only  visit with  friends  or  family  at  “visiting  hours”;  they  may  only  talk  on  the  phone  during \n“phone  hours”;  and  their  only  opportunity  to  work  is  to  perform janitorial  services  on  the  lodge \n(only  two  residents  are  allowed  to  be  so  employed).  The  primary  choice  that the  residents  are \nallowed  to  control  in  their  day-to  day-life  is  where  to  sit  in  the  day  area.  All  other  choices  are \nmade  for  them—what to  eat,  what  to  do,  where  to  sleep,  when  to  shower,  when  to  get  up,  and \nwhen  to  go  to  bed. \n130.  Most  of the  individuals  confined  at  Bryan  do  not  have  private  insurance,  but would  be \neligible  for  Medicaid  if they  lived  in  the  community.  However,  most  cannot  access  Medicaid  to \npay  for  care  at  Bryan,  as  Medicaid  is  only  available  to  fund  psychiatric  hospitalizations  for \neligible  Medicaid  participants  who  are  under  age  21  or  over  age  65. \n131.  In  contrast,  Medicaid  funds  many  community  mental  health  services,  regardless  of the \nage  of the  eligible  participant. \n21\n132.  Individuals  eligible  for  Medicare  fare  little  better.  Medicare  Part A  has  a  limited, \ninpatient  psychiatric  hospital  benefit  that  has  a  lifetime  cap  of  190  days,  a  deductible  of $1288 \nper  benefit  period,  and  an  increasing  coinsurance  cost to  the  patient  after  60  days.  Medicare  Part \nB  covers  some  outpatient  services,  including  individual  and  group  therapy,  psychiatrist  visits, \nand  medication  management. \n133.  Individuals  without  insurance  that  covers  psychiatric  hospitalization  are  billed  a \nminimum  of $503  dollars  for  each  day they  are  confined  at  Bryan.  Therefore,  residents  at  Bryan \nwho  are  eligible  for  public  assistance  programs  in  the  community,  like  Medicaid,  are  billed  $503 \ndollars  for  each  day they  are  in  the  hospital. \n134.  The  Defendants  also  bill  for  some  services  in  addition  to  the  daily  rate,  such  as  physician \nServices. \n135.  Individuals  who  remain  confined  due  to  a  lack  of community  support  programs  and \nservices  accrue  massive  bills.  The  cost  of one  year  at  Bryan  is  approximately  $183,595.  Being \ndischarged  in  a timely  manner,  as  well  as  avoiding  hospitalization,  is  critically  important  to  the \nPlaintiffs  for their  physical,  psychological,  and  financial  well-being. \n136.  A  decision  on  whether  a  resident  of Bryan  Hospital  is  ready  for  discharge  is  frequently \nbased  upon  what  is  available  (or  not)  in  the  community,  rather  than  whether  or  not the \nindividual’s  psychiatric  condition  has  stabilized  to  the  point they  can  be  safely  reintegrated  into \nthe  community. \n137.  Defendants  have  failed  to  adequately  assess  and  identify the  long  term  needs  of the \nPlaintiffs  to  determine  whether  those  needs  could  be  appropriately  met  in  integrated,  community- \nbased  settings.  Also,  Defendants  have  failed  to  ensure  that  someone  is  actively  looking  for \nplacement  for  all  those  who  need  placement. \n22\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG ___  Date  Filed  05/24/17  Entry  Number1  Page  23  of  53 \n138.  Information,  such  as  the  availability  of intensive  community  services  for  outpatient \ntreatment  at  a  CMHC,  is  not  provided  to  the  treating  professionals  because  Bryan  residents  are \nnot  assessed  for  the  level  of services  they  need  until  after  they  are  discharged  and  living  in  the \ncommunity. \n139.  Plaintiffs’  access  to  integrated  community  support  services  is  arbitrarily  limited  by  the \npolicies  of the  Defendants. \n140.  All  of the  individual  Plaintiffs  have  been  in  Bryan  Hospital  for  longer  than  90  days.  The \naverage  length  of stay  for  the  adult,  non-forensics  portion  of Bryan  in  2012  ranged  from  27  days \non  Lodge  D  to  over  800  days  on  Lodge  G. \n141.  The  2013  accountability  report  of the  Defendants  was  the  last  report  that tracked  the \npercentage  of inpatients  who  had  stays  longer  than  90  days.  That  report  noted  that  69%  of \nadmitted  patients  stay  longer  than  90  days  in  SCDMH  inpatient  placements. \n142.  On  information  and  belief,  the  percentage  has  increased  since  2013. \n143.  Defendants  place  the  responsibility  for  discharge  planning  of Bryan  residents  conjointly \non  the  Hospital  and  on  the  SCDMH  Division  of Outpatient  Treatment,  which  operates  the \nCMHCs.” \n144.  At  Bryan,  social  workers  are  responsible  for  coordination  of aftercare  referrals  and  other \naspects  of the  discharge  planning  process. \n145.  Hospital  social  workers  attend  the  Plaintiffs’  treatment team  meetings  on  a regular  basis \nand  have  a therapeutic  relationship  with  the  residents. \n  \n* After  receiving  demands  from  Plaintiffs,  Defendants  have  informed  Plaintiffs  that they  intend  to \nreview  their  discharge  policies,  known  as  “Continuity  of Care”  policies.  As  of this  filing,  no \nchanges  to  discharge  policies  have  been  publicized  by  the  Defendants. \n23\n146.  The  CMHC  is  responsible  for  screening  individuals  at  Bryan  to  see  if they  are  ready \nfor  discharge,  and  for  assisting  with  planning  for  their  discharge  and  setting  up  aftercare \nappointments  at  the  CMHC. \n147.  CMHC  clients  who  have  been  at  Bryan  for  more  than  90  days  have  their  cases  closed— \nsevering  the  relationships  between  that  CMHC  and  individuals  at  Bryan.  Those  relationships,  if \nmaintained,  could  benefit the  patient  and  streamline  the  discharge  process. \n148.  Because  most  residents  of Bryan  have  been  at the  hospital  for  over  90  days,  they  do  not \nhave  an  open  case  at  a  CMHC  and  do  not  have  a  CMHC  case  manager;  therefore,  discharge \nplanning  is  the  responsibility  of the  hospital  liaison. \n149.  Each  CMHC  has  a hospital  liaison.  The  hospital  liaisons  are  SCDMH  employees  who \nwork  at  a  CMHC  and  have  other  duties  at  the  CMHC. \n150.  While  the  Defendants’  discharge  policy  states  that  hospital  liaisons  should  attend \ntreatment team  meetings,  upon  information  and  belief,  none  of the  individual  Plaintiffs  have  had \na hospital  liaison  attend  any  of their treatment team  meetings.  Treatment team  meetings  for \nindividuals  at  Bryan  are  generally  held  every  28  days  for  individuals  who  have  been  at  Bryan  for \nat  least  several  months. \n151.  The  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  of the  Defendants  of closing  a resident’s  CMHC \ncase  after  90  days  of an  inpatient  stay,  and  placing  the  discharge  process  responsibility  on  the \nhospital  liaison,  who  may  not  have  ever  had  a  relationship  with  the  hospital  resident,  results  in \ninadequate  and  inappropriate  discharge  planning  and  unnecessary  delays  in  discharge. \n152.  Because  of poor  coordination  between  Bryan  and  CMHCs,  mostly  due  to  Defendants’ \npolicies  and  procedures  and  confusion  about the  policies  and  procedures,  the  discharge  planning \n24\nprocess  designed  by  the  Defendants  is  arbitrary,  inefficient,  and  convoluted.  It  impedes \ndischarge.  For  example: \na.  Much  of the  control  of discharge  is  in  the  hands  of the  CMHCs,  and  that  control  can \nresult  in  delays  in  discharge. \nb.  Patients  must  be  “screened”  by the  hospital  liaisons  for  readiness  for  discharge—a \ntime  consuming  step  when  the  actual  treating  professionals  are  most  qualified  to \nmake  the  determination. \nc.  Use  of “catchment”  areas  can  be  arbitrary  and  can  cause  delays  in  discharge, \nespecially  for  rural  areas  with  few  options  for  placements. \nd.  Failure  to  use  available  technology,  such  as  video  conferencing,  makes  the  process  of \ndischarge  inefficient  and  causes  needless  delays  in  discharge. \n153.  When a  Bryan  resident  does  not  have  an  established  residence,  usually  the  only \nplacement  option  considered  by  a resident’s  treating  professionals  and  the  hospital  liaison  is  a \nCRCEF,  also  known  as  an  Assisted  Living  Facility. \n154.  Defendants  have  a Memorandum  of Agreement  (“MOA”)  with  some  CRCFs.  The \nDefendants’  MOA  requires  the  CRCF  to  comply  with  criteria  set  by  SCDMH  in  exchange  for \nan  agreement to  provide  mental  health  services  for  the  residents  of the  CRCF. \n155.  Except  on  rare  occasions,  Bryan  Hospital  will  discharge  patients  only to  those  CRCFs \nwith  MOAs.  Ifthe  catchment  area  does  not  have  any  or  enough  CRCFs  with  MOAs,  or  if all \nCRCFs  in  the  area have  refused  to  accept  a hospital  resident,  the  liaison  will  report that there  is \nno  placement  available,  leaving  the  resident  to  languish  at  Bryan. \n156.  Two  CMHCs,  Aiken-Barnwell  MHC  and  Coastal  Empire  MHC,  have  no  CRCFs  with  a \nMOA  in  their  catchment  area.  In  many  catchment  areas,  the  discharge  planners  have  little  access \n25\nto  CRCF  placements  and  less  access  to  a  CRCF  with  a MOA.  Consequently,  a  resident  at  Bryan \nwho  is  from  one  of these  catchment  areas  may  be  stuck  at  Bryan  until  another  catchment  area \nagrees  to  accept the  resident  and  finds  a  CRCF  willing  to  take  the  resident. \n157.  Discharges  are  routinely  put  on  hold  during  the  pursuit  of a  CRCF  with  an  open  bed. \nThis  wait  often  takes  years.  Bryan  residents  may  become  frustrated,  upset,  depressed,  or  their \nmental  status  may  change  during  their  long  wait.  In  such  cases,  they will  be  determined  to  no \nlonger  be  ready  for  discharge,  in  which  case  they  will  go  back to  the  beginning  of the  process. \n158.  At  Bryan,  a hospital  resident  approved  for  discharge  is  treated  the  same  as  a patient who \nstill  requires  acute  care—the  same  rules  and  restrictions  apply.  The  resident  determined  ready \nfor  discharge  must  obey  the  same  visiting  hours  and  phone  limits,  must  adhere  to  the  same \nrestrictions  on  movement  at the  facility,  and  accrues  daily  bills  at  the  same  rate. \n159.  The  discharge  process  includes  presenting  a  discharge  plan  to  the  individual.  For \nexample,  the  treatment team  may  recommend  the  individual  be  discharged  to  a  CRCF.  If the \nindividual  prefers  an  option  other  than  a  CRCF,  the  process  of discharge  will  end  at that  impasse, \nwith  little  attempt  made  to  consider  other  options,  such  as  apartment  settings  with  intensive \nsupports. \n160.  Most  of the  individual  Plaintiffs  have  been  identified  as  needing  a  CRCF  or  higher  level \nof care.  Many  of the  individual  Plaintiffs  do  not wish  to  live  ina  CRCF,  but  desire  discharge \nfrom  Bryan. \n161.  However,  some  of the  Plaintiffs  are  afraid  to  disagree  with  any  discharge  plan.  They \nbelieve,  with  good  reason,  that  if they  disagree  with  the  discharge  plan  that  has  been  proposed \nthey  will  be  left  in  the  hospital  for  an  even  longer  period  of time. \n26\n162.  Alternatives  to  CRCFs  are  extremely  limited.  Some  of the  alternatives  include \nHomeshare  placements,  which  are  similar  to  adult  foster  homes.  However,  the  number  of these \nplacements  is  inadequate  to  meet the  demands  of those  who  would  benefit  from  this  type  of \nplacement. \n163.  The  Plaintiffs  have  been  negatively  impacted  by  the  convoluted  and  ineffective  discharge \nprocess  described  above. \n164.  The  Defendants  have  authorized  and  encouraged  this  discharge  process  through  their \npolicies,  practices,  and  funding. \n165.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  appropriate  discharge  planning  to  enable  class  members  to  live \nin  the  community. \n166.  Defendants  have  control  over  and  the  responsibility  for  the  policies,  practices,  and \nprocedures  for  discharge  of Bryan  residents. \n167.  Defendants  have  management  control  over  and  responsibility  for  the  staff who  implement \nthe  discharge  policies,  procedures,  and  practices. \n168.  The  current  discharge  procedures  do  not  provide  for  timely  discharge  from  Bryan \nHospital. \n169.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  Defendants  do  not  systematically  keep  lists  of who  is \nready  for  discharge,  they  do  not  have  specific  criteria  for  who  is  appropriate  for what  level  of \ncare  once  the  individual  leaves  Bryan,  and  they  do  not  have  systems  in  place  to  ensure  that \nplacements  are  managed  fairly. \n170.  The  policies  and  practices  regarding  discharge  from  Bryan  negatively  affect  every \nindividual  Plaintiff,  every  class  member,  and  the  constituents  of P&A. \n27\nCMHC  Initiation  of Services  After  Hospitalization--Aftercare \n171.  CMHC  assessment,  required  to  be  completed  for  an  individual  to  receive  services  from \nthe  CMHC,  is  not  performed  until  after  the  resident  is  discharged  from  Bryan. \n172.  Therefore,  the  treatment team  at  Bryan  must  send  the  resident  into  the  community \nwithout  knowledge  of the  level  of supports  and  services  the  individual  will  receive  once  he  or \nshe  is  discharged.  As  a result,  the  treatment team  may  be  more  cautious  and  conservative  than \nshould  be  necessary  prior  to  initiating  the  discharge  and  placement  process,  lengthening  the \nhospital  stay  needlessly. \n173.  SCDMH  requires  that the  initial  community  assessment  be  done  within  seven  days  of \ndischarge  from  Bryan.  However,  this  first  appointment  is  simply  an  assessment  for  what \nservices  will  be  arranged.  It  is  not  necessarily  a time  when  the  individual  will  begin  treatment. \n174.  CMHCs  may  not  have  access  to  information  from  Bryan,  and  the  hospital  may  not  have \naccess  to  information  from  the  community.  The  policy  and  practice  of Defendants,  which  fails \nto  assess  the  need  for  community  mental  health  services  prior  to  discharge,  places  all  Plaintiffs  at \nrisk  of increased  needless  days  in  the  segregated  and  isolated  setting  of Bryan  Hospital. \nCRCFs \n175.  Defendants  rely  heavily  upon  CRCFs  to  provide  placement to  clients  of SCDMH. \n176.  Many  CRCFs  are  large,  restrictive,  congregate  settings,  which  are  themselves  de  facto \ninstitutions. \n177.  Most  CRCFs  house  more  than  six,  unrelated  individuals.  Many  CRCFs  are  large \ninstitutions,  as  large  as  169  beds. \n178.  InaCRCF,  virtually  all  the  residents  are  people  with  disabilities.  Residents  have  highly \nregimented  schedules,  which  revolve  around  meals  and  administration  of medication. \n28\nRoommates  are  often  assigned,  not  chosen.  Residents  may  not  have  a key to  the  facility  or to \ntheir  room,  and  they  do  not  have  a  lease.  The  facilities  often  have  oppressive  rules  and \nrestrictions,  and  residents  often  have  little  or  no  opportunities  for  access  to  the  greater \ncommunity. \n179.  CRCFs  are  licensed  and  regulated  by  Department  of Health  and  Environmental  Control \nunder  S.C.  DHEC  Reg.  61-84. \n180.  Although  Defendants  rely  heavily  on  CRCFs  as  placements  for  individuals  being \ndischarged  from  Bryan,  the  Defendants  do  not  have  any  licensing  or  regulatory  authority  over \nCRCFs.  CRCFs  exist  to  provide  assistance  with  activities  of daily  living.  The  CRCFs  should \nnot  be  locked  facilities,  but  they  are  frequently  isolated  from  the  community.  Most  staff at  a \nCRCF  do  not  have  any training  in  caring  for  people  with  a mental  disability. \n181.  While  Defendants  operate  a handful  of CRCFs,  most  CRCFs  are  privately  owned  and \noperated.  Of those  CRCFs  which  are  privately  owned  and  operated,  about  half of the  CRCF \nbeds  in  South  Carolina take  public  funding  for  the  beds.  The  other  half of the  beds  are  privately \nfunded.  These  privately  funded  beds  offer  an  array  of services  and  amenities,  and  they  are  more \nlikely  to  be  referred  to  as  “assisted  living  facilities.” \n182.  The  vast  majority  of patients  of SCDMH  are  concentrated  in  the  publicly-funded  subset \nof CRCFs. \n183.  P&A,  which  has  an  inspection  program  of CRCFs,  estimates  that  nearly  40%  of the \nresidents  in  the  publicly-funded  CRCFs  are  SCDMH  clients.  Since  CRCFs  also  house  people \nwith  a  serious  mental  disability who  are  not  receiving  services  from  SCDMH,  the  percentage  of \npeople  in  CRCF  with  serious  mental  disability  is  actually  higher. \n29\n  \n184.  CMHC  services  are  very  limited  for  some  residents  of CRCFs.  They  may  receive \nmedication  management  only  from  the  CMHC,  or  they  may  have  a monthly  meeting  with  a  case \nworker  and  quarterly  medication  checks.  In  other  CMHCs,  caseworkers  may  check  on  the \nresidents  at the  facilities,  and  they  may  participate  in  the  development  of their  plan  of care.  The \ndifference  is  based  upon  location  and  policies  of the  CMHC  and  not  based  upon  the  needs  of the \nindividual. \n185.  Because  of the  Defendants’  over-reliance  and  inappropriate  reliance  on  CRCFs, \ndischarge  of residents  at  Bryan  is  further  delayed.  Simply  put,  there  is  far  more  “demand”  for \nCRCF  placements  than  supply. \n186.  The  high  demand  for  publicly-funded  CRCF  beds  is  driven  by  the  Defendants’  excessive \nand  unnecessary  reliance  upon  these  segregated  placements  and  the  Defendants’  failure  to \nexpand  mental  health  services  that  are  an  alternative  to  CRCF  placements,  such  as  supported \nhousing,  supportive  employment,  and  assertive  community treatment  (ACT)  services. \n187.  The  overreliance  on  CRCFs  and  the  lack  of adequate  or  intense  community  mental  health \nservices  places  former  residents  of Bryan  at  risk  of having  to  return  to  the  hospital. \n188.  When  residents  are  discharged  from  Bryan  to  a  CRCF,  little  in  their  life  changes,  as  many \nof the  institutional  qualities  of Bryan  also  exist  in  the  CRCFs  where  Bryan  places  them. \n189.  Rarely  are  CRCF  residents  who  are  clients  of the  CMHC  considered  for  services  which \nreduce  hospitalization  risk,  such  as  psycho-social  rehabilitation,  supported  employment  services, \nsupported  housing  services,  or ACT  services.  Because  the  clients  are  in  a  facility,  the  CMHC \nassumes  that the  clients’  needs  are  being  met.  The  Defendants  violate  the  ADA  and  Section  504 \nby  causing  further  isolation  and  segregation  of residents  of Bryan  by  overly  relying  upon  CRCFs \nfor  discharge  and  by  not  making  integrated  services  available  to  the  Plaintiffs. \n30\nDefendants  Forgo  Community  Services  to \nCreate  and  Maintain  Institutional  Placements \n190.  Contrary  to  the  requirements  under  the  ADA  or  Section  504,  Defendants  have  failed  to \nprovide  services  in  the  most  integrated  settings  appropriate  to  the  needs  of SCDMH’s  clients. \n191.  Between  2008  and  2012,  state  appropriations  for  SCDMH  were  reduced  by  over  $86 \nmillion,  a  decrease  of 39%  and  the  largest  reduction  of public  mental  health  services  in  the \ncountry.  These  cuts  fell  disproportionately  on  already  underfunded  community  services,  rather \nthan  the  institutions  operated  by  the  Defendants. \n192.  SCDMH  has  received  more  money  over  the  last three  of the  state’s  fiscal  years,  but \nfunding  for  community  mental  health  services  has  still  not  returned  to  the  2008  level  for \ncommunity  services,  which  means  that the  increases  have  gone  to  fund  the  institutions  operated \nby  the  Defendants. \n193.  Defendants  have  used  the  increase  in  funding  to  increase,  maintain,  and  expand \ninstitutional  placements,  rather  than  for  restoring  and  expanding  much-needed  community \nServices. \n194.  SCDMH  must  produce  an  annual  accountability  report,  to  be  submitted  to  the  governor \nand  made  available  to  the  public.  In  the  state  fiscal  year  2013/2014  accountability  report, \nDefendants  report that  SCDMH’s  hospital  admissions jumped  significantly  from  776  at the \nbeginning  of the  fiscal  year to  1025  at  the  end  of the  fiscal  year. \n195.  Bryan  Hospital  increased  in  size  and  capacity  by  40  beds  in  2015. \n196.  Funding  for  additional  bed  days  was  requested  by  Defendants  and  approved  by  the \nlegislature  and  governor  for  the  2016/2017  state  fiscal  year.  The  increase  for the  adult  care \nportion  of Bryan  Hospital  was  a request  for  an  additional  7,300  bed  days  per  year  which  equates \nto  20  new  beds. \n31\n197.  Bryan  Hospital  as  a whole  has  added  three  new  units  and  now  houses  patients  in  long- \nterm  care  units,  acute  units,  forensics  units,  children’s  acute  care,  adolescent  acute  care,  and  an \nadolescent  recovery  program. \n198.  Defendants  completed  the  construction  of two  large  administrative  buildings  in  2015  at \nthe  Bryan  Hospital  campus.  These  new  buildings  house  the  director  of the  division  of inpatient \nservices  at  SCDMH  and  other  administrators  who  support  inpatient  services. \n199.  The  average  length  of stay  for  a resident  at  Bryan  is  on  the  increase.  According  to  the \nminutes  of the  April  2013  meeting  of the  Mental  Health  Commission,  the  average  length  of stay \nincreased  at  Bryan  by  40  days  that  year.  In  2012,  the  average  length  of stay  was  over  400  days. \n200.  Even  in  2016,  the  Defendants’  request  for  funding  on  community  mental  health  is  less \nthan  that  requested  in  2008. \n201.  Defendants  have  failed  to  adequately  fund  community  mental  health  services,  and  have \nfailed  to  control  the  services  being  provided  by  CMHCs  to  ensure  that  funding  is  used  in \ncompliance  with  the  ADA  and  Section  504.  Instead,  Defendants  have  developed  and  continually \nexpanded  Bryan,  the  large  central  state  hospital,  which  houses  individuals  who  could  be  served \nin  the  community. \n32\nFor  Decades,  State-wide  Reports  have  Identified \nthat  Defendants  Need  to  Improve  the  Discharge  Process \nand  Increase  Availability  of  Community  Services. \n202.  Defendants  have  known  since  1983  that  they  need  to  improve  access  to  community \nServices. \n203.  In  1983,  long  before  the  ADA,  the  South  Carolina  General  Assembly’s  Legislative  Audit \nCouncil  issued  a report  on  SCDMH. \n204.  The  report,  which  included  a review  of admissions  to  Bryan,  noted  that  individuals  were \nbeing  inappropriately  admitted  to  the  hospitals;  that  SCDMH  is  “not  adequately  planning  for \ninstitutionalized  patients’  return  to  the  community”;  and  that  “the  Department  has  not taken  the \ninitiative  to  redirect  funding  to  the  community  in  order  to  follow-up  on  patients  released  from \npsychiatric  hospitals.” \n205.  The  problems  identified  in  the  1983  report  continue  today,  including  policies  and \npractices  which  fail  to  adequately  plan  for  a patient’s  return  to  the  community;  fail  to  equitably \ndistribute  resources  that  support  discharge  and  community  integration;  and  fail  to  adequately \nfund  community  services. \n206.  Eighteen  years  later,  in  2001,  a report  by  a  state  working  group,  including  representatives \nof the  Defendants,  identified  that  Defendants  were  still  failing  to  adequately  plan  for  discharge \nand  failing  to  adequately  provide  services  in  the  community. \n207.  The  2001  report  made  recommendations  relating  to  the  need  for  community  integration \nincluding: \na.  Individuals  in  institutions  who  have  indicated  their  desire  to  move  to  a  community \nsetting  should  be  discharged  within  one  year. \n33\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG __  Date  Filed  05/24/17  Entry  Number1  Page  34  of  53 \nb.  Identify those  in  the  hospital  who  meet  criteria  for  Toward  Local  Care  (TLC)  and \nensure  they  have  funding  to  get  them  out  of the  hospital  and  into  the  program. \nc.  Transition  consumers  to  the  community  through  the  TLC  process  by  20%  annually. \nd.  For  clients  deemed  to  be  at  risk  of unnecessary  institutionalization,  develop  a \ncommunity-based,  pre-crisis  plan. \ne.  Identify which  patients  are  waiting  for  placement,  TLC  services,  Homeshare,  and \nother  services  and  monitor this  list. \nf.  Develop  and  promote  a variety  of housing  and  residential  options. \ng.  Increase  access  to  supported  employment. \nh.  Buy waiver  slots  from  the  Department  of Disabilities  and  Special  Needs  (DDSN). \ni.  Ensure  the  commission  is  fully  informed  regarding  the  state’s  obligations  under  the \nADA  community  integration  requirement. \n208.  Fifteen  years  after  the  2001  report,  the  South  Carolina  Institute  of Medicine  and  Public \nHealth  (IMPH)  “convened  a taskforce  comprised  of behavioral  and  mental  health  professionals \nand  stakeholders  from  across  South  Carolina to  address a  set  of priority  areas  related  to \nimproving  care  and  outcomes  to  better  serve  our  residents  with  behavioral  health  illness”’--the \nBehavioral  Health  Task  Force. \n209.  In  May  of 2015,  the  Behavioral  Health  Task  Force  issued  a report,  again  with  the  same \nmessage  as  the  previous  state-wide  reports—the  mental  health  system  must  focus  on  providing \nadequate  community  services. \n210.  The  Behavioral  Health  Task  Force  Report  identified  services  which  are  effective  at \npreventing  unnecessary  hospitalization,  including: \n  \n*  South  Carolina  Institute  of Medicine  and  Public  Health,  Behavioral  Health  Task  Force, \navailable  at  http://imph.org/taskforces/behavioral-health-taskforce/  . \n34\nfone wet  wt \na.  Expanding  hours  at  outpatient  behavioral  health  service  sites  around  the  state. \nb.  Developing  a network  of Mobile  Crisis  Units  for  the  entire  state. \nc.  Creating  small,  highly  supervised  settings  around  the  state—a more  integrated  setting \nfor  individuals  who  need  intensive  supports. \nd.  Providing  permanent  supportive  housing  units. \ne.  Funding  rental  assistance  programs  and  associated  supportive  services. \nf.  Offering  Assertive  Community  Treatment  (ACT). \nDefendants  have  failed  to  plan  for  and  act  upon  most  of the  recommendation  of these  reports. \nDefendants’  Actions  and  Omissions  Discriminate  Against \nPlaintiffs  by  Causing  Unnecessary  Isolation  and  Segregation \n211.  The  problems  identified  in  the  three  reports,  issued  over  four  decades,  continue  now, \nresulting  in  discrimination  against the  Plaintiffs. \n212.  Defendants  provide  more  than  half a million  bed  days  in  institutional  placements  each \nyear. \n213.  Some  of the  Plaintiffs  have  remained  in  the  hospital,  ready  for  and  waiting  on  outside \nplacement,  for  years. \n214.  While  the  goal  set  in  2001  was  to  reduce  the  number  of institutionalized  patients  by  20% \nper  year,  in  2014  SCDMH  increased  its  inpatient  bed  capacity—moving  toward  an  increase  in \nreliance  on  institutionalization,  not  a  decrease. \n215.  Defendants  requested  additional  appropriations  for  2016/2017  to  increase  the  census  in \nthe  adult  portion  of Bryan.  The  additional  funds  were  approved,  and  the  census  at  Bryan  has \nrisen  from  139  in  late  2015  to  152  in  May  2017. \n216.  The  budget  proposed  by  the  Defendants  for  2017/2018  included  another  32-bed  unit  to  be \npart  of Bryan  Hospital. \n35\n217.  Even  though  Defendants  overly  rely  upon  institutional  beds  and  placements,  SCDMH \ndoes  not  identify  in  their  federal  mental  health  block  grant  application  that there  is  a need  to \nreduce  reliance  upon  institutional  placement  and  to  work toward  providing  services  in  integrated \nsettings. \n218.  Based  upon  the  number  of licensed  beds,  530,  Bryan  Hospital  is  licensed  for  more  beds \nthan  any  other  psychiatric  hospital  in  Georgia,  North  Carolina,  or  South  Carolina. \n219.  Bryan  Hospital  is  the  fourth  largest  hospital  in  the  state,  including  all  the  general \nhospitals  in  the  major  metropolitan  areas. \n220.  There  is  a  consensus  of professional judgment that  mobile  crisis  intervention  services  are \nan  essential  part  of a  community  mental  health  system  and  essential  to  reduce  the  need  for \nhospitalization.  Only  one  out  of seventeen  mental  health  centers  has  a mobile  crisis  unit. \n221.  The  failure  of the  Defendants  to  provide  an  integrated  crisis  system,  including  a mobile \ncrisis  network,  harms  the  Plaintiffs.  The  Plaintiffs  need  access  to  integrated  services  when  they \nare  on  pass  and  upon  discharge,  to  assist them  in  the  transition. \n222.  South  Carolina has  a total  of  1812  psychiatric  hospital  beds.  In  contrast,  North  Carolina \nhas  only  1643  psychiatric  hospital  beds  licensed  in  the  state,  even  though North  Carolina’s \npopulation  is  estimated  to  be  more  than  double  that  of South  Carolina. \n223.  The  high  number  of psychiatric  hospital  beds  in  South  Carolina  is  due  in  large  part  to  the \nfailure  of the  Defendants  to  provide  adequate  and  appropriate  community  mental  health  services, \nincluding  mobile  crisis  services.  In  addition,  Defendants  fund  stays  at  private  hospitals  rather \nthan  ensuring  adequate  funding  is  allocated  to  other,  more  integrated  forms  of crisis  services. \n224.  Between  2000  and  2004,  expenditures  on  inpatient  services  decreased  while  spending  on \ncommunity  services  increased.  In  2005,  spending  on  inpatient  services  increased  slightly,  but \n36\nyee \nspending  on  community  services  significantly  outpaced  the  spending  increases  on  inpatient \nServices. \n225.  Unfortunately,  the  trend  of increasing  investment  in  community  services  and  decreasing \ninvestment  in  inpatient  services  ended  after  2005,  and  actually  reversed.  Beginning  in  2008, \nspending  on  both  inpatient  and  outpatient  services  was  cut,  but  community  services  sustained \nmuch  more  significant  cuts  than  inpatient  services. \n226.  Since  2007,  using  projected  2015  spending  data,  spending  on  inpatient  services  has \nincreased  by  over  $17  million;  spending  on  community  services  is  down  by  over  $7  million. \nPlaintiffs  do  not  have  Access  to  the \nServices  They  Need  in  the  Community \n227.  Defendants  are  capable  of providing  the  services  which  are  critical  to  prevent \nunnecessary  institutionalization,  but  access  to  these  services  is  very  limited  for the  Plaintiffs. \n228.  Providing  the  relief requested  is  a reasonable  modification  to  Defendants’  policies, \npractices,  and  procedures  to  prevent  unjustified  isolation.  Community  placement  would  be \navailable,  as  required  by  Title  II  of the  ADA,  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130  (b)  (7),  with  only  reasonable \nmodification  in  how  this  state  provides  services. \n229.  Defendants  already  have  programs  designed  to  assist  individuals  to  be  integrated  into  the \ncommunity.  However,  these  programs  are  either  not  available  to  the  Plaintiffs,  or the  programs \nare  available  in  insufficient  quantity  and  quality to  prevent  unnecessary  isolation  and  segregation \nof the  Plaintiffs.  The  Plaintiffs  need  a  combination  of multiple  services  and  programs  identified \nbelow,  which  are  not  adequately  available. \nACT \n230.  Inthe  past,  Defendants  have  successfully  used  Assertive  Community  Treatment  (“ACT”) \nto  assist  in  deinstitutionalization. \n37\n  \n231.  ACT  is  an  evidence-based  practice  characterized  by  a team  approach,  small  caseloads, \nand  time-unlimited  services.  ACT  treatment  is  provided  in  the  community;  staff goes  to  the \nclient  as  needed.  Crisis  management  is  an  important  piece  to  the  practice,  available  twenty-four \nhours  a  day. \n232.  Currently,  SCDMH  uses  ACT  on a  limited  basis.  Few  of the  programs  offered  are \nprograms  faithful  to  the  evidence-based  ACT  model,  or ACT  “fidelity”  programs.  Instead,  they \nare  “ACT-like”  programs. \n233.  Only  nine  out  of seventeen  CMHCs  have  ACT-like  services. \n234.  Only  one  of the  nine  CMHCs  with  ACT-like  services  has  plans  to  create  a true  ACT \nprogram  with  fidelity  to  the  evidence-based  ACT  model. \nMobile  Crisis \n235.  Defendants  operate  one  mobile  crisis  unit.  This  one  unit  operates  out  of the \nCharleston/Dorchester  Mental  Health  Center.  The  unit’s  team  comprises  7.5  master  level \nclinicians,  operates  24  hours  a  day  every  day,  will  go  anywhere  in  the  mental  health  center’s \ncatchment  area,  and  will  provide  services  to  anyone  in  distress. \n236.  The  mobile  crisis  team  is  estimated  to  divert  2080  visits  to  local  emergency  rooms  each \nyear,  avoiding  a  cost  of $1,500  or  higher  per visit. \n237.  Even  though  this  program  is  an  apparent  success,  saves  money,  and  reduces  the  need  for \nhospitalization,  there  is  still  only  one  mobile  crisis  team  operating  in  South  Carolina. \n238.  Very  few  community  mental  health  clinics  in  South  Carolina provide  any  mental  health \nservices  after  5:00  p.m.  or  on  weekends,  much  less  care  that travels  to  a  client  in  distress  as \nopposed  to  requiring  the  client to  travel  to  a  center.  Access  to  transportation  during  a  crisis  is  a \nbarrier to  treatment  for  the  clients  of SCDMH. \n38\n239.  Most  South  Carolinians  with  mental  disabilities  must  go  to  a hospital  emergency  room  if \nthey  have  a  crisis  after  hours.  Mental  health  crisis  services  need  to  be  available  around  the  clock. \nSouth  Carolinians  with  mental  disabilities  should  not  have  to  go  to  an  ER  for  every  crisis  event \nthey  have  that  does  not  occur  between  the  hours  of 8:30  a.m.  to  5:00  p.m.,  Monday  through \nFriday. \nCTH Homes \n240.  For  individuals  with  high  needs  and  a  low  level  of intellectual  functioning,  Defendants \nhave  contracted  with  the  Department  of Disabilities  and  Special  Needs  (DDSN)  to  provide \nplacements  in  Community  Training  Homes  (“CTHs”),  where  these  individuals  have  access  to \nbehavior  support  services  and  habilitation,  as  well  as  mental  health  services.  CTHs  are  licensed \nby  DDSN  and  usually  have  four  residents,  each  with  their  own  bedroom.  Staff is  on  the \npremises  24  hours  a  day. \n241.  CTH  placements  are  available  only  to  individuals  who  have  been  determined  to  be \neligible  for  DDSN  services,  even  though  SCDMH  partially  funds  the  placement. \n242.  CTH  placements  are  not  available  to  the  Plaintiffs.  Access  to  such  placements  would \nprovide  intensive  support  in  a  safe  environment  in  the  community,  even  for  SCDMH  clients  who \nare  in  frequent  crisis  or  have  trouble  controlling  their  behavior,  as  these  placements  do  for  clients \nof DDSN. \n243.  Defendants  have  plans  to  develop  four  homes  that  will  provide  intensive  services,  but \nonly  patients  from  the  forensic  units  at  Bryan  will  be  allowed  to  be  discharged  to  these  homes. \nAlso,  without  an  Olmstead plan  that would  serve  to  guide  the  Defendants,  the  plan  for  these \nhomes  may  not  comply  with  the  ADA’s  integration  mandate  and  be  yet  another  investment  in  an \n39\nisolated  and  segregated  setting  that  offers  little  or  no  opportunities  for the  residents  to  interact \nwith  anyone  but  staff and  other  residents. \nSupported Employment \n244.  Defendants  currently  provide  supported  employment  for  some  clients  of the  CMHCs, \ncalled  Individual  Placement  and  Support  (“IPS”). \n245.  The  IPS  program  has  demonstrated  success,  achieving  a  51.2%  average  competitive \nemployment  rate  for  people  with  severe  mental  illness. \n246.  Even  though  this  program  has  demonstrated  success  and  Defendants  have  identified  that \nsupported  employment  is  an  evidence  based  program  which  aids  individuals  with  mental \ndisabilities  in  their  recovery,  it  is  being  offered  in  only  nine  out  of seventeen  mental  health \ncenters,  and  only to  approximately  500  people  annually. \n247.  The  IPS  program  is  available  to  the  Plaintiffs  on  only  a very  limited  basis. \nTLC \n248.  The  Toward  Local  Care  (“TLC”)  Program  is  designed  to  assist  clients  in  transitioning \nfrom  inpatient  institutions  into  the  community  and  to  help  avoid  re-hospitalization. \n249.  Based  upon  an  arbitrary  policy,  the  program  is  available  only  to  individuals  who  do  not \nmeet  nursing  home  level  of care  requirements. \n250.  In  order  to  qualify  for the  TLC  program,  an  individual  must  either  be  hospitalized  for  90 \ndays  or  have  had  three  hospitalizations  in  less  than  a year. \n251.  In  2008,  the  capacity  of the  TLC  program  was  967.  Even  though  many  individuals  need \nthese  services,  the  capacity  was  only  1093  in  2014. \n252.  Some  of the  TLC  slots  are  provided  in  integrated  settings,  but  many  of them  are  not. \n40\n253.  TLC  slots  include  providing  services  in  congregate  settings  of sixteen  bed  CRCFs,  which \nare  typically  in  very  rural  and  remote  locations  and  offer  few  opportunities  for  community \nintegration.  Additional  TLC  slots  are  in  CRCFs  of other  sizes. \n254.  All  of the  individual  Plaintiffs  should  qualify  for  the  TLC  program,  as  they  have  been \nhospitalized  for  longer than  90  days.  Only  two  of the  individual  Plaintiffs  are  currently  being \nconsidered  or  referred  to  the  program.  Because  of the  limited  number  of slots,  the  Plaintiffs  have \nvery  limited  access  to  these  intensive  services  combined  with  a residential  component.  In  order \nto  enter  the  program,  the  Plaintiffs  must  agree  to  the  rules  of the  program  and  may  have  to  agree \nto  live  in  a  segregated  facility  with  little  access  to  community  integration  or  self-determination. \nOther Supports \n255.  Defendants  offer  other  services  that the  Plaintiffs  would  greatly  benefit  from  but to  which \nthey  have  limited  access.  These  services  include: \na.  Peer  support \nb.  Supported  Housing \n256.  Defendants  have  identified  that  peer  support  and  supportive  housing  are  evidence  based \nprograms  which  aid  individuals  with  mental  disabilities  in  their  recovery. \n257.  However,  these  programs  remain  limited  because  Defendants  are  focused  on  providing \nservices  in  inpatient  settings  in  violation  of their  obligation  to  provide  services  in  integrated \nsettings. \nThe  Effect  of the  Failure  to  Develop \nand  Implement  an  Olmstead  Plan \n258.  Defendants  emphasize  segregated  placements  and  fail  to  develop  the  community  supports \nnecessary to  allow  the  Plaintiffs  to  live  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  their  needs. \n4]\n259.  One  method  to  prevent  discrimination  by  public  entities  in  their  programs  is  by  creating \nan  Olmstead Plan. \n260.  An  Olmstead Plan  is  a  guiding  document to  ensure  compliance  with  the  ADA.  See \nOlmstead v.  L.C.,  527  U.S.  581,  587  (1999). \n261.  Defendants  have  not  developed  a working  plan  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  Olmstead \ndecision. \n262.  Without  an  over-arching,  guiding  document  developed  by  professionals  in  the  state  to \nmeet the  needs  of the  South  Carolina residents  with  mental  disabilities,  decisions  will  be \nreactionary  and  not  in  compliance  with  the  ADA. \nANTI-DISCRIMINATION  LAWS \nTitle  II  of the  ADA \n263.  General  Prohibition  against Discrimination:  Title  II  of the  ADA  provides  that  “no \nqualified  individual  with  a  disability  shall,  by  reason  of such  disability,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation  in  or  be  denied  the  benefits  of the  services,  programs,  or  activities  of a public  entity, \nor  be  subjected  to  discrimination  by  any  such  entity.”  42  U.S.C.  §  12132.  A  “public  entity”  is \ndefined  as  any  state  or  local  government  or  “any  department,  agency,  ..  .  or  other  instrumentality \nofa  State  or  States  or  local  government...  .”  42  U.S.C.  §  12131(1)  (A)  &  (B). \n264.  Specific  Integration  Mandate:  The  United  States  Department  of Justice  (DOJ)  has \npromulgated  regulations  providing  that  a  “public  entity  shall  administer  services,  programs,  and \nactivities  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities.”  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130  (d).  The  “most  integrated  setting”  is  defined  as  “a  setting  that \nenables  individuals  with  disabilities  to  interact with  nondisabled  persons  to  the  fullest  extent \npossible  ....”  28  C.F.R.  Pt.  35  App.  B  (Guidance  on  ADA  Regulation  on Nondiscrimination  on \n42\n  \nthe  Basis  of Disability  in  State  and  Local  Government  Services  Originally  Published  July  26, \n1991).  This  provision  is  generally  referred  to  as  “the  integration  mandate.” \n265.  Specific  Prohibition  against Methods  of Administration  that Discriminate.  The  ADA \nregulations  state  that  “[a]  public  entity  may  not,  directly  or  through  contractual  or  other \narrangements,  utilize  criteria  or  methods  of administration:  (1)  That  have  the  effect  of subjecting \nqualified  individuals  with  disabilities  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability;  (11)  That  have \nthe  purpose  or  effect  of defeating  or  substantially  impairing  accomplishment  of the  objectives  of \nthe  public  entity’s  program  with  respect  to  individuals  with  disabilities;  or  (111)  That  perpetuate \nthe  discrimination  of another  public  entity  if both  public  entities  are  subject  to  common \nadministrative  control  or  are  agencies  of the  same  State.”  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130  (b)  (3). \n266.  Specific  Requirement  that Reasonable  Modifications  be  Made  to  Policies:  The  ADA \nregulations  state:  “A  public  entity  shall  make  reasonable  modifications  in  policies,  practices,  or \nprocedures  when  modifications  are  necessary  to  avoid  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability  .  . \n..”  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130  (b)  (7). \n267.  In  1999  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  unnecessary  institutionalization  of \nindividuals  with  disabilities  is  a  form  of discrimination  under  Title  II  of the  ADA  and  Section \n504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act.  Olmstead v.  L.C.,  527  U.S.  581,  587  (1999).  In  doing  so,  the \nCourt  interpreted  the  ADA’s  integration  mandate  as  requiring  States  to  provide  persons  with \ndisabilities  treatment  in  community  based  settings,  rather than  institutional  settings  when:  (1) \ncommunity-based  treatment  is  appropriate;  (2)  the  individual  does  not  oppose  community \nplacement;  and,  (3)  community  placement  can  be  reasonably  accommodated.  Jd. \nSection  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act \n268.  General  Prohibition  against Discrimination:  Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act \n43\nprovides  that  “[n]o  otherwise  qualified  individual  with  a  disability  in  the  United  States  ..  .  shall, \nsolely  by  reason  of his  or  her  disability,  be  excluded  from  the  participation  in,  be  denied  the \nbenefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal \nfinancial  assistance...  .”  29  U.S.C.  §  794  (a);  see  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51.  A  program  or  activity  is \ndefined  as  a  “department,  agency,  .  .  .  or  other  instrumentality  of a  State  or  of a  local \ngovernment.”  29  U.S.C.  §  794  (b)  (1)  (A). \n269.  Specific  Integration  Mandate:  The  United  States  Department  of Justice  (DOJ)  has \npromulgated  regulations  providing  that  “[r]ecipients  [of Federal  financial  assistance]  shall \nadminister  programs  and  activities  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of \nqualified  handicapped  persons.”  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51  (d). \n270.  Specific  Prohibition Against Methods  of Administration  that Discriminate:  Section  504 \nregulations  state  that  “[a]  recipient  [of Federal  financial  assistance]  may  not,  directly  or through \ncontractual  or  other  arrangements,  utilize  criteria  or  methods  of administration:  (1)  That  have  the \neffect  of subjecting  qualified  handicapped  persons  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of handicap;  (11) \nThat  have  the  purpose  or  effect  of defeating  or  substantially  impairing  accomplishment  of the \nobjectives  of the  recipient’s  program  with  respect  to  handicapped  persons,  or;  (111)  That \nperpetuate  the  discrimination  of another  recipient  if both  recipients  are  subject  to  common \nadministrative  control  or  are  agencies  of the  same  state.”  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51  (b)  (3). \nFIRST  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF: \nVIOLATION  OF  TITLE  II  OF  THE  ADA \n(AGAINST  ALL  DEFENDANTS) \n271.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  reallege  the  above  paragraphs. \n272.  This  claim  for  relief is  brought  against  each  and  every  named  Defendant. \n44\n  \n273.  Plaintiffs  are  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability  in  that  they  (1)  have  physical  or \nmental  impairments  that  substantially  limit  one  or  more  major  life  activities;  and  (2)  meet  the \nessential  eligibility  requirements  for  services  from  SCDMH. \n274.  Plaintiffs  are  qualified  to  participate  in  the  treatment  and  programs  offered  by \nDefendants. \n275.  P&A  is  authorized  to  advocate  and  litigate  on  behalf of individuals  with  disabilities, \nincluding  advocating  for  them  to  live  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  their  needs. \n276.  Plaintiffs  desire  to  leave  the  hospital.  The  hospital  is  not the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate  to  the  Plaintiffs’  needs. \n277.  Defendant  Magill  and  the  Commission  are  responsible  for  the  operation  of SCDMH,  a \npublic  entity,  covered  by  Title  II  of the  ADA.  42  U.S.C.  §  12131  (1)  (A)  &  (B). \n278.  Defendants’  operation  of the  mental  health  system  where  Plaintiffs  must  receive  services \nin  a restrictive  setting  rather  than  in  a  community  setting  at  a  lower  cost  constitutes  unlawful \ndiscrimination  in  violation  of ADA’s  integration  mandate.  Defendants  have  caused  the  Plaintiffs \nto  be  marooned  in  extremely  restrictive,  inappropriate,  and  unnecessary  hospital  settings.  By \ncreating  barriers  to  discharge,  failing  to  provide  adequate  community  mental  health  services,  not \ncreating  and  implementing  a working  Olmstead plan,  overly  relying  upon  CRCFs,  and \ngenerating  charges  of $503  per  day  to  the  Plaintiffs,  Defendants  have  caused  unjustified \ninstitutionalization  in  violation  of the  ADA’s  integration  mandate. \n279.  Title  II  of the  ADA  prohibits  Defendants  from  discriminating  against  individuals  with \ndisabilities  in  programs  and  activities.  42  U.S.C.  §§  12131,  12132. \n45\n280.  Defendants  are  obligated  under the  ADA  to  administer  South  Carolina programs, \nincluding  both  inpatient  and  outpatient  programs,  in  a manner that  supports  the  availability  of \nservices  and  programs  in  the  most  integrated  setting  for  individuals  with  disabilities. \n281.  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  adequate  services  and  programs  in  the  most  integrated \nsetting.  Without the  relief provided  by  injunction,  Defendants  will  fail  to  provide  necessary  care \nin  the  most  integrated  setting  for  Plaintiffs  in  violation  of Title  II  of the  ADA. \n282.  Defendants  have  utilized  criteria  and  methods  of administration  that  subject  Plaintiffs  to \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of their  disability,  including  unnecessary  institutionalization  by:  (1) \nfailing  to  properly  assess  the  services  and  supports  that would  enable  Plaintiffs  to  remain  in  the \ncommunity;  (2)  failing  to  ensure  that  Plaintiff will  have  access  to  services  that will  meet their \nneeds  in  the  community;  (3)  failing  to  make  reasonable  modifications  to  policies,  procedures, \npractices,  and  programs  to  avoid  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability;  (4)  allocating \nresources  for  institutional  versus  community  long-term  care  contrary  to  the  desires  and  needs  of \npeople  with  disabilities  and  contrary  to  the  ADA  and  the  integration  mandate;  (5)  overly  and \ninappropriately  relying  upon  segregated  facilities  for  discharge;  and  (6)  charging  Plaintiffs  $503 \nper  day  for  unnecessary  and  unjustified  hospitalization. \n283.  Defendants  have  failed  to  make  reasonable  modifications  to  their  programs  to  allow \nPlaintiffs  to  receive  services  in  the  community  rather than  in  an  institution.  The  cost  of \nPlaintiffs’  services  at  Bryan  is  over  $503  dollars  per  day.  In  the  community,  many  of the \nservices  the  Plaintiffs  need  are  covered  by  Medicaid,  providing  a payment  source  and  lessening \nthe  cost when  compared  to  remaining  in  the  institution. \n284.  A  permanent  injunction  is  appropriate  because: \n46\nfone wet  wt \na.  Plaintiffs  do  not  have  access  to  an  adequate  remedy  at  law  as  they  need  community- \nbased  mental  health  treatment. \nb.  Plaintiffs  will  suffer  irreparable  injury  if they  continue  to  be  isolated  and  segregated \nin  institutions  away  from  the  community. \nc.  The  benefits  to  the  Plaintiffs  of an  injunction  outweigh  the  burdens  an  injunction \nwould  place  on  the  Defendants. \nd.  The  right  to  the  relief sought  is  clear. \n285.  Defendants  are  using  methods  of administration  that  subject  individuals  with  disabilities \nto  discrimination,  inhibiting  the  ability  of individuals  to  live  in  the  community. \n286.  Defendants’  actions,  omissions,  policies,  and  practices  are  in  violation  of Title  II  of the \nADA. \nSECOND  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF: \nSECTION  504  OF  THE  REHABILITATION  ACT \n(AGAINST  ALL  DEFENDANTS) \n287.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  reallege  the  above  paragraphs. \n288.  This  claim  for  relief is  brought  against  each  and  every  named  Defendant. \n289.  Plaintiffs  are  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  within  the  meaning  of Section  504, \nbecause  they  (1)  have  physical  or  mental  impairments  that  substantially  limit  one  or  more  major \nlife  activities;  and  (2)  meet  the  essential  eligibility  requirements  for  services  from  SCDMH. \n290.  Plaintiffs  are  qualified  to  participate  in  the  treatment  and  programs  offered  by \nDefendants. \n291.  P&A  is  authorized  to  advocate  and  litigate  on  behalf of individuals  with  disabilities, \nincluding  advocating  for  them  to  live  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  their  needs. \n47\n  \n292.  Plaintiffs  desire  to  leave  the  hospital.  The  hospital  is  not the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate  to  the  Plaintiffs’  needs. \n293.  Defendants  are  recipients  of Federal  financial  assistance  from  CMS  from  the  block  grant \nprogram,  the  disproportionate  share  program,  and  the  Medicaid  and  Medicare  programs.  These \nfunds  are  used  to  operate  Defendants’  hospitals  and  community  programs. \n294.  Defendants’  operation  of the  mental  health  system  where  Plaintiffs  must  receive  services \nin  a restrictive  setting  rather  than  in  a  community  setting  at  a  lower  cost  constitutes  unlawful \ndiscrimination  in  violation  of Section  504’s  integration  mandate.  Defendants  have  caused  the \nPlaintiffs  to  be  marooned  in  extremely  restrictive,  inappropriate,  and  unnecessary  hospital \nsettings.  By  creating  barriers  to  discharge,  failing  to  provide  adequate  community  mental  health \nservices,  not  creating  and  implementing  a working  Olmstead plan,  overly  relying  upon  CRCFs, \nand  generating  charges  of $503  per  day to  the  Plaintiffs,  Defendants  have  caused  unjustified \ninstitutionalization  in  violation  of Section  504  and  the  integration  mandate. \n295.  Section  504  prohibits  Defendants  from  discriminating  against  individuals  with  disabilities \nin  programs  and  activities.  29  U.S.C.  §  794  (a);  see  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51. \n296.  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  adequate  services  and  programs  in  the  most  integrated \nsetting.  Without the  relief provided  by  injunction,  Defendants  will  fail  to  provide  necessary  care \nin  the  most  integrated  setting  for  Plaintiffs  in  violation  of Title  II  of the  ADA. \n297.  Defendants  have  utilized  criteria  and  methods  of administration  that  subject  Plaintiffs  to \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of their  disabilities,  including  unnecessary  institutionalization  by:  (1) \nfailing  to  properly  assess  the  services  and  supports  that would  enable  Plaintiffs  to  remain  in  the \ncommunity;  (2)  failing  to  ensure  that  Plaintiffs  will  have  access  to  services  that will  meet their \nneeds  in  the  community;  (3)  failing  to  make  reasonable  modifications  to  policies,  procedures, \n48\npractices,  and  programs  to  avoid  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability;  (4)  allocating  resources \nfor  institutional  versus  community  long-term  care  contrary  to  the  desires  and  needs  of people \nwith  disabilities  and  contrary  to  Section  504  and  the  integration  mandate;  (5)  overly  and \ninappropriately  relying  upon  segregated  facilities  for  discharge;  and  (6)  charging  Plaintiffs  $503 \nper  day  for  unnecessary  and  unjustified  hospitalization. \n298.  A  permanent  injunction  is  appropriate  because: \na.  Plaintiffs  do  not  have  access  to  an  adequate  remedy  at  law  as  they  need  community \nbased  mental  health  treatment. \nb.  Plaintiffs  will  suffer  irreparable  injury  if they  continue  to  be  isolated  and  segregated \nin  institutions  away  from  the  community. \nc.  The  benefits  to  the  Plaintiffs  of an  injunction  outweigh  the  burdens  an  injunction \nwould  place  on  the  Defendants. \nd.  The  right  to  the  relief sought  is  clear. \n299.  Defendants  are  using  methods  of administration  that  subject  individuals  with  disabilities \nto  discrimination  inhibiting  the  ability  of individuals  to  live  in  the  community. \n300.  Defendants’  actions,  omissions,  policies,  and  practices  are  in  violation  of Section  504. \nCONCLUSION \n301.  The  culture  of the  asylum  persists  tenaciously. \n302.  The  promise  of the  ADA  and  Section  504  is  that  individuals  with  mental  disabilities  will \nlive  integrated  in  the  community  with  services  and  supports  which  keep  them  and  the  community \nsafe. \n49\n303.  While  the  doors  of the  historic  Bull  Street  campus  have  closed,  Bryan  is  open.  Bryan \nHospital  is  another  large  central  institution,  which  is  only  a ten-minute  drive  from  its \npredecessor. \n304.  Defendants  violate  the  ADA  by  causing  needless,  prolonged  segregation  and  isolation  of \nresidents  of Bryan,  by  failing  to  provide  adequate  services  in  the  community,  by  failing  to \ndevelop  and  maintain  a working  plan  for  implementing  the  ADA’s  integration  mandate,  by \noverly  and  inappropriately  relying  upon  segregated  residential  facilities  for  discharge,  by \ncreating  arbitrary  barriers  to  discharge  and  accessing  community  mental  health  services,  and  by \ncharging  residents  $503  per  day  for  services  they  do  not  need. \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  having  set  forth  the  Complaint  against  Defendants,  Plaintiffs  would \nrespectfully  pray  that  this  Court  issue  an  Order  granting  the  following  relief and  remedies: \nA.  Assume jurisdiction  over  this  action  and  maintain  continuing jurisdiction  until \nDefendants  are  in  full  compliance  with  every  Order  of this  Court. \nB.  Certify  the  class. \nC.  Declare  that  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  acts,  and  omissions,  as  set  forth  above, \nviolate  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  ADA  and  Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act  by \ninter  alia: \n1.  Leaving  Plaintiffs  in  segregated  settings  when  they  wish  to  live  in  less  restrictive \nsettings  and  are  able  to  live  in  less  restrictive  settings  if they  receive  appropriate \nservices  and  supports. \n2.  Relying  inappropriately  on  CRCF  placements  and  other  segregated  placements \nfor  discharge  of patients  at  Bryan. \n50\nyee \n3.  Failing  to  make  an  appropriate  range  and  sufficient  quantity  of community  mental \nhealth  services  available  to  Plaintiffs  to  prevent  needless  isolation  and \nsegregation.  These  community  mental  health  services  include: \na.  Sufficient ACT  fidelity  programs  to  serve  Plaintiffs; \nb.

(\"Plaintiffs\"). (Dkt. No. 26.)  For the \nreasons set forth below, the motion for class certification is denied. \nI.  Background \nThe G.  Werber Bryan Psychiatric Hospital (\"Bryan Hospital\") is an inpatient facility in \nColumbia, South Carolina for individuals with mental health disabilities.  The Adult Services \nDivision primarily treats involuntary admissions, and the Forensics Division is a more secure \nunit that primarily treats patients referred by South Carolina jails and criminal courts. See S.C. \nDEP'T OF M ENTAL HEALTH, https://www.state.sc.us/dmh/dir_facilities.htm (last visited Aug. 20, \n2018).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to  develop sufficient community mental health \nservices that would allow the Named Plaintiffs and proposed class to be discharged from Bryan \n-1-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 2 of 10\nHospital's Adult Services Division into an integrated care setting, causing injury by forcing these \nindividuals to be unjustifiably isolated and discriminatorily held in the Adult Services Division \non  the  basis  of their  mental  disabilities.  (Dkt.  Nos.  1 ~~ 1-6,  26-1  at  2.)  Plaintiffs  claim \nDefendants'  conduct violates  Title  II  of the  Americans  with  Disabilities Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§ \n12131-12132,  and  Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation Act,  29  U.S.C.  § 794.  Plaintiffs  seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, including (i) enjoining Defendants from collecting the portion \nof Plaintiffs'  bills and fees  for hospital stays for the time period where Plaintiffs could have \nbeen, but were not, discharged from Bryan Hospital and (ii) enjoining Defendants from violating \nPlaintiffs' rights under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. (Dkt. No. 1, Prayer \nfor Relief~~ C-G.)  Plaintiffs refer to the relief sought as \"a single injunctive order requiring that \nDefendants make sufficient community mental health services available to ensure that the Class \nreceives the services they need to live in their communities instead of in an institution.\" (Dkt. \nNo. 26-1 at 2.) \nPlaintiffs move pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) to certify \na class consisting of \"All current and future adult, non-forensic residents of Bryan Hospital who, \nwith appropriate supports and services, would now or in the future be able to live in an integrated \ncommunity setting and who do not oppose living in an integrated community setting.\" (Dkt. Nos. \n1~109, 26-1at2.) \nII.  Legal Standard \n\"The class-action device, which allows a representative party to prosecute his own claims \nand the claims of those who present similar issues, is an exception to the general rule that a party \nin federal court may vindicate only his own interests.\" Thorn v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 445 \nF.3d 311, 318 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Gen.  Tel.  Co.  ofSw. v.  Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982)). \n\"Chief among the justifications for  this device  is  its efficiency:  adjudication of a properly-\n-2-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 3 of 10\nconstituted class action generally has res judicata effect and  'saves the resources of both the \ncourts and  the  parties by  permitting an  issue potentially affecting every class  member to  be \nlitigated  in  an  economical  fashion.\"' Id.  (quoting  Califano  v.  Yamasaki,  442  U.S.  682, 701 \n(1979)).  \"To ensure this benefit is realized, however, and to protect both the rights of the absent \nplaintiffs to present claims that are different from those common to the class and the right of the \ndefendant  to  present facts  or raise  defenses  that  are  particular to  individual  class  members, \ndistrict courts must conduct a rigorous analysis to ensure compliance with Rule 23  . . . paying \ncareful attention to  the requirements of that Rule.\" Id.  (internal citations and quotation marks \nomitted). \nTo be certified, a proposed class must satisfy the four prerequisites of Rule 23(a):  (1) \nnumerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality and ( 4) adequacy ofrepresentation, as well as one of \nthe three categories in  Rule 23(b). See EQT Prod.  Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, 357 (4th Cir. \n2014).  Here, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that \"the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  A party seeking class certification must do more than plead \ncompliance with the  Rule 23  requirements;  rather,  the party \"must present evidence that the \nputative class complies with Rule 23.\" Adair, 764 F.3d at 357-58.  Plaintiffs bear the burden of \ndemonstrating compliance with Rule 23, \"but the district court has an independent obligation to \nperform a rigorous analysis to ensure that all of the prerequisites have been satisfied.\" Id.  at 358. \n\"Although  Rule  23  does  not  give  district  courts  a  license  to  engage  in  free-ranging  merits \ninquiries at the certification stage, a court should consider merits questions to the extent that they \nare relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.\" \n-3-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 4 of 10\nId.  at 357-58 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Brown v.  Nucor Corp.,  785 F.3d 895, \n903 (4th Cir. 2015). \nIII.  Discussion \nA.  The Class Is Not Readily Identifiable. \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs' motion for class certification must be denied because the \nclass is not easily ascertainable.  \"Rule 23  contains an implicit threshold requirement that the \nmembers of a proposed class be 'readily identifiable.\"' Adair, 764 F.3d at 358.  In other words, \nthe Court must be able to \"readily identify the class members in reference to objective criteria.\" \nId.  \"If a class description is not sufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the \ncourt to determine whether a particular individual is a member, a class should not be certified.\" \nAnselmo  v.  West  Paces  Hotel  Grp.,  LLC,  No.  9:09-2466-MBS,  2011  WL  1049195,  at  *18 \n(D.S.C. Mar.  18, 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \"The plaintiffs need not be able to \nidentify every class member at the time of certification, but if class members are impossible to \nidentify without extensive and individualized fact-finding or mini-trials, then a class action is \ninappropriate.\" Adair, 764 F.3d at 358. (internal quotations omitted). \nPlaintiff seeks to  certify a class of \"All  [ 1]  current and future  [2]  adult, non-forensic \nresidents  of G.  Werber  Bryan  Psychiatric  Hospital  who,  [3]  with  appropriate  supports  and \nservices, would [4 ] now or in the future [5] be able to live in an integrated community setting \nand [6] who do not oppose living in an integrated community setting.\" (Dkt. No. 26 at 2.)  These \nclass members cannot be easily identified without extensive and individualized fact-finding into \nissues that turn on personal circumstances and are inherently fact-specific, such as each class \nmember's medical diagnosis, future prognosis, treatment plan, and future interest in and ability \nto live in an integrated care facility. See Cuming v. South Carolina Lottery Comm 'n, No. 3:05-\ncv-03608-MBS, 2008 WL 906705, at * 1 (D.S.C. Mar. 31, 2008) (\"Where the practical issue of \n-4-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 5 of 10\nidentifying  class  members  is  overly  problematic,  the  court  should  consider  that  the \nadministrative  burdens  of certification  may  outweigh  the  efficiencies  expected  in  a  class \naction.\").  Plaintiffs  contend  that  these  individuals  can  be  easily  ascertained  by  consulting \nDefendant's routine documentation of the \"names and status\" of Bryan Hospital residents. (Dkt. \nNo.  26-1  at n.4.)  But investigating if an individual has \"been recommended for screening by \ntheir treatment team\" as  indication that a family  member is  willing to  take  the  patient, and \n\"ask[ing] their treatment team\" or reviewing \"the social work notes\" to determine if the patient \n\"needed a structured placement\" (Dkt. No. 26-3 at 12) is not an objective measure by which to \ndetermine if an individual meets the class criteria.  Plaintiffs offer no objective tool to identify \neach class member.  As a result, the Court finds the proposed class is not readily ascertainable. \nB.  There Are Not Common Questions of Law or Fact. \nEven if the proposed class were readily identifiable as a threshold matter, Plaintiffs have \nnot demonstrated that each requirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied.  For example, to maintain a \nclass  action, there must be \"questions of law or fact common to  the class.\" Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n23(a)(2).  The class members' \"claims must depend upon a common contention . .. of such a \nnature that it is capable of classwide resolution-which means that determination of its truth or \nfalsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\" \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc.  v.  Dukes,  564 U.S.  338, 350 (2011); see also Adair,  764 F.3d at 360 \n(\"Although the rule speaks in terms of common questions, what matters to class certification [is] \nthe capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of \nthe litigation.\") (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original).  \"A single common \nquestion will suffice, but it must be of such a nature that its determination will resolve an issue \n-5-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 6 of 10\nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\" Adair,  764 F.3d at 360 \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \nHere,  as  noted,  each  proposed  class  member  is  factually  unique  from  the  others. \nPlaintiffs' proposed common injury- \"unnecessary institutionalization\" (Dkt. No. 26 at 2)-is \nnot sufficient for a single proceeding to produce common answers that could resolve classwide \nissues. See Thorn v.  Jefferson-Pilot Ins.  Co., 445 F.3d 311, 317 (4th Cir. 2006) (\"A question is \nnot common  ... if its resolution turns on a consideration of the individual circumstances of each \nmember.\").  And, because the proposed class is fundamentally heterogeneous by virtue of each \nindividual's evolving medical treatment, class certification of these over 152 individuals would \nnot produce the efficiency intended by Rule 23. See id. (finding \"Plaintiffs have failed to meet \nthe requirement of commonality\" because \"the court would be required to conduct an inquiry \ninto the individual circumstances and motivations of each class member\").  Accordingly, the \nCourt finds the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a) is not satisfied. \nC.  The Named Representatives' Claims are Not Typical of Those of the Class. \nThe typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) demands that \"a class representative must be \npart of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.\" \nLienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 146 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting General Tel.  Co.  ofSw. \nv.  Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982)).  Named Plaintiffs are patients at Bryan Hospital for whom \n\"community  based  services  would  be  appropriate,\"  who  do  not  \"oppose  community  based \ntreatment,\" and who have \"been involuntarily committed to Bryan Hospital.\" (Dkt. No. 1 ~ 12.) \nThese interests and injuries generally reflect those alleged by the proposed class members. See \nParker v. Asbestos Processing, LLC, No. O:l l-CV- 01800-JFA, 2015 WL 127930, at *7 (D.S.C. \nJan. 8, 2015) (\"The typicality requirement is met if a plaintiffs claim arises from the same event \n-6-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 7 of 10\nor course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and is based on the \nsame legal theory.\").  Nonetheless, \"[l]ike the requirement of commonality, the requirement of \ntypicality  serves  as  a  guidepost  for  determining  whether  under the  particular  circumstances \nmaintenance of a class action is economical.\" Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157 n.13.  One such indication \nof  typicality  is  damages,  and  the  injunction  Plaintiffs  seek--enjoining  Defendants  from \ncollecting bills and fees from Plaintiffs for the time period when Plaintiffs could have been, but \nwere  not,  discharged  from  Bryan  Hospital-requires  an  analysis  of  each  member's \ncircumstances that  is  not appropriate  for  class  certification. See  Broussard v. Meineke  Disc. \nMuffler Shops, Inc.,  155 F.3d 331, 342-44 (4th Cir.  1998) (holding that individualized damages \nwill preclude typicality where a fact-specific inquiry is necessary).  The Court therefore finds the \nclass representatives' interests and injuries are not typical of those of the class members. \nHaving found the class not ascertainable, insufficient common questions of law or fact, \nand insufficient typicality, the Court finds that the proposed class cannot be certified.  The Court \nhas  taken  each requirement of Rule  23(a)  into  careful  consideration in  light of the  facts  as \nalleged, and finds that two of the four Rule 23(a) requirements are satisfied. \nD.  Numerosity \nA class must be \"so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a)(l). \"No specified number is needed to maintain a class action.\" Brady v. Thurston Motor \nLines,  726  F .2d  13 6,  145  (4th  Cir.  1984 ).  Instead,  \"the determination  rests  on  the  court's \npractical judgment in light of the particular facts of the case.\" Lott v. Westinghouse Savannah \nRiver Co.,  200 F.R.D. 539, 550 (D.S.C. 2000); accord Gen. Tel.  Co.  of the Nw. v. Equal Emp't \nOpportunity  Comm'n,  446  U.S.  318,  330  (1980)  (\"The  numerosity  requirement  requires \nexamination  of  the  specific  facts  of  each  case  and  imposes  no  absolute  limitations.\") \n-7-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 8 of 10\n\"[P]racticability of joinder depends on many factors, including, for example, the size of the class, \nease of identifying its numbers and determining their addresses, facility of making service on \nthem if joined and their geographic dispersion.\" Baltimore v.  Laborers' Int'! Union of N. Am., 67 \nF.3d 293, 1995 WL 578084at*1 (4th Cir. 1995). \nHere, the class consists of at least 152 individuals currently institutionalized in the adult \ncare  lodges at  Bryan Hospital,  as  well as  additional  individuals who may be  hospitalized at \nBryan Hospital in the future. (Dkt. No. 1 ~ 110.)  This class is sufficiently numerous that joinder \nis impracticable. See Doe v.  Charleston Area Med.  Ctr., Inc., 529 F.2d 638, 645 (4th Cir. 1975) \n(\"Where the plaintiff has demonstrated that the class of persons he or she wishes to represent \nexists, that they are not specifically identifiable supports rather than bars the bringing of a class \naction, because joinder is  impracticable.\").  Moreover, these individuals are unlikely to  seek \nindividual vindication of their rights by virtue of their current hospitalization and mental health \ndisabilities.  The Court therefore finds the numerosity requirement of Rule 23 satisfied. \nE.  Adequate Representation \nNamed Plaintiffs must be able to \"fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This requirement is \"a two-pronged inquiry, requiring evaluation of: \n(1) whether class counsel are qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed \nlitigation; and (2) whether Plaintiffs' claims are sufficiently interrelated with and not antagonistic \nto the class claims as to ensure fair and adequate representation.\" Lott v. Westinghouse Savannah \nRiver Co.,  200 F.R.D. 539, 561 (D.S.C. 2000); see also Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 (noting that the \nRule 23 (a)( 4) requirement \"raises concerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts \nof interest\"). \n-8-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 9 of 10\nRegarding  the  first  prong,  class  counsel  primarily  practices  litigation  arising  out  of \nconstruction  and  admiralty  matters.  See  WOMBLE  BOND  DICKINSON  LLP, \nhttps://www.womblebonddickinson.com/us/people/dana-w-lang  and \nhttps://www.womblebonddickinson.com/us/people/sean-d-houseal (last visited Aug.  20, 2018). \nThis apparent lack of experience in class action or disabilities law would be supplemented by the \nexpertise of Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. and the Bazelon Center \nfor Mental Health Law.  Therefore, on the whole, the trial team would be able to prosecute the \naction on behalf of the class.  Turning to the second prong, the \"adequacy inquiry under Rule \n23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to \nrepresent.\" Amchem Prods., Inc.  v.  Windsor,  521  U.S.  591,  625  (1997).  Here, there are no \napparent conflicts of interest between the proposed class representatives.  Although the lack of \ntypicality raises whether \"the named plaintiff1 s'] claim[ s] and the class claims are so interrelated \nthat the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence,\" \nGunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 459 (4th Cir. 2003), the Court finds that the \nRule 23(a)(4) requirement is satisfied. \nF.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nFinally,  if the  class  were  readily  identifiable  and  all  Rule  23(a)  requirements  were \nsatisfied, Plaintiffs must also demonstrate that Defendants \"acted or refused to act on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  This necessitates two \nshowings:  (1)  \"the  defendants'  actions  or  inactions  must  be  based  on  grounds  generally \napplicable to all class members,\" and (2) final injunctive relief [would] be appropriate for the \nclass as a whole.\"  Williams v. Jones, No. 9:14-cv-00787-RMG-BM, 2014 WL 2155251, at *9 \n-9-\n\n2:17-cv-01346-RMG     Date Filed 08/21/18    Entry Number 52     Page 10 of 10\n(D.S.C.  May  22,  2014).  Plaintiffs  contend  that  \"a  single  injunctive  order  requiring  that \nDefendants  make  sufficient community mental  health services available\" would \"benefit the \nClass  as  a  whole.\"  (Dkt.  No. 26-1  at  2,  27.)  But  each  proposed  class  member's  medical \ndiagnosis,  future  prognosis,  treatment  plan,  and  ability  to  live  in  a  community  setting  is \nindividualized and subject to change as the member's health and medical status evolve.  As a \nresult, the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek necessitates a patient-specific inquiry and, therefore, \nwould not have the blanket effect that Rule 23(b)(2) requires.  Accordingly, the Court finds that \nRule 23(b )(2) is not satisfied. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the motion for class certification by Named Plaintiffs together \nwith Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. (Dkt. No. 26) is DENIED. \nAND IT IS SO ORDERED. \nRichard Mark Gerge \nUnited States District Court Judge \nAugust <...(, 2018 \nCharleston, South Carolina \n-10-",
