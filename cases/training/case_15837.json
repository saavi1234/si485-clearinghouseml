    "summary": "<p>On February 20, 2009, a Muslim prisoner at the Central New York Psychiatric Center filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The pro se plaintiff sued the Director of the Sex Offender Treatment Program, the New York State Office of Health Commissioner, and the Executive Director of the Central New York Psychiatric Center under 42 U.S.C. §1983. The plaintiff sought injunctive and monetary relief, claiming violations of the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clauses, and the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The plaintiff alleged that his facility, the Central New York Psychiatric Center (CNYPC) did not allow him to properly participate in Al-Jumu’ah prayer services, forced him to attend classes on Fridays in violation of Muslim practice, and denied him food in compliance with Halal. </p><p>On March 17, 2010, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment. He argued there was clear evidence the CNYPC misunderstood the requirements for Al-Jumu’ah prayer and in doing so deprived him of Free Exercise. On April 14, 2010, the defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing (1) that the reason Al-Jumu’ah prayer has not been provided is that there are no Imams in the area who are available to facilitate, (2) the food offered in the cafeteria allows those following a Halal diet to sustain good health without violating their dietary laws, and (3) the utensils are sufficiently washed so as to be in compliance with Halal. </p><p>On December 23, 2010, Magistrate Judge George Lowe issued a report and recommendation to Judge David Hurd, (2010 WL 5620908), which Judge Hurd then adopted in full on January 20, 2011. Judge Hurd denied the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment while granting in part and denying in part the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. The surviving claims included the Free Exercise and Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act claims regarding the lack of Al-Jumu’ah services, the lack of a Halal-compliant menu, the denial of access to sacred food on religious holidays, and the requirement to attend classes on Fridays. The court dismissed the Free Exercise claims regarding bowls, utensils, and serving fish on Fridays; the Establishment Clause claim regarding serving fish on Fridays; the Due Process Claims; the Eighth Amendment claim; and the claim against the New York State Office of Health Commissioner. 2011 WL 195648. </p><p>After the appointment of pro bono counsel on September 29, 2011, parties moved to settle the lawsuit. On November 14, 2011, the parties consented to have Magistrate Judge Lowe oversee the negotiations and final resolution of the case. On February 7, 2012, the parties settled and Magistrate Judge Lowe signed off on the settlement the next day. According to the settlement,  the defendants would pay the plaintiff $15,000, which included all damages, costs, and attorney’s fees, and the defendants further agreed to have a Halal menu in place and retain an Imam to lead Al-Jumu’ah services on Fridays. As no action has been taken on this case since, it is likely this case is closed. </p><p></p>",

Plaintiff informed \"administrators\"1\nthat he was a Muslim and needed to participate in all of the activities required by his faith,\nincluding prayer, meals, and ceremonies.  Id. at 3-4 ¶ 3.\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants Terri Maxymillian (the director of the Sex Offender\nTreatment Program at CNYPC), Michael Hogan (the commissioner of the New York Office of\nMental Health), and Donald Sawyer (the executive director of CNYPC) violated his\nconstitutional rights by (1) not allowing Al-Jumu'ah prayer on Fridays; (2) forcing Plaintiff to eat\nfood from bowls and with plastic silverware contaminated with pork from prior meals eaten by\nnon-Muslims; (3) denying Plaintiff sacred foods during holidays; (4) forcing Plaintiff to eat fish\non Fridays \"as the church of Catholics require[s]\"; and (5) forcing Plaintiff to attend Sex\nOffender Treatment Program (\"SOTP\") classes on Fridays.  Id. at 4-5 ¶¶  4-7.2     \n  II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS\nA. Legal Standard Governing Motions for Summary Judgment\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment is warranted if “the\npleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no\n1 The complaint does not identify these \"administrators\" by name.\n2 Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment focuses entirely on the Al Jumu'ah issue. \n(Dkt. Nos. 33-1, 33-2.)  Defendants, too, focus largely on the Al Jumu'ah issue.   \n2\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 3 of 24\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).  The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden\nof showing, through the production of admissible evidence, that no genuine issue of material fact\nexists.  Only after the moving party has met this burden is the nonmoving party required to\nproduce evidence demonstrating that genuine issues of material fact exist.  Salahuddin v. Goord,\n467 F.3d 263, 272-73 (2d Cir. 2006).  The nonmoving party must do more than “rest upon the\nmere allegations . . . of the [plaintiff’s] pleading” or “simply show that there is some\nmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts.”  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,\n475 U.S. 574, 585-86 (1986).  Rather, a dispute regarding a material fact is genuine “if the\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  In determining whether a genuine\nissue of material3 fact exists, the Court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable\ninferences against the moving party.  Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, 542 F.3d\n290, 309 (2d Cir. 2008).  \nB. Legal Standard Governing Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\nTo the extent that a defendant’s motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56 is based entirely on the allegations of the plaintiff’s complaint, such a motion\nis functionally the same as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6).  As a result, “[w]here appropriate, a trial judge may dismiss for failure\nto state a cause of action upon motion for summary judgment.”  Schwartz v. Compagnise Gen.\n3 A fact is “material” only if it would have some effect on the outcome of the suit. \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248.\n3\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 4 of 24\nTransatlantique, 405 F.2d 270, 273 (2d Cir. 1968) (citations omitted); accord, Katz v. Molic, 128\nF.R.D. 35, 37-38 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (“This Court finds that . . . a conversion [of a Rule 56\nsummary judgment motion to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint] is proper with or\nwithout notice to the parties.”).  Accordingly, it is appropriate to summarize the legal standard\ngoverning Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss.  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6) on the ground that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n In order to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain, inter alia,\n“a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 8(a)(2).  The requirement that a plaintiff “show” that he or she is entitled to relief means\nthat a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)) (emphasis added).  “Determining whether\na complaint states a plausible claim for relief . . . requires the . . . court to draw on its judicial\nexperience and common sense . . . [W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer\nmore than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged - but it has not shown -\nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Id. at 1950 (internal citation and punctuation omitted).    \n“In reviewing a complaint for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept the\nmaterial facts alleged in the complaint as true and construe all reasonable inferences in the\nplaintiff’s favor.”  Hernandez v. Coughlin, 18 F.3d 133, 136 (2d Cir. 1994) (citation omitted). \nCourts are “obligated to construe a pro se complaint liberally.”  Harris v. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 72\n(2d Cir. 2009).  However, “the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations\n4\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 5 of 24\ncontained in the complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.  Threadbare recitals of the\nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Iqbal,\n129 S. Ct. at 1949.  \nIII. DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nA. Religion Claims\n1. Applicable Standard\nDepending on the circumstances, different standards apply to claims that state actors have\nviolated an individual's right to freely exercise religion.  Generally, in order to satisfy the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment, government actions that substantially burden a\nreligious practice must be justified by a compelling government interest.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374\nU.S. 398 (1963).  However, due to the unique concerns of the prison setting, prisoners’ First\nAmendment free exercise rights must be balanced against the interests of prison officials engaged\nin the complex duties of administering the penal system.  Ford v. McGinnis, 352 F.3d 582, 588\n(2d Cir. 2003).  Thus, a prison regulation or individualized decision to deny a prisoner the ability\nto engage in a religious exercise “is judged under a reasonableness test less restrictive than that\nordinarily applied [to burdens on fundamental rights]: a regulation that burdens a [prisoner’s]\nprotected right passes constitutional muster if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological\ninterests.”  Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 274 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting O’Lone v. Estate of\nShabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 349 (1987) (punctuation omitted). \nThe Second Circuit has not decided which standard applies to individuals, like Plaintiff,\nwho are civilly committed to locked psychiatric facilities that share characteristics with penal\ninstitutions.  District courts in the Second Circuit are split on the issue.  Compare Carney v.\n5\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 6 of 24\nHogan, No. 9:08-CV-1251 (DNH/ATB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59439, at *8, 2010 WL\n2519121, at *3 (N.D.N.Y.

Apr. 8, 2008) (applying legitimate penological purpose test\nto CNYPC patient's free exercise claim) (Hurd, J.).4  In an abundance of caution, I will consider\nPlaintiff's claims in the context of each standard.5  \n Plaintiff's religious rights are also protected by the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act. (\"RLUIPA\").6  RLUIPA, like the Free Exercise Clause as applied\nto non-prisoners, applies a compelling governmental interest test.  Specifically, RLUIPA\nprovides that \"[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a\n4 The Court will provide Plaintiff with a copy of this unpublished decision in\naccordance with the Second Circuit’s decision in LeBron v. Sanders, 557 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2009). \n5 Defendants' position is that the legitimate penological interest test should apply\nbecause \"Plaintiff has made reference to prisoner litigation in his complaint and has not\nsuggested that the analysis for a free exercise claim by an involuntarily committed individual is\ndifferent from the analysis applied to prisoners' free exercise claims.\"  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 3,\ncitation to complaint omitted.) \n6 Although Plaintiff’s complaint does not explicitly claim that Defendants are liable\nunder RLUIPA, I am required to construe the complaint liberally, interpreting it to raise the\nstrongest possible arguments that it suggests.  Chavis v. Chappius, 618 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 2010). \nMoreover, Plaintiff refers to RLUIPA in his motion for summary judgment.  (Dkt. No. 33-2 at 5.) \nDefendants do not address RLUIPA.  \n6\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 7 of 24\nperson residing in or confined to an institution7 . . . unless the government demonstrates that\nimposition of the burden on that person (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\ninterest.\"8  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).\n        2. Al Jumu'ah Service\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his religious rights by failing to hold proper Al\nJumu'ah services.  (Dkt. No. 1 at 4 ¶ 4(a).)  Defendants move for summary judgment of this\nclaim, arguing that the unavailability of proper Al Jumu'ah services was caused by legitimate\npenological interests.  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 5.)   \na. Facts\n\"Al Jumu'ah is an important service for Muslims.  Unlike other Muslim daily prayers, it is\nnot a prayer that can be worshiped individually.  It is a congregate prayer performed every Friday\nafter the sun reaches its zenith and before the Asr, or afternoon prayer. . . . There is no alternative\nmeans of attending Jumu'ah.  Attendance at the congregational prayer is obligatory on all men in\nthe Muslim religion.\"  (Najeeullah Decl., Dkt. No. 37-5 ¶¶ 10-11.)  Plaintiff alleges that CNYPC\nstopped offering Al Jumu'ah services in August 2008.  (Dkt. No. 33-1 ¶ 1.)    \n7 An \"institution\" is any facility or institution that is \"owned, operated, or managed\nby, or provides services on behalf of any State\" and is, inter alia, \"for persons who are mentally\nill, disabled, or retarded, or chronically ill or handicapped\" or \"a jail, prison, or other correctional\nfacility.\"  42 U.S.C. § 1997(1) (2010).  \n8 Although neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has yet decided the\nissue, the consensus of opinion among district courts in the Second Circuit  is that RLUIPA does\nnot authorize suits for money damages.  See Pugh v. Goord, 571 F. Supp. 2d 477, 506-09\n(S.D.N.Y. 2008).  That issue is currently pending before the Supreme Court in Sossamon v.\nTexas (No. 08-1438, argued Nov. 2, 2010).  That issue does not affect the analysis here because\nPlaintiff requests both money damages and injunctive relief.  (Dkt. No. 1 at 7-9.) \n7\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 8 of 24\nAt CNYPC, a Muslim prayer service or study class9 is offered on Fridays from 9:30-\n10:30 a.m.  (Defs.' Ex. 1, Dkt. No. 37-4 at 2.)  Imam Malik Najeeullah presides.  (Dkt. No. 37-5 ¶\n7.) Plaintiff's official schedule at CNYPC includes this event.  (Defs.' Ex. 9, Dkt. No. 37-4 at 45.) \nDefendants state that \"CNYPC was under the mistaken belief that the Al Jumu'ah prayer could be\nworshiped individually and that the regularly scheduled worship time for Muslims at 9:30 a.m.\non Fridays was available to satisfy the desire of resident Muslims to worship the prayer.\" \n(Dziadyk Decl., Dkt. No. 37-6 ¶ 12.) \nOn January 22, 2009, Plaintiff sent a complaint to Defendant Maxymillian objecting to\nthe lack of Al Jumu'ah services.  (Pl.'s Ex. C, Dkt. No. 33-2 at 11 ¶ 1.)  Defendant Maxymillian\nresponded, stating that \"CNYPC . . . offers Muslim prayer services on Friday mornings that are\nled by Imam Najeeullah.  Those services have not been changed nor has [Plaintiff] been denied\nthe ability to attend.\"  (Defs.' Ex. 7, Dkt. No. 37-4 at 40.)    \nOn February 20, 2009, Plaintiff filed this action.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  \nOn March 18, 2009, Plaintiff sent a complaint to Defendant Sawyer in which he objected\nto the lack of Al Jumu'ah services.  (Pl.'s Ex. G, Dkt. No. 33-2 at 17.)  Defendant Sawyer\nresponded that \"Muslim services are offered on Fridays at 9:30 a.m.  This time was set to meet\nboth the needs of the residents and the Imam's schedule.  The Imam has informed us that formal\nservices do not need to happen at noon as residents can participate individually and from any\n9 At various times, CNYPC officials, including Defendants, have referred to this\nevent as a \"prayer service.\"  (Dkt. No. 33-2 at 18; Dkt. No. 37-4 at 32, 40.)  Imam Najeeullah,\nwho presides over the event, refers to it as a \"class.\"  (Dkt. No. 33-2 at 16; Dkt. No. 37-5 ¶ 7.)  \n8\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 9 of 24\nlocation at that time.\"10  Id. at 18. \nOn March 27, 2009, Imam Najeeullah issued a memorandum titled \"Jumu'ah Prayer or\nthe Friday Worship Service for Muslim[s].\"  (Pl.'s Ex. A, Dkt. No. 33-2 at 7.)  It is not clear to\nwhom the memorandum was directed, but the document states that  Elaine Dziadyk (the\nsupervisor of rehabilitation services) and S. Montrose (a social worker supervisor) received\ncopies.  Id.  Imam Najeeullah explained that Al Jumu'ah should occur at approximately 1:15 p.m.\nduring daylight savings time, that the prayer was \"obligatory for all Muslims,\" and that the Friday\nmorning Muslim study class at CNYPC was \"not a Jumu'ah worship service.\"  Id.  Imam\nNajeeullah stated that his schedule did not allow him to facilitate a Friday Al Jumu'ah prayer\nservice at CNYPC, but that \"[t]here should always be a qualified Imam available to facilitate this\nservice if it is allowed.\"  Id.\nOn May 1, 2009, John Culkin, the Director of the Bureau of Sex Offender Evaluation and\nTreatment, responded to an April 7, 2009, letter from Plaintiff.  (Pl.'s Ex. D, Dkt. No. 33-2 at 15;\nDefs.' Ex. 8, Dkt. No. 37-4 at 42.)  Mr. Culkin stated that \"[p]er staff at Central New York\nPsychiatric Center, the facility offers Muslim prayer services at 9:30 am on Friday mornings. \nThese services have not changed nor have you been denied the right to attend them as currently\nscheduled.  The Imam has additionally informed [CNYPC] staff that formal services do not need\nto occur at noon as residents can participate individually and from any location at that time.\"  Id.  \nOn May 19, 2009, Mental Hygiene Legal Services wrote to Mr. Culkin, enclosing a copy\n10 In response to interrogatories, Defendant Sawyer identified \"the Imam\" who had\n“informed” him on these matters as Imam Abdullah Muhammad.  (Pl.'s Ex. G, Dkt. no. 33-2 at\n19.)  Imam Abdullah Mohammad is the Muslim Chaplain at Mohawk Correctional Facility. \n(Pl.'s Ex. B, Dkt. No. 33-2 at 8.) \n9\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 10 of 24\nof a letter from Imam Najeeullah.  (Pl.'s Ex. E, Dkt. No. 33-2 at 16.)  Mental Hygiene Legal\nServices noted that Imam Najeeullah's letter stated  \"that the Jumu'ah worship service is\n'obligatory for all Muslims,' just as 'Sunday worship service is for all Christians'\" and that \"the\n'study classes' he does host on Thursdays and Fridays are 'not a Jumu'ah worship service.'\"  Id. \nOn October 23, 2009, Defendants Sawyer and Maxymillian responded to Plaintiff's\ninterrogatories.  (Dkt. No. 37-4 at 52-66.)  In those responses, Defendants reiterated their answers\nto Plaintiff's grievances and stated that Imam Abdullah Muhammad had informed them that\ncongregate prayer was not necessary for Al Jumu'ah.  Id.  \nOn January 13, 2010, Imam Abdullah Muhammad wrote to Deputy Attorney General\nDean J. Higgins, counsel for Defendants in this action.  (Pl.'s Ex. B, Dkt. No. 33-2 at 8.)  He\nstated that he was writing to \"clarify a gross misunderstanding\" that Al Jumu'ah \"can be\nperformed individually.\"  Id.  He explained that \"[a]ttendance at the congregational prayer is\nobligatory on all men . . . So, it is impossible for me to advise anyone that Jumu'ah prayer can be\nperformed individually.  What I did say, and it may be the source of the misunderstanding, is that\nthe [five] daily prayers can be performed individually under circumstances such as those found in\njails, prisons, and other institutions.\"  Id. \nAt some point, officials at CNYPC came to understand that \"Al Jumu'ah is a congregate\nprayer that can[]not be worshiped individually. \"  (Dziadyk Decl., Dkt. No. 37-6  ¶¶ 13.) \nThereafter, the facility \"commenced a search for a Muslim Imam to conduct the service.\"  Id. ¶\n14.  CNYPC officials asked Imam Najeeullah to preside at the service.  Id. ¶ 15.  Imam\nNajeeullah is employed part-time by both the New York Department of Correctional Services\n(\"DOCS\") at Marcy Correctional Facility and the Department of Mental Health at CNYPC. \n10\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 11 of 24\n(Najeeullah Decl., Dkt. No. 37-5  ¶¶ 2-3.)  Imam Najeeullah attempted to get permission from\nDOCS to conduct a service at CNYPC, but his request was denied because it would conflict with\nhis schedule of services at Marcy.  Id. ¶ 12.  \nImam Najeeullah has worked with CNYPC officials \"to identify an eligible Imam who\nwould be able to conduct services at the Center,\" but no such individual has been found.  (Dkt.\nNo. 37-5 ¶ 13.)  At one point, an individual was \"identified . . . , but it was determined that he\nwas not eligible\" because of \"issues in his background.\"  Id. ¶ 14; Dkt. No. 37-6 ¶ 18. \nDefendants do not identify what these \"issues\" were or why they rendered the individual\nunsuitable.  Defendants state that the search is ongoing.  (Dkt. No. 37-5 ¶ 16; Dkt. No. 37-6 ¶\n19.)      \nOn February 4, 2010, Stephen C. Clark, the principal attorney for the Mental Hygiene\nLegal Service for the Fourth Judicial Department, wrote to Plaintiff.  (Pl.'s Ex. C, Dkt. No. 33-2\nat 9-10.)  Mr. Clark reported that he had met with members of the CNYPC staff, including\nDefendants Sawyer and Maxymillian, to discuss the lack of Al Jumu'ah services at CNYPC.  Id. \nat 9.  Defendant Sawyer stated that CNYPC was \"actively attempting\" to find someone and\n\"insured that he would continue to work to bring this matter to a quick resolution.\"  Id.  Mr.\nClark inquired whether Plaintiff would be interested in being trained to lead Al Jumu'ah services\nbecause Defendant Sawyer \"seemed to indicate that the hospital would be willing to entertain\ngetting appropriate training for someone currently there [] to run such services.\"  Id.     \nb. Analysis\nUnder the legitimate penological interest test, a prisoner “must show at the threshold that\n11\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 12 of 24\nthe disputed conduct substantially burdens11 his sincerely held religious beliefs.”  Salahuddin,\n467 F.3d at 274-75 (citing Ford, 352 F.3d at 591).  Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff's\nreligious beliefs are sincerely held or that the lack of Al Jumu'ah services burdened those beliefs. \nIndeed, for the purposes of the pending motions, Defendants concede that Al Jumu'ah \"is a\ncentral religious service of the Muslim faith\" and that \"[t]here is no alternative to the Al Jumu'ah\nworship.\"  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 5.)  Therefore, I find that Plaintiff holds a sincere religious belief\nthat has been substantially burdened.  The issue, then, is whether Defendants have established as\na matter of law that this burden was caused by a legitimate or compelling governmental interest.\nUnder the deferential legitimate penological interest test, once a plaintiff establishes that\nhis or her sincerely held religious belief has been substantially burdened,“[t]he defendants then\nbear the relatively limited burden of identifying the legitimate penological interests that justify\nthe impinging conduct; the burden remains with the prisoner to show that these articulated\nconcerns were irrational.”  Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 275 (quoting Ford, 352 F.3d at 595)\n(punctuation omitted).  Although the defendants’ burden is “relatively limited,” the legitimate\npenological interest advanced must have been the actual reason for the defendants’ actions. \n11  Although the Second Circuit has applied the “substantial burden” test in its most\nrecent prison free exercise cases, it has done so while explicitly refusing to adopt or endorse the\ntest.  “The Ford court noted that the Circuits apparently are split over whether prisoners must\nshow a substantial burden on their religious exercise in order to maintain free exercise claims.\nNevertheless, the Ford court held that since the plaintiff had not challenged the application of the\nsubstantial burden requirement, the court would proceed as if the requirement applied.  Likewise,\nthe Salahuddin court noted that ‘[r]esolution of this appeal does not require us to address\nSalahuddin's argument that a prisoner's First Amendment free-exercise claim is not governed by\nthe 'substantial burden' threshold requirement,’ because defendants ‘never proceed to argue that\nwe should find any particular burdened religious practice to be peripheral or tangential to\n[plaintiff's] religion.’ The court then proceeded as if the substantial burden requirement applied.” \nPugh v. Goord, 571 F. Supp. 2d 477, 497 n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)(citations and some punctuation\nomitted).  \n12\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 13 of 24\n“Post hoc justifications with no record support will not suffice.”  Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 276-77. \nHere, Defendants rely on a post hoc justification.  Defendants state that they\nare  not  opposed  to  permitting  Plaintiff's  participation  in  the\ncongregate Al Jumu'ah; however . . . there is currently no Imam\navailable to conduct the service . . . [T]he Imam and the CNYPC staff\nare addressing this issue and have instituted a search for a person to\nconduct the service.  Once an Imam is identified, the service will be\ninstituted and Plaintiff will be permitted to attend.\n(Dkt. No. 37-8 at 5.)  This was not the reason that Defendants initially gave for not offering the\nAl Jumu'ah service.  Rather, Defendants initially responded to Plaintiff's complaints by stating\nthat they believed that the Friday morning session offered by Imam Najeeullah was sufficient and\nthat no congregate Al Jumu'ah service was required.12  Defendants admit in their motion papers\nthat this belief was \"mistaken.\"  (Dkt. No. 37-6 ¶ 12.)  Defendants persisted in this “mistaken\nbelief” for at least seventeen months, from the time that they ceased offering Al Jumu'ah services\nin approximately August 2008 until January 2010, when  Imam Muhammad wrote to defense\ncounsel to correct Defendants’ “gross misunderstanding.”  (Dkt. No. 37-4 at 40; Dkt. No. 33-2 at\n8.)  Indeed, individuals associated with CNYPC continued to assert their belief that Al Jumu'ah\nwas not required for several months after Plaintiff filed this action.  (Dkt. No. 37-4 at 42.)  Thus,\nthe initial denial of Al Jumu'ah was due not to the lack of an Imam as Defendants now contend,\nbut rather to a misunderstanding of the religious significance of Al Jumu'ah.  It was not until after\nImam Muhammad corrected this misunderstanding that Defendants began to search for an Imam\n12 I note that such a justification would not, if asserted in the pending motion, be\nlegally sufficient to entitle Defendants to summary judgment.  Ford, 352 F.3d at 597-98.  Even if\nthis justification were legally sufficient, it would not be factually supported here.  As Imam\nMuhammad indicated in his letter to defense counsel, he never intended for Defendants to\nbelieve that congregate Al Jumu'ah prayer is merely optional for Muslims.  \n13\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 14 of 24\nwho could preside at Al Jumu'ah.  \nEven if Defendants’ justification were not post hoc, it would be insufficient to support a\nfinding, as a matter of law, that the denial of Al Jumu'ah was motivated by a legitimate\npenological interest.  As another judge in this District has observed, the legitimate penological\ninterest inquiry \"is particularly fact-lad[]en and often ill-suited for resolution on [a] motion for\nsummary judgment . . .\"  Jackson v.

Dec. 31, 2009).13    Here, Defendants\nsimply have not provided the Court with enough information to analyze the issue.  Defendants do\nnot provide any details at all about why the search for an Imam has been unsuccessful, other than\nto state that one potential Imam was not eligible because of unspecified “issues in his\nbackground.”  (Dkt. No. 37-6 ¶ 18.)\nDefendants’ justification, and the lack of detail they provide about it, is similar to that\nasserted in a recent case from the District of Connecticut.  Vega v. Lantz, No. 304CV1215DFM,\n2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88550, 2009 WL 3157586 (D. Con. Sept. 25, 2009).14  In Vega, a state\nprisoner claimed that his free exercise and RLUIPA rights were violated because the facility\nroutinely cancelled Al Jumu'ah.  Vega, 2009 WL 315786, at *1.  The defendants conceded that\nAl Jumu'ah had been frequently cancelled over a four-year period, but argued that cancellation\nwas necessary “when there is no chaplain available or in case of a security lockdown.”  Id. at\n13 The Court will provide Plaintiff with a copy of this unpublished decision in\naccordance with the Second Circuit’s decision in LeBron v. Sanders, 557 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2009).\n \n14 The Court will provide Plaintiff with a copy of this unpublished decision in\naccordance with the Second Circuit’s decision in LeBron v. Sanders, 557 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2009).\n  \n14\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 15 of 24\n*11.  The court denied the defendants’ motion for summary judgment because the defendants\n“provide[d] no explanation for the frequent cancellation of Jumah, or of the insufficient and\nunequal staffing that allegedly underlies it.”  Id.  Thus, the court found, the defendants had failed\n“to carry their burden of showing that the frequent cancellation of Jumah is either rationally\nrelated to a legitimate penological interest . . . or in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest.”  Id.             \n Therefore, I recommend that the Court deny Defendants' motion for summary judgment\ndismissing Plaintiff's claim regarding the Al Jumu'ah service.\n3. Bowls and Utensils\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his religious rights by \"forcing Plaintiff to eat\nfood from bowls contaminated with pork from prior meals eat[en] by non-Muslims.\"  (Dkt. No. 1\nat 4 ¶ 4(b).)  Defendants move for summary judgment dismissing this claim, arguing that\nPlaintiff's religious beliefs have not been burdened.  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 6.)  Defendants are correct.\nImam Najeeullah declares that there is \"no prohibition\" on eating from a bowl or using a\nutensil previously used by a non-Muslim to eat pork \"so long as they have been washed and\nsanitized . . .\"  (Dkt. No. 37-5 ¶¶ 18-19.)  Valerie Fasteson, the Director of Nutritional Services\nfor CNYPC, declares that plates, bowls, and utensils are \"thoroughly washed and sanitized\"\nbefore they are reused.  (Dkt. No. 37-7 ¶ 6.)  CNYPC residents can also request disposable plates\nand tableware that would be used only once and then discarded.  Id. ¶ 7.  Plaintiff has not made\nsuch a request.  Id.\nIn opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff admits that \"all\nbowls and utensils are washed and sanitized after use and before re-use and such washing is\n15\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 16 of 24\nconsistent with the tenets of the Muslim faith.\"  (Dkt. No. 37-1 ¶ 20; Dkt. No. 40 ¶ 9.)\nTherefore, Plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of fact that his sincerely held religious\nbeliefs have been burdened and I recommend that the Court dismiss Plaintiff's claim regarding\nthe contamination of bowls and utensils.  \n4. Food Issues\nPlaintiff alleges that his religion requires him to eat Halal foods and that Defendants\nviolated his constitutional rights by forcing him \"to eat meals issued for Christian and Catholic\nreligions, e.g.: Friday Muslims must eat fish as the church of Catholics require.\"  (Dkt. No. 1 at 5\n¶ 5.)  It is not entirely clear whether Plaintiff objects to the lack of a Halal menu or to the fact that\nfish is served on Fridays.  Defendants argue that serving fish on Fridays does not burden\nPlaintiff's religious beliefs and that they are not constitutionally required to provide an entirely\nHalal menu.  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 5-6.)  \na. Fish on Friday\nImam Najeeullah declares that \"[f]ish is an acceptable food for a Muslim diet and the\nservice of fish would violate no tenet of our faith.\"  (Dkt. No. 37-5 ¶ 21.)  Plaintiff admits in his\nreply papers that fish is a permissible food under Islamic law.  (Dkt. No. 40 ¶ 8.)  Therefore,\nPlaintiff has not raised a triable issue of fact that his sincerely held religious beliefs were\nburdened by the fact that fish was served on Fridays at CNYPC and I recommend that the Court\ngrant Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the claim that CNYPC's practice\nof serving fish on Fridays violated Plaintiff's rights under the Free Exercise Clause or RLUIPA.15  \n15 Plaintiff may also be asserting an Establishment Clause claim regarding the\nservice of fish on Fridays.  Any such claim would be subject to dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim.  See Travillion v. Leon, 248 Fed. App'x 353, 355-56 (3d Cir. 2007) (affirming trial court's\n16\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 17 of 24\nb. Halal Foods\n Plaintiff may also be claiming that Defendants violated his free exercise and RLUIPA\nrights because CNYPC does not offer a Halal menu.  (Dkt. No. 1 at 5 ¶ 5.)  Defendants move for\nsummary judgment of this claim.  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 5-6.)\nThe Second Circuit has \"clearly established that a prisoner has a right to a diet consistent\nwith his or her religious scruples.\"  Ford, 352 F.3d at 597.  However, \"[a]ll that is required for a\nprison diet not to burden an inmate's free exercise of religion is the provision of a diet sufficient\nto sustain the prisoner's good health without violating [his religion's] dietary laws.\"  Muhammad\nv. Warithu-Deen Umar, 98 F. Supp. 2d 337, 344 (W.D.N.Y. 2000) (citing Abdul-Malik v. Goord,\nNo. 07 Civ. 4584, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2047, 1997 WL 83402, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27,\n1997)).16  \nDefendants assert that meals at CNYPC \"do not violate any tenets of the Muslim faith.\" \n(Dkt. No. 37-1 ¶ 19.)  For this proposition, Defendants cite the declarations of Valerie Fasteson\nand Imam Najeeullah.  Id.  Neither of the declarations cited by Defendants show that CNYPC\nmeals do not violate Muslim dietary laws.  Ms. Fasteson declares that \"[a]lthough the dietary\nservice does not serve a strictly Halal diet, we do serve meals that are not violative of Muslim\ntenets.  We do serve an alternative diet that, upon information and belief and based on the\ndeclaration of Imam Najeeullah . . . , does accommodate the Muslim faith.  This would include\n12(b)(6) dismissal of claim that jail's service of vegetarian menu during Lent violated Protestant\ninmate's rights under the Establishment Clause).\n16 The Court will provide Plaintiff with a copy of this unpublished decision in\naccordance with the Second Circuit’s decision in LeBron v. Sanders, 557 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2009).\n \n17\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 18 of 24\nan option that would insure a pork free diet.\"  (Dkt. No. 37-7 ¶ 5.)  Imam Najeeullah's declaration\ndoes not state that CNYPC's alternative diet accommodates the Muslim faith.  Rather, Imam\nNajeeullah merely states that fish in an acceptable food for a Muslim diet and that \"the Halal diet\nis important to a Muslim's faith . . . I will work with CNYPC staff to try and find ways to make a\nHalal diet possible.\"  (Dkt. No. 37-5 ¶¶ 21-22.)  These vague declarations stand in stark contrast\nto the evidence presented in a case cited by Defendants,  Majid v. Fischer, No. 07 Civ. 4584,\n2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71616 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 31, 2009).17  There, the defendants provided the\ncourt with a report from an Imam explicitly stating that the pork-free menu offered by DOCS was\n\"adequate and sufficient for Muslims under Islamic law and does not require Muslims to choose\nbetween violating their religious practice or starving.\"  Majid, Dkt. No. 37-10 at 8.  \nMoreover, Defendants have not provided the Court with enough evidence to establish as a\nmatter of law that CNYPC provides a pork-free diet that is sufficient to sustain Plaintiff's good\nhealth.  Indeed, the only reference in the record to the nutritional quality of the alternative menu\nis one sentence in the Inpatient Operations Manual stating that CNYPC's pork-free diet \"meets\n100 percent of the RDA.\"  (Defs.' Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 37-4 at 24.)  Defendants do not note this fact in\ntheir memorandum of law or ask the Court to draw any conclusions from it.   \n  Additionally, Defendants have not provided any evidence regarding the legitimate\npenological or compelling interests supporting the menu at CNYPC.  Although Defendants cite\ncases upholding DOCS' menu in the face of First Amendment and RLUIPA challenges by\nMuslim inmates, Defendants have not provided the Court with any evidence that CNYPC's menu\n17 Defendants served a copy of this unpublished decision on Plaintiff with their\nsummary judgment papers.  (Dkt. No. 37-10.)\n18\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 19 of 24\nis similar to DOCS' or that it is driven by similar penological interests.  In contrast to the dearth\nof detail here, the defendants in Majid provided the court with a declaration describing in detail\nthe number of inmates who needed to be fed in the DOCS system, the nutritional and religious\nfactors that DOCS considered in formulating menus, the cost of providing a pork-free (but non-\nHalal) menu as compared with the regular menu, and the problems associated with obtaining\nHalal meats.  Thus, I find that Defendants have not established, as a matter of law, that CNYPC\nprovided Plaintiff with a diet sufficient to maintain his good health without violating Muslim\ndietary laws.  Therefore, I recommend that the Court deny Defendants' motion for summary\njudgment dismissing this claim.    \n5. Classes on Fridays and Denial of Sacred Foods on Holidays\nDefendant's motion for summary judgment does not address Plaintiff's claims that (1)\nbeing required to attend classes on Fridays violates his religious rights; or (2) Defendants\nviolated Plaintiff's religious rights by denying him sacred foods on holidays.  Therefore, I find\nthat the claims should survive Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\nB. DUE PROCESS CLAIM\nPlaintiff claims that Defendants violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to\ndue process.  (Dkt. No. 1 at 7.)  Regarding the due process issue, Plaintiff's complaint states only\nthat \"Plaintiff has not d[one] anything to lose his right[s] afforded by the\" First Amendment.  Id. \nDefendants argue that the complaint fails to state a due process claim.  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 6-7.) \nDefendants are correct.  Plaintiff's due process claim simply duplicates his free exercise and\nRLUIPA claims.  See Velez v. Levy, 401 F.3d 75, 94 (2d Cir.2005) (“[W]here a specific\nconstitutional provision prohibits government action, plaintiffs seeking redress for that prohibited\n19\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 20 of 24\nconduct in a § 1983 suit cannot make reference to the broad notion of substantive due process.”). \nTherefore, I recommend that the Court grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment\ndismissing Plaintiff's due process claim.   \nC. EIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\nPlaintiff claims that Defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights.  (Dkt. No. 1 at 8.) \nDefendants argue that the complaint fails to state an Eighth Amendment claim.  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at\n6-7.)  Defendants are correct.\n The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits “cruel and unusual”\npunishments.  The word “punishment” refers not only to deprivations imposed as a sanction for\ncriminal wrongdoing, but also to deprivations suffered during imprisonment.  Estelle v. Gamble,\n429 U.S. 97, 102-03 (1976).  Punishment is “cruel and unusual” if it involves the unnecessary\nand wanton infliction of pain or if it is incompatible with “the evolving standards of decency that\nmark the progress of a maturing society.”  Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102.  To satisfy the objective\ncomponent of an Eighth Amendment claim,  a prisoner must show that the defendant’s “act or\nomission ... result[ed] in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.” \nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 834.  Therefore, “extreme deprivations are required to make out a\nconditions-of-confinement claim.”  Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9 (1992).  To satisfy the\nsubjective component, the defendant’s behavior must be “wanton.”  Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S.\n312, 320 (1986).  Where a prisoner claims that a defendant provided inadequate conditions of\nconfinement, he must show that the defendant acted with “deliberate indifference.”  Wilson v.\nSeiter, 501 U.S. 294, 302-03 (1991).  A prison official demonstrates deliberate indifference to\ninhumane conditions of confinement where he “knows of and disregards an excessive risk to\n20\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 21 of 24\ninmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could\nbe drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” \nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  \nHere, Plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of fact that Defendants deprived him of the\nminimal civilized measure of life's necessities or that they knew of and disregarded an excessive\nrisk to Plaintiff's health or safety.  Therefore, I recommend that the Court grant Defendants'\nmotion for summary judgment of Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment claim.  \nD. PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT BY DEFENDANT HOGAN\nDefendants argue that any claims against Defendant Hogan should be dismissed because\nPlaintiff has failed to allege that Defendant Hogan was personally involved in any constitutional\nviolation.  (Dkt. No. 37-8 at 7-8.)  Defendants are correct.\nUnder Second Circuit precedent, “‘personal involvement of defendants in alleged\nconstitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under § 1983.'\"  Wright v.\nSmith, 21 F.3d 496, 501 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting Moffitt v. Town of Brookfield, 950 F.2d 880, 885\n(2d Cir. 1991)).  In order to prevail on a Bivens cause of action against an individual, a plaintiff\nmust show some tangible connection between the unlawful conduct and the defendant.  Bass v.\nJackson, 790 F.2d 260, 263 (2d Cir. 1986).  If the defendant is a supervisory official, a mere\n“linkage” to the unlawful conduct through “the prison chain of command” (i.e., under the\ndoctrine of respondeat superior) is insufficient to show his or her personal involvement in that\nunlawful conduct.  Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325 (1981); Richardson v. Goord, 347\nF.3d 431, 435 (2d Cir. 2003); Wright, 21 F.3d at 501; Ayers v. Coughlin, 780 F.2d 205, 210 (2d\nCir. 1985).  In other words, supervisory officials may not be held liable merely because they held\n21\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 22 of 24\na position of authority.  Black v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 72, 74 (2d Cir. 1996).  Rather, supervisory\npersonnel may be considered “personally involved” if they (1) directly participated in the\nviolation, (2) failed to remedy that violation after learning of it through a report or appeal, (3)\ncreated, or allowed to continue, a policy or custom under which the violation occurred, (4) had\nbeen grossly negligent in managing subordinates who caused the violation, or (5) exhibited\ndeliberate indifference to the rights of inmates by failing to act on information indicating that the\nviolation was occurring.18  Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995).\nHere, the complaint does not mention Defendant Hogan at all other than in the caption\nand the list of parties.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  In response to interrogatories from Plaintiff, Defendant\nSawyer stated that he could not recall Defendant Hogan making any inquiry about Plaintiff's\nMarch 18 complaint.  (Dkt. No. 33-2 at 19.)  Thus, the complaint fails to plausibly suggest, and\nthe evidence fails to raise a triable issue, that Defendant Hogan was personally involved in any\nalleged constitutional violation.  Therefore, I recommend that the Court dismiss Plaintiff's claims\nagainst Defendant Hogan.      \nIV. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 33) focuses entirely on the lack of Al\nJumu'ah services at CNYPC.  I have discussed all of the evidence submitted by Plaintiff\n18 In Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949, the Supreme Court ruled that where the underlying\nconstitutional claim is a claim of intentional discrimination, a supervisory official's liability must\nbe judged by the official's own purpose rather than the official's knowledge of subordinates'\nactions or policies.  The Second Circuit has not yet issued a decision discussing Iqbal's effect on\nthe Colon categories.  Several district courts in the Second Circuit have determined that Iqbal\nnullified some of the Colon categories.  See Sash v. United States, 674 F. Supp. 2d 531, 543-44\n(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (collecting cases).  I will assume for the purposes of this motion that the Colon\ncategories remain good law.  \n22\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 23 of 24\nregarding this issue above, in Section III(A)(2).  In analyzing Plaintiff's motion for summary\njudgment, I must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in Defendants' favor. \nMajor League Baseball Props., Inc., 542 F.3d at 309.  Although, as discussed above, Defendants\nhave not provided the Court with sufficient evidence to support summary judgment in their favor\non the Al Jumu'ah issue, they have provided sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact.  A\nreasonable juror could find that Defendants had a legitimate penological or a compelling interest\nfor the decision not to hold Al Jumu'ah services at the proper time.  Therefore, I recommend that\nthe Court deny Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.      \nACCORDINGLY, it is\nRECOMMENDED that Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 37) be\nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  I recommend that the Court grant\nDefendants' motion and dismiss the following claims: (1) the free exercise and RLUIPA claims\nregarding the use of bowls and utensils; (2) the free exercise and RLUIPA claims regarding\nCNYPC's practice of serving fish on Fridays; (3) any Establishment Clause claim regarding\nCNYPC's practice of serving fish on Fridays; (4) the due process claim; (5) the Eighth\nAmendment claim; and (6) all claims against Defendant Hogan; and it is further\nRECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 33) be\nDENIED; and it is further\nRECOMMENDED that the following claims survive the pending motions: (1) the free\nexercise and RLUIPA claims regarding the lack of Al Jumu'ah services at CNYPC; (2) the free\nexercise and RLUIPA claims regarding the lack of a Halal menu at CNYPC; (3) the claim\nregarding CNYPC's requirement that Plaintiff attend classes on Fridays; and (4) the claim that\n23\n\nCase 9:09-cv-00214-GHL   Document 42   Filed 12/23/10   Page 24 of 24\nDefendants denied Plaintiff sacred foods on holidays.  The parties should be prepared, in further\nproceedings, to fully brief whether the legitimate Penological interest or the compelling\ngovernment interest test should be applied to this case; and it is further\nORDERED that the Clerk provide Plaintiff with copies of  Carney v. Hogan, No. 9:08-\nCV-1251 (DNH/ATB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59439, 2010 WL 2519121 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 30,\n2010); Lombardo v. Holanchock, No. 07 Civ. 8674, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48753, 2008 WL\n2543573 (S.D.N.Y. June 25, 2008); Abdul-Matiyn v. Pataki, No. 9:06-CV-1503, 2008 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 118430, 2008 WL 974409 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2008); Jackson v. Boucaud, No. 9:08-CV-\n1373 (TJM/DEP), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125893, 2009 WL 6066799 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 31, 2009);\nVega v. Lantz, No. 304CV1215DFM, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88550, 2009 WL 3157586 (D.

Sanders, 557 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2009). \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), the parties have fourteen days within which to file\nwritten objections to the foregoing report.  Such objections shall be filed with the Clerk of the\nCourt.  FAILURE TO OBJECT TO THIS REPORT WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS WILL\nPRECLUDE APPELLATE REVIEW.  Roldan v.
