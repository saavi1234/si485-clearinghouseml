          "description": "MINUTE ENTRY. Teleconference held before the Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey on October 3, 2019 regarding a discovery dispute as to whether Defendants should provide Plaintiffs with a blood sample for one of the named Plaintiffs, Jamerson, for testing by an independent laboratory to determine if he has HCV. Defendants objected to the request on several grounds. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs should have moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35 because Rule 34 cannot be used to request a document that cannot exist. Second, Defendants have already conducted the test and the results twice indicated that Jamerson does not have HCV. Plaintiffs have not suggested that there is any basis to doubt the authenticity or veracity of the test results. Third, the request would lead the parties down a slippery slope. If Plaintiffs ask for additional testing for all of the class members, it would create enormous inefficiencies. Plaintiffs explained that Jamerson was first tested in 2015 and was told at the that time that he had chronic Hepatitis C. Viral load testing was first conducted in 2017, and that testing indicated that he did not have Hepatitis C. Plaintiffs are not asking at this time that the test be conducted for all class members; they are asking only that one of the three named plaintiffs be tested because of the unique circumstances. Plaintiffs argued that Defendants should not be allowed to dictate how Plaintiffs conduct discovery. Plaintiffs argued also that Defendants would not have been content to rely on an opposing experts findings without independently confirming them. Plaintiffs argued that they need not rely on Rule 35 to procure the blood sample because Rule 34 applies to tangible things. Plaintiffs noted that Defendants have not articulated any burden that would arise from providing the requested blood samplePlaintiffs have arranged for the testing and payment. Finally, Plaintiffs noted that the information Plaintiffs seek is relevant to Jamersons status as a class representative and his damagesissues that may be addressed in upcoming mediation. When asked by the Court whether they would prefer to proceed pursuant to Rule 35, with DOC transporting Jamerson to the laboratory of Plaintiffs choosing for testing, waiting while his blood sample is taken, and then transporting him back to the prison, or pursuant to Rule 34, with Corizon drawing a sample of Jamersons blood for transportation to a lab of Plaintiffs choosing, counsel for both Corizon and DOC agreed that, if the Court were to order one of the two measures, the latter would be preferable. The Court ordered Corizon to produce a blood sample from Mr. Jamerson on or before October 11, 2019. Plaintiffs are to arrange for the sample to be collected by the laboratory of their choice. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within 48 hours as to when the sample shall be collected, they are to contact the court on October 7, 2019 to arrange a teleconference. The Court noted that its ruling today is limited to the specific issue of Mr. Jamersons blood sample for HCV testing. Todays ruling does not reflect the Courts position as to whether similar discovery would be available for any other class member, or whether any such discovery would be available under Rule 34 or Rule 35.

Ms. Henthorne informed the Court that the parties have finalized the terms for the class settlement, but they anticipate that it will take until mid-July to finalize the settlement for the named Plaintiffs both because the parties continue to work on one material provision in the written agreements and because of the logistics of procuring the signature of one plaintiff who is incarcerated out of state. The Court ordered the parties to contact the Court within seven days if there are any substantive, material issues that preclude a meeting of the minds. The Court will check back with the parties by the end of July to see if everything has been completed. Appearances: Plaintiff by Anastasia Pastan, Elizabeth Henthorne, Meghan Cleary and Amy Breihan. Defendant MODOC by Jennifer Baumann. Defendant Corizon by Bill Lunsford and Matt Reeves. CRD: Renea Matthes Mitra. Court Reporter: None. This is a TEXT ONLY ENTRY. No document is attached.

The motion is granted with respect to Defendant Corizon's request to exceed the 15 page limitation. Therefore, each defendant's response to Plaintiffs' motion to certify shall not exceed 20 pages. The motion is denied with respect to the request for an additional 14-day extension in light of the Court's Order, Doc. 99, which provided that no further extensions would be granted for this deadline absent extraordinary circumstances. Although Defendant had an opportunity to raise concerns about the motion to certify's briefing schedule during the Court's scheduling phone conference on 2/1, Defendant did not identify any scheduling problems at that time. Now, as support for its requested extension, Defendant states its affiant was out of the country. But, the Court is not persuaded that this constitutes an extraordinary circumstance, and Defendant has failed to convince the Court that there were no other reasonable avenues available to it, which would have allowed it to complete its response within the time permitted. Signed on 2/23/2017 by District Judge Nanette K. Laughrey. This is a TEXT ONLY ENTRY. No document is attached.(Specker, Suzanne) (Entered: 02/23/2017)"

          "description": "MINUTE ENTRY. Teleconference held before the Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey on August 9, 2019. Argument presented on Defendants' Motion for Testimony via Videoconference, Doc. 329 . Mr. Lunsford offered, in the alternative, to produce Dr. Koretz in person on Monday, August 19, 2019. The Court denied Defendants' motion and ordered Defendants to arrange for Dr. Koretz to appear in the courtroom on Friday, August 16, 2019, by noon. The Court stated that another teleconference will be held at 5:00 p.m. if Defendants are unable to arrange for Dr. Koretz to testify in person on Friday. The Court instructed the parties to discuss and plan the order and timing of their witnesses to ensure that there are no gaps in time between any given witnesses. Defendants raised an objection concerning Plaintiffs plan to present the deposition testimony or declarations of seven previously-undisclosed experts. Plaintiffs argued that Defendants' motion to present Dr. Gerrity's testimony prompted their designation of the seven experts' testimony or declarations. The Court ruled that it will permit Plaintiffs to present the testimony or declarations of the previously-undisclosed experts only insofar as the material is offered for the purpose of rebuttal. However, if Plaintiffs cannot establish that the material is properly presented for the purpose of rebuttal, it will not be allowed because of the timing of Plaintiffs' disclosure. The Court expects to hold Court from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m, except that the Court granted the parties' request to begin at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, August 14, 2019, in order to accommodate one expert's schedule conflict that afternoon. Appearances: Plaintiffs by Amy Breihan, Jessie Steffan and Amelia Frenkel. Defendant MDOC by David Dean, Jennifer Baumann and Jason Lewis. Defendant Corizon by William Lunsford and Matthew Reeves.

Section III.G of the Settlement Agreement states under the Enforcement header: \"If any Party believes that a dispute exists relating to the provisions of this Agreement, then such Party shall notify the other Parties in writing, describing the dispute. The Parties shall engage in good-faith negotiations and attempt to resolve the dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of the written notification, then they shall mediate their dispute with Nancy Kenner, Kenner Nygaard DeMarea Kendall, LLC, 117 West 20th Street, Suite 201, Kansas City, Missouri 64108, or a mutually agreeable mediator if Ms. Kenner is unavailable, at a mutually agreeable date and time. If, through mediation, the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute, then a Partys sole and exclusive remedy is to seek enforcement in a single (and no other) jurisdiction and venue: Missouri State Court, Cole County.\" Plaintiff is bound by the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Because the Settlement Agreement sets out the procedure for enforcement and provides that the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, is the forum for any court challenge relating to the enforcement of the Settlement Agreements provisions, this Court is not the proper forum to address Plaintiffs request. Plaintiffs motion, Doc. 576, is denied without prejudice. Signed on 4/9/2021 by District Judge Nanette K. Laughrey. This is a TEXT ONLY ENTRY. No document is attached.

          "description": "MINUTE ENTRY. Teleconference held before the Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey on June 28, 2019, regarding Defendants' motion for scheduling order, Doc. 295 . Defendants request to take the depositions of Plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Moseley, Dr. Thedinger, and Dr. Olsen, prior to the hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs object to delay of the hearing but do not object to the limited discovery requested. The Court, based in large part on Defendants' representation that the preliminary injunction requested is in effect a request for a permanent injunction, granted Defendants' request to depose Plaintiffs' three experts. If, however, Defendants seek to redepose these witnesses at a later date, resulting in duplicative work and costs, reasonable costs will be shifted to the Defendants. The Court, accommodating the schedule of defendant Corizon's lead counsel, set the preliminary injunction hearing for August 12, 2019. Plaintiffs estimate that it will take 1-2 days to present evidence. Defendants estimate 2-3 days to present evidence. All depositions shall be completed in a timely manner so that the parties will be ready for the hearing on August 12, 2019. Defendants shall file their opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction no later than August 8, 2019. Any written reply shall be filed by the hearing date. The Court will take all briefing with the hearing. Appearances: Plaintiffs by Anthony Rothert, Gillian Wilcox, Jessie Steffan, Anastasia Pastan, Amelia Frenkel, and Meghan Cleary. Defendant MDOC by David Dean and Jennifer Baumann. Defendant Corizon by William Lunsford. Defendants Aguilera, Williams, Stamps, Pryor, Proctor, Hardman, Davison, Jones, Stieferman, Bredeman, Fipps, Cofield, Rucker, Campbell, Baker, Wilhite, Boley, Yates, and Julie by Carrie Kinsella.

    "summary": "<p>On July 14, 2016, a person incarcerated at the Missouri Department of Corrections (MDOC) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, alleging that he had received inadequate medical care from the MDOC for a chronic Hepatitis C (HCV) viral infection. The plaintiff originally filed on his own, but the ACLU of Missouri and MacArthur Justice Center began representing him and on December 15, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint seeking to proceed as a class action lawsuit. Plaintiff sued the Missouri Department of Corrections and Corizon, LLC, the healthcare provider for all MDOC facilities, under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiff additionally sued the director of MDOC and individual medical practitioners at MDOC facilities. Plaintiff claimed that defendants violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by failing to provide the medically acceptable care to inmates with the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Specifically, he claimed (a) that defendants failed to provide all inmates with HCV the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drug treatment, which is approved by the FDA and has been shown to cure 90% of HCV cases; and (b) that defendants utilized outdated and ineffective diagnostic techniques in determining whether or not to treat a patient with symptoms of HCV. Plaintiff further claimed that defendants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by discriminating against incarcerated people with HCV.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff sought relief for members of a putative class comprising over 5,000 prisoners in custody of MDOC who have been or will be diagnosed with HCV but who are not provided treatment with DAA drugs. Plaintiff wanted a declaration that the withholding of DAA drugs from defendants was unconstitutional and additionally sought an injunction to require defendants to formulate and implement a plan that meets the prevailing standard of care for HCV diagnosis and treatment. Plaintiff further sought monetary relief in the form of the costs of the suit and attorney fees and litigation expenses. The case was before United States District Judge Nanette Laughrey.</p>\r\n<p>On February 21, 2017, MDOC defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In their motion to dismiss, MDOC defendants claimed that plaintiff had failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim because he had no constitutional right to obtain the course of treatment demanded (DAAs). Additionally, defendants claimed that the plaintiff failed to state an ADA claim since ADA claims cannot be based on medical treatment decisions.</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, 2017, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part MDOC defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. The Court denied defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiff&rsquo;s Eighth Amendment claims on the grounds that the plaintiff had demonstrated both a serious medical need for prompt treatment with DAAs and deliberate indifference on the part of defendants to plaintiff's serious need for medical treatment. It also denied defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiff's ADA claims, finding that the plaintiff had plausibly alleged claims under the ADA and that defendants had not shown adequate evidence to dismiss at that point. The Court did grant the motion to dismiss with respect to specific counts for individual MDOC employees on qualified immunity grounds, and also with respect to certain damages claims against state officials in their official capacity on Eleventh Amendment grounds. 2017 WL 1968317.</p>\r\n<p>On July 26, 2017, Judge Laughrey granted class certification, certifying a class of \"all those individuals in the custody of MDOC, now or in the future, who have been, or will be, diagnosed with chronic HCV, as that term is defined medically, but who are not provided treatment with direct acting antiviral drugs.\" 2017 WL 3185155. The defendants sought permission to appeal under Rule 23(f) and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted permission in September 2017. The parties then moved to stay proceedings in the District Court pending the Court of Appeal's resolution of the certification appeal, and the District Court stayed proceedings on October 27, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>On December 6, 2018, the Court of Appeals (Circuit Judges Erickson, Wollman, and Kelly) affirmed the judgment of the District Court granting class certification. 910 F.3d 1030. Then, the Court of Appeals issued an order denying a motion to rehear the case en banc on January 11, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, 2019, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to implement a policy that complied with the standard of care for inmates with chronic HCV infection, as set forth in the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. From August 13, 2019 to August 16, 2019 the court held a hearing concerning the preliminary injunction motion.</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued to engage in mediation discussions. On May 11, 2020, Judge Laughrey entered a stay for 60 days because the parties had \"made progress in their efforts to resolve the dispute.\"</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, the parties submitted a joint motion for a settlement agreement on August 25, 2020. The settlement provided for opt-out antibody testing at intake, meaning that everyone incarcerated in MDOC facilities would be tested for Hepatitis C unless they affirmatively chose not to be tested. The settlement also stated that RNA tests would be conducted for people with positive antibody tests to determine whether the Hepatitis C infection is active or has cleared. If an incarcerated individual were to be identified as having an active infection, they would be enrolled in the Hepatitis C chronic care clinic. Direct Acting Antiviral treatment was also guaranteed to be provided to class members through a priority-based system in line with current Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) categorizations.&nbsp; MDOC would treat at least 15 people per quarter, starting with those designated \"Priority 1.\" The agreement further required educational materials to be provided to all persons in MDOC custody. Finally, the defendants agreed to pay attorneys' fees of $375,000.&nbsp; MDOC was to provide quarterly reports to plaintiffs' counsel.&nbsp; Pursuant to the agreement, any action for enforcement was to be filed in state court; upon final approval of the settlement agreement, the federal court action would be terminated.&nbsp; The agreement was slated to last \"through the full term of the medical services contract that MDOC intend[ed] to award with a starting date of July 1, 2021.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Various class members filed objections, but these objections were uniformly dismissed by the court. On October 28, 2020, after a hearing was conducted, the court approved the settlement agreement.&nbsp; This case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

Kennedy to enlist the private bar’s leadership and \nresources  in  combating  racial  discrimination  and  the  resulting  inequality  of \nopportunity.    The  Lawyers’  Committee’s  principal  mission  is  to  secure  equal \njustice  for  all  through  the  rule  of  law,  targeting  in  particular  the  inequities \nconfronting  African  Americans  and  other  racial  and  ethnic  minorities.    The \nLawyers’  Committee  has  a  particular  interest  in  this  case  because  African \nAmericans  and  other  minorities  make  up  a  disproportionate  percentage  of  the \npersons  suffering  from  chronic  hepatitis  C  and  are  thus  disproportionately \nimpacted by Defendants’ policies.1 \nBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThis  action  is  one  of  the  growing  number  of  cases  raising  the  issue  of \nwhether  prisoners  with  chronic  hepatitis  C  who  are  denied  treatment  as  a \nconsequence of an institutional policy may properly be certified as a class.2  It is \n                                           \n1 Pursuant to Fed.

This recent increase in such cases is not a \ncoincidence—rather, it is the direct result of recent revolutionary advances in the \ntreatment  of  the  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV).    The  discovery  of  new,  remarkably \neffective direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs has led not only to positive changes in \nmedical outcomes that were previously impossible to achieve, but also to changes \nin  treatment  guidelines  and  health  care  policies  and  practices.    Since  the \nrevolutionary introduction of DAA drugs, standard-of-care guidelines have shifted, \nMedicaid providers have expanded their treatment coverage, prison systems have \naltered their policies, foreign governments have instituted programs to cure the \ndisease, and as here, parties have begun challenging outmoded treatment policies \nand practices through litigation.   \nThe sea-change in HCV treatment is transforming the applicable standard of \ncare  and  access  to  HCV  treatment.    The  sweeping  nature  of  these  widely \nrecognized  treatment  advances  underscores  that  Defendants’  failure  to  provide \nsuch treatment to any but a handful of prisoners can be explained only as being the \n                                                                                                                                        \nMass. filed June 10, 2015); Chimenti et al. v.

Hepatitis  C  is  a  contagious  liver  disease \nresulting from HCV infection that has devastating effects on its patient population.  \nFor every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 75 to 85 develop chronic \nhepatitis C, a long-term illness that can lead to serious liver problems including \ncirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.3  Out of that same 100 persons, 60 \nto 70 will develop chronic liver disease, 5 to 20 will develop cirrhosis, and 1 to 5 \nwill die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis).4   \nAn estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million people in the United States have chronic \nhepatitis C, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates \nthat, in 2014, there were 19,659 deaths with HCV as an underlying or contributing \ncause.5  In May 2016, the CDC reported that hepatitis C kills more Americans than \nany  other  infectious  disease,  including  HIV.6    Chronic  hepatitis  C \ndisproportionately  affects  incarcerated  individuals,  with  conservative  research \n                                           \n3 CDC, Hepatitis C FAQs for the Public, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/cfaq.htm (last visited Feb. 6, 2018).  \n4 CDC, Hepatitis C FAQs for Health Professionals, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm (last visited Feb. 6, 2018).  \n5 Id. \n6 CDC, Hepatitis C Mortality, https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2016/hcv-\nmortality.html (last visited Feb. 6, 2018). \n3 \n\n \nestimating that hepatitis C is seven times more prevalent among prisoners than in \nthe general population.7  It also disproportionately impacts African Americans who \ncomprise  approximately  11%  of  the  U.S.  population  but  represent  25%  of  the \npeople with chronic HCV infections.8 \nARGUMENT \nI.  RECENT  DRUG  ADVANCEMENTS  HAVE  REVOLUTIONIZED \nHEPATITIS  C  TREATMENT,  BUT  ALMOST  NONE  OF \nMISSOURI’S  PRISONERS  WITH  HEPATITIS  C  RECEIVE  SUCH \nTREATMENT \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to established commonality because \nthe members of the class have disparate treatment needs.  (Appellants’ Br. at 19– \n26.)    This  is  an  incorrect  framing  of  the  common  question,  which  should  be \nwhether all class members are exposed to a uniform policy or practice that creates \nsubstantial risk of serious harm.  (See Appellees’ Br. at 26–42.)  Here, they are.  \nWith the recent introduction of DAA drugs, there has been a sea-change in HCV \ntreatment.  These revolutionary medicines have led to a new standard of care and \nevolving practices in Medicaid, foreign governments, and correctional facilities in \n                                           \n7 Pew Charitable Trusts, State Prison Health Care Spending at 9 (July 2014), \nhttp://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2014/07/stateprisonhealthcarespendingre\nport.pdf. \n8 Corinna Dan, Hepatitis C Disparities among African Americans, U.S. Dept. of \nHealth & Human Serv.

The  near-blanket  failure  to  provide  such  treatment  in \nMissouri’s prisons can be explained only as being the result of a systemwide policy \nby Defendants that is appropriately remedied on a classwide basis.  \nA.  The  Introduction  of  New  DAA  Drugs  Revolutionized  HCV \nTreatment \n  Prior to 2013, HCV treatment required “grueling shots” lasting six months to \na year and “pills that gave patients flu-like symptoms and still barely cured half of \nthem.”9    This  all  changed  beginning  in  December  2013  when  FDA  approved \nGilead’s Sovaldi, a DAA that marked the “advent of interferon-free treatments for \nhepatitis  C”  and  “a  landmark  shift  in  the  treatment  of  hepatitis  C.”10    Since \nDecember 2013, FDA has approved eight additional drugs to treat hepatitis C.  \nFDA calls these advances in HCV treatment “transformative.”11  Prior interferon-\nbased injection treatments lasted six months to a year, often made patients ill and \ngave them flulike symptoms, and cured only 40% to 50% of patients who were \n                                           \n9 Associated Press, FDA approves new drug to treat hepatitis C, (Aug. 4, 2017), \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-approves-mavyret-abbvie-drug-to-treat-\nhepatitis-c/.   \n10 Richard Knox, Treatments: FDA Expected To Approve New, Gentler Cure For \nHepatitis  C,  NPR  (Dec.  5,  2013),  https://www.npr.org/sections/health-\nshots/2013/12/05/248934833/fda-set-to-approve-hepatitis-drug. \n11 FDA, Hepatitis C Treatments Give Patients More Options, \nhttps://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm405642.htm  (last \nupdated May 4, 2017). \n5 \n\n \ntreated.12  New DAA drugs “double[d] the viral cure rates—90% to 100%—in just \nin  12  weeks’  time.”13    And  the  treatment  landscape  continues  to  improve  and \nchange.  One journal article speculates that we may eventually see single-tablet \nregimens lasting no more than 4 to 6 weeks.14  The Infectious Diseases Society of \nAmerica  (IDSA)  and  American  Association  for  the  Study  of  Liver  Diseases \n(AASLD) provide continually updated guidance for HCV treatment with the stated \ngoal “to provide up-to-date recommendations to healthcare practitioners” in part \nbecause  of  “the  rapid  evolution  of  highly  effective  antiviral  therapy  for  HCV \ninfection.”15 \nB.  The Standard of Care is that Nearly All Chronic HCV Patients \nShould be Treated \nWith the introduction of DAA drugs, the standard of care for HCV patients \nis that nearly all patients with chronic HCV infection should be treated.  This \nstandard is supported by the IDSA/AASLD Guidelines.  The CDC refers health \nprofessionals  to  the  IDSA/AASLD  guidelines  as  “evidence-based,  expert-\n                                           \n12 Id. \n13 Id. \n14 Brian P.

Therefore, the panel continues to recommend treatment for all \npatients with chronic HCV infection, except those with a short life expectancy that \n                                           \n16 CDC, Hepatitis C FAQs for Health Professionals, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm (last visited Feb. 6, 2018). \n17 AASLD/IDSA, HCV Guidance, About the Guidance, \nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org/about.  \n18 Id.  \n19 U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Serv., National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2017-\n2020 at 24 (Jan. 2017), available at \nhttps://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/National%20Viral%20Hepatitis%20Action\n%20Plan%202017-2020.pdf (emphasis added).  \n20 AASLD/IDSA, HCV Guidance, When and in Whom to Initiate HCV Therapy, \nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/when-whom (last updated Sept. 21, 2017) \n(emphasis added). \n7 \n\n \ncannot be remediated by HCV treatment, liver transplantation, or another directed \ntherapy.”21    With  regard  to  testing,  the  IDSA/AASLD  guidelines  recommend \nperiodic testing to “persons with ongoing risk factors for HCV exposure,” and one \nrisk exposure is incarceration.22 \nWith a revolutionary shift in available medicines and a standard of care that \nnearly all chronic HCV patients should be treated, health care coverage, policies, \nand practices have also started to transform in different areas: \nMedicaid Providers. Medicaid providers have been expanding DAA drug \ntreatment  coverage.

CORIZON,  MISSOURI’S  PRISON  HEALTHCARE  PROVIDER,  IS \nSINGLE-MINDEDLY FOCUSED ON COSTS \nIt  appears  to  be  no  accident  that  Defendants’  policies  and  practices  are \ndriven  by  Missouri’s  for-profit  provider,  Corizon.    As  a  private,  for-profit \ncompany, Corizon is “acutely aware of costs.”37  Corizon typically enters “full \nrisk”  contracts  with  state  corrections  systems,  by  which  Corizon  receives  a \npredetermined monetary amount, regardless of the extent to which Corizon’s on-\nsite services or other, off-site medical services are utilized.38  This suggests that, \nunlike  other  businesses,  cost  reduction  for  Corizon  does  not  mean  a  simple \ndecrease in operating expenses; cost-cutting for Corizon corresponds one-for-one \nwith a reduction in needed care.  Under this model, the less treatment inmates \nreceive, the greater the profit realized by Corizon.39   \nAs  a  matter  of  business  policy,  Corizon  spends  “significantly  less”  on \ntreatment  for  incarcerated  individuals  than  the  general  population  spends  per \n                                           \n37 Corizon “Provider Info Manual,” available at Norwood v.

To \nthe contrary, former CEO Rich Hallworth advertises: “We are the model because \nwe’ve been doing capitated rates since we’ve been in business.”41  Unfortunately, \nthere is a correlation between these rates and Corizon’s quality of treatment.  In \nfact, experts have testified that Corizon’s cost-centric model renders it “incapable \nof recognizing and responding to serious medical problems.”42   \nCorizon has a record of minimizing costs by denying prisoners treatment.  \nFor example, the recommended treatment for a patient with a symptomatic hernia \nis prompt surgical repair.43  Yet, in 2017, Corizon paid a class of current and \nformer Florida state prisoners $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit that challenged the \ncompany’s policy of refusing hernia surgeries “for the purpose of reducing costs \nand  increasing  profits.”44    Similarly,  Alabama  prisons—which  have  engaged \n                                           \n40 Beth Kutscher, Rumble over jailhouse healthcare, Modern Heathcare (Aug. 13, \n2013), available at \nhttp://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130831/MAGAZINE/308319891. \n41 Id. \n42 Confidential Rebuttal Report of Robert L.

Few people know, The Kansas City Star (Jan. 21, 2018), available at \nhttp://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article195673934.html. \n14 \n\n \nCorrections and Juvenile Justice has never “experienced a specific report in terms \nof Corizon or their performance in their contracts.”48 \nWhile research suggests effective management and oversight are critical to \nthe success of outsourcing prison health care services,49 Missouri has failed to \nimplement  this.    Instead,  Corizon  effectively  self-monitors,  directly  paying  the \nindividual in charge of oversight and, upon her departure, having a hand in looking \nfor her replacement.50  An expert physician who testifies in correctional medical \nmalpractices  cases  has  described  Corizon’s  policy  of  minimized  treatment  in \nMissouri and elsewhere as follows:  “They’re private, their goal is to make money, \nso  they  put  policies  in  place  that  aren’t  necessarily  (intended)  to  benefit  the \npatient.”51   \nDefendants’  brief  contends  that  Plaintiffs  have  overlooked  the  burdens \nassociated  with  individualized  treatment  and  the  corresponding  efforts  such \ntreatment would entail.  (Appellants’ Br. at 19–26.)  In other words, their primary \njustification is a veiled appeal to cost:  individualized treatment risks variation, \n                                           \n48 Id. \n49 See Pew Charitable Trusts, State Prison Health Care Spending at 13 (July 2014), \nhttp://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2014/07/stateprisonhealthcarespendingre\nport.pdf. \n50Andy Marso, What is $2 billion buying Kansas and Missouri in prison health \ncare?

This all but proves Plaintiffs’ point.  Defendants’ policies are \nrooted in a single-minded emphasis on cost, which is best addressed on a classwide \nbasis. \nIII.  COURTS  IN  SIMILAR  CASES  HAVE  CERTIFIED  PLAINTIFF \nCLASSES \nIn other similar cases around the country, courts have certified classes of \nprisoner plaintiffs challenging policies and practices as improperly denying serious \nmedical treatment for cost reasons.  For example, in Scott v. Clarke, the court \ncertified a class of female inmates who were denied treatment for “serious medical \nneeds,”  including  hepatitis  C,  because  “[t]he  essential  questions  in  this  case—\nquestions of fact and questions of law—do not vary among class members” and \ninclude  “whether  the  [state  DOC’s]  contract  system  permits  improper  cost \nconsiderations to interfere with treatment of serious medical conditions.”52  And in \nParsons v. Ryan, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district court order granting class \ncertification  for  Arizona  state  prisoners  suing  the  Arizona  Department  of \nCorrections (“ADC”) for “systemic deficiencies in ADC’s statewide health care \nsystem.”53    Among  the  evidence  considered  by  the  district  court  was  expert \ntestimony  that  a  “system-wide  practice  of  not  following  the  [ADC’s  formal] \n                                           \n52 61 F. Supp. 3d 569, 585 (W.D. Va. 2014). \n53 754 F.3d 657, 663 (9th Cir. 2014). \n16 \n\n \npolicies”  pervaded  because,  among  other  things,  defendants  “failed  to  provide \nadequate staffing, supervision and resources to promote compliance.”54  Later in \nthe  case  an  expert  report  described  how  Corizon,  one  of  ADC’s  health  care \nproviders, denied a prisoner standard medication for a serious chronic condition \n“due to cost.”55   \nThis  case  concerns  a  new  class  of  treatment  that  is  revolutionary,  but \nadmittedly expensive.  With near-perfect efficacy rates and shortening treatment \ncycles, the only conceivable reason Defendants’ treatment rates with the new drugs \nare so low is due to cost.  The statistics support this inference: as of January 2015, \nonly 5 out of 4,736 prisoners known to be infected with HCV were being treated,56 \nwhile  out  of  100  people  with  hepatitis  C,  60  to  70  will  develop  chronic  liver \ndisease, 5 to 20 will develop cirrhosis, and 1 to 5 will die from the consequences of \n                                           \n54 Id. at 669. \n55 Confidential Supplemental Report of Dr. Todd Randall Wilcox, M.D., at 17, \nParsons v.

A current federal program, for instance, \nallows eligible institutions, like hospitals, to receive steep discounts on hepatitis C \nand HIV medications.74  In light of these new developments—and amid a pending \nclass action alleging non-treatment for hepatitis C—the Tennessee Department of \nCorrections is taking steps to deliver treatment.75  Rejecting a bid by Corizon, \nTennessee awarded a contract to a medical provider that “approached Vanderbilt \nUniversity Medical Center about a partnership that would allow the department to \nreceive the favorable rates [for DAA drugs].”76 \n                                           \n73 Michelle Andrews, FDA’s approval of a cheaper drug for hepatitis C will likely \nexpand treatment, NPR (Oct. 4, 2017), https://www.npr.org/sections/health-\nshots/2017/10/04/555156577/fdas-approval-of-a-cheaper-drug-for-hepatitis-c-will-\nlikely-expand-treatment.   \n74 See Dave Boucher, New Tennessee prison health contract could top $473 \nmillion, points to Hepatitis C plan, Tennesean (Aug. 7, 2017), \nhttps://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/08/07/massive-new-tennessee-\nprison-health-contract-points-possible-hepatitis-c-partnership/546417001/.   \n75 Id. \n76 Id. \n22 \n\n \nRather than alleviate the spread of the hepatitis C epidemic, Defendants’ \nsystemic failure to treat HCV-positive inmates ensures that, upon release, these \nindividuals are sicker, less employable, and more reliant on government programs \nfor  treatment.77    Notably,  Defendants’  approach  also  has  a  disproportionately \nharmful  effect  on  minority  populations.    “Racial  and  ethnic  minority  persons \nappear to comprise the majority of HCV burden in U.S. correctional settings,”78 \nand African Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at more than five times the \nrate of whites.79 \nCases  with  such  sweeping  civil  rights  implications  and  public  health \nconsequences,  like  that  presently  before  the  Court,  are  precisely  the  kinds  of \nmatters suited for classwide resolution.  As the Supreme Court has emphasized, a \n“‘[c]ivil  rights  case[ ]  against  parties  charged  with  unlawful,  class-based \n                                           \n77 See Tianhua He, et al., Prevention of Hepatitis C by Screening and Treatment in \nUnited States Prisons, Ann.

The parties request this Court’s preliminary \napproval of a Private Settlement Agreement (the “Agreement”) reached between Defendants and \nthe  Class  certified  by  the  Court  of  inmates  in  the  custody  of  the  Missouri  Department  of \nCorrections (“MDOC”). Specifically, in their Joint Motion, the parties request that the Court: \n(a) preliminarily approve the Agreement;  \n(b) authorize and approve the form and manner of a Notice of Proposed Settlement, Right \nto Objection, and Fairness Hearing in Class Action Lawsuit (the “Notice”) to be sent to Class \nmembers;  \n(c) set the deadline for written submissions by Class members, who wish to be heard in \nfavor of or in objection to the Agreement;   \n(d) set a due date for briefs in support of approval of the Agreement; and  \n(e) set the date for a fairness hearing in accordance with Rule 23(e).  \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 1 of 50\n\n  The Court has preliminarily reviewed and evaluated the proposed Agreement and finds that \nit falls within the range of fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy so as to warrant the Court’s \npreliminary approval. Accordingly, the Joint Motion is GRANTED and the Court orders as \nfollows: \n1.  Preliminary Approval of the Agreement and Distribution of Notice \nTaking into account the applicable legal standards, the Court finds that the Agreement is \nworthy of the Class’s consideration. It falls within the range of possible approval, as required by \nRule 23.

Nothing in this order \nrequires Defendants to respond or provide legal advice to any Class member, or any other person \nor entity in connection with the Agreement.

This is a Court-ordered \nNotice. The purpose of this Notice is to inform you of a proposed settlement in the \nlawsuit, including your right to provide any favorable comments or objections to the \nproposed settlement, and the upcoming fairness hearing where the Court will consider the \nproposed settlement.  \nPlease read this Notice carefully, as your rights may be affected by this proposed \nsettlement agreement. \n1. WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT?\nThis is a class action lawsuit pending in federal district court. The case is known \nas Postawko v. MDOC, et al., Case No. 2:16-CV-4219-NKL. The people who sued are \ncalled the Plaintiffs, and the people they sued are called the Defendants. In this case, the \nDefendants are the Missouri Department of Corrections (MDOC) and its private medical \nprovider, Corizon LLC (Corizon). \nThe plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on July 14, 2016. Plaintiffs seek relief from the \nDefendants’ policies and practices regarding the treatment of Missouri inmates who have \nchronic hepatitis C. \nPostawko v. MDOC, et al., Case No. 2:16-CV-4219-NKL \nNotice of Proposed Settlement, Right to Object, and Fairness Hearing in Class Action Lawsuit  1 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 6 of 50\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides the following \nexplanation of hepatitis C: \nHepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus \n(HCV). Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus. Today, most people \nbecome infected with the hepatitis C virus by sharing needles \nor other equipment to inject drugs. For some people, hepatitis \nC is a short-term illness but for 70%–85% of people who \nbecome infected with the hepatitis C virus, it becomes a long-\nterm,  chronic  infection.  Chronic  hepatitis  C  is  a  serious \ndisease than can result in long-term health problems, even \ndeath. Many people might not be aware of their infection \nbecause they are not clinically ill.1 \nThe lawsuit seeks injunctive relief. It does not seek money damages on behalf of \nthe entire Class. Instead, it seeks injunctive relief. “Injunctive relief” means a court order \nthat prohibits the Defendants from doing something and/or directs the Defendants to do \nsomething. \n2. WHY AM I RECEIVING THIS NOTICE?\nThe Court has certified this lawsuit as a class action and decided that everyone \nwho fits the definition of the Class is a Class Member. The Class is defined as: \nAll those individuals in the custody of MDOC, now or in the \nfuture, who have been, or will be, diagnosed with chronic \nHCV,  as  that  term  is  defined  medically,  but  who  are  not \nprovided treatment with direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs). \nIf you fit this definition, you are automatically a Class Member and do not need to take \nany further action to be a part of this lawsuit. Since the lawsuit seeks only injunctive \nrelief, you cannot opt out of the Class. \nYou are receiving this Notice because there is a proposed settlement on behalf of \nthe entire Class, and you now have the chance to tell the Court whether you agree or \ndisagree, if you wish. \n3. WHAT DOES THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT PROVIDE?\nThe proposed settlement is summarized as follows: \n1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hepatitis C, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm \nPostawko v. MDOC, et al., Case No. 2:16-CV-4219-NKL \nNotice of Proposed Settlement, Right to Object, and Fairness Hearing in Class Action Lawsuit  2 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 7 of 50\n\n(1) Defendants agree to conduct opt-out antibody testing for all inmates at\nintake. beginning July 1, 2020. This means that all inmates will automatically be tested \nfor hepatitis C, unless they affirmatively choose not to be tested. \n(2) Defendants agree to immediately conduct RNA testing for those inmates\nwith positive antibody tests. An antibody test determines whether you have, at any time, \nbeen infected with the hepatitis C virus; the RNA test confirms whether the infection is \nactive, or has cleared. If the RNA test is positive, the inmate will be enrolled in the \nhepatitis C chronic care clinic. \n(3) Defendants agree to conduct RNA testing with the next scheduled blood\ndraw for every inmate with a positive antibody test who has not yet received an RNA test \nand will provide the inmate with a copy of their test results either on paper or via tablet. \n(4) Defendants will provide educational materials to inmates regarding the\nvirus and Defendants’ policies and procedures for treating hepatitis C, and will display \nposters that encourage HCV testing that will be posted on bulletin boards within the \nfacilities and on the offender television network. \n(5) Between now and June 30, 2021, Direct Acting Antiviral (“DAA”)\ntreatment will be provided to Class Members as follows: \n(a) Corizon, the current MDOC medical services vendor, will complete\nDAA treatment of all Priority 1 inmates identified as of January 1, 2021\n(as defined by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“FBOP”) Guidance2; the\ncurrent version of the Guidance defining Priority groups is attached here\nas Exhibit A).\n(b)Corizon will treat at least 15 inmates in a given quarter through the end\nof its contract on June 30, 2021. If all Priority 1 inmates are treated\nbefore June 30, 2021, Corizon will proceed to treat Priority 2 inmates,\nfollowed by Priority 3 inmates.\n(6) A new medical services contract will begin on July 1, 2021. The State of\nMissouri will require that the next MDOC medical services vendor agree to the following \nfor the duration of the contract (July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2028): \n(a) The vendor must conduct opt-out antibody testing for all inmates at\nintake and immediate RNA testing for all inmates with positive\n2 The current FBOP Guidance is also available online at  \nhttps://www.bop.gov/resources/pdfs/hcv_infection_20180906.pdf .

If the RNA test is positive, the inmate will be enrolled in \nthe HCV chronic care clinic.  \n(b)The vendor must spend at least $7 million per each fiscal year on DAA\nmedications, and must treat all Priority 1 inmates (as defined by the\nFBOP Guidance) regardless of whether those costs are in excess of $7\nmillion.\n(c) Inmates will be treated based upon FBOP Guidance, including\nGuidance regarding who receives treatment first and the\nrecommendation that an inmate have at least 181 days remaining on\nhis/her sentence to receive treatment. Those inmates that are HCV\npositive but are unable to be treated due to time remaining on their\nsentences will be provided referral information as part of reentry. If the\nFBOP Guidance is updated, the vendor will be required to follow the\nnewest FBOP Guidance for treatment.\n(d)The vendor will conduct a liver ultrasound every 6 months for all\nPriority 1 inmates as part of their Cirrhosis Chronic Care Clinic.\n(7) Defendants will provide Plaintiffs’ counsel with quarterly reports regarding\ncompliance with the agreement. \n(8) On-site medical staff will receive education/training regarding hepatitis C.\n(9) Defendants will pay attorneys’ fees and expenses to Class Counsel of\n$375,000 as well as reimburse Plaintiffs’ counsel for certain mediation expenses. \nIf you would like to obtain a full copy of the proposed settlement agreement, \nplease contact Class Counsel. Their contact information is in Section 5, below. You can \nalso see the entire proposed settlement agreement at Class Counsel’s website: <insert \nlink>. The settlement agreement will be posted no later than <date>. In addition, a copy \nof the settlement agreement will be available in the library of each MDOC facility.  \nPlease do not call District Judge Nanette K. Laughrey or the Clerk of the Court \nregarding the settlement agreement or this case. \n4. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\nBefore this proposed settlement agreement can be approved, the Court must \nconduct a fairness hearing. The Court has scheduled a fairness hearing for DATE in \nLOCATION. Following that hearing, the Court will decide whether or not it will \napprove the proposed settlement agreement. The settlement may be approved only if it is \nfair, reasonable, and adequate to the Class Members. \nPostawko v.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Clinical Guidance on Evaluation and Management of Chronic \nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection provides the most current BOP recommendations for the treatment of \nchronic HCV infection in the federal inmate population. As stated by the current American Association \nfor the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)  HCV Guidance, \nthe goal of treatment of HCV-infected persons is to:  \n…reduce all-cause mortality and liver-related health adverse consequences, including end-\nstage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, by the achievement of virologic cure as \nevidenced by a sustained virologic response. \nIn light of the rapidly changing HCV treatment landscape, review of the most recent \nrecommendations from AASLD/IDSA (see link below) is recommended. BOP Central Office Clinical \nstaff will continue to monitor this guidance and provide updates as necessary. \n Be sure to consult the BOP Health Management Resources website to determine the date of the most\nrecent update to this document:  http://www.bop.gov/resources/health care mngmtjsp.\n The AASLD/IDSA guidance is available at https://www.hcvguidelines.org. See the References section in\nthis document for a complete citation.\nIn general, the BOP promotes a modified test-and-treat strategy for HCV infection. The BOP-\nrecommended approach to evaluation and management of HCV includes five basic steps. \nSTEP 1:  Test for HCV infection with anti-HCV (HCV Ab) test. \nSee Section 2, Screening for HCV Infection.\n• All inmates\n• Diagnostic evaluation of other conditions\n• Upon inmate request\nSTEP 2:  Perform a baseline evaluation of inmates who are anti-HCV positive. \nSee Section 3, Initial Evaluation of Anti-HCV Positive Inmates.\n• Problem-focused history and physical exam\n• Lab tests – CBC, PT/INR, liver panel, serum creatinine and eGFR, hepatitis B serology\n(HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc), HIV serology, quantitative HCV RNA viral load with reflex\ntesting for HCV genotype\nSTEP 3:  Assess for hepatic cirrhosis/compensation and BOP priority criteria for treatment, \nif HCV RNA is detectable. \n• Assess for hepatic cirrhosis/compensation: Calculate APRI score if no obvious cirrhosis;\nCalculate Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score if cirrhosis is known or suspected ( Section 4).\n• Assess for BOP priority criteria for treatment of HCV ( Section 5).\nSTEP 4:  Perform a pretreatment assessment, if priority criteria for treatment are met. \n• Determine the most appropriate direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen(s)\nDAA regimen selection is based on HCV genotype, cirrhosis, compensated or\n►\nuncompensated liver disease, prior treatment history, presence of resistance associated\nsubstitutions, and drug interactions ( Appendix 1 and Appendix 2).\nRefer to AASLD HCV guidance, DHHS antiretroviral guidelines, and manufacturers’\n►\nprescribing information for specific drug interactions ( References).\n• Obtain pretreatment labs within 90 days of starting treatment ( Appendix 3).\n• Submit Nonformulary Request (NFR) for Hepatitis C Treatment Algorithm; if approved, submit\nNFR(s) for specific DAA medication(s) ( Appendix 6).\n• Provide preventive health care for patients with cirrhosis.\nSTEP 5:  Monitor patient during and after treatment. \n• Start treatment with approved DAA regimen.\n• Follow monitoring schedule described in Appendix 3.\n1 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 18 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \n2. SCREENING FOR HCV INFECTION\nINMATE HISTORY AND PATIENT EDUCATION \nA health history should be obtained from all newly incarcerated BOP inmates. In addition, these \ninmates should be provided with educational information regarding prevention and transmission, \nrisk factors, testing, and medical management of HCV infection, in accordance with BOP policy. \nHealth education efforts should make use of the BOP peer-oriented video on infectious diseases, \nStaying Alive, located in Section 5: A–Z Topics on the HSD Infection Control website. \nSCREENING CRITERIA \nTesting for HCV infection is recommended for (a) all inmates, (b) all inmates with certain clinical \nconditions, and (c) all inmates who request testing. \na. RISK FACTORS FOR SENTENCED INMATES\nAn OPT OUT strategy of voluntary testing for HCV infection is recommended for all inmates,\nregardless of sentencing status, including new intakes and those already in population who\nhave not been previously tested. An “opt out” approach involves an informed refusal of\ntesting, rather than informed consent  (or “opt in”) for testing. After informing a patient of the\nindications and plan for testing, the particular test is ordered and performed—unless the\npatient declines it. Testing is considered voluntary in that it is good clinical practice, but is not\nrequired by policy or law.\nThe AASLD, CDC, and USPSTF recommend risk factor-based and birth cohort screening for\nHCV infection. The incarcerated population  is reported to have higher prevalence rates of\nHCV than the general population and is identified by the AASLD and USPSTF as a risk\nfactor for which screening is recommended.\nOther well-described risk factors, which should be considered when recommending HCV\ntesting to inmates, include:\nEver injected illegal drugs or shared equipment (including intranasal use of illicit drugs)\n►\nReceived tattoos or body piercings while in jail or prison, or from any unregulated source\n►\nHIV or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection\n►\nReceived a blood transfusion or an organ transplant before 1992, received clotting factor\n►\ntransfusion prior to 1987, or received blood from a donor who later tested positive for\nHCV infection\nHistory of percutaneous exposure to blood\n►\nEver received hemodialysis\n►\nBorn to a mother who had HCV infection at the time of delivery\n►\nBorn between 1945 and 1965\n►\n2 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 19 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nb. CLINICAL CONDITIONS FOR ANY INMATE\nHCV testing  is recommended for all inmates with the following clinical conditions:\nA reported history of HCV infection without prior medical records to confirm the\n►\ndiagnosis\nCirrhosis\n►\nElevated ALT levels of unknown etiology\n►\nEvidence of extrahepatic manifestations of HCV – mixed cryoglobulinemia,\n►\nmembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, porphyria cutanea tarda, vasculitis\nPotential exposure to HCV, e.g., chronic hemodialysis (screen alanine aminotransferase\n►\n[ALT] monthly and anti-HCV semiannually), injection drug use or high-risk sexual\nbehavior, exposure to blood or potentially infectious material (see BOP Clinical Guidance\non Medical Management of Exposures)\nSCREENING METHOD \nThe preferred screening test for HCV infection is an immunoassay that measures the presence of \nantibodies to HCV antigens, referred to as HCV Ab or anti-HCV. The presence of these antibodies \nonly indicates a history of exposure to the HCV virus, but does not distinguish between active \nand resolved infection. \nInitial testing with an HCV RNA test is recommended for cases with a known prior positive \nHCV Ab if they are at risk for reinfection or suspected of reinfection, and if they previously \ncleared the HCV spontaneously or achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) with treatment. \nREFUSAL OF TESTING \nInmates who decline testing at the baseline visit, should be counseled about and offered HCV \ntesting during periodic preventive health visits.  \n A treatment refusal form is recommended for every testing and treatment refusal.\n3. INITIAL EVALUATION OF ANTI-HCV POSITIVE INMATES\nInitial evaluation of anti-HCV positive inmates includes (a) a baseline history and physical \nexamination, and (b) baseline lab tests. The inmate should also be (c) assessed regarding the need \nfor preventive health interventions such as vaccines and screenings for other conditions,  as well \nas (d) counseled with information on HCV infection. \nDetermining whether the patient meets BOP priority criteria for treatment is an important part of \nthe initial evaluation of anti-HCV positive inmates:   \n If cirrhosis is present, see Section 4, Assess for Hepatic Cirrhosis and Decompensation, to determine\nwhether the liver disease is compensated or decompensated.\n Section 5, BOP Priority Criteria for Treatment, lists the clinical scenarios that will be used in the BOP\nto prioritize inmates for treatment. \n3 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 20 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nBASELINE EVALUATION \nA baseline clinician evaluation should be conducted for all inmates who are anti-HCV positive. At \nminimum, this evaluation should include the following elements: \na. PROBLEM-FOCUSED HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nEvaluate for signs and symptoms of liver disease, quantify prior alcohol consumption, and\n►\ndetermine risk behaviors for acquiring HCV infection (see the section on risk factors under\nScreening Criteria above). Attempt to estimate the earliest possible date of infection,\nincluding when risk factors for exposures started and stopped, e.g., the time period in\nwhich the inmate engaged in injection drug use.\nEvaluate for other possible causes of liver disease, especially alcoholism, nonalcoholic\n►\nsteatohepatitis (NASH), iron overload, and autoimmune hepatitis.\nInquire about prior treatment for HCV infection, specific medications used, dosages and\n►\nduration of treatment, and outcomes, if known.\nb. LABORATORY TESTS:\nRecommended baseline laboratory tests are listed in Appendix 3 and include the following:\nComplete blood count (CBC); prothrombin time (PT) with International Normalization\n►\nRatio (INR); liver panel (albumin, total and direct bilirubin, serum alanine\naminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase);\nserum creatinine; and calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n Unexplained abnormalities should prompt additional diagnostic evaluations, as clinically\nindicated, to determine the underlying cause, e.g., low hemoglobin/platelet count or GFR.\nHepatitis B serology (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc) and HIV serology.\n►\n Refer to the relevant BOP Clinical Guidance for management of a positive HBsAg or HIV test.\nQuantitative HCV RNA viral load testing, sensitive to ≤  25 IU/ml, with reflex testing\n►\nfor HCV genotype, to determine if the inmate has active HCV infection and identify the\nHCV genotype.\n Undetectable levels of HCV RNA indicate resolved infection or a false positive HCV Ab test.\nSuch cases do not require ongoing follow-up or monitoring of this condition in a chronic care\nclinic.\nUnless otherwise clinically indicated, testing for other causes of liver disease—e.g.,\n►\nantinuclear antibody (ANA), ferritin, iron saturation, ceruloplasmin—are not routinely\nordered in the evaluation of a positive HCV Ab test.\nA urine drug screen is recommended only if ongoing substance use is suspected or if it is\n►\notherwise clinically indicated.\n4 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 21 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nc. PREVENTIVE HEALTH MEASURES:\nAll inmates who are anti-HCV positive should be evaluated to assess the need for the\npreventive health interventions. Patients with liver disease should receive standard\nimmunizations that are applicable to an otherwise healthy population, including the\nfollowing:\nHepatitis B vaccine:  Indicated for susceptible inmates with chronic HCV infection. For\n►\nforeign-born inmates, consider prescreening for hepatitis B immunity prior to vaccination.\n Inmates with evidence of liver disease should be priority candidates for hepatitis B vaccination.\nHepatitis A vaccine:  Indicated for susceptible inmates with chronic HCV. For foreign-born\n►\ninmates, consider prescreening for hepatitis A immunity prior to vaccination.\nInfluenza vaccine:  Offer to all HCV-infected inmat es annually.\n►\n Inmates with cirrhosis are high priority for influenza vaccine.\nPneumococcal vaccine:  Recommended by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on\n►\nImmunization Practices (ACIP) for use in adults with chronic liver disease, including\ncirrhosis, regardless of age. Evidence for its use in chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis\nis limited. (Refer to BOP Clinical Guidance on Immunization for specific\nrecommendations.)\nd. PATIENT EDUCATION:\nInmates diagnosed with chronic HCV infection should be counseled by a health care provider\nregarding the natural history of the infection, potential treatment options, and specific\nmeasures to prevent transmitting HCV infection to others (both during incarceration and\nupon release).\n4. ASSESS FOR HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS AND DECOMPENSATION\nCirrhosis is a condition of chronic liver disease marked by inflammation, degeneration of \nhepatocytes, and replacement with fibrotic scar tissue. The natural history of HCV is such that \n50–80% of HCV infections become chronic. Progression of chronic HCV infection to fibrosis \nand cirrhosis may take years in some patients and decades in others—or, in some cases, may not \noccur at all. Most complications from HCV infection occur in people with cirrhosis.  \n• Patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis (primarily stage 3) have a 10% per year rate of\nprogressing to cirrhosis (stage 4).\n• Those with cirrhosis have a 4% per year rate of developing decompensated cirrhosis, and a\n3% per year rate of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.\n The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score is a useful tool in determining the severity of cirrhosis and in\ndistinguishing between compensated and decompensated liver disease. See the discussion\nunder Assessing Hepatic Compensation.\n5 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 22 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nASSESSING FOR HEPATIC FIBROSIS AND CIRRHOSIS \nAssessing for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis is recommended for all inmates with HCV infection \nin order to select the most appropriate treatment regimen, prioritize inmates for treatment of \nHCV, and determine the need for additional health care interventions. Cirrhosis may be \ndiagnosed in several ways:   \n• Symptoms and signs that support the diagnosis of cirrhosis may include:  Low albumin or\nplatelets, elevated bilirubin or INR,  ascites, esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy.\nHowever, isolated lab abnormalities may require additional diagnostic evaluation to determine\nthe etiology.\n• The AST-Platelet Ration Index (APRI) is the BOP-preferred method for non-invasive\nassessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis:\nThe APRI score, a calculation based on results from two blood tests—the AST (aspartate\n►\naminotransferase)and the platelet count—is a less invasive and less expensive means of\n \nassessing fibrosis than a liver biopsy. If a person is known to have cirrhosis, the APRI is\nirrelevant and unnecessary.\n The formula for calculating the APRI score is: [(AST/AST ULN) x 100] / platelet count (109/L).\n A calculator is available at: http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/page/clinical-calculators/apri\nAn APRI score ≥ 2.0 may be used to predict the presence of cirrhosis. At this cutoff, the\n►\nAPRI score has a sensitivity of 48%, but a specificity of 94%, for predicting cirrhosis.\nInmates with an APRI score ≥ 2.0 should have an abdominal ultrasound performed to\nidentify other findings consistent with cirrhosis (see abdominal imaging studies bullet below\nin this list). Lower APRI scores have different sensitivities and specificities for cirrhosis.\nFor example, an APRI score ≥ 1 has a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 75% for\npredicting cirrhosis.\nThe APRI may also be used to predict the presence of significant fibrosis (stages 2 to 4, out\n►\nof 4). Using a cutoff of  ≥ 0.7, the sensitivity is 77% and specificity is 72% for significant\nfibrosis.\nThe APRI score may be invalidated in cases of splenectomy. An alternative non-invasive\n►\ntest, e.g., Fibrosure, may be appropriate.\n• Liver biopsy is no longer required unless otherwise clinically indicated or if there is\nuncertainty about the stage of fibrosis, based on results from non-invasive testing or other\nclinical indicators. However, the presence of cirrhosis on a prior liver biopsy may be used to\nmeet the BOP criteria for HCV treatment.\n• Although a combination of direct biomarkers and transient elastography is emerging as an\naccurate non-invasive assessment of fibrosis, the data is insufficient at this time to establish it\nas the new standard over validated indirect biomarkers such as the APRI score.\n• Abdominal imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scan may identify findings consistent\nwith or suggestive of the following:  cirrhosis (nodular contour of the liver), portal\nhypertension (ascites, splenomegaly, varices), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nAbdominal ultrasound is routinely performed in cases of known or suspected cirrhosis, and\nas clinically indicated on a case-by-case basis.\n6 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 23 of 50\n\nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 24 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nthe scope of this document. Other resources should be consulted for more specific \nrecommendations related to this condition.  \n5. BOP PRIORITY CRITERIA FOR HCV TREATMENT\nSVR (virologic cure) rates of 90% or higher can be achieved  with current DAA regimens. \nEradication of HCV is associated with a number of improved outcomes, including a reduction in \nthe following:  liver inflammation and fibrosis, severity of advanced liver disease and its \ncomplications, risk of liver cancer and liver-related mortality, need for liver transplantation, and \ntransmission of HCV infection.  \nAll sentenced inmates with chronic HCV infection are eligible for consideration of treatment. \nCertain cases are at higher risk for complications or disease progression and may require more \nurgent consideration for treatment. The BOP has established   to ensure that \nPRIORITY CRITERIA\ninmates with the greatest need are identified and treated first. Additional criteria for treatment \nhave also been established (see Other Criteria For Treatment). \nPRIORITY LEVEL 1:  HIGH PRIORITY FOR TREATMENT * \n• ADVANCED HEPATIC FIBROSIS\nAPRI ≥ 2.0,  or\n►\nMetavir or Batts/Ludwig stage 3 or 4 on liver biopsy,  or\n►\nKnown or suspected cirrhosis\n►\n• LIVER TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS\n• HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC)\n• COMORBID MEDICAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HCV, INCLUDING:\nCryoglobulinemia with renal disease or vasculitis\n►\nCertain types of lymphomas or hematologic malignancies\n►\nPorphyria cutanea tarda\n►\n• IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT MEDICATION FOR A COMORBID MEDICAL CONDITION\nSome immusuppressant medications (e.g., certain chemotherapy agents and tumor necrosis\n►\nfactor inhibitors) may be needed to treat a comorbid medical condition, but are not\nrecommended for use when infection is present.  Although data are insufficient and current\nguidelines are inconsistent regarding treatment of HCV infection in this setting, such cases\nwill be considered for  prioritized treatment of HCV on an individual basis.\n• CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THOSE ALREADY STARTED ON TREATMENT, including inmates who are newly\nincarcerated in the BOP.\nPRIORITY LEVEL 2:  INTERMEDIATE PRIORITY FOR TREATMENT * \n• EVIDENCE FOR PROGRESSIVE FIBROSIS\nAPRI score ≥ 0.7\n►\nStage 2 fibrosis on liver biopsy\n►\n(PRIORITY LEVEL 2 criteria continues on next page) \n8 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 25 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \n• COMORBID MEDICAL CONDITIONS associated with more rapid progression of fibrosis\nCoinfection with HBV or HIV\n►\nComorbid liver diseases (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, fatty infiltration of\n►\nthe liver, steatohepatitis)\nDiabetes mellitus\n►\n• CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) with GFR ≤ 59 mL/min per 1.73 m2\n• BIRTH COHORT 1945–1965\nPRIORITY LEVEL 3:  LOW PRIORITY FOR TREATMENT * \n• Stage 0 to stage 1 fibrosis on liver biopsy\n• APRI < 0.7\n• All other cases of HCV infection meeting the eligibility critera for treatment, as noted right\nbelow under Other Criteria for Treatment.\nOTHER CRITERIA FOR TREATMENT \nIn addition to meeting the above criteria for PRIORITY LEVELS 1–3, inmates being considered for \ntreatment of HCV infection should: \n• Have no contraindications to, or signicifant drug interactions with, any component of the\ntreatment regimen.\n• Not be pregnant, especially for any regimen that would require ribavirin or interferon.\n• Have sufficient time remaining on their sentence in the BOP to complete a course of\ntreatment.\n Inmates with high priority criteria (PRIORITY LEVEL 1), but insufficient time remaining in BOP\ncustody, may be considered for treatment if they will have access to medications and health care\nproviders for continuity of care at the time of release.\n Long-term, pre-sentence detainees in BOP custody with high priority criteria may be considered for\ntreatment if continuity of care can be reasonbly assured and there is reliably sufficient time\nremaining in custody to complete treatment.\n• Have a life expectancy > 18 months.\n• Demonstrate a willingness and an ability to adhere to a rigorous treatment regimen and to\nabstain from high-risk activities while incarcerated.\n Inmates with with evidence for ongoing high-risk behaviors, e.g., injection drug use, are considered\nfor HCV treatment on an individual basis. Referral for evaluation and treatment of substance abuse\nis recommended.\n9 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 26 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \n6. RECOMMENDED TREATMENT REGIMENS\nRecommendations for preferred HCV treatment regimens continue to evolve, but still depend on \nseveral factors: \n► HCV GENOTYPE\n► PRIOR HCV TREATMENT HISTORY\n► COMPENSATED VS. DECOMPENSATED LIVER DISEASE\n► RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED SUBSTITUTIONS (CERTAIN CLINICAL SCENARIOS)\n► DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS\n SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:  Certain conditions require special consideration when selecting an HCV\ntreatment regimen, including decompensated cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, solid organ transplant\nrecipients, and pregnancy. These SPECIAL CONDITIONS are addressed in Section 8.\n COST:  The cost of direct acting antiviral (DAA) regimens can vary widely. When more than one\nregimen is appropriate for an individual case, the most cost-effective regimen is recommended, taking\ninto consideration all the factors listed in the BOX above.\nDIRECT ACTING ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS (DAAS) \nAs the name implies, these antiviral medications for HCV infection act directly on some part of \nthe virus, usually the replication mechanism. \nCurrently, there are three classes of HCV DAAs:  polymerase inhibitors (-buvir), protease \ninhibitors (-previr), and NS5A replication complex inhibitors (-asvir). \n DAAs cannot be used as monotherapy; they must be used in combination with at least one\nother DAA or with ribavirin, and in some cases with peginterferon, depending on the clinical\nscenario.\n The most commonly recommended regimens are briefly described below. More detailed\ninformation about the regimens and the individual medications—including indications,\ncontraindications, dosing and duration, and drug interactions—may be found in the the AASLD\nguidance, manufacturer’s prescribing information, Facts and Comparisons (available in BEMR), and\nother validated resources.\nDACLATASVIR + SOFOSBUVIR \n• USE:  Once-daily daclatasvir coadministered with 400 mg of sofosbuvir once daily, with or\nwithout food, is FDA-approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 3.\nAASLD currently recommends this combination as an option for treatment of HCV\n►\ngenotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 in various clinical scenarios with decompensated cirrhosis.\nIf there are no contraindications, ribavirin is added to the regimen in decompensated\n►\ncirrhosis and in some HCV treatment-experienced cases.\n• DOSING:  The usual dose of daclatasivir is 60 mg once daily, with or without food.\nDosage adjustment is required with strong CYP3A inhibitors (30 mg once daily) and with\n►\nmoderate CYP3A inducers (90 mg once daily).\n Daclatasvir is contraindicated with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin,\nand rimamycin antimycobacterials) and is not recommended with amiodarone.\n10 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 27 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nWhen coadministered with antiretrovirals for HIV infection—the dose of daclatasvir is\n►\ndecreased to 30 mg with indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, or\nany cobicistat-containing regimen except darunavir; the dose of daclatasvir is increased to\n90 mg with efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine.\n• DURATION:  The usual duration of treatment is 12 weeks in patients with no cirrhosis,\nResponse rates are diminished in cirrhosis; the optimal duration for treatment of HCV with\n►\ncirrhosis is not well-established, but AASLD recommends longer treatment durations of\n16 to 24 weeks, depending on the clinical scenario.\nELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR (ZEPATIER®) \n• FORMULATION/USE:  A coformulation of 50 mg of elbasvir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor) and\n100 mg of grazoprevir (an HCV NS3 protease inhibitor) is FDA-approved for treatment of\nHCV genotypes 1 and 4.\n In HCV genotype 1a, NS5A resistance testing is recommended prior to treatment, if GFR is ≥30.\n• DOSING AND DURATION:  The usual dose and duration is one tablet orally once daily, with or\nwithout food, for 12 weeks.\n16 weeks is recommended for HCV genotype 1a with baseline NS5A polymorphisms or for\n►\nHCV genotype 4 treatment-experienced with peginterferon + ribivarin.\nSofosbuvir is added to elbasvir/grazoprevir when treating HCV genotype 3 with\n►\ncompensated cirrhosis and previously treated with pegylated interferon + ribavirin.\nWeight-based ribavirin is added to elbasvir/grazoprevir for the following:  HCV\n►\ngenotype 1a with baseline NS5A polymorphisms; HCV genotype 1a or 1b treatment-\nexperienced with PEG- peginterferon + ribivarin + HCV protease inhibitor; or HCV\ngenotype 4 treatment-experienced with peginterferon + ribivarin.\nNo dosage adjustment is required for decreased renal function or hemodialysis, although\n►\nthe ribavirin dose must be adjusted for GFR < 50.\n• CONTRAINDICATIONS AND USE NOT RECOMMENDED :\nElbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis (CTP score ≥ 7), or\n►\nwith certain medications.\nContraindicated medications include phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, efavirenz, HIV\n►\nprotease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir), and\ncyclosporine.\nElbasvir/grazoprevir is not recommended with moderate CYP3A inducers or with strong\n►\nCYP3A inhibitors.\nGLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR (MAVYRET®) \n• FORMULATION/USE:  A coformulation of 100 mg of glecaprevir and 40 mg of pibrentasvir is\nFDA-approved for treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, without cirrhosis or with\ncompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A).

Adjustments of the inmate’s \ncurrent medications may be needed prior to starting treatment for HCV. Refer to the appendices \nat the end of this document for specific drug interactions. Other useful resources for potential \ndrug interactions include the AASLD/IDSA guidance, the individual manufacturers’ prescribing \ninformation, and the DHHS Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected \nAdults and Adolescents. \nREGIMENS NOT RECOMMENDED \nRegimens that are not recommended for use include the following: \n• Monotherapy with peginterferon, ribavirin, or any of the DAAs.\n• Dual therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin, except when urgent HCV treatment is needed\nfor genotypes 2, 3, 5, or 6 with GFR < 30.\n See discussion of chronic kidney disease in Section 8.\n• Triple therapy with peginterferon, ribavirin, and the HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir,\nsimeprevir, or telaprevir.\n• HCV protease inhibitors for genotypes 2, 3, 5, or 6 (paritaprevir, simeprevir).\n7. MONITORING\n See Appendix 3, Hepatitis C Treatment Monitoring Schedule, for a summary chart of the monitoring\nrecommendations.\nPRETREATMENT ASSESSMENT \nPrior to starting treatment for HCV infection, PATIENT EDUCATION is recommended—including, \nbut not limited to: how to take the medication, the importance of adherence, monitoring and \nfollow up, and potential medication side effects. When ribavirin is used, specific counseling \nabout the risks and recommendations related to pregnancy should be provided.  \nPretreatment assessment should be accomplished within three months of the projected start of \ntreatment, and should include the following:  \n• Laboratory tests including CBC, PT/INR,  liver panel, serum creatinine, calculated GFR.\n Obtain quatitative HCV RNA viral load and HCV genotype if the most recent results are more than\none year old or if not previously performed.\n A urine drug screen is not required as part of the pretreatment evaluation, and is recommended\nonly if ongoing substance use is suspected or if it is otherwise clinically indicated.\n• Calculation of the APRI score using results from the pretreatment labs. (An APRI score is not\nneeded if there is confirmed cirrhosis.)\n(PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENT list continues on next page) \n15 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 32 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \n• Calculation of current CTP score for inmates with known or suspected cirrhosis.\n• Assessment for significant drug-drug interactions.\n• Assessment for current/prior medication adherence.\n• Review of incident report history for high-risk behaviors (alcohol/drug possession/use;\ntattooing).\n• For ribavirin-containing regimens: In addition to the above, obtain a pregnancy test in all\nwomen with childbearing potential. A pretreatment ECG is recommended for inmates with\npreexisting coronary heart disease.\n• For interferon-containing regimens: In addition to the above, pretreatment evaluation should\ninclude a WBC with differential, TSH/free T4. Such regimens should also include a mental\nhealth evaluation.\nTesting for NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) is recommended prior to treatment \nwith the following regimens or situations: \n• Elbasvir/grazoprevir for HCV genotype 1a and GFR ≥30.\n• Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for treatment-naïve HCV genotype 3 with cirrhosis.\n• Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for HCV genotype 3 treatment-experienced with PEG-IFN + RBV and\nno cirrhosis.\n• Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir as an alternative regimen for treatment-naïve HCV genotype 3 with\ncirrhosis.\n• Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir as an alternative regimen for HCV genotype 3 treatment-experienced\nwith  PEG-IFN + RBV, and no cirrhosis.\n• NS5A resistance testing may be considered when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is an option for\ntreatment-experienced HCV genotype 1a with no cirrhosis or compensated cirrhosis.\n NS3/4A resistance testing is no longer routinely recommended.\nON-TREATMENT MONITORING \nOn-treatment monitoring should include the following: \n• An outpatient clinic visit at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks after starting therapy, and monthly\nthereafter; more frequently as clinically indicated.\nThe primary focus at the 2-week visit is assessment of medication adherence, side effects\n►\nand symptoms of hepatic decompensation, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug\ninteractions.\n• Labs drawn at 4 weeks after the start of therapy should include CBC, serum creatinine,\ncalculated GFR, liver panel including ALT, and quantitative HCV viral load sensitive to ≤  25\nIU/ml; others as clinically indicated.\nFor regimens containing interferon and/or ribavirin:  A CBC should also be drawn 2 weeks\n►\nafter starting therapy, then at 4 weeks, then monthly; more frequently as clinically\nindicated. Interferon and/or ribavirin dosage adjustments may be required.\n See Appendix 4, Management of Hematologic Changes.\n(ON-TREATMENT MONITORING list continues on next page) \n16 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 33 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nMore frequent monitoring of ALT is necessary in certain situations:\n►\n▪ Regimens containing elbasvir/grazoprevir: For 12-week regimens, a liver panel\nincluding ALT should be drawn at 4 weeks and again at 8 weeks, and as clinically\nindicated. For 16-week regimens, a liver panel including ALT should be drawn at\n4 weeks and again at 12 weeks.\n▪ Patients with compensated cirrhosis who are treated with paritaprevir/ritonavir/\nombitasvir (with or without dasabuvir) require monitoring by a liver panel—including\nALT and signs of decompensated liver disease—at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and as clinically\nindicated.\n▪ Increases in the ALT should prompt more frequent monitoring or early discontinuation.\nAsymptomatic ALT increases of less than tenfold should be monitored approximately\nevery 2 weeks. Early discontinuation of HCV treatment is recommended if ALT\nincreases by tenfold—or if less than tenfold , but accompanied by symptoms such as\nweakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or change in stool color, or signs including\nelevations in conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and INR, related to hepatic\ndysfunction.\nIf the quantitative HCV viral load is detectable after 4 weeks of treatment, it should be\n►\nrepeated 2 weeks later. Early discontinuation of HCV treatment is recommended only if\nthere is > 1 log increase from the nadir in HCV viral load after 6 weeks or more of\ntreatment.\n HCV viral load testing is no longer required at the end of treatment, but should be obtained in all\ncases that failed to achieve undetectable levels during treatment.\n• A test for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is recommended every 12 weeks only for patients\nreceiving regimens containing interferon. For a 12-week regimen, a TSH should be drawn at\nthe end of treatment, in addition to the pretreatment baseline.\n• Pregnancy testing is required prior to treatment with ribavirin-containing regimens, and then\nperiodically during and after treatment—usually monthly during treatment and for 6 months\nafter completion of treatment.\n• Monitoring of interferon and/or ribavirin-containing regimens has not changed and is included\nin Appendix 3, Hepatitis C Treatment Monitoring Schedule.\n• For patients with evidence of chronic HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg positive) who do not meet\ncriteria for antiviral HBV therapy, quantitative HBV DNA levels are recommended prior to\nstarting HCV DAA treatment, periodically during DAA treatment (usually every four weeks),\nand immediately after DAA treatment. Initiate antiviral HBV treatment if the HBV DNA\nlevel increases more than 10-fold from baseline or above 1,000 IU/ml if it was previously\nundetectable.\n17 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 34 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nPOST-TREATMENT MONITORING \n• A quantitative HCV RNA viral load assessment is recommended at 12 weeks after completion\nof treatment; if HCV is undetectable, it defines an SVR.\n• If the HCV viral load is again undetectable at 6 to 12 months after the end of treatment, the\ninmate may be removed from the chronic care clinic for this condition, so long as he or she\nhas no cirrhosis, complications, or related comorbidities, and the HCV infection has been\nchanged to “resolved” in the problem list.\n Recurrent viremia following an SVR may be due to relapse or reinfection. To help distinguish between\nthe two in such cases, an HCV genotype, along with subtyping for genotype 1, should be obtained. If\nthe post-SVR genotype is the same as the pre-treatment genotype, it is not possible to distinguish\nrelapse from reinfection.\nONGOING MONITORING \nPeriodic monitoring is recommended for all those with active infection, including acute HCV \ninfection, HCV treatment failures, relapse of HCV infection  or reinfection, and those with \nchronic HCV infection who are not yet treated.  \n• For cases without advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, or complications, annual evaluation is\nappropriate. This evaluation should include a focused review of systems and patient education\nrelevant to HCV, vital signs and a focused physical examination, and lab monitoring (CBC,\nPT/INR,  liver panel, serum creatinine, calculated GFR, and calculation of the APRI score).\n• For patients with cirrhosis or significant comorbidities, evaluation is recommended at least\nevery six months; more frequently as clinically indicated.\n• In cases of acute HCV infection, monitoring for spontaneous clearance of the infection with\nALT and quantitative HCV RNA levels every four to eight weeks, for six to twelve months, is\nrecommended. If viremia persists after that time, continue to monitor and manage the case as\na chronic infection. In most cases of acute HCV infection, treatment may be deferred to allow\nfor spontaneous clearance of viremia. However, in some cases there may be a compelling\nreason to treat the acute infection in order to prevent severe complications, e.g., HCV\ninfection superimposed on established cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis.\n18 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 35 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \n8. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nHCV INFECTION WITH MORE THAN ONE GENOTYPE \nVery little data are available to guide the selection of a DAA regimen when more than one HCV \ngenotype are present at the same time. In such cases, selection of a regimen that is effective \nagainst both of the existing genotypes is appropriate, in consultation with a BOP Hepatitis \nClinical Pharmacy Consultant or Central Office Physician. \nHBV COINFECTION \nIn patients coinfected with HBV and HCV, HBV reactivation may occur during or after \ntreatment with HCV DAAs. Testing for HBV infection—including HBsAg, anti-HBs, and \nanti-HBc, as well as HBV DNA levels in those with a reactive HBsAg—is recommended  for all \npatients being considered for treatment of HCV infection.  \n• If criteria for treatment of HBV are met, it is recommended that HBV treatment be started prior\nto or at the same time as HCV treatment, and monitored according to HBV treatment\nguidance.\n• If criteria for treatment of HBV infection are NOT met, monitoring of HBV DNA is\nrecommended every 4 weeks during HCV treatment and for 3 months after treatment is\ncompleted. Initiate antiviral HBV treatment if the HBV DNA level increases more than\n10-fold from baseline or above 1,000 IU/ml if it was previously undetectable. Alternatively,\nHBV antiviral therapy may be prescribed during HCV treatment and for 3 months after\ntreatment completion.\n• For isolated anti-HBc positive cases with negative HBsAg and anti-HBs, monitor ALT at\nbaseline, at the completion of HCV treatment, and again during post-treatment follow-up.\nHIV COINFECTION \nCurrently recommended HCV regimens are equally effective for HCV mono-infection and \ncoinfection with HIV. However, an alternative HCV regimen or an alternative antiretroviral \nmedication regimen may be necessary due to potential drug interactions between the HCV DAAs \nand certain antiretrovirals. \nThe following are links to tables showing drug interactions between the HIV antiretrovirals and the \nHCV Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs): \n• https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/htmltables/1/5536 (Table 12)\n• https://www.hcvguidelines.org/unique-populations/hiv-hcv (scroll to the bottom of the page)\n19 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 36 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nDECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS \nTreatment of HCV patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be managed in consultation with \nan experienced clinician/specialist, with treatment requests considered on a case-by-case basis. \nHCV treatment recommendations for patients with decompensated cirrhosis apply regardless of \neligibility for a liver transplant or the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The regimens and \nother considerations are listed below. Inmates with decompensated cirrhosis and a CTP score ≥ 9 \nmay meet reduction in sentence criteria \n See TABLE 2 for a summary of treatment recommendations for decompensated cirrhosis.\nHCV GENOTYPE 1,  4, 5, OR 6 WITH DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS:   \n See the section that discusses the use of ribavirin with this group.\n• The treatment options for HCV genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 with decompensated cirrhosis, either\ntreatment-naïve or treatment-experienced with peginterferon+ribivarin, are as follows:\nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir + low initial dose ribavirin for 12 weeks (or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir\n►\nfor 24 weeks in ribavirin-ineligible cases)\nSofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks (or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 24 weeks in\n►\nribavirin-ineligible cases)\nGenotypes 1 or 4 only: Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir + low initial dose ribavirin for 12 weeks\n►\n(or daclatasvir + sofosbuvir for 24 weeks in ribavirin-ineligible cases)\n• For cases with a history of treatment failure with a regimen containing sofosbuvir, one of the\nthe following two regimens is recommended:\nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir + low initial dose ribavirin for 24 weeks\n►\nSofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks\n►\n• For cases with a history of treatment failure with a regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor, the\nfollowing regimen is recommended:\nSofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks\n►\nHCV GENOTYPE 2 OR 3 WITH DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS:  \n See the section that discusses the use of ribavirin with this group.\n• The treatment options for HCV genotype 2 or 3 with decompensated cirrhosis, either treatment-\nnaïve or treatment-experienced with peginterferon+ribivarin, are as follows:\nOnce-daily daclatasvir + once-daily sofosbuvir + low initial dose of ribavirin for 12 weeks\n►\n(or daclatasvir + sofosbuvir for 24 weeks in ribavirin-ineligible cases)\nOnce-daily sofosbuvir/velpatasvir +  ribavirin for 12 weeks (or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for\n►\n24 weeks in ribavirin-ineligible cases)\n• For cases with a history of treatment failure with a regimen containing sofosbuvir or an NS5A\ninhibitor, the following regimen is recommended:\nSofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks.\n►\n20 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 37 of 50\n\nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 38 of 50\n\nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 39 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nCHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) \nHCV is independently associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). \nPublished studies indicate that HCV is associated with 1) a higher risk of developing proteinuria \nand CKD; 2) a higher risk for progression to end-stage-liver-disease (ESLD); and 3) an increased \nrisk of mortality for dialysis patients.  \nNo dosage adjustment is required for any of the current DAAs when the GFR is ≥ 30 (CKD stages \n1, 2, and 3).  For cases being considered for renal transplantation, consultation with the transplant \nconsultant is recommended regarding timing of HCV treatment relative to transplantation.  \n• For patients with GFR < 30 (CKD stages 4 and 5), and any HCV genotype—either with no\ncirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and either treatment-naïve or treatment-\nexperienced—the recommended DAA treatment regimens are as follows:\nGlecaprevir/pibrentasvir once daily for 8 to 16 weeks may be used for all genotypes,\n►\nDuration of treatment is the same as for those without CKD. No dosage adjustment is\nrequired.\n► Elbasvir/grazoprevir once daily for 12 weeks may be used ONLY for genotypes 1a, 1b, or 4. It\nappears NOT to be a good choice for most DAA-experienced cases. No dosage adjustment\nis required. NS5A resistance testing is not required when elbasvir/grazoprevir is used to\ntreat genotype 1a with a GFR < 30.\n See discussion of  elbasvir/grazoprevir in Section 6.\n• Ribavirin doses must be decreased with GFRs ≤50. For GFRs 30–50, ribavirin is dosed\n200 mg alternating every other day with 400 mg. For GFR <30, including hemodialysis, the\nribavirin dose is 200 mg daily.\n• For kidney transplant recipients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 with no cirrhosis or with\ncompensated cirrhosis, either treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced, glecaprevir (300mg) /\npibrentasvir (120mg) or ledipasvir (90mg) / sofosbuvir (400mg), once daily for 12 weeks are\nthe preferred DAA regimens. No dosage adjustments are required.\n• For kidney transplant recipients with HCV genotype 2, 3, 5, or 6 with no cirrhosis or with\ncompensated cirrhosis, either treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced, glecaprevir (300mg) /\npibrentasvir (120mg) is the  preferred DAA regimen. No dosage adjustment is required.\n23 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 40 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nPREGNANCY \nSafety and efficacy data are limited regarding use of HCV DAAs during pregnancy. The current \nAASLD/IDSA guidance does NOT recommend treatment of HCV during pregnancy.  \nRibavirin is contraindicated during pregnancy: \n• Women of childbearing potential who are being considered for an HCV regimen that includes\nribavirin should be counseled on the adverse fetal effects of ribavirin. They should be advised\nnot to become pregnant during treatment with ribavirin and for six months after the treatment\nhas ended. They should also be advised that the same risks apply if a male sex partner is being\ntreated with ribavirin.\n A negative pregnancy test should be documented prior to starting treatment with ribavirin, monthly\nduring treatment, and for six months after treatment.\n• Men being treated with ribavirin should also be counseled on the adverse fetal effects of\nribavirin. They should be advised not to cause pregnancy in their female sex partners during\ntreatment with ribavirin and for six months after the treatment has ended.\n24 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 456   Filed 08/25/20   Page 41 of 50\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons  Evaluation and Management of Chronic HCV Infection \nClinical Guidance  August 2018 \nREFERENCES \nAASLD/IDSA.

They are sued in their individual capacities.  \n33.  At all times relevant, Defendants acted under color of state law. \nFACTS \nChronic Hepatitis C Virus \n34.  HCV is a viral infection that attacks the liver and causes hepatitis, or liver \ninflammation. It is spread primarily through contact with infected blood.  \n35.  Liver inflammation caused by HCV can significantly impair liver function and \ndamage its crucial role in digesting nutrients, filtering toxins from the blood, preventing disease, \nand making possible essentially all metabolic processes in the body.  \n36.  Liver impairment can cause severe pain, abdominal and gastrointestinal problems, \nfatigue, weakness, and muscle wasting, difficulty or pain with urination, increased risk of heart \nattacks, and other side effects. \n37.  HCV can be either acute or chronic. A small percentage of people who are \nexposed to infected blood develop an acute infection that their body resolves without treatment. \n9 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 9 of 35\n\nBut a significant majority (75% to 85%) of people who develop acute HCV go on to develop \nchronic HCV.  \n38.  People with chronic HCV develop fibrosis of the liver, which is a process by \nwhich healthy liver tissue is replaced with scarring. Scar tissue cannot perform any of the jobs of \nnormal liver cells, so fibrosis reduces liver function.  \n39.  When scar tissue begins to take over most of the liver, this extensive fibrosis is \ntermed cirrhosis.  \n40.  Cirrhosis is irreversible. It can, and often does, cause additional painful \ncomplications, including widespread itching, arthritic pain throughout the body, kidney disease, \njaundice, fluid retention with edema, internal bleeding, easy bruising, abdominal ascites, mental \nconfusion, lymph disorders, and even more extreme fatigue. \n41.  In part because it can be difficult to determine exactly when significant hepatitic \nfibrosis becomes cirrhosis, most of these complications can occur before cirrhosis. If these \ncomplications go untreated, some can cause death. \n42.  Health care providers who provide care to people with chronic HCV need to be \naware of how drugs they prescribe can cause or exacerbate stress to the liver and need to counsel \ntheir HCV-positive patients appropriately about prescription and over-the-counter medications \nthat affect the liver, including ibuprofen, naproxen, large doses of acetaminophen, and others.   \n43.  In addition to causing day-to-day pain and other problems, chronic HCV also \ndramatically increases a person’s risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer.  \n44.  Of those with chronic HCV, at least half will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer, \nand almost everyone (70% to 95%) will develop chronic liver disease.  \n10 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 10 of 35\n\n45.  Some 19,000 people die of HCV-caused liver disease every year in the United \nStates. HCV is the leading indication for liver transplants in the United States.  \n46.  Hepatitis C virus is rampant in correctional facilities, including within the \nfacilities of the Missouri Department of Corrections.  \n47.  At least 10% to 15% of the population under the supervision, care, and custody of \nthe Missouri Department of Corrections is infected with HCV.  \n48.  Since more than 90% of persons who are incarcerated are eventually released into \nthe community, most of this population will return to the general population. \n49.  Each day without treatment increases a person’s likelihood of developing chronic \nliver disease, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, painful complications, death from liver failure, and \nthe risk of transmitting HCV to others.  \n50.  For persons with cirrhosis, each day without treatment causes additional \nirreversible scarring and permanently reduces the function of the liver.  \n51.  As of January 2015, MDOC reported that it was treating 0.11 percent of HCV-\npositive inmates under its supervision, or 5 inmates out of 4,736 inmates with known HCV \ninfections.  \nStandard of Care for HCV \n52.  HCV treatment is successful when it results in a sustained virologic response \n(SVR) for three months following the end of treatment. SVR occurs when a person’s blood has \nno detectable genetic material of the Hepatitis C virus. The medical community recognizes SVR \nas tantamount to a cure. \n53.  For many years, finding and establishing an effective and safe treatment for \nHepatitis C infections was a highly elusive goal. The standard treatment, which included the use \n11 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 11 of 35\n\nof interferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure most patients and was associated with \npainful and other adverse side effects, including psychiatric and autoimmune disorders, flulike \nsymptoms, and gastrointestinal distress. \n54.  In the past four years, the Federal Drug Administration has approved new \nmedications, called direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAA drugs), which have proven to work more \nquickly, cause fewer side effects, and treat chronic HCV much more effectively.  \n55.  In 2011, the FDA approved the use of protease inhibitors called boceprevir (under \nbrand name Victrelis) and telaprevir (under brand name Incivek), and the standard of care \ndeveloped into a “triple therapy” to include the combination of either boceprevir or telaprevir, \nplus ribavirin and interferon. The triple therapy improved results for many patients, but \ncontinued to produce painful and adverse side effects, and the treatment could take 48 weeks to \ncomplete. Manufacturing of these drugs for the United States was discontinued between 2014 \nand 2015 because later treatments are superior. \n56.  In 2013, the FDA approved DAA medications called simeprevir (under brand \nname Olysio) and sofosbuvir (under brand name Sovaldi). At this time, the recommended \ntreatment was a DAA drug such as Sovaldi combined with either ribavirin or interferon, \ndepending on the patient’s other symptoms and medical diagnoses.  \n57.  In late 2014, the FDA approved the use of Sovaldi in combination with Olysio for \nthe treatment of Hepatitis C. \n58.  On October 10, 2014, the FDA approved a DAA drug called Harvoni, which is a \npill that is taken once a day and combines sofosbuvir and ledipasvir.  \n12 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 12 of 35\n\n59.  On December 19, 2014, the FDA approved a DAA drug under the brand name \nViekira Pak, which combines a multi-ingredient tablet with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and \nritonavir and a tablet with dasabuvir.  \n60.  In July 2015 and later expanded in February 2016, the FDA approved daclatasvir \n(under brand name Daklinza) for use with or without ribavirin for patients with one of two \nvariations of chronic HCV, including the most common genotype in the United States.  \n61.  Also in July 2015, the FDA approved a pill that combines ombitasvir, \nparitaprevir, and ritonavir (under brand name Technivie), for use with ribavirin, for treatment of \none variation of chronic HCV for patients without cirrhosis.  \n62.  In January 2016, the FDA approved a pill that combines elbasvir and grazoprevir \n(under brand name Zepatier) for the treatment of two variations of chronic HCV, including the \nmost common genotype in the United States.  \n63.  On June 28, 2016, the FDA approved Epclusa, another new DAA drug that \ncombines sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. It is the first drug approved to treat all six major variations, \nor genotypes, of HCV.  \n64.  Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), Olysio (simeprevir), Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir), \nViekira Pak (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir), Daklinza (daclatasvir), Technivie \n(ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir), Zepatier (elbasvir/grazoprevir), and Epclusa \n(sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) have few side effects, dramatically greater efficacy, can reduce \ntreatment duration by up to 75 percent (from 48 weeks to 12 weeks in many cases), and are \nadministered orally rather than by injections. \n65.  These eight drugs are manufactured by five different drug companies:  \na.  Sovaldi, manufactured by Gilead Sciences \n13 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 13 of 35\n\nb.  Olysio, manufactured by Janssen Research & Development \nc.  Harvoni, manufactured by Gilead Sciences \nd.  Viekira Pak, manufactured by AbbVie \ne.  Daklinza, manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb \nf.  Technivie, manufactured by AbbVie \ng.  Zepatier, manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. \nh.  Epclusa, manufactured by Gilead Sciences \n66.  Over 90 percent of patients treated with any of these DAA drugs are cured.  \n67.  Because of the obvious advantages of the DAA drugs, the medical standard of \ncare for HCV is now well-established. The CDC encourages health care professionals to follow \nthe evidence-based standard of care developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America \n(IDSA) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).  \n68.  The IDSA/AASLD guidelines are the medical standard of care. \n69.  Under the IDSA/AASLD guidelines, some groups of people should be routinely \ntested for HCV, including all persons born between 1945 and 1965 and all persons who were \never incarcerated.  \n70.  As of January 2015, MDOC did not have a policy of routine opt-out testing for \ninmates under its supervision and care.  \n71.  When the CDC/IDSA/AASLD standard of care was updated immediately after \nthe first DAA drug was approved, these organizations provided “prioritization tables” and \nguidance on selecting patients with the greatest need because the “infrastructure . . . did not yet \nexist to treat all patients immediately.”  \n14 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 14 of 35\n\n72.  But on July 6, 2016, these organizations updated the standard of care in \nrecognition of the fact that continuing medical research has demonstrated the safety, tolerability, \nand dramatic benefits of treating all persons with chronic HCV.  \n73.  The benefits demonstrated through vigorous research include: immediate decrease \nin liver inflammation, reduction in the rate of progression of liver fibrosis, improvement in \nnecrosis and cirrhosis, reduction in portal hypertension and spleen enlargement, reduction in \nsevere side effects including cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, a 70% reduction in the river of liver \ncancer, a 90% reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality, and a dramatic increase in quality \nof life.  \n74.  Other studies show treatment delay decreases the benefits associated with cure.  \n75.  Under the current prevailing standard of care, treatment with DAA drugs “is \nexpected to benefit nearly all chronically infected persons” and the CDC, AASLD, and ISDA \nrecommend treatment for all patients with chronic HCV infection.  \nMethods for Determining Progression of Fibrosis/Cirrhosis \n76.  A person is generally diagnosed with HCV through a rapid blood test in which the \nblood is examined for HCV antibodies. A follow-up blood test determines whether the genetic \nmaterial (RNA) of the Hepatitis C virus remains in the blood. Finally, a third blood test can \ndetermine which variation, or genotype, of HCV a person has.  \n77.  These diagnostic tests are different from the test(s) used to determine the \nprogression of a person’s fibrosis or cirrhosis.  \n78.  The severity of a person’s fibrosis or cirrhosis should never be used to determine \nwhether a person should be treated.  \n15 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 15 of 35\n\n79.  Although the standard of care is to treat all persons with chronic HCV with DAA \ndrugs, it is still useful to determine the progression (staging) of fibrosis and/or cirrhosis in the \nliver to choose among the DAA drugs for the most appropriate treatment module for HCV, to \ntreat other conditions or complications a person may be experiencing, and to advise patients \nabout contraindications and drugs to avoid.  \n80.  Health care providers use several methods to determine the advancement of a \nHCV-positive person’s cirrhosis or fibrosis. These methods include, but are not limited to: \na.  Liver biopsy – a surgery where a provider removes a small sample of liver tissue \nand undertakes a histological assessment \nb.  APRI (AST to Platelet Ratio Index) – using a blood sample, a ratio derived using \nthe level of a certain enzyme in the blood, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and \ncomparing it to (1) usual amount of AST in the blood of a healthy person and (2) \nthe number of platelets in the affected person’s blood \nc.  FIB-4 – using a blood sample, a ratio derived using the level of two enzymes in \nthe blood, AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as platelet count and \nthe person’s age \nd.  FibroScan – a type of ultrasound known as transient elastography, which images a \nseveral-centimeter mass of liver tissue \n81.  When an APRI score is extremely high, it has good diagnostic utility in predicting \nsevere fibrosis or cirrhosis, but low and mid-range scores miss many people who have significant \nfibrosis or cirrhosis.  \n16 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 16 of 35\n\n82.  For instance, in more than 90% of cases, an APRI score of at least 2.0 indicates \nthat a person has cirrhosis. But more than half of people with cirrhosis will not have an APRI \nscore of at least 2.0. \n83.  Where a person has been diagnosed with cirrhosis through some other means, an \nAPRI score is irrelevant and using an APRI score to measure the progression of fibrosis is \nunnecessary.  \n84.  In addition, because the levels of AST and ALT fluctuate from day to day, a \ndecreased or normalized level does not mean the condition has improved, and even a series of \nnormal readings over time may fail to accurately show the level of fibrosis or cirrhosis.  \n85.  Furthermore, not only do the levels of elevation of AST and ALT often fail to \nshow the current level of fibrosis or cirrhosis, they also often fail to predict the eventual \noutcomes of a failure to treat the disease in a specific person.   \n86.  Moreover, an APRI score relies only on AST and fails to take into account ALT, \neven though—because ALT is found predominately in the liver and not all over the body like \nAST—ALT is a more specific indicator of liver inflammation than AST.  \n87.  For all these reasons, using APRI score alone to determine the severity of a \nperson’s fibrosis or cirrhosis is not adequate or appropriate. \nHCV Treatment Policy of Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon \n88.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of not \nproviding DAA drug treatment to all inmates with HCV, or even all inmates with chronic HCV, \nin contravention of the prevailing standard of care and in deliberate indifference to the serious \nmedical need for treatment.  \n17 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 17 of 35\n\n89.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of using an \nAPRI score—which measures the progression of fibrosis or cirrhosis—to determine whether a \nperson should be treated, in contravention of the prevailing standard of care and in deliberate in \ndifference to serious medical need. \n90.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of not \nundertaking liver biopsies, FIB-4, FibroScan, or other methods of determining the stage of \nfibrosis or cirrhosis and relying exclusively on APRI score to determine that stage, in \ncontravention of the prevailing standard of care and in deliberate indifference to serious medical \nneed.  \n91.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of failing to \neven consider providing treatment to HCV-positive inmates unless they have an “APRI score” \nabove 2.0 that persists for several months, even though more than half of persons with cirrhosis \nwill not have an APRI score at or above 2.0 and they know that AST levels are transient, in \ncontravention of the prevailing standard of care and in deliberate indifference to serious medical \nneed. \n92.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of \ndisregarding independent diagnoses of cirrhosis or significant hepatitic fibrosis in making \ntreatment decisions, in contravention of the prevailing standard of care and in deliberate \nindifference to serious medical need.  \n93.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of basing \ntreatment decisions on cost, rather than on need for treatment, in contravention of the prevailing \nstandard of care and in deliberate indifference to serious medical need.  \n18 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 18 of 35\n\n94.  These policies or customs have caused, and continue to cause, unnecessary and \nwanton infliction of pain and an unreasonable risk of serious damage to the health of HCV-\npositive inmates. \n95.  Contrary to the proper and necessary medical procedures and the community \nstandard of care, Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have repeatedly denied requests by \nPlaintiffs Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson, and by other members of the class, for the appropriate \nand medically necessary direct-acting antiviral treatment for their Hepatitis C infections.  \n96.  Instead, Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon classify inmates with known \nHCV infection as “Chronic Care Clinic Offenders.” Instead of receiving treatment, these inmates \nreceive a blood draw every six months and, at times, minimal counseling.  \n97.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of failing to \nrequire appropriate counsel of HCV-positive patients, and continuity of care across the DOC \nsystem, related to contraindications for other medications that exacerbate liver damage, in \ncontravention of the prevailing standard of care and in deliberate indifference to serious medical \nneed. \n98.  Defendants Lombardi, MDOC, and Corizon have a policy or custom of permitting \n“Chronic Care Clinic” visits with HCV-positive inmates to be conducted by videoconference, so \na visual and physical inspection of the liver cannot be undertaken, in contravention of the \nprevailing standard of care and in deliberate indifference to serious medical need.  \n99.  Upon information and belief, MDOC receives additional funding from the State \nof Missouri for inmates classified as “Chronic Care Clinic Offenders” even though the additional \nmonitoring HCV-positive inmates receive is minimal and, in most cases, they receive no \nadditional treatment.   \n19 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 19 of 35\n\nPlaintiff Michael Postawko \n100.  Postawko became infected with HCV while under the care and supervision of \nMDOC, in or around 2012.   \n101.  Postawko was asymptomatic for approximately one-and-one half to two years and \nsigned paperwork indicating that he refused treatment for HCV.   \n102.  Sometime in 2014, he began experiencing adverse symptoms and requested \ntreatment at a Chronic Care visit with Defendant Davison.  \n103.  Defendants Davison and every other treater Postawko has seen at MDOC or who \nhas reviewed his HCV-related complaints, including Defendants Pryor, Proctor, Hardman, Jones, \nStieferman, Bredeman, Cofield and Does I–III, have acted with deliberate indifference and have \nrefused to treat Postawko with DAA drugs in contravention of the prevailing standard of care.  \n104.  Postawko is experiencing serious symptoms consistent with HCV symptoms. He \nis thoroughly racked with fatigue to the point that brushing his teeth causes intense aching in his \narm muscles; he also experiences fever, abdominal pain, severe headaches, almost constant joint \npain, and has dark urine with what appears to be traces of blood. Medications he receives for his \nsevere headaches, sumatriptan and propranolol HCL, are only about 50% to 60% effective.  \n105.  To date, Postawko has received no treatment for HCV.  \n106.  Although Postawko has requested treatment multiple times and has submitted \nsubstantial evidence of his attempts to complete the MDOC grievance process, this Court found \nthat “he has either not received timely responses or received responses that violated prison \npolicy,” so he has exhausted his administrative remedies.  \nPlaintiff Christopher Baker \n107.  In 2005, Plaintiff Christopher Baker was diagnosed with HCV.  \n20 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 20 of 35\n\n108.  In 2007, Baker underwent a liver biopsy and was diagnosed with cirrhosis at the \nUniversity of Missouri Hospital in Columbia, Missouri.  \n109.  In 2008, Baker was sentenced to ten years in MDOC for a repeat offense of \ndriving while intoxicated.  \n110.  In 2009, MDOC began treating Baker with the then-prevailing treatment, \ninterferon and ribavirin, and it appeared to be working.  \n111.  However, after five months of treatment, MDOC—through a provider named Dr. \nMcKinney—informed Baker that MDOC was no longer treating HCV-positive inmates with \ninterferon and ribavirin and discontinued Baker’s course of treatment.  \n112.  Since early 2010, Baker has received no further treatment for HCV and has \nreceived no treatment at any time with a DAA drug.  \n113.  Each treater Baker has seen at MDOC or who has denied his HCV-related \ncomplaints, including Defendants Stamps, Jones, Aguilera, Bredeman, Cofield, Rucker, Wilhite, \nBoley, Hardy, and Does I–III, has acted with deliberate indifference and has refused to treat \nBaker with DAA drugs in contravention of the prevailing standard of care.  \n114.  On March 2, 2016, while Baker was incarcerated at Jefferson City Correctional \nCenter, an Informal Resolution Request response to Baker indicates that he was “placed on \nspreadsheet” because he had an APRI score above 1.0 (without regard for his independent \ndiagnosis of cirrhosis by liver biopsy before incarceration).  \n115.  However, no treatment resulted.  \n116.  In July, Baker was transferred from JCCC to Algoa Correctional Center, where he \nno longer appears even on any list for treatment.  \n21 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 21 of 35\n\n117.  Baker is experiencing serious symptoms consistent with HCV symptoms. He has \nnausea, severe joint pain, extreme fatigue, back and chest pain, tenderness in the area of his liver, \nand dark urine. \n118.  Baker has completed the grievance process several times. He has exhausted his \nadministrative remedies.  \nPlaintiff Michael Jamerson \n119.  Plaintiff Michael Jamerson became infected with HCV while under the care and \nsupervision of MDOC. \n120.  In 2015, at his request, Jamerson was tested for HCV. \n121.  Jamerson has repeatedly requested treatment with DAA drugs, including Harvoni. \n122.  Although Jamerson is enrolled in the Hepatitis C Chronic Care Clinic, he has not \nreceived treatment with any DAA drug.  \n123.  Defendants Williams, Campbell, Fipps, Baker, Bredeman, Yates, Julie Unknown, \nDoes I-III, and every other medical provider Jamerson has seen at MDOC or who has directed \nhis course of treatment, have acted with deliberate indifference and have refused to treat \nJamerson with DAA drugs in contravention of the prevailing standard of care. \n124.  Jamerson is currently experiencing serious symptoms consistent with HCV \nsymptoms, including fatigue, muscle and joint pain, pain in his stomach and liver area, and chest \npain. He has severe joint pain and extreme fatigue, back and chest pain, tenderness in the area of \nhis liver \n125.  To date, Jamerson has not received any treatment for his HCV.  \n126.  Jamerson has exhausted his administrative remedies.  \n22 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 22 of 35\n\nClass Action Allegations \n127.  Plaintiffs bring their class for prospective relief against MDOC, Corizon, and \nLombardi as a class action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated pursuant to \nRules 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  \n128.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class on claims for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief: individuals in the custody of MDOC who have been or will be diagnosed with \nHCV but who are not provided treatment with DAA drugs. \n129.  As a result of Defendants MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon’s deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of the class, members of the class are or will be \nsubjected to cruel and unusual punishment and deprived of their constitutional and statutory \nrights. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy Defendants’ illegal and \nunconstitutional actions, policies and customs, and practices.  \n130.  The information as to the precise size of the class and the identity of the inmates \nwho are in the class is in the exclusive control of Defendants MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon. \nThe class encompasses thousands of individuals under the custody of MDOC, who are \ngeographically dispersed throughout the State of Missouri. The number of persons who are \nmembers of the class described above are so numerous that joinder of all members in one action \nis impracticable. \n131.  Because the Class seeks prospective relief only, questions of law and fact that are \ncommon to the entire Class predominate over individual questions because the actions of \nDefendants MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon complained of herein were generally applicable to \nthe entire class. These legal and factual questions include, but are not limited to:  \n23 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 23 of 35\n\nA.  Whether Defendants MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon maintain a policy or custom of \nwithholding treatment with DAA drugs from individuals in the custody of MDOC \nwho have been or will be diagnosed with HCV; \nB.  Whether the policy and custom of MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon of withholding \ntreatment with DAA drugs from individuals in the custody of MDOC who have been \ndiagnosed with HCV constitutes deliberate indifference to a serious medical need; \nand \nC.   Whether the policy and custom of MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon of withholding \ntreatment with DAA drugs from individuals in the custody of MDOC who have been \ndiagnosed with HCV discriminates based on their diagnosis in that MDOC, \nLombardi, and Corizon do not have a custom or policy of withholding life-saving \ntreatment from inmates with illnesses other than HCV. \n132.  Plaintiffs’ claims for prospective relief are typical of the members of the class \nbecause Plaintiffs and all class members are subject to ongoing harm by the same wrongful \npolicy and custom of Defendants MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon of withholding treatment from \nthem. Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same practices and course of conduct that give rise to the \nclaims of the class members, and they are based on the same legal theories. \n133.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Plaintiffs \nhave no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the Class they seek to represent. \nPlaintiffs are represented by competent and skilled counsel whose interests are fully aligned with \nthe interests of the Class. \n134.  Relief concerning Plaintiffs’ rights under the laws herein alleged and with respect \nto the Class would be proper. Defendants MDOC, Lombardi, and Corizon have acted or refused \n24 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 24 of 35\n\nto act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief with regard to Class Members as a whole and \ncertification of the Class under Rule 23(b)(2) proper. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nClass-Action Claim for Prospective Relief for \nDeprivation of Eighth Amendment Right to Medical Care \n(Plaintiff Class against Defendants Lombardi and Corizon) \n135.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n136.  Defendants’ acts and omissions in failing to provide adequate medical care, and \ndelaying care, constitute deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners \ninfected with HCV, and they thereby violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court:  \nA.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendants Lombardi and Corizon’s policy \nof withholding treatment with DAA drugs from inmates diagnosed with HCV \nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution;  \nB.  Enter preliminary and permanent injunctions directing that: (a) Defendants \nLombardi and Corizon formulate and implement an HCV treatment policy \nthat meets the prevailing standard of care, including identifying persons with \nHCV; (b) Defendants Lombardi and Corizon treat members of the Class with \nappropriate DAA drugs; and (c) Defendants Lombardi and Corizon provide \nmembers of the class an appropriate and accurate assessment of the level of \nfibrosis or cirrhosis they have, counseling on drug-drug interactions, and \n25 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 25 of 35\n\nongoing medical care for complications and symptoms of HCV; and (d) any \nfurther appropriate injunctions to prevent the future deprivation of rights of \nmembers of the plaintiff class; \nC.  Award Plaintiffs’ costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988 and other relevant provisions of law; and \nD.  Allow such other and further relief to which Plaintiffs may be entitled. \nCOUNT II \nClass-Action Claim for Prospective Relief for \nViolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(Plaintiff Class against Defendant MDOC) \n \n137.  Paragraphs 1–136 are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n138.  Subtitle A of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits \npublic entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities in their programs, services, \nand activities. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134.  Regulations implementing subtitle A are codified at \n28 C.F.R. part 35. \n139.  Title II’s definition of “public entity” includes any state or local government or \n“any department, agency . . . or other instrumentality” of a state or local government. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1)(A), (B). \n140.  Defendant MDOC is a “public entity” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1)(A) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n141.  Each member of the Class has a disability within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(1) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n142.  Each member of the Class is “a qualified individual with a disability” within the \nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104 because they meet the essential \neligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities \n26 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 26 of 35\n\nprovided by MDOC other than the fact that they require reasonable modifications to rules, \npolicies, or practices, the removal of barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services. \n143.  MDOC subjects members of the Class to discrimination by withholding medically \nappropriate treatment that will likely cure their disability, although MDOC does not without life-\nsaving treatments from individuals with different disabilities. This denial of treatment and \ndiscrimination violates 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (and the regulations promulgated under it - 28 C.F.R. \nPart 35) which states: “Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by any such entity.” \n144.  As a result of Defendant MDOC’s violations of the ADA and its implementing \nregulations, Defendant MDOC is liable to Plaintiffs for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 12133. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court:  \nA.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendant MDOC’s policy of withholding \ntreatment with DAA drugs from inmates diagnosed with HCV violates the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act;  \nB.  Enter preliminary and permanent injunctions directing that: (a) Defendant \nMDOC formulate and implement an HCV treatment policy that meets the \nprevailing standard of care, including identifying persons with HCV; (b) \nDefendant MDOC treat members of the Class with appropriate DAA drugs; \nand (c) Defendant MDOC provide members of the class an appropriate and \naccurate assessment of the level of fibrosis or cirrhosis they have, counseling \n27 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 27 of 35\n\non drug-drug interactions, and ongoing medical care for complications and \nsymptoms of HCV; and (d) any further appropriate injunctions to prevent the \nfuture deprivation of rights of members of the plaintiff class.  \nC.  Award Plaintiffs’ costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees under 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794a and other relevant provisions of law; and \nD.  Allow such other and further relief to which Plaintiffs may be entitled. \nCOUNT III \nClaim for Damages for  \nDeprivation of Eighth Amendment Right to Medical Care \n(Plaintiff Postawko against Defendants Lombardi, Corizon, Pryor, Proctor, Hardman, \nDavison, Stieferman, Bredeman, Cofield, and Does I-III) \n \n145.  Paragraphs 1–106 and 135–136 are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n146.  The acts and omissions of Defendants Pryor, Proctor, Hardman, Davison, \nStieferman, Bredeman, Cofield, and Does I-III in failing to provide adequate medical care, and \ndelaying care, to Plaintiff Postawko constitute deliberate indifference to the serious medical \nneeds of prisoners infected with HCV, and they thereby violate the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.   \n147.  At all times relevant, Plaintiff Postawko had a serious medical need for \ntreatment of his HCV with DAA drugs. \n148.  At all times relevant, Defendants Pryor, Proctor, Hardman, Davison, \nStieferman, Bredeman, Cofield, and Does I-III were aware of Plaintiff Postawko’s serious need \nfor medical care. \n149.  At all times relevant, Defendants Pryor, Proctor, Hardman, Davison, \nStieferman, Bredeman, Cofield, and Does I-III acted with deliberate indifference, failed to \nprovide the medical care, or failed to direct that the medical care be provided. \n28 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 28 of 35\n\n150.  As a direct result of the failure of Defendants Pryor, Proctor, Hardman, \nDavison, Stieferman, Bredeman, Cofield, and Does I-III to provide care or direct that care be \ngiven, Plaintiff Postawko was harmed. \n151.  In addition, in their actions described herein, Defendants Pryor, Proctor, \nHardman, Davison, Stieferman, Bredeman, Cofield, and Does I-III acted pursuant to and in \naccordance with the policy and custom of Defendants Lombardi and Corizon to withhold \ntreatment with DAA drugs from persons diagnosed with HCV. \nWHEREFORE Plaintiff Postawko prays this Court: \nA.  Award him compensatory damages; \nB.  Award his costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988 and other relevant provisions of law; and \nC.  Allow such other and further relief to which he may be entitled. \nCOUNT IV \nClaim for Damages for \nViolation of Americans with Disabilities Act \n(Plaintiff Postawko against Defendant Missouri Department of Corrections) \n \n152.  Paragraphs 1–106 and 135–151 are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \nWHEREFORE Plaintiff Postawko prays this Court: \nA.  Award him compensatory damages; \nB.  Award Plaintiffs’ costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees under 29 \nU.S.C. § 794a and other relevant provisions of law; and \nC.  Allow such other and further relief to which he may be entitled. \n29 \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 30   Filed 12/15/16   Page 29 of 35\n\nCOUNT V \nClaim for Damages for  \nDeprivation of Eighth Amendment Right to Medical Care \n(Plaintiff Baker against Defendants Lombardi, Corizon, Aguilera, Stamps, Jones, \nBredeman, Cofield, Rucker, Wilhite, Boley, Hardy, and Does I-III) \n \n153.  Paragraphs 1–99, 107–118, and 135–136 are incorporated as if fully set forth \nherein. \n154.  The acts and omissions of Defendants Aguilera, Stamps, Jones, Bredeman, \nCofield, Rucker, Wilhite, Boley, Hardy, and Does I-III in failing to provide adequate medical \ncare, and delaying care, to Plaintiff Baker constitute deliberate indifference to the serious \nmedical needs of prisoners infected with HCV, and they thereby violate the Eighth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution.   \n155.

[Doc. 77].  For the following reasons, the motion is granted.   \nI.    Background \n  Named  Plaintiffs  Michael  Postawko,  Christopher  Baker,  and  Michael  Jamerson  are \nincarcerated in the Missouri Department of Corrections (“MDOC”).  [Doc. 30, p. 3].  They filed \nthis putative class action for claims arising out of what they allege to be inadequate medical care \nfor their chronic Hepatitis C (“HCV”) viral infections.  [Id.].  They bring claims under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 and the Eighth Amendment, as well as Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(ADA).  [Id. at p. 4-9].  They named numerous defendants, including their prison treating \nphysicians and nurses; prison officials who reviewed their grievances and treatment requests; the \nMDOC; and Corizon, LLC, the healthcare provider for all MDOC facilities.  [Id.]. \n  A.   Hepatitis C  \n  HCV is a viral infection that attacks the liver and causes its inflammation, referred to as \nhepatitis.  [Id. at p. 9].  Hepatitis caused by HCV can significantly impair liver function and \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 1 of 35\n\ndamage its crucial role in digesting nutrients, filtering toxins from the blood, and preventing \ndisease.    [Id.].    In  turn,  liver  impairment  can  cause  severe  pain,  fatigue,  muscle  wasting, \ndifficulty or pain with urination, an increased risk of heart attacks, and other side effects.  [Id.].   \n  HCV can be either acute or chronic.  [Id.].  Some people who are exposed to infected \nblood develop an acute infection that their body resolves without treatment, while others who \ndevelop acute HCV go on to develop chronic HCV.  [Id. at p. 10].  People with chronic HCV \ndevelop fibrosis of the liver, which is a process by which healthy liver tissue is replaced with \nscarring.  [Id.].  Because scar tissue cannot perform the jobs of normal liver cells, fibrosis \nreduces liver function.  [Id.].   \n  When scar tissue begins to take over most of the liver, this extensive fibrosis is termed \ncirrhosis.  [Id.].  Cirrhosis is irreversible, and it often causes additional painful complications, \nincluding  arthritic  pain  throughout  the  body,  kidney  disease,  jaundice,  fluid  retention  with \nedema, internal bleeding, easy bruising, abdominal ascites, mental confusion, lymph disorders, \nwidespread itching, and even more extreme fatigue.   [Id.].  Because  it can be difficult to \ndetermine  exactly  when  significant  hepatitis  fibrosis  becomes  cirrhosis,  most  of  these \ncomplications can occur before cirrhosis.  [Id.].  Further, if these complications go untreated, \nsome can cause death.  [Id.].  At least half of all persons diagnosed with chronic HCV will \ndevelop cirrhosis or liver cancer, and between 70 and 90 percent will develop chronic liver \ndisease.  [Id.].  Each day without treatment increases a person’s likelihood of developing chronic \nliver disease, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death from liver failure.  [Id.]. \n  At least 10 to 15 percent of the population under the supervision, care, and custody of the \nMDOC are infected with HCV.  [Id. at p. 11].  As of January 2015, the MDOC reported that it \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 2 of 35\n\nwas treating 0.11 percent of HCV-positive inmates under its supervision, or 5 inmates out of \n4,736 inmates with known HCV infections.  [Id.].   \n  B.  Standard of Care for HCV  \n  For many years, there was no effective and safe treatment for HCV.  [Id.].  The standard \ntreatment, which included the use of interferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure most \npatients and was associated with adverse side effects, including psychiatric and autoimmune \ndisorders.  [Id. at p. 12].  However, over the past four years, the Federal Drug Administration \n(“FDA”)  has  approved  eight  new  medications,  called  direct-acting  antiviral  drugs  (“DAA \ndrugs”), which work faster, cause fewer side effects, and are more effective.  [Id.].  Over 90 \npercent of patients treated with a DAA drug are cured.  [Id. at p. 14].     \n  The CDC encourages health professionals to follow the evidence-based standard of care \ndeveloped  by  the  Infectious  Diseases  Society  of  America  (“IDSA”)  and  the  American \nAssociation for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”), which constitutes the medical standard \nof care.  [Id.].  On July 6, 2016, these organizations updated the standard of care to recommend \ntreating all persons with chronic HCV with DAA drugs.  [Id. at p. 15].  Benefits of treatment \ninclude  an  immediate  decrease  in  liver  inflammation,  reduction  in  the  progression  of  liver \nfibrosis and improvement in cirrhosis, a 70 percent reduction in the risk of liver cancer, and a 90 \npercent reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality.  [Id.].  Studies show that a delay in DAA \ndrug treatment for HCV decreases the benefits associated with cure.  [Id.].   \n  C.  Methods for Determining Progression of Fibrosis/Cirrhosis \n  Health care providers use several methods to determine the advancement of an HCV-\npositive person’s cirrhosis or fibrosis, including liver biopsy and APRI (AST to Platelet Ratio \nIndex).  [Id. at p. 16].  APRI is the use of a blood sample to determine the ratio of a certain \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 3 of 35\n\nenzyme in the blood to the number of platelets.  [Id.].  When an APRI score is very high, it has \ngood diagnostic utility in predicting severe fibrosis or cirrhosis, but low and mid-range scores \nmiss many people who have significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.  [Id.].  For example, in more than 90 \npercent of cases, an APRI score of at least 2.0 indicates that a person has cirrhosis, but more than \nhalf of all people with cirrhosis will not have an APRI score of at least 2.0.  [Id. at 17].    \n  If a person has already been diagnosed with cirrhosis through some other means, such as \nliver biopsy, an APRI score is irrelevant and not necessary for measuring the progression of \nfibrosis.  [Id.].  In addition, because the levels of AST and ALT in one’s blood fluctuate from \nday to day, a decreased or normalized level does not mean the condition has improved, and even \na series of normal readings over time may fail to accurately show the level of fibrosis or \ncirrhosis.  [Id.].  Furthermore, the elevation levels of AST and ALT often fail to show an \nindividual’s current level of fibrosis or cirrhosis, and they often fail to predict the consequences \nof not treating that individual.  [Id.].   Although ALT is found predominately in the liver and not \nall over the body like AST, and ALT is a more specific indicator of liver inflammation than \nAST, an APRI score relies only on AST without taking ALT into account.  [Doc. 30, p. 17].  For \nall of these reasons, using an APRI score alone to determine the severity of a person’s fibrosis or \ncirrhosis is not adequate or appropriate.  [Id.].   \n  D.  Defendants’ HCV Treatment Policy within the MDOC \n  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants Precythe, MDOC, and Corizon, LLC have the \nfollowing policies or customs, all of which are contrary to the prevailing standard of care: (1) not \nproviding DAA drug treatment to all inmates with chronic HCV; (2) using an APRI score, which \nmeasures the progression of fibrosis or cirrhosis, to determine whether a person should be \ntreated; (3) relying exclusively on APRI score to determine the stage of fibrosis or cirrhosis, \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 4 of 35\n\nrather than using other more accurate methods of determining its progression through liver \nbiopsies,  FIB-4,  or  FibroScan;  (4)  failing  to  consider  providing  treatment  to  HCV-positive \ninmates unless they have an APRI score above 2.0 that persists for several months, even though \nmore than half of persons with cirrhosis will not have an APRI score at or above 2.0, and they \nknow that AST levels  are transient; (5) disregarding independent  diagnoses of cirrhosis or \nsignificant  hepatitis  fibrosis  in  making  their  treatment  decisions;  and  (6)  basing  treatment \ndecisions on cost, rather than on need for treatment.  [Id. at p. 17-18].  Plaintiffs allege that these \npolicies or customs have caused, and continue to cause, unnecessary pain and an unreasonable \nrisk of serious damage to the health of HCV-positive inmates.  [Id. at p. 18].  As evidence of \nsome of these policies, Plaintiffs submitted eight  grievance and informal resolution request \n(“IRR”) responses to inmates’ requests for DAA treatment.  [Doc. 132-6].  These IRR responses \nreflect that DAA treatment was denied to each inmate due to their individual APRI scores, \nincluding to Named Plaintiff Chris Baker, despite his independent diagnosis of cirrhosis.1  [Id.].  \n  Defendants  have  repeatedly  denied  the  requests  of  the  Named  Plaintiffs  and  other \nmembers of the putative class for DAA drug treatment for their HCV infections.  [Id. at p. 19].  It \nis the policy of Defendants to classify inmates with known HCV infection as “Chronic Care \nClinic Offenders.”  [Id.].  Rather than receiving DAA treatment, these inmates receive a blood \ndraw every six months and, at times, minimal counseling.  [Id.].   \n  E.  Named Plaintiffs Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson’s Claims \n  Named Plaintiff Michael Postawko became infected with HCV while under the care and \nsupervision of the MDOC in or around 2012.  [Id. at p. 20].  Every Defendant treater who \n                                                           \n1 For this reason, the Court rejects Defendant Corizon’s unsupported contention within a footnote \nin its sur-reply that these grievance records are somehow “immaterial.”  [Doc. 142, p. 7 of 16, n. \n1]. \n5 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 5 of 35\n\nPostawko has seen at the MDOC or who has reviewed his HCV-related complaints has refused \nto treat Postawko with DAA drugs.  [Id.].   \n  In 2005, Named Plaintiff Christopher Baker was diagnosed with HCV, and in 2007, he \nunderwent a liver biopsy and was diagnosed with cirrhosis.  [Id. at p. 21].  In 2008, Baker was \nsentenced to ten years in the MDOC.  [Id.].  In 2009, the MDOC began treating Baker with the \nthen-prevailing  treatment,  interferon  and  ribavirin,  which  appeared  to  be  working.    [Id.].  \nHowever, after five months of treatment, the MDOC, through a provider named Dr. McKinney, \ninformed Baker that the MDOC was no longer treating HCV-positive inmates with those drugs \nand discontinued Baker’s course of treatment.  [Id.].  Since early 2010, Baker has received no \nfurther treatment for HCV and has received no treatment at any time with a DAA drug.  [Id.].   \n  On March 2, 2016, while Baker was incarcerated at  JCCC, an Informal Resolution \nRequest response to Baker indicates that he was “placed on a spreadsheet” because he had an \nAPRI score above 1.0, without regard to his pre-incarceration cirrhosis diagnosis, which was \nmade based on a liver biopsy.  [Id.].  Baker did not receive any treatment as a result of either his \nindependent cirrhosis diagnosis or his placement on a spreadsheet. [Id.].  In July 2016, Baker \nwas transferred from JCCC to Algoa Correctional Center where he no longer even appears on a \nlist for treatment.  [Id.].   \n  Named Plaintiff Michael Jamerson became infected with HCV while incarcerated at the \nMDOC.  [Id.].  Jamerson has repeatedly requested treatment with DAA drugs.  [Id.].  Although \nJamerson is enrolled in the Chronic Care Clinic, he has not received any DAA treatment.  [Id.].   \n  F.  The Proposed Class \n  The Named Plaintiffs seek certification of a class of similarly situated individuals in the \ncustody of the Missouri Department of Corrections, defined as: \n6 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 6 of 35\n\nAll those individuals in the custody of MDOC, now or in the future, who have \nbeen, or will be, diagnosed with chronic HCV,2 as that term is defined medically, \nbut who are not provided treatment with direct acting antiviral drugs. \n \n  Plaintiffs bring two claims on behalf of the putative class: Count I for prospective relief \nfor deprivation of their Eighth Amendment rights against Precythe, in her official capacity, and \nCorizon, LLC, and Count II for prospective relief for violation of the ADA against the MDOC.3  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ “policy of withholding \ntreatment with DAA drugs from inmates diagnosed with HCV violates the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments” and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  [Doc. 30, p. 25 and 27 ¶¶ 136, 144 \n(Second  Amended  Complaint)].    Plaintiffs  seek  injunctions  that  (1)  direct  Defendants  to \n“formulate and implement an HCV treatment policy that meets the prevailing standard of care, \nincluding identifying persons with HCV”; (2) direct Defendants to “treat members of the class \nwith appropriate DAA drugs”; and (3) direct Defendants to “provide members of the class an \nappropriate and accurate assessment of the level of fibrosis or cirrhosis they have, counseling on \ndrug-drug interactions, and ongoing medical care for complications and symptoms of HCV.”  Id. \nII.  Discussion \nA.    Class Certification Standard  \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, a motion for class certification involves a two-\npart analysis.  First, under Rule 23(a), the proposed class must satisfy the requirements of \n                                                           \n2 Because Plaintiffs concede that some minority of persons exposed to the Hepatitis C virus clear \nthe virus without treatment, they “do not oppose amending their proposed definition of the \nputative  Class  to  include  only  persons  with  chronic  Hepatitis  C  as  that  term  is  defined \nmedically.”  [Doc. 148, p. 3 (emphasis added)].  Accordingly, the Court considers this narrower \nclass definition in its Rule 23 analysis, rather than Plaintiffs’ original class definition for “all \nindividuals . . . diagnosed with HCV . . .”   \n3  Plaintiffs  also  bring  individual  claims  (Counts  III-VIII)  for  damages  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment and the ADA. \n \n7 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 7 of 35\n\n“numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  fair  and  adequate  representation.”    Luiken  v. \nDomino’s Pizza, LLC, 705 F.3d 370, 372 (8th Cir. 2013).  Second, the proposed class must meet \nat least one of the three requirements of Rule 23(b).  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S.Ct. 1426, \n1432 (2013).  \nPlaintiffs carry the burden to show the class should be certified.  See Luiken, 705 F.3d at \n372.  This burden is met only if, “after a rigorous analysis,” the Court is convinced the Rule 23 \nrequirements are satisfied.  Comcast, 133 S.Ct. at 1432 (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 341 (2011)).  Rigorous analysis may further “entail some overlap with the merits \nof  the  plaintiff’s  underlying  claim,”  because  “[t]he  class  determination  generally  involves \nconsiderations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff’s cause \nof action.”  Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982)).   However, \nthe  Court’s  inquiry  on  a  motion  for  class  certification  is  “tentative,”  “preliminary,”  and \n“limited.”  In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Prod. Liab. Litig., 644 F.3d 604, 613 (8th Cir. 2011). “Rule \n23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.”  \nAmgen Inc. v. Connecticut Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 1194-95 (2013). “Merits \nquestions may be considered to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant to \ndetermining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”  Id. \n  At the outset, Defendants contend that certification should be denied because Plaintiffs \nfailed  to  submit  any  evidence  in  support  of  class  certification  and  rely  entirely  on  their \nComplaint.  The Court rejects this argument because Plaintiffs have submitted evidence to \nsupport  their  class  certification  request.    Further,  there  is  no  rule  that  requires  admissible \nevidence be submitted to support a  class certification motion.   \nWhile Rule 23 “does not set forth a mere pleading standard,” Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, \n8 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 8 of 35\n\n133 S.Ct. 1426, 1432 (2013), there is nothing in the rule that mandates evidence must be \nsubmitted to support a request for class certification.  The Rules Enabling Act is the method for \nchanging the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Court declines to create an evidentiary \nburden that is clearly not contemplated by Rule 23.  Such a significant requirement would not \nhave been included without debate, and without any explicit reference, particularly because far \nmore mundane things are explicitly included in the Rules.  While a plaintiff must “be prepared to \nprove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, \ntypicality of claims or defenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by Rule 23(a),” id., \nthe operative word is “be prepared” to prove the requirements of the Rule.  It would be a leap to \nconstrue “be prepared” to mean that the party seeking class certification in fact must submit \nevidence and that the Court must resolve every potential evidentiary dispute before addressing \nthe issue of class certification.   \nTo create a rule that required evidence, much less admissible evidence, to be submitted at \nthe class certification stage, would turn a class certification motion into something akin to a \nmotion for summary judgment, which would be inconsistent with an expeditious resolution of \nclass certification.  While Rule 23 was changed to say class certification motions should be \nresolved as early as “practicable,” a full evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed issues of fact \nwould effectively result in class certification being resolved at the same time as the merits, and \nonly after discovery.  It would never be “practical” to resolve the issue expeditiously or early.   \nSuch a requirement would also increase the risk for inconsistent factual findings.  For \nexample, if in this case the Court were to find as a matter of fact that there was a policy \nconcerning Hepatitis C drugs, and the jury later found that  there was no such policy, the \ninconsistent factual findings would undermine confidence in the judicial process.  Our rules of \n9 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 9 of 35\n\nprocedure, both modern and ancient, were designed to avoid factual inconsistencies.  While the \nissue of subject matter and personal jurisdiction disputes might require a court to resolve facts, \nrarely will those issues be intertwined with the merits of the case.  \nFinally, it may increase the work of the parties and the court unnecessarily.  A court \ncannot  grant  a  motion  for  class  certification  without  a  rigorous  analysis  of  each  of  the \nrequirements of Rule 23.  If plaintiffs are required to introduce evidence as to each Rule 23 \nfactor, even though the dispute eventually deals with a legal question or narrow factual issue, the \nburden is substantially increased.  Producing evidence and resolving evidentiary disputes is time \nconsuming.  That is particularly difficult at the beginning of a lawsuit when the parameters of the \ndispute are undeveloped.  In many cases, such as the one before the Court, there is enough in the \nComplaint to make it plausible that the plaintiff will be able to produce evidence to prove the \nallegations contained in the Complaint. Requiring the plaintiff to go further and actually submit \nevidence and have the Court resolve any evidentiary disputes is a burden to the system without \nany suggestion of how the benefit outweighs that burden.  There may be circumstances when a \ncourt concludes that it cannot meet its obligation to conduct a rigorous analysis without evidence \nor an evidentiary hearing.  Such circumstances do not exist here.  Therefore, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs were not required to produce evidence to support their motion.  Nonetheless, the \nPlaintiffs did produce evidence and the Court therefore turns to that evidence.4 \n                                                           \n4 Although Plaintiffs did not initially support their motion with attached evidence, they did \nsubmit evidence in their reply brief.  As a general rule, the Court does not consider arguments or \nevidence raised for the first time in a reply brief.  Bearden v. Lemon, 475 F.3d 926, 930 (8th Cir. \n2007).  However, because the Court granted Defendants leave to file sur-replies, Defendants had \nan adequate opportunity to respond to this newly submitted evidence.  Therefore, the Court \nconsiders  this  evidence  in  conjunction  with  Plaintiffs’  motion  rather  than  striking  it,  as \nDefendants suggest.  \n10 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 10 of 35\n\nC.   Rule 23(a) \n    1.   Numerosity \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be sufficiently numerous such that joinder of all \nmembers would be impracticable.  In assessing whether the numerosity requirement has been \nmet, courts examine factors such as the number of persons in the proposed class, the nature of \nthe action, the size of the individual claims, and the inconvenience of trying individual claims. \nPaxton v. Union Nat’l Bank, 688 F.2d 552, 561 (8th Cir. 1982).  Joinder of all members may be \nimpracticable where the class includes individuals who may become members in the future but \nwho are currently unidentifiable.  See, e.g., Phillips v. Joint Legis. Committee, 637 F.2d 1014, \n1022 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding that “joinder of unknown individuals is certainly impracticable”).      \nPlaintiffs estimate that there are at least 5,000 inmates incarcerated in the MDOC and \ndiagnosed with HCV but who have not received DAA drug treatment.  As evidence of their \nestimate, Plaintiffs cite a 2016 article from The Wall Street Journal, which estimates that there \nare approximately 5,146 HCV positive persons in the MDOC as of mid-2016, but less than 0.3 \npercent (or 18 total inmates) are receiving HCV treatment.5  [Doc. 132-1, p. 6 of 8].  In addition, \nPlaintiffs  provide  a  medical  journal  article  from  Health  Affairs,  which  is  consistent  with \nPlaintiffs’ estimate.  [Doc. 132-2, p. 5 of 20 (reflecting that between 0.00 and 0.12 percent of all \nMissouri state prisoners with known HCV infections as of January 1, 2015 had received any \ntreatment for HCV, according to an analysis of data from the Hepatitis C and State Prisons \nSurvey)].  The MDOC’s own documents responsive to a 2016 Sunshine Request also reflect \nnumbers consistent with Plaintiffs’ estimate, including that, as of November 2016, there were \n5,200 MDOC inmates in Hepatitis C Chronic Care with only 9 of those inmates started on a \n                                                           \n5 Again, the Court rejects Defendant Corizon’s unsupported assertion within a footnote that this \narticle “does not merit consideration of class certification.”  [Doc. 142, p. 7 of 16, n. 1].   \n11 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 11 of 35\n\nDAA drug (Harvoni or Viekira) and a total of only 12 inmates who completed a course of \nHarvoni or Viekira in 2016.  [Doc. 132-3, p. 8-9 (“MDOC Statewide Hepatitis C Statistics \n2016”)].   \nEven with a conservative estimate, there are likely at least 2,000 members of the class: \nthose  MDOC  inmates  with  chronic  HCV  who  have  not  received  DAA  drug  treatment.6  \nAlthough this evidence does not establish exactly how many class members exist, Plaintiffs are \nnot required to “specify an exact number or to prove the identity of each class member, rather, \n‘the plaintiffs must only show a reasonable estimate of the number of class members.’”  Halbach \nv. Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co., 2007 WL 1018658, at *3 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 2, 2007) \n(quoting Morgan v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., 169 F.R.D. 349, 355 (E.D. Mo. 1996)).  Here, \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable estimate. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ evidence of numerosity would be inadmissible at trial, \nbut  the  admissibility  of  Plaintiffs’  evidence  is  immaterial  at  this  stage,  particularly  where \nDefendants have not identified any contrary evidence to refute that Plaintiffs’ proposed class \nsatisfies the numerosity requirement.  See In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Products Liab. Litig., 644 \nF.3d 604, 611 (8th Cir. 2011) (“We have never required a district court to decide conclusively at \nthe class certification stage what evidence will ultimately be admissible at trial.”).  Furthermore, \nwhatever the evidentiary burden to Plaintiffs, the Eighth Circuit has made clear that this burden \nis something less than the presentation of trial-admissible evidence.  Id. at 613-14 (“Because a \ndecision to certify a class is far from a conclusive judgment on the merits of the case, it is of \n                                                           \n6 The Court arrived at this figure by applying the estimates of Defendant Corizon’s own expert, \nDr. Thomas Bredeman, to the approximately 5,000 MDOC inmates with HCV who are not \nreceiving DAA drug treatment.  Dr. Bredeman stated that between 50 and 80 percent of \nindividuals infected with HCV become chronic.  [Doc. 114-1, p. 2 of 9, ¶ 6].  Therefore, \napplying the conservative end of that estimate—50 percent—to the estimated 5,000 MDOC \ninmates with HCV not receiving DAA treament equates to an estimated 2,500 class members.   \n12 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 12 of 35\n\nnecessity . . . not accompanied by the traditional rules and procedure applicable to civil trials.”) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  \nThe  inmate  populations  at  these  facilities  are  constantly  revolving.    Even  with  a \nconservative estimate of one thousand class members, the number of individual claims, as well \nas the inherently fluid nature of this class, would make it impracticable to require individual \nlawsuits.  Numerosity is satisfied.   \n2.   Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  Plaintiffs must show that their class claims “depend upon a common \ncontention” that “is capable of class wide resolution,” such that “determination of its truth or \nfalsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  \nWal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  But, commonality “‘does not require \nthat every question of law or fact be common to every member of the class . . . and may be \nsatisfied, for example, where the question of law linking the class members is substantially \nrelated  to  the  resolution  of  the  litigation  even  though  the  individuals  are  not  identically \nsituated.’”  Downing v. Goldman Phipps PLLC, 2015 WL 4255342, at *4 (E.D. Mo. July 14, \n2015) (quoting Paxton v. Union Nat’l Bank, 688 F.2d 552, 561 (8th Cir. 1982).   \nIn  Ebert  v.  General  Mills,  Inc.,  823  F.3d  472  (8th  Cir.  2016),  the  Eighth  Circuit \nreaffirmed that “a single common question ‘will do’ for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2).”  Id. at 478  \n(contrasting  the  commonality  requirement  with  the  predominance  prong  of  Rule  23(b)(3)).  \nAlthough commonality was not challenged on appeal in that environmental-contamination case, \nthe Eighth Circuit noted in dicta that it “d[id] not necessarily disagree” with the district court’s \nholding that the defendant’s “standardized conduct of alleged contamination and the remedies \n13 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 13 of 35\n\nsought by the class [were] common to all plaintiffs” for purposes of 23(a)(2).  Id.; DeBoer v. \nMellon Mortg. Co., 64 F.3d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir. 1995) (rejecting defendants’ contention in \nmortgage case that, because class members had “claims of differing strengths,” class failed \ncommonality, and holding instead that because “all class members of the class [were] interested \nin a satisfactory common course of conduct in the future servicing of their loans,” there was \n“declaratory  and  injunctive  nexus  .  .  .  sufficient  to  establish  the  requisite  commonality”).  \nTherefore, even “where the circumstances of each particular class member vary but retain a \ncommon core of factual or legal issues with the rest of the class, commonality exists.”  Parsons \nv. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 675 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).    \n  Commonality is satisfied here.  Plaintiffs seek class certification of whether Defendants’ \npolicy  of  withholding  HCV  treatment,  including  DAA  drugs,  violates  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act and the Eighth Amendment.  To prove their ADA claim, Plaintiffs must show \n(1) that they have a disability as defined by statute; (2) that they are otherwise qualified for the \nbenefit in question—treatment for their HCV; and (3) that they were excluded from the benefit \nbecause of discrimination based upon their disability.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; Randolph \nv. Rodgers, 170 F.3d 850, 857 (8th Cir. 1999).  As to Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim, they \nmust show that Defendants “act[] with deliberate indifference to the prisoner’s serious medical \nneeds.”  Bender v. Regier, 385 F.3d 1133, 1137 (8th Cir. 2005) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 \nU.S. 97, 104) (1976)).  Specifically, Plaintiffs must show (1) that they have an objectively \nserious  medical  need  and  (2)  that  prison  officials  subjectively  know  of,  but  deliberately \ndisregard, that need through the HCV treatment policies and practices alleged by Plaintiffs.  \nDulaney v. Carnahan, 132 F.3d 1234, 1239 (8th Cir. 1997).  “A plaintiff can show deliberate \nindifference  in  the  level  of  care  provided  in  different  ways,  including  by  showing  grossly \n14 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 14 of 35\n\nincompetent or inadequate care,” Smith v. Jenkins, 919 F.2d 90, 93 (8th Cir. 1990), showing a \ndefendant’s decision to take an easier and less efficacious course of treatment, id., or showing a \ndefendant intentionally delayed or denied access to medical care, Meloy v. Bachmeier, 302 F.3d \n845, 849 (8th Cir. 2002).”  Allard v. Baldwin, 779 F.3d 768, 772 (8th Cir. 2015).  In addition, \n“[i]n institutional level challenges to prison health care such as this one, systemic deficiencies \ncan provide the basis for a finding of deliberate indifference.”  Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, \n1505 (11th Cir. 1991).  For example, “[d]eliberate indifference to inmates’ health needs may be \nshown . . . by proving that there are ‘such systemic and gross deficiencies in . . . procedures that \nthe inmate population is effectively denied access to adequate medical care.’” Id.  In addition, “a \nseries of incidents  closely related in  time may disclose a pattern of conduct  amounting to \ndeliberate indifference.”  Id. (internal  quotations omitted).  Further, “[r]epeated examples of \ndelayed or denied medical care may indicate a deliberate indifference by prison authorities to the \nsuffering that results.”  Id.  \nBoth of these claims necessarily involve common questions.  For instance, as to the \nEighth  Amendment  claim,  all  class  members  share  the  common  question  of  whether  the \nDefendants’ policy or custom of withholding treatment with DAA drugs from individuals who \nhave been or will be diagnosed with chronic HCV constitutes deliberate indifference to a serious \nmedical need.  As to the ADA claim, all class members share the common mixed factual and \nlegal question of whether Defendants use the alleged policies to discriminate against inmates in \nneed of medical treatment based on their chronic HCV diagnoses.  Defendant MDOC briefly \ncontends that because Plaintiffs challenge medical treatment decisions, they have failed to state a \n15 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 15 of 35\n\nclaim under the ADA.7  [Doc. 113, p. 22 of 25].  The Court rejects this argument as going only to \nthe merits of the ADA claim, not to the requirements of Rule 23.  See, e.g., Amgen Inc. v. \nConnecticut Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 1194-95 (2013) (“Merits \nquestions may be considered to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant to \ndetermining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”)  The Court is \nsatisfied that the commonality requirement is met because the alleged HCV-treatment policies or \ncustoms are the “glue” that holds together the putative class; either these policies are unlawful as \nto all inmates or they are not.  See Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014).     \nThe Court is not persuaded by Defendants’ interpretation of Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338 (2011), as prohibiting class certification in this case.  Specifically, Defendants contend that \nWal-Mart prevents Plaintiffs from showing that the requisite “common answer” exists to satisfy \ncommonality because the treatment of HCV inmates is “highly individualized.”  In support, \nDefendants emphasize that DAA medications are not recommended for everyone and that the \nNamed Plaintiffs, alone, allege different symptoms and conditions, as well as different treating \nphysicians  and  healthcare  providers.    However,  Defendants’  argument  depends  on  their \ncontention that inmate medical decisions always involve individualized treatment decisions that \nare, by their very nature, unsuitable for class treatment even when all are attributable to an \noverarching policy or protocol.  The Court rejects this theory, which “amounts to a sweeping \nassertion that, after Wal-Mart, Eighth Amendment claims can never be brought in the form of a \nclass action.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 675-76 (9th Cir. 2014).   \n                                                           \n7 Defendant MDOC also states without support that the circumstances giving rise to each class \nmember’s purported claim of discrimination are “unique,” defeating commonality.  [Doc. 113, p. \n22 of 25].  The Court rejects this argument for the same reasons that it rejects this argument as to \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment class claim: Plaintiffs are alleging a discriminatory policy that is \napplied to all class members, not individualized acts of discrimination.  See also infra, p. 19-20.   \n16 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 16 of 35\n\nFurthermore, a comparison of Wal-Mart to this case supports class certification, rather \nthan undermines it.  Wal-Mart clarified that class certification is appropriate only where the \nplaintiffs’ claims rest on a “common contention” whose “truth or falsity will resolve an issue that \nis central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  \nWal-Mart concluded that a proposed Title VII class of millions of female employees, challenging \ndiscretionary decisions made by managers in 3,400 stores across the country, did not satisfy Rule \n23’s commonality requirement.  Id. at 350-61.  The Wal-Mart court reasoned that the plaintiffs, \nwho alleged a general corporate policy of allowing discretion by local managers, lacked “a \ncommon answer to the crucial question why was I disfavored.”  Id. at 352.  It concluded that the \nplaintiffs’ effort to “sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once” did not satisfy \ncommonality because “demonstrating the invalidity of one manager’s use of discretion will do \nnothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s.”  Id. at 355-56.   \nUnlike in Wal-Mart, where the plaintiffs failed to identify “a common mode of exercising \ndiscretion that pervades the entire company,” the policies alleged by Plaintiffs in this case \nprevent  individual  treaters  from  using  their  discretion  to  make  appropriately  individualized \ntreatment decisions.  Moreover, to the extent that treaters do use their discretion in denying DAA \ndrug treatment to inmates with chronic HCV, unlike in Wal-Mart, Plaintiffs in this case have \nidentified “a common mode of exercising [that] discretion”: in the form of policies applied to all \ninmates  with  chronic  HCV,  e.g.,  not  considering  DAA  drug  treatment  unless  and  until  an \ninmate’s APRI score is above 2.0 for several months.   \n  In contrast to Defendants’ characterizations, Plaintiffs are not merely aggregating many \nclaims of individual mistreatment.  Instead, they are alleging that the policies and practices in \nplace for HCV treatment generally expose all inmates with chronic HCV to a substantial risk of \n17 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 17 of 35\n\nserious  harm  in  violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment.    In  other  words,  the  unconstitutional \ntreatment decisions alleged by Plaintiffs are attributable to an overarching policy to which all \nclass members are exposed, satisfying the commonality requirement.  To be sure, there may be \nvariance in symptoms, contraindications for treatment, and differing levels of physical health \nfrom inmate to inmate, but “every inmate suffers exactly the same constitutional injury when he \nis exposed to a single statewide [MDOC] policy or practice that creates a substantial risk of \nserious harm,” despite the fact that “a presently existing risk may ultimately result in different \nfuture harm for different inmates ranging from no harm at all to death.”  See Parsons v. Ryan, \n754 F.3d 657, 679 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834 and Helling, 509 U.S. at 33).8  \nIn this case, the putative class sets forth a common contention whose truth or falsity can be \ndetermined in one stroke: whether the specified policies and practices to which they are all \nsubjected by Defendants constitute constitutionally adequate or inadequate care.   \n  Next, Defendants argue commonality is lacking by mischaracterizing Plaintiffs’ proposed \nclass as “rely[ing] upon a false assumption: that every inmate with HCV should receive DAA \nmedications.”9  [Doc. 114, p. 16 of 28].  But this is not the case.  Instead, the assumption \nunderlying Plaintiffs’ class is that Defendants’ systematic policies or customs related to HCV \ntreatment, which are applied to all class members, are constitutionally inadequate.  These alleged \npolicies include: \n(1) “using  an  APRI  score—which  measures  the  progression  of  fibrosis  or  cirrhosis—to \ndetermine whether a person should be treated”; \n                                                           \n8 The Court also rejects Defendant MDOC’s contention that Parsons somehow “erroneously \ndeparts from long-standing Eighth Amendment precedent.”  [Doc. 142, p. 11 of 16].      \n9 Furthermore, although Defendants acknowledge that “DAA medications are appropriate for \nsome,”  they  do  not  challenge  Plaintiffs’  allegation  that  Defendants  have  provided  DAA \nmedications to less than one-half of one percent of inmates in their custody with a known HCV \ninfection.  When a defendant makes the same decision for the same reason as to 99 percent of a \ngroup of thousands of people, that is a common policy that should be litigated at one time. \n18 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 18 of 35\n\n \n(2) “not undertaking liver biopsies, FIB-4, FibroScan, or any other methods of determining \nthe stage of fibrosis or cirrhosis and relying exclusively on APRI score to determine that \nstage”;  \n \n(3) “failing to even consider providing treatment to HCV-positive inmates unless they have \nan APRI score above 2.0 that persists for several months, even though more than half of \npersons with cirrhosis will not have an APRI score at or above 2.0 and they know that \nAST  levels  are  transient  in  contravention  of  the  prevailing  standard  of  care  and  in \ndeliberate indifference to serious medical need”; \n \n(4) “disregarding  independent  diagnoses  of  cirrhosis  or  significant  hepatitis  fibrosis  in \nmaking treatment decisions”; and   \n \n(5) “basing treatment decisions on cost, rather than on need for treatment.”   \n \n[Doc. 30, p. 18-19].  Such policy-based claims will lead to common answers, as required for \ncommonality, including potentially enjoining Defendants from delaying treatment with a DAA \ndrug to the class members for any nonmedical reason or enjoining Defendants to revise their \ntreatment policies so that they comply with the standard of care.  [Doc. 132, p. 17 of 28].   \n  As a separate argument, Defendants again argue that Plaintiffs have not carried their \nburden  of  proving  by  a  “preponderance  of  the  evidence”  that  Defendants  adopted  any \nsystemwide policy of withholding treatment with DAA medications.  As already discussed, the \nEighth Circuit has never articulated a particular evidentiary burden, much less a “preponderance \nof the evidence” standard.  Rather, to establish Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement, the \nSupreme Court has described Plaintiffs’ burden as requiring Plaintiffs to “be prepared to prove \nthat there are in fact sufficiently . . . common questions of law or fact.”  Comcast Corp. v. \nBehrend,  133  S.Ct.  1426,  1432  (2013).    As  discussed  above,  Plaintiffs’  uncontroverted \nallegations alone satisfy this burden because Defendants have failed to challenge the common \nquestions set forth by Plaintiffs.   \n  Still, to the extent that any question arguably remains about the existence of standardized \n19 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 19 of 35\n\nconduct common to all class members, Plaintiffs have submitted supportive evidence, including \ngrievance and informal resolution request (“IRR”) responses to inmates’ requests for DAA \ntreatment.  [Doc. 132-6].  These IRR responses repeatedly acknowledge the existence and nature \nof some of the policies Plaintiffs set forth in their Complaint, which Defendants appear to rely \nupon to deny treatment.  [Id.].  For example, the Informal Resolution Request Response dated \nOctober 27, 2016 provides: \nYour concern is understood to be: you would like your hepatitis treated “before it \ngets worse. . . . [Y]ou were seen by the medical provider . . . At that time your \nscore did not indicate that you qualified for the treatment.  \n \n[Doc. 132-6, p. 1]. Another IRR similarly provides, “[Y]our APRI score is 0.314.  APRI scores \nhigher than 2 are being considered for Hepatitis C treatment.  At this time you do not meet \ncriteria for treatment.  You will continue to [be][sic] monitored in infectious disease clinic for \nyour Hepatitis C.”  [Id. at p. 2].  Another provides, “You do not currently meet the criteria for \nHarvoni treatment.  You are enrolled in chronic care for your condition and your lab levels are \nmonitored and you are seen by a medical provider every 6 months.”  [Id. at p. 3].  Another \nprovides, “The results of your test noted that your APRI score does not support treatment at this \ntime.”  [Id. at p. 5].  Another IRR directed to Plaintiff Chris Baker, whose severe cirrhosis was \nindependently diagnosed prior to incarceration through a liver biopsy, responds, “Your APRI \nscore is 0.562 and per protocol the APRI score needs to be greater than 2 to be considered for \ntreatment.”  [Id. at p. 6].  Although not required, this evidence further buttresses Plaintiffs’ \ncommonality argument by showing that Defendants do in fact have a policy or custom—not \nconsidering DAA treatment without an “adequate” APRI score greater than 2—that does not \nrequire individualized determinations and is applied to inmates with chronic HCV.  Defendants \n20 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 20 of 35\n\nhave not identified any evidence to the contrary.10     \n  As an additional argument against commonality, Defendants repeatedly emphasize the \n“individual” circumstances that must be considered to determine whether DAA drug treatment is \nappropriate for an HCV-positive inmate.  As identified by Defendants, these considerations \ninclude that people with acute HCV should not receive DAA treatment because they may self-\nresolve;11  some  persons  may  be  allergic  to  or  have  significant  drug  interactions  with  the \ncomponents of the treatment; pregnant patients or patients who lack sufficient time in their \nsentence should not receive it; and patients who do not demonstrate a willingness to adhere to the \ntreatment regimen and abstain from high-risk activities should not receive it.  [Doc. 114, p. 10-11 \n(citing Dr. Bredeman’s affidavit)].  However, the reality that DAA drug treatment may not be \nappropriate  for  every  inmate  diagnosed  with  chronic  HCV  does  nothing  to  undermine  the \nexistence of the common questions alleged by Plaintiffs and discussed previously.  The Court \nrecognizes that some members of the class may not be good candidates for DAA drug treatment \nbased on individual characteristics and contraindications.  Nonetheless, at least one common \nquestion remains: whether Defendants’ classwide policy of not even considering DAA drug \ntreatment in the first place unless an inmate has an “adequate” APRI score is lawful or unlawful.  \n  For  the  previous  reasons,  the  Court  finds  that Plaintiffs’  putative  class  satisfies  the \ncommonality requirement. \n                                                           \n10  Even  if  Defendants  had  identified  evidence  to  the  contrary,  Plaintiffs  also  allege  that \nDefendants’ written policies are, in practice, aspirational: that Defendants deviate from their \nwritten HCV protocols for the purpose of delaying and denying treatment even to persons who \nmight qualify for treatment.  Indeed, it is difficult for the Court to believe that less than one half \nof one percent of HCV-positive inmates—the percentage who have received DAA treatment—\nhave an APRI score of more than 2 when the overall rate of cirrhosis among HCV-positive \npersons is alleged to be somewhere in the range of 20 percent.  [Doc. 132-7 (“CDC Fact \nSheet”)]. \n11 Furthermore, this contraindication is not relevant to Plaintiffs’ class, which is limited to only \nthose inmates with chronic HCV, not acute HCV. \n21 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 21 of 35\n\n3.   Typicality \nThe typicality requirement is met when the claims or defenses of the representative party \nare typical of those of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The requirement “is fairly easily met \nso long as other class members have claims similar to the named plaintiff.”  DeBoer v. Mellon \nMortg. Co., 64 F.3d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir. 1995).  In determining typicality, courts consider \nwhether the named plaintiff’s claim “arises from the same event or course of conduct as the class \nclaims, and gives rise to the same legal or remedial theory.”  Alpern v. UtiliCorp United, Inc., 84 \nF.3d 1525, 1540 (8th Cir. 1996). \nThe Named Plaintiffs’ claims and the claims of the remainder of the putative class arise \nfrom the same course of conduct: Defendants’ policies surrounding their treatment of inmates \nwith chronic HCV, including their policy of denying DAA drug treatment to individuals with \nHCV due to APRI score.  Plaintiffs allege these policies are discriminatory based on HCV status \nand are violative of their Eighth Amendment rights.  These claims are identical to the claims that \ncould be raised by any member of the class.  In addition, all putative class members share a \ncommon injury of having these policies applied to them and as a result, suffering a significant \nrisk of harm.  Therefore, the Named Plaintiffs are typical because they, too, are exposed to the \nsame risk.  Like the remainder of the class, they are HCV-positive inmates to which the alleged \npolicy has been applied and who have not been treated with DAA drugs.  See Alpern v. UtiliCorp \nUnited, Inc., 84 F.3d 1525, 1540 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding that typicality means that there are \n“other members of the class who have the same or similar grievances as the plaintiff” and that \n“[f]actual variations in the individual claims will not normally preclude class certification if the \nclaim arises from the same event or course of conduct as the class claims, and gives rise to the \nsame legal or remedial theory”).   \n22 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 22 of 35\n\nDefendants argue that there is no typicality because Plaintiffs have not offered evidence \n“of their alleged entitlement to such medications” or “that they themselves were injured” because \nof their failure to receive DAA medications.  [Doc. 114, p. 19 of 28].  First, the Court has already \nrejected Defendants’ arguments as to Plaintiffs’ evidentiary burden for proving the Rule 23(a) \nrequirements.  Furthermore, Defendants’ own evidence buttresses Plaintiffs’ typicality because \nthis evidence confirms Plaintiffs’ allegations that (1) they have been diagnosed with chronic \nHCV and (2) they have not been treated with DAA drugs.  See, e.g., [Docs. 114-3, 114-4, and \n114-5 (Medical Records for Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson)].  Second, the typicality inquiry \ndoes not require Plaintiffs to show “their alleged entitlement” to DAA drugs or that they, \nthemselves, were injured.  Instead, such inquiries are relevant only to the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims and cannot be resolved at the class certification stage.  See Golan v. Veritas Entm’t, LLC, \n788 F.3d 814, 821 (8th Cir. 2015) (reversing district court and holding that even where named \nplaintiffs were potentially subject to defense, because that defense was a “critical issue in this \ncase,” their claims were typical); Blades v. Monstanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 567 (8th Cir. 2005) \n(holding, as to  Rule 23(b)(3), that “disputes may be resolved only insofar as resolution  is \nnecessary to determine the nature of the evidence that would be sufficient, if the plaintiff’s \ngeneral allegations were true, to make out a prima facie case for the class” and that “[t]he closer \nany dispute at the class certification stage comes to the heart of the claim, the more cautious the \ncourt should be in ensuring that it must be resolved in order to determine the nature of the \nevidence the plaintiff would require”).   \nNext, Defendants argue there is no typicality by again contending that Plaintiffs’ claims \nturn on individualized medical treatment decisions, an argument this Court has already rejected.  \nThe Court further rejects Defendants’ arguments that Plaintiffs “will require individualized proof \n23 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 23 of 35\n\nby expert testimony” of “[t]he effect that a lack of DAA medications has had on them.”  [Doc. \n114, p. 20-21 of 28 (emphasis added)].  Individualized proof and analysis might be required if \nPlaintiffs  were  seeking  money  damages  for  their  particular  injuries  caused  by  Defendants’ \npolicies and customs, including the denial of DAA treatment.  However, in this case, Plaintiffs \ndo not seek classwide monetary relief.  Instead, they seek injunctive and declaratory relief \nregarding Defendants’ policies and practices that are applicable to all inmates with chronic HCV \nand thus, do not require individualized proof by expert testimony.    \nAlthough Defendants also cite a number of HCV inmate cases, none of these cases \ndemonstrate that the Named Plaintiffs are atypical.  See also Graham v. Parker, 2017 WL \n1737871, at *1 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, 2017) (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class of Tennessee inmates \nwith Hepatitis C with similar Eighth Amendment class claim).  Not only do Defendants’ cases \nnot involve motions for class certification, but they also predate the FDA’s approval of DAA \ndrugs when the medical standard of care was different than the one applicable to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  Prior to DAA drugs, there was no effective and safe treatment for HCV; the standard \ntreatment, which included the use of interferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure most \npatients;  and  this  treatment  was  associated  with  severe  side  effects  and  contraindications, \nincluding psychiatric and autoimmune disorders.  See [Doc. 114, p. 21 of 28, n. 9 (citing cases \nprior to approval of DAA drugs that do not involve class certification)].  Therefore, to the extent \nthat Defendants contend these cases somehow demonstrate the Named Plaintiffs are not typical \nof the class, these cases are also distinguishable.    \nFor the previous reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the class.   \n4.  Adequacy \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the class representative and class counsel will “fairly and \n24 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 24 of 35\n\nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  The adequacy requirement is met where:  “(1) the \nrepresentatives and their attorneys are able and willing to prosecute the action competently and \nvigorously; and (2) each representative’s interests are sufficiently similar to those of the class \nthat it is unlikely that their goals and viewpoints will diverge.”  Carpe v. Aquila, Inc., 224 F.R.D. \n454,  458  (W.D.Mo.  2004)  (internal  quotes  omitted).   This  requirement  “serves  to  uncover \nconflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.”  Amchem \nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997).    \nFirst,  Defendants do not  dispute that Plaintiffs’counsel  can adequately represent  the \nputative  class  members.    The  proposed  class  counsel  has  extensive  experience  prosecuting \ncomplex litigation.  One attorney has significant experience as class counsel in civil rights class \nactions seeking prospective relief, and the remaining two attorneys have experience litigating \ncomplex civil rights matters in federal court, including prisoners’ rights cases.  The proposed \nclass counsel will vigorously represent the plaintiffs in this action.   \nIn addition, Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs have common interests with the \nputative class—namely, getting prompt, medically appropriate consideration for treatment with a \nDAA drug.  Contrary to Defendants’ contentions, a  named plaintiff’s individual claim for \nindividual  damages  does  not  disqualify  that  named  plaintiff  from  being  an  adequate  class \nrepresentative.  See Stewart v. Winter, 669 F.2d 328, 334-335 (5th Cir. 1982) (“An individual \nclaim  for  large  damages  does  not  necessarily  make  a  putative  representative’s  interests \n‘antagonistic’ to those of the class; to the contrary, the courts have often viewed the assertion of \nsuch a claim as an indication that the representative will prosecute the action vigorously.”).  \nAside from raising the Named Plaintiffs’ individual monetary claims as a “potential conflict,” \nDefendants  have  not  identified  anything  “in  the  record  to  indicate  that    [their]  claims  for \n25 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 25 of 35\n\ndamages are in any way ‘antagonistic’ to the class claims for injunctive relief.”  Id.  The Court is \nsatisfied that the Named Plaintiffs’ interests are aligned with those of the class because as \ndiscussed above, their claims arise out of the same common course of conduct and are based \nupon the same legal theories as the class members’ claims.  See Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 349, n. 5 (2011) (noting that the two requirements of typicality and adequacy “tend to \nmerge”).  The adequacy requirement is satisfied. \nD.  Rule 23(b)(2)  \nTo  certify  the  class,  Plaintiffs  must  further  prove  satisfaction  of  the  Rule  23(b)(2) \nrequirements: that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Although a Rule 23(b)(2) \nclass is not required to satisfy the additional predominance and superiority requirements of Rule \n23(b)(3), “the class claims must be cohesive.”  Ebert v. General Mills, Inc., 823 F.3d 472, 480 \n(8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Barnes v. Am. Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 143 (3d Cir. 1998).  For \npurposes of 23(b)(2), cohesiveness requires that “the relief sought must perforce affect the entire \nclass at once.”  Id.  In contrast, cohesiveness is lacking where “each individual class member \nwould be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.”  Id. at \n480-81.   \n  The  Court  finds  that  the  putative  class  satisfies  Rule  23(b)(2)  because  Defendants’ \npolicies apply generally to the class so that the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would \nprovide relief to all class members.  As discussed previously, Plaintiffs challenge policies and \npractices through which Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \nto all inmates with chronic HCV.  The existence of at least one policy or custom—refusing to \n26 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 26 of 35\n\neven consider DAA treatment for an inmate without an “adequate” APRI score greater than 2—\nwas additionally supported with evidence, including grievance and informal resolution request \nresponses to various inmates’ requests for DAA treatment.  See supra Section II.C.2. p. 20-21 \nand [Doc. 132-6].  Rather than controverting the existence of these classwide policies, Defendant \nCorizon’s own evidence confirms their existence, including referencing standardized “protocols” \nrelied upon by Corizon for the management and treatment of chronic HCV.  See, e.g., [Doc. 114, \np. 9 of 28 (citing Dr. Bredeman’s affidavit)].  Although Corizon’s expert12 states that HCV \nmedication decisions are based upon the individual patient’s medical need and made on a “case-\nby-case basis,” Corizon does not identify any specific evidence contradicting the existence of the \nHCV-treatment policies alleged by Plaintiffs.  These systemwide policies preclude all class \nmembers from even being considered for DAA treatment without the requisite APRI score, \nwhich, in turn, prevents treaters from making “case-by-case” DAA decisions based on individual \ncriteria because the policies do not permit DAA consideration in the first place.    \n  As required for cohesiveness, all class members seek precisely the same declaratory and \ninjunctive  relief.    They  seek  a  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  current  “policy  of \nwithholding treatment with DAA drugs from inmates diagnosed with [chronic] HCV violates the \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments.”  As to injunctive relief, they seek to enjoin Defendants: \n(1)  to formulate and implement an HCV treatment policy that meets the prevailing \nstandard of care, including identifying persons with HCV;  \n \n(2)  to provide members of the class an appropriate and accurate assessment of the level \nof fibrosis or cirrhosis they have, counseling on drug-drug interactions, and ongoing \nmedical care for complications and symptoms of HCV; and   \n \n                                                           \n12 Plaintiffs also submitted their own expert affidavit, which Corizon challenged under Daubert.  \n[Doc. 132-5 (“Declaration of Dr. Blair Thedinger”)].  However, even to the extent that Corizon’s \nDaubert challenge is valid, the Court need not address it because the Court found Plaintiffs’ \naffidavit unnecessary for deciding the current motion. \n27 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 27 of 35\n\n(3)  from delaying or denying DAA drug treatment to class members for any nonmedical \nreason.13  \n \n[Docs. 30, p. 25 and 27 ¶¶ 136, 144 (Second Amended Complaint) and Doc. 132, p. 17 of 28 \n(Plaintiffs’  Reply  Suggestions  describing  the  injunctive  relief  the  Court  could  give  as \n“includ[ing] enjoining Defendants from delaying treatment with a DAA drug to the putative \nClass members for any nonmedical reason”)].  Therefore, if Plaintiffs are successful, “a single \ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class” because it \nwould address the HCV treatment policies that apply generally to all class members.  Ebert v. \nGeneral Mills, Inc., 823 F.3d 472, 480 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 \n(2011)). \n  The  Court  is  not  persuaded  by  Defendant  Corizon’s  reliance  on  an  environmental-\ncontamination case, Ebert v. General Mills, Inc., 823 F.3d 472 (8th Cir. 2016), to argue that \nPlaintiffs fail to satisfy the cohesiveness requirement.  See id. at 480–81 (discussing “stringent” \ncohesiveness  standard).    In  Ebert,  neighborhood  property  owners  sued  General  Mills  for \nremediation for dumping toxic waste and exposing their neighborhood to toxic vapors.  Id. at \n474.  The Eighth Circuit held that the class of property owners was not cohesive because the \nremediation sought was “not even universal” and remediation, if awarded, would have been \n“unique” to “each of the affected properties.”  Id. at 480-81.  Indeed, some of the class members \nhad already received vapor migration systems customized to their properties and some had not; \nsome members’ properties had been tested and no vapors were detectible; and of those homes \naffected by the vapors, their test results showed “widely varying levels.”  Id. at 481. Further, \nbecause the class sought “hybrid certification” with (b)(2) and (b)(3) classes, there were “myriad \n                                                           \n13 The Court’s Order granting class certification is based on the equitable relief discussed herein.  \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs seek an alternative injunctive remedy, the motion for class \ncertification may be reconsidered. \n28 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 28 of 35\n\nconsiderations” about the individual proof needed to show causation and damages for each class \nmember.  Id. at 481; see also id. at 479–80.  \n  The case before this Court is different.  There is a straightforward causal relationship \nbetween Defendants’ policies relating to HCV medical care and the putative class members’ lack \nof treatment and exposure to substantial risk.  In contrast to Ebert, there are no classwide issues \nrelating to damages because the class seeks only equitable relief.  Also unlike the Ebert plaintiff \nclass where some properties had been fully or partially remediated so that class members sought \ndifferent levels of remediation relief, none of the members of the proposed class in this case has \nreceived treatment with any DAA drug.  As a result, the plaintiffs in this class are not seeking \ndiffering levels of injunctive relief, as they were in Ebert. \n  Defendants again argue that the Eighth Amendment claim central to this case requires \nindividualized inquiries with respect to every class member, making it impermissible under Rule \n23(b)(2).    Defendants  contend  that  the  proof  for  Plaintiffs’  claims  rests  on  whether  each \nindividual class member’s treatment was constitutionally inadequate.  Again, according to this \nlogic, class certification would never be appropriate for Eighth Amendment claims, a sweeping \nconclusion that this and other courts have long rejected.  See, e.g., Graham v. Parker, 2017 WL \n1737871, *1 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, 2017) (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) inmate class against state \nprison for Eighth Amendment claims based on the prison’s allegedly unconstitutional treatment \nprotocols, policies, and practices regarding HCV treatment); Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657 (9th \nCir. 2014) (affirming district court’s certification of Rule 23(b)(2) inmate class against state \nprison  for  Eighth  Amendment  claims  based  on  allegedly  serious  systemic  deficiencies  in \nconditions of confinement in isolation cells and in the provision of privatized medical, dental, \nand mental health care services).   \n29 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 29 of 35\n\n  According to Defendants, the inquiry is individualized because not every inmate with \nHCV will go on to develop serious complications from HCV, and not every inmate will be an \nappropriate  candidate  for  DAA  drug  treatment.    However,  such  arguments  repeatedly \nmisconstrue  Plaintiffs’  class  claims  as  demands  for  individual  treatment  dependent  on \nindividualized factors.  See, e.g., [Doc. 113, p. 10-12 of 25].  As the Court has already explained \nin analyzing and rejecting Defendants’ similar arguments against commonality, Plaintiffs are not \nseeking adjudication of demands for particular individualized treatment.  Instead, the challenge \nthey are actually bringing—to customs or policies dictating the way that the entire putative \nclass’s chronic HCV is treated generally—is well recognized.  Indeed, a case like this one in \nwhich a group of prisoners seeks to challenge the constitutionality of a prison policy is so well \nsuited for Rule 23(b)(2) class treatment that the leading class-action and federal-practice treatises \nboth use it as the exemplar of a case fitting within that subsection: “For example, if a prisoner in \na prison conditions lawsuit secures a ruling that a prison policy violates the Constitution, the \ncourt-ordered injunctive relief will necessarily apply to all other prisoners.” 1 H. Newberg & A. \nConte, Newberg on Class Actions § 4.34 (5th ed. 2016 update); see also Wright & Miller, 7AA \nFed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1776 (3d ed. 2017 update) (“[I]t should be noted that a common use of \nRule 23(b)(2) is in prisoner actions brought to challenge various practices or rules in the prisons \non the ground that they violate the constitution.  For example, Rule 23(b)(2) class actions have \nbeen utilized to challenge prison policies or procedures alleged to . . . violate the prisoners’ \nEighth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.”).  \n  Defendants’ reliance on Avritt v. Reliastar Life Ins. Co., 615 F.3d 1023 (8th Cir. 2010) to \nshow that Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim cannot be certified does not require a different \nresult.  In Avritt, purchasers of annuities alleged that the seller engaged in unfair business \n30 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 30 of 35\n\npractices by systematically crediting higher interest to the most recent deposits in customers’ \nannuity accounts and crediting lower interest to older deposits.  The Eighth Circuit found the \ncase to be inappropriate for injunctive or declaratory relief under Rule 23(b)(2) because the \nplaintiffs  conceded  that  the  case  was  primarily  about  money  damages,  and  “the  level  of \ndisclosure—as well as the extent of each individual’s reliance—varied between plaintiffs.”  Id. at \n1036.  Accordingly, the Eighth Circuit reasoned,  injunctive or declaratory relief would be \ninappropriate because resolution of the plaintiffs’ claims would require numerous individual \ndeterminations regarding the defendant’s representations and each purchaser’s reliance.  Id.   \n  The Eighth Amendment claim in this case is different from the claims in Avritt.  Unlike \nin Avritt, the plaintiff class in this case does not even seek monetary relief, and members of the \nclass are not required to prove individualized elements, such as their individual reliance on a \nparticular representation made, as in Avritt.  In fact, this case is more comparable to DeBoer v. \nMellon Mortgage Co., 64 F.3d 1171 (8th Cir. 1995), also cited by Defendants.  In DeBoer, the \nEighth Circuit approved a class action settlement under Rule 23(b)(2) where the plaintiffs were \nmortgagees seeking to enjoin a mortgage servicer from requiring them to maintain unreasonably \nhigh balances in an escrow account.  Id. at 1175.  The DeBoer mortgage servicer’s liability \nturned on a single question that uniformly applied to all class members: whether the mortgage \nservicer was required to use aggregate or individual-item accounting in determining the amount \nof money to hold in an escrow account.  Id. at 1173.  Resolution of that question as to one of the \nplaintiffs necessarily resolved the issue for the entire class.  In the same way, Defendants’ \nliability in this case turns on a single question that uniformly applies to all class members: \nwhether Defendants’ policies for diagnosing and treating inmates with chronic HCV, including \nrefusing  to  consider  DAA  drug  treatment  based  on  APRI  score,  constitute  constitutionally \n31 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 31 of 35\n\nadequate or inadequate care in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  As in DeBoer, the central \nissue in this case is one that can be decided uniformly with respect to all plaintiffs.   \n  The Court is also not persuaded by Defendants’ contention that certifying Plaintiffs’ class \nwould force them to adopt a “one-size-fits-all policy” for treating inmates with HCV.  Rather, a \nfinding of liability may instead force MDOC to revise what is already alleged to be a one-size-\nfits-all policy to reflect the current medical standard of care.  These revisions could include \nrequiring Defendants to individually consider class members for DAA treatment rather than, as a \nmatter of policy, denying this treatment exclusively based on APRI score or for nonmedical \nreasons such as cost.   \n  As a separate argument against cohesiveness, Defendant MDOC quotes  Elizabeth M. v. \nMontenez, 458 F.3d 779 (8th Cir. 2006), to “caution” the Court to be “mindful of the special \ndelicacy  of  the  adjustment  to  be  preserved  between  federal  equitable  power  and  State \nadministration of its own law.”  Id. at 784.  Although Defendant MDOC cites to Elizabeth M. \nwhile emphasizing the potential financial cost of treating putative class members with DAA \ndrugs, the cost of the class’s requested relief was never considered or discussed by the Elizabeth \nM. court, nor is cost a factor requiring consideration under Rule 23.   \n  In  Elizabeth  M.,  the  Eighth  Circuit  vacated  the  district  court’s  certification  of  an \nunwieldy class of patients at three state mental health facilities due to the named plaintiffs’ lack \nof standing and the class definition’s inclusion of both current and former patients.  Unlike the \ncase before this Court, the Elizabeth M. class brought numerous claims and sought “sweeping \ninjunctive relief,” which “would require the district  court to  mandate and monitor detailed \nprograms governing nearly every facet of the State’s operation of the three facilities—patient \nrisk assessment, placement, and discipline; staff leadership structure; prehire procedures and \n32 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 32 of 35\n\ntraining for staff; sex education;” and more.  Id. at 783-84 (emphasis added).  Defendant MDOC \nappears to cite Elizabeth M. for its contention that certifying Plaintiffs’ class would produce such \nsweeping financial implications that there must be a clear showing that the Rule 23 requirements \nhave been met.  However, the Court does not disagree with this principle, a principle that is \nunrelated to the financial implications of a putative class’s requested injunctive relief.  Rather, \nevery motion for class certification requires the Court to conduct a “rigorous analysis,” which \nthis Court has undertaken.  See id. at 784.    \n  Defendants next contend that because the Named Plaintiffs bring individual claims for \nmonetary damages, Wal-Mart v. Dukes precludes certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  The Court \nrejects this argument as a misinterpretation of Wal-Mart, which did not hold that a plaintiff’s \nindividual claim for damages separate from the claims of the class somehow defeats certification \nunder Rule 23(b)(2).14  See Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 (2011).  Furthermore, the Eighth \nCircuit in Ebert contradicted this argument by implication because it observed that a court may \nbifurcate a class action into two phases, insulating the (b)(2) class from the money damage \nportion of the case in a (b)(3) class.  Defendant’s citation to Rouse v. Caruso, 2013 WL 588916, \nat *5 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 7, 2013), also does not require a different result because Rouse involved a \n(b)(2) injunctive relief class claim for compensatory damages of $10 million dollars.  Unlike \nRouse, Plaintiffs’ class claims do not seek any monetary damages.    \nDefendants’ remaining arguments, some of which are mischaracterized as demonstrating \nthat the class is “overbroad,” are again merits arguments not relevant to class certification: that \nPlaintiffs have not established that everyone with HCV actually “needs” DAA drug treatment or \n                                                           \n14 In addition,  it would be unreasonable to interpret Wal-Mart as holding that if individual class \nmembers could make claims for monetary damages, then the class could not be certified under \nRule 23(b)(2) because such an interpretation would preclude the vast majority of Rule 23(b)(2) \nclasses.   \n33 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 33 of 35\n\nthat all patients diagnosed with HCV have suffered an injury due to Defendants’ policies.  These \nare not the issues presented at the class certification stage.  The cases that Defendants cite relate \nto summary judgment motions or cases in which the courts reached the merits of the plaintiffs’ \nclaims—whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to an inmate’s particular medical \nneeds and whether certain treatments were warranted.  Again, Plaintiffs are not challenging \nindividualized  treatment  decisions  related  to  their  own  unique  characteristics  or \ncontraindications.  Rather, they are challenging Defendants’ systemwide policies of denying \nconsideration for DAA drug treatment based on allegedly arbitrary and/or nonmedical reasons, \nand  these  policies  apply  generally  to  all  members  of  the  class.    Plaintiffs  are  not  merely \ndisagreeing with a doctor’s course of treatment or medical decision as to a particular person.  \nThey are attacking the constitutionality of Defendants’ MDOC-wide policies and procedures \napplicable to all inmates with chronic HCV.   \nRegardless, such arguments are premature.  “In determining the propriety of a class \naction, the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will \nprevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.” Eisen v. Carlisle \n&  Jacquelin,  417  U.S.  156,  178  (1974).    Arguments  about  the  appropriateness  of  certain \ntreatments or how these policies are, in fact, applied to class members may be relevant to a future \nmotion  for  summary  judgment  or  at  trial.    But,  these  arguments  have  no  impact  on  the \navailability of class certification, as they do not go to the Rule 23(b)(2) inquiry or establish that \nthe class is somehow overbroad.    \nFor the previous reasons, the putative class is appropriate for certification under Rule \n23(b)(2). \n \n34 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 174   Filed 07/26/17   Page 34 of 35\n\nIII.   Conclusion \nPlaintiffs’ motion for class certification, Doc. 77, is granted, and the class is defined as \ndiscussed above.  \n              /s/ Nanette K. Laughrey  \n              NANETTE K.

Defendant Corizon LLC's second \n17  6   motion for extension of time to file, Doc. 105 , is granted in part and denied in \npart. The motion is granted with respect to Defendant Corizon's request to \nexceed the 15 page limitation. Therefore, each defendant's response to \nPlaintiffs' motion to certify shall not exceed 20 pages. The motion is denied \nwith respect to the request for an additional 14-day extension in light of the \nCourt's Order, Doc. 99 , which provided that no further extensions would be \ngranted for this deadline absent extraordinary circumstances. Although \nDefendant had an opportunity to raise concerns about the motion to certify's \nbriefing schedule during the Court's scheduling phone conference on 2/1, \nDefendant did not identify any scheduling problems at that time. Now, as \nsupport for its requested extension, Defendant states its affiant was out of the \ncountry. But, the Court is not persuaded that this constitutes an extraordinary \ncircumstance, and Defendant has failed to convince the Court that there were no \n\nother reasonable avenues available to it, which would have allowed it to \ncomplete its response within the time permitted.

Teleconference held before the Honorable Nanette K. \n19  5   Laughrey on August 9, 2019. Argument presented on Defendants' Motion for \nTestimony via Videoconference, Doc. 329 . Mr. Lunsford offered, in the \nalternative, to produce Dr. Koretz in person on Monday, August 19, 2019. The \nCourt denied Defendants' motion and ordered Defendants to arrange for Dr. \nKoretz to appear in the courtroom on Friday, August 16, 2019, by noon. The \nCourt stated that another teleconference will be held at 5:00 p.m. if Defendants \nare unable to arrange for Dr. Koretz to testify in person on Friday. The Court \ninstructed the parties to discuss and plan the order and timing of their witnesses \nto ensure that there are no gaps in time between any given witnesses. \nDefendants raised an objection concerning Plaintiffs plan to present the \ndeposition testimony or declarations of seven previously-undisclosed experts. \nPlaintiffs argued that Defendants' motion to present Dr. Gerrity's testimony \nprompted their designation of the seven experts' testimony or declarations. The \nCourt ruled that it will permit Plaintiffs to present the testimony or declarations \nof the previously-undisclosed experts only insofar as the material is offered for \nthe purpose of rebuttal. However, if Plaintiffs cannot establish that the material \nis properly presented for the purpose of rebuttal, it will not be allowed because \nof the timing of Plaintiffs' disclosure. The Court expects to hold Court from \n9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m, except that the Court granted the parties' request to begin \nat 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, August 14, 2019, in order to accommodate one \nexpert's schedule conflict that afternoon.

Precythe (Attachments: # 1 Exhibit \nA)(Lunsford, William) (Entered: 10/02/2019) \n10/03/20 38 MINUTE ENTRY. Teleconference held before the Honorable Nanette K. \n19  5   Laughrey on October 3, 2019 regarding a discovery dispute as to whether \nDefendants should provide Plaintiffs with a blood sample for one of the named \nPlaintiffs, Jamerson, for testing by an independent laboratory to determine if he \nhas HCV. Defendants objected to the request on several grounds. First, \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs should have moved pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 35 because Rule 34 cannot be used to request a document that \ncannot exist. Second, Defendants have already conducted the test and the results \ntwice indicated that Jamerson does not have HCV. Plaintiffs have not suggested \nthat there is any basis to doubt the authenticity or veracity of the test results. \nThird, the request would lead the parties down a slippery slope. If Plaintiffs ask \nfor additional testing for all of the class members, it would create enormous \ninefficiencies. Plaintiffs explained that Jamerson was first tested in 2015 and \nwas told at the that time that he had chronic Hepatitis C. Viral load testing was \nfirst conducted in 2017, and that testing indicated that he did not have Hepatitis \nC. Plaintiffs are not asking at this time that the test be conducted for all class \nmembers; they are asking only that one of the three named plaintiffs be tested \nbecause of the unique circumstances. Plaintiffs argued that Defendants should \nnot be allowed to dictate how Plaintiffs conduct discovery. Plaintiffs argued \nalso that Defendants would not have been content to rely on an opposing \nexperts findings without independently confirming them. Plaintiffs argued that \nthey need not rely on Rule 35 to procure the blood sample because Rule 34 \napplies to tangible things. Plaintiffs noted that Defendants have not articulated \nany burden that would arise from providing the requested blood \nsamplePlaintiffs have arranged for the testing and payment. Finally, Plaintiffs \nnoted that the information Plaintiffs seek is relevant to Jamersons status as a \nclass representative and his damagesissues that may be addressed in upcoming \nmediation. When asked by the Court whether they would prefer to proceed \npursuant to Rule 35, with DOC transporting Jamerson to the laboratory of \nPlaintiffs choosing for testing, waiting while his blood sample is taken, and then \ntransporting him back to the prison, or pursuant to Rule 34, with Corizon \ndrawing a sample of Jamersons blood for transportation to a lab of Plaintiffs \nchoosing, counsel for both Corizon and DOC agreed that, if the Court were to \norder one of the two measures, the latter would be preferable. The Court \nordered Corizon to produce a blood sample from Mr. Jamerson on or before \nOctober 11, 2019. Plaintiffs are to arrange for the sample to be collected by the \nlaboratory of their choice. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within 48 \nhours as to when the sample shall be collected, they are to contact the court on \nOctober 7, 2019 to arrange a teleconference. The Court noted that its ruling \n\ntoday is limited to the specific issue of Mr. Jamersons blood sample for HCV \ntesting. Todays ruling does not reflect the Courts position as to whether similar \ndiscovery would be available for any other class member, or whether any such \ndiscovery would be available under Rule 34 or Rule 35.

The Parties shall engage in good-faith negotiations and attempt to \nresolve the dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) \ndays of the written notification, then they shall mediate their dispute with \nNancy Kenner, Kenner Nygaard DeMarea Kendall, LLC, 117 West 20th Street, \nSuite 201, Kansas City, Missouri 64108, or a mutually agreeable mediator if \nMs. Kenner is unavailable, at a mutually agreeable date and time.

In support, they state: \n1.  In this action, Plaintiffs challenge the custom or policy Defendants Missouri \nDepartment of Corrections (MDOC), Anne L. Precythe (in her official capacity), and \nCorizon to refused medical treatment that is consistent with current and prevailing \nmedical standards in a manner that is deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ serious \nmedical needs. In particular, while a cure is available for Hepatitis C viral infection in \nthe form of direct-acting antiviral drugs, these Defendants withhold that treatment \nfrom inmates who should receive it—leaving them to develop serious illnesses, \nspread Hepatitis C viral infections to other inmates, and, in some cases, die. \n2.  For the reasons set forth in the accompanying suggestions, Plaintiffs meet the \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements to justify a Class of \nall individuals, like them, who are now, or will in the future be, in the custody of the \nMissouri Department of Correction and have been, or will be, diagnosed with HCV \n1 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 77   Filed 01/24/17   Page 1 of 4\n\nbut are not provided treatment with DAA drugs.

Plaintiffs’ claims in their Second Amended Complaint fail, because Plaintiffs fail \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(c). \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims against MDOC is barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity.   \n3.  To the extent Plaintiffs purport to assert claims against MDOC employees in their \nindividual capacities, such claims are barred by qualified immunity. Qualified immunity is \napplicable, because no Plaintiff has alleged or can prove that his clearly established rights were \nviolated. \n4.  Plaintiffs’ claims fail, because Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their \nadministrative remedies, including the grievance procedure available to him at the Missouri \nDepartment of Corrections. \n5.  Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. \n6.  Plaintiffs’ claims are barred in whole or in part because Plaintiffs’ own negligence \ncontributed to the injuries alleged in the Second Amended Complaint. \n7.  Plaintiffs’ ADA claims fail, because Defendants had a legitimate non-\ndiscriminatory reason for their actions.  \n  17\nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 162   Filed 05/25/17   Page 17 of 18\n\n8.

In particular,\nthey claim the MDOC’s policies expose the class to a substantial risk of serious harm. \nThe district court1 granted class certification.  We granted the Defendants’ Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(f) petition for interlocutory appeal of the grant of class certification, and\nnow affirm.\nI.  Background\nPostawko, Baker, and Jamerson (the Named Plaintiffs) are each incarcerated in\nthe MDOC.  They filed an action asserting that they received inadequate medical care\nfor their HCV infections and sought class certification.  The following facts were\ncontained in the Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint.  HCV is a viral infection that\ncan cause liver damage and other extremely serious side effects.  Those who contract\nHCV may suffer inflammation of the liver, known as hepatitis.  In turn, those with\nhepatitis may suffer significantly impaired liver functioning.  A decrease in liver\n1The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri.\n-2-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 2      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nfunction may result in symptoms such as severe pain, fatigue, difficulty or pain with\nurination, and an increased risk of heart attacks. \nHCV may be either acute or chronic.  While some acute HCV infections are\nresolved naturally, others develop into chronic HCV.  Individuals suffering from\nchronic HCV develop fibrosis of the liver, in which healthy liver tissue is replaced\nwith scar tissue.  Patients are said to suffer from cirrhosis when a significant portion\nof the liver has been converted into scar tissue.  Cirrhosis is irreversible.  Determining\nexactly when significant fibrosis amounts to cirrhosis is not always an easy task,\ncomplicating treatment.  Cirrhosis often causes “painful complications, including\narthritic pain throughout the body, kidney disease, jaundice, fluid retention with\nedema, internal bleeding, easy bruising, abdominal ascites, mental confusion, lymph\ndisorders, widespread itching, and even more extreme fatigue.”  Some of these\ncomplications can cause death if left untreated. \nAt least half of all those who suffer from chronic HCV will develop either\ncirrhosis or liver cancer.  Each day without treatment increases the risk that an HCV\ninfection will either develop into a serious condition such as chronic liver disease,\nfibrosis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer, or cause death from liver failure.  HCV causes the\ndeath of more American citizens than any other infectious disease.\nIn recent years, significant medical advancements have been made in the\ntreatment of HCV, which gives rise to the Plaintiffs’ case.  While previous treatments\ndemonstrated only low rates of success and often caused substantial side effects, new\ndirect-acting antiviral drugs (“DAA drugs”) are estimated to cure over 90% of patients\nwho receive them as treatment.  DAA drugs are also estimated to cause a 90%\nreduction in the risk of liver-related mortality.  Those effects, however, may diminish\nif treatment is delayed.  The medical standard of care put forward by organizations\nsuch as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for\n-3-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 3      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nthe Study of Liver Diseases now recommends that almost all persons with chronic\nHCV receive DAA drug treatment.2\nTo know whether or not treatment is required, patients must undergo reliable\nscreening for liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.  One method for determining the presence and\ndegree of cirrhosis or fibrosis is the AST to Platelet Ratio Index, or APRI.  The APRI\nis derived by analyzing a blood sample of the patient and determining the ratio of a\nparticular enzyme to the number of platelets.  While a high APRI score (above 2.0)\nreliably indicates the presence of cirrhosis or severe fibrosis, a low APRI does not\nprovide conclusive evidence in the other direction; in fact, over half of all patients\nsuffering from cirrhosis will not have an APRI score of 2.0.  For this reason, the use\nof other methods (such as liver biopsies) may be required to reliably determine\nwhether an individual is suffering from fibrosis or cirrhosis.\nThe rate of HCV infection among the population of the MDOC is estimated to\nbe at least 10% to 15%.  As a highly communicable disease, HCV often spreads\namong the incarcerated population.  The MDOC has provided DAA medications to\nless than one-half of one percent of inmates in their custody with a known HCV\ninfection.\nPlaintiffs alleged that Defendants Precythe, MDOC, and Corizon, LLC have the\nfollowing policies or customs: \n(1) not providing DAA drug treatment to all inmates with chronic HCV;\n(2) using an APRI score, which measures the progression of fibrosis or\ncirrhosis, to determine whether a person should be treated; \n2In cases where a patient has a life expectancy that is confidently estimated to\nbe less than 12 months and treatment of HCV cannot alter that prognosis, the standard\nof care recognizes that it is reasonable to refrain from treatment and focus on\npalliative care.\n-4-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 4      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\n(3) relying exclusively on APRI score to determine the stage of fibrosis\nor  cirrhosis;  rather  than  using  other  more  accurate  methods  of\ndetermining its progression through liver biopsies, FIB-4, or FibroScan;\n(4) failing to consider providing treatment to HCV-positive inmates\nunless they have an APRI score above 2.0 that persists for several\nmonths, even though more than half of persons with cirrhosis will not\nhave an APRI score at or above 2.0, and they know that AST levels are\ntransient;\n(5)  disregarding  independent  diagnoses  of  cirrhosis  or  significant\nhepatitis fibrosis in making their treatment decisions; and \n(6) basing treatment decisions on cost, rather than on need for treatment. \nPlaintiffs alleged that instead of receiving DAA treatment, inmates with HCV but who\nhave an APRI score below 2.0 are given a blood draw every six months and potential\ncounseling.\nThe Defendants in this case opposed class certification, arguing in part that the\nPlaintiffs had not submitted sufficient evidence in conjunction with their motion for\ncertification to allow the district court to conduct the “rigorous analysis” that is\nrequired under Rule 23. See Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)\n(explaining that district courts must engage in a “rigorous analysis” to determine\nwhether the requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied); see also Comcast Corp. v.\nBehrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013) (explaining that a party seeking class certification\nmust “be prepared to prove” the requirements of Rule 23(a) and “must also satisfy\nthrough evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of Rule 23(b)”). In response,\nPlaintiffs attached evidence to their reply to the Defendants’ opposition to class\ncertification supporting their compliance with Rule 23’s requirements.  That evidence\nincluded multiple records indicating that inmates were denied DAA drug treatment\nexclusively due to their low APRI scores—even when a Plaintiff had received an\nindependent diagnosis of cirrhosis.  For example, one record stated, “Your APRI score\nis 0.562 and per protocol the APRI score needs to be greater than 2 to be considered\nfor treatment.” The district court granted the Defendants leave to file sur-replies to\naddress the Plaintiffs’ new evidence.\n-5-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 5      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nThe district court granted certification of a class comprised of the following:\nAll those individuals in the custody of MDOC, now or in the future, who\nhave been, or will be, diagnosed with chronic HCV, as that term is\ndefined medically, but who are not provided treatment with direct acting\nantiviral drugs.\nThe  district  court  relied  on  evidence  submitted  by  both  the  Plaintiffs  and  the\nDefendants to support its certification decision. For example, the court found that the\nsize of the proposed class was likely to number at least 2,000 persons, relying on\nevidence from one of the Defendants’ experts to determine how many of the roughly\n5,000 inmates with HCV were likely to develop chronic HCV.  The court found that\nevidence submitted by the Defendants bolstered Plaintiffs’ typicality arguments by\nconfirming the Named Plaintiffs’ allegations that they were diagnosed with chronic\nHCV and had not received treatment with DAA drugs.  After closely examining the\nevidence put forward by both sides regarding the existence of a class wide policy, the\ncourt concluded that the records submitted by the Plaintiffs showing that they were\nrejected  for  DAA  treatment  and  the  Defendants’  own  evidence  referencing\nstandardized “protocols” for the treatment of chronic HCV satisfied the requirement\nthat Plaintiffs be able to show that the party opposing the class acted or refused to act\non grounds applying generally to the class.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nPlaintiffs initially sought injunctions that would require Defendants to: (1)\n“formulate and implement an HCV treatment policy that meets the prevailing standard\nof care, including identifying persons with HCV”; (2) “treat members of the class with\nappropriate DAA drugs”; and (3) “provide members of the class an appropriate and\naccurate assessment of the level of fibrosis or cirrhosis they have, counseling on\ndrug-drug interactions, and ongoing medical care for complications and symptoms of\nHCV.”  The district court modified the scope of those proposed injunctions, replacing\nthe direction to “treat members of the class with appropriate DAA drugs” with a\nprohibition on “delaying or denying DAA drug treatment to class members for any\n-6-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 6      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nnonmedical reason,” due to the court’s recognition that DAA treatment might conflict\nwith other medical indicators.  Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment that the\nDefendants’ policy of withholding treatment with DAA drugs from inmates diagnosed\nwith HCV violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and the ADA.  We granted\nthe Defendants’ Rule 23(f) petition for interlocutory appeal of the district court’s grant\nof class certification.\nII. Discussion\n “To be certified as a class, plaintiffs must meet all of the requirements of Rule\n23(a) and must satisfy one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b).”  In re St. Jude\nMed., Inc., 425 F.3d 1116, 1119 (8th Cir. 2005) (citing Amchem Prod., Inc. v.\nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997); Blades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 568-69\n(8th Cir. 2005)).  Plaintiffs carry the burden of showing that they have met those\nrequirements.  See Luiken v. Domino’s Pizza, LLC, 705 F.3d 370, 372 (8th Cir. 2013)\n(quoting Coleman v. Watt, 40 F.3d 255, 258 (8th Cir. 1994)).  District courts must\nengage in a “rigorous analysis” to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23\nhave been satisfied.  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161 (1982).  We will “reverse a certification\nwhere there has been an abuse of discretion.”  Ebert v. Gen. Mills, Inc., 823 F.3d 472,\n477 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Smith v. ConocoPhillips Pipe Line Co., 801 F.3d 921,\n925 (8th Cir. 2015)).  A district court abuses its discretion if it commits an error of\nlaw.  Sandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. Medtox Sci., Inc., 821 F.3d 992, 995 (8th Cir.\n2016) (citing In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Prods. Liab. Litig., 644 F.3d 604, 616 (8th Cir.\n2011)).  “[T]he district court’s factual findings underlying the certification ruling are\nreviewed under the ‘clearly erroneous’ standard.”  Ebert, 823 F.3d at 477 (quoting\nBlades, 400 F.3d at 566).\n“[A] decision to certify a class is far from a conclusive judgment on the merits\nof the case.”  In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Prod. Liab. Litig., 644 F.3d at 613.  For that\nreason, “Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at\n-7-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 7      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nthe certification stage.”  Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 568 U.S. 455,\n466 (2013).  “Merits questions may be considered to the extent—but only to the\nextent—that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for\nclass certification are satisfied.”  Id.  Our primary task is not to determine the final\ndisposition of a plaintiff’s claims, but instead to examine whether those claims are\nappropriate for class resolution.  See In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Prod. Liab. Litig., 644\nF.3d at 613 (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469 n. 11 (1978))\n(explaining that the “tentative” nature of inquiry on a motion for class certification\nmeans that a court “must determine only” if Rule 23’s requirements have been met).\nBefore considering whether the district court abused its discretion in certifying\nthe class, we address the Defendants’ argument that the district court treated Rule 23\nas a mere “pleading standard” by failing to require additional evidence in support of\nthe Plaintiffs’ allegations.3  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350\n(2011) (“Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.”).  While the district\ncourt’s order contained dicta stating that it believed the Defendants proposed an\noverly stringent evidentiary requirement, the court noted that it would consider the\nevidence  produced  by  the  parties.  Postawko  v.  Missouri  Dep’t  of  Corr.,  No.\n2:16-CV-04219-NKL,  2017  WL  3185155,  at  *5  (W.D.  Mo.  July  26,  2017)\n(“Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs did produce evidence and the Court therefore turns to that\nevidence.”). The court’s consideration of that evidence makes clear that it did not treat\nRule 23’s requirements as a mere “pleading standard.”  The evidence submitted by\nboth parties was sufficient to permit the district court to conduct a “rigorous analysis”\ninto whether or not class certification was appropriate.  We therefore turn to the\nquestion of class certification.\n3The Defendants also argue that the district court improperly relied on evidence\nattached to Plaintiffs’ reply in support of class certification. Admitting the evidence\nin the Plaintiffs’ reply and allowing the Defendants the opportunity to file a sur-reply \nwas an appropriate exercise of discretion in a matter of case management left to the\ndistrict court.\n-8-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 8      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nA.  Rule 23(a)\nRule 23(a) requires plaintiffs to show that the class satisfies the requirements\nof “numerosity, commonality, typicality, and fair and adequate representation.” \nLuiken, 705 F.3d at 372.  The Defendants challenge the district court’s conclusion that\nthe numerosity, commonality, and typicality requirements were satisfied. \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the numerosity\nrequirement was satisfied.  Given the evidence before the district court on the number\nof people suffering from chronic HCV under the MDOC’s care, the district court’s\nfinding that the class was likely to include at least 2,000 people was not clearly\nerroneous.    A  class  of  that  size  would  make  “joinder  of  all  members  .  .  .\nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); see Paxton v. Union Nat. Bank, 688 F.2d\n552, 559-60 (8th Cir. 1982).\nNor did the district court abuse its discretion in finding that the commonality\nrequirement was satisfied.  To satisfy Rule 23(a)(2), plaintiffs must show their claims\ninvolve a common question or contention “of such a nature that it is capable of\nclasswide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will\nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” \nSandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC, 821 F.3d at 998 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350);\nsee also Ebert, 823 F.3d at 478 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 359)).  The mere\npresence of one or more common questions is not enough; rather, the district court\nmust examine “the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common answers\napt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, 361 (5th\nCir. 2017) (emphasis omitted in original) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350).\nHere the district court ably identified common questions whose answers were\n“apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  For example, the members of the\nproposed class must show the Defendants acted “with ‘deliberate indifference to [an\n-9-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 9      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\ninmate’s] serious medical needs’” to succeed on their Eighth Amendment claim. \nBender v. Regier, 385 F.3d 1133, 1137 (8th Cir. 2004) (alteration in original) (quoting\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976)).  As the district court noted, “[A]ll class\nmembers share the common question of whether the Defendants’ policy or custom of\nwithholding treatment with DAA drugs from individuals who have been or will be\ndiagnosed with chronic HCV constitutes deliberate indifference to a serious medical\nneed.”  Answering that question will resolve an issue “central to the validity” of each\nof the class members’ claims.4\nThe Defendants argue that the unique medical condition of each member of the\nclass means that resolving their claims will require a “highly individualized” inquiry.\nThis misunderstands the nature of the class’s claims.  Plaintiffs assert that the failure\nof the Defendants to screen properly for a life-threatening disease and provide\nappropriate treatment exposes all inmates suffering from chronic HCV to the same\nunconstitutional injury.  Cf. Allard v. Baldwin, 779 F.3d 768, 772 (8th Cir. 2015)\n(citations omitted) (“A plaintiff can show deliberate indifference in the level of care\nprovided in different ways, including showing grossly incompetent or inadequate care,\nshowing a defendant’s decision to take an easier and less efficacious course of\ntreatment, or showing a defendant intentionally delayed or denied access to medical\ncare.”).  While a putative class seeking damages for such claims might struggle to\nsatisfy Rule 23(a)(2), a class certified under Rule 23(b)(2) seeking only injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief suffers no such difficulty.5  Here the physical symptoms eventually\n4Plaintiffs’ ADA claim clears the same hurdle.  As the district court stated,\n“[A]ll class members share the common mixed factual and legal question of whether\nDefendants use the alleged policies to discriminate against inmates in need of medical\ntreatment based on their chronic HCV diagnoses.”\n5The Defendants’ comparison to Wal-Mart supports, rather than weakens,\nPlaintiffs’  claims.    In  Wal-Mart,  the  plaintiffs’  discrimination  claims  included\ndamages and involved the exercise of discretion by different managers all over the\ncountry.  See Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 136 S. Ct. 1036, 1048 (2016)\n-10-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 10      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nsuffered by each class member may vary, but the question asked by each class\nmember is susceptible to common resolution.  See Yates, 868 F.3d at 363 (affirming\nclass certification even where no two class members had “the exact same risk,” as the\nrelevant policy was alleged to pose an unconstitutional risk of serious harm to all class\nmembers); Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014) (explaining that\n“although a presently existing risk may ultimately result in different future harm for\ndifferent inmates . . . every inmate suffers exactly the same constitutional injury when\nhe is exposed to a single . . . policy or practice that creates a substantial risk of serious\nharm”).\nThe typicality requirement was also satisfied.  Typicality “is fairly easily met\nso long as other class members have claims similar to the named plaintiff.”  DeBoer\nv. Mellon Mortg. Co., 64 F.3d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir. 1995) (citing Paxton, 688 F.2d at\n562).  “Factual variations in the individual claims will not normally preclude class\ncertification if the claim arises from the same event or course of conduct as the class\nclaims, and gives rise to the same legal or remedial theory.”  Alpern v. UtiliCorp\nUnited, Inc., 84 F.3d 1525, 1540 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Donaldson v. Pillsbury Co.,\n554 F.2d 825, 831 (8th Cir. 1977)).  The Defendants argue that the Named Plaintiffs’\nclaims require individualized inquiries, such that their claims are not typical of the\nclass.  This argument overlaps significantly with their arguments on commonality. \nSee Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157-158 n.13)\n(explaining that the “commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to\nmerge”).  We therefore reject the argument for similar reasons.  In this suit for\n(explaining that the plaintiffs in Wal-Mart “did not provide significant proof of a\ncommon policy of discrimination to which each employee was subject”).  By contrast,\nhere the Plaintiffs allege the existence of a single policy related to HCV treatment and\nAPRI scores that involves no discretionary decision-making.  Cf. Bouaphakeo v.\nTyson Foods, Inc., 765 F.3d 791, 797 (8th Cir. 2014), aff’d and remanded, 136 S. Ct.\n1036 (2016) (“Unlike [in Wal-Mart], Tyson had a specific company policy . . . that\napplied to all class members.”).\n-11-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 11      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\nprospective  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief,  the  potential  for  minor  “factual\nvariations” does not undermine the district court’s conclusion that the violation\nallegedly suffered by the Named Plaintiffs is typical of that suffered by the class as\na whole.  See DeBoer, 64 F.3d at 1174–75 (explaining that claims may be “typical of\nthe remainder of the class given the nature of the injunctive relief sought,” even when\nthe amount of harm might differ if plaintiffs had instead brought a suit for damages). \nThe district court did not clearly err in finding that the Named Plaintiffs are exposed\nto the same alleged risk under the Defendants’ policies as all other inmates suffering\nfrom HCV.  The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are therefore typical of the class.\nB. Rule 23(b)(2)\nPlaintiffs must demonstrate that “the party opposing the class has acted or\nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\nwhole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  For certification to be appropriate, the class claims\nmust be “cohesive.”  Avritt v. Reliastar Life Ins. Co., 615 F.3d 1023, 1035 (8th Cir.\n2010) (quoting In re St. Jude Med., Inc., 425 F.3d at 1121).  “Rule 23(b)(2) applies\nonly when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each\nmember of the class.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360.\nThis case involves claims that the Defendants uniformly applied a screening and\ntreatment policy for HCV that was so inadequate that it amounted to a constitutional\nviolation as to each and every incarcerated person who either suffered or will suffer\nfrom HCV.  If those claims are true, they describe a party acting “on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class.”  The district court engaged in a “rigorous analysis”\nof the evidence put forward by both Plaintiffs and Defendants before concluding that\nthere was sufficient evidence that the party opposing the class “acted or refused to act”\non grounds that apply generally to the class.  As part of its analysis, the court closely\nexamined  the  medical  records  submitted  by  the  plaintiffs  and  considered\n-12-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 12      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\ninconsistencies within the Defendants’ evidence concerning the existence of a uniform\npolicy.\nWhether or not the class will be able to show that each proposed injunction is\nwarranted on the merits is not before us.  Rather, we are tasked only with determining\nwhether the district court abused its discretion by holding that the proposed class\naction satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).  The district court’s modified\nproposed injunctions identify relief that would respond to the alleged harm on a\nuniform, generally applicable basis.  Cf. Yates, 868 F.3d at 368 (affirming class\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) for claims seeking injunctive relief where “[a]ll\ninmates, regardless of age or health,” were subject to the same policy on climate\ncontrol and were “(allegedly) harmed in essentially the same way—i.e., by exposure\nto a substantial risk of serious harm because of exposure to excessive heat”).  While\nthe Defendants may continue to challenge the existence and parameters of the alleged\npolicy at trial, at this stage they are unable to show that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in holding that sufficient evidence of a common policy existed to comply\nwith Rule 23(b)(2). \nC. Federalism Interests \nThe Defendants urge us to hold that this class certification decision implicates\nprinciples of federalism regarding the authority of a state to administer its own\nprisons.  We are mindful “of the special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved\nbetween federal equitable power and State administration of its own law.”  Elizabeth\nM. v. Montenez, 458 F.3d 779, 784 (8th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation mark omitted)\n(citing Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 378 (1976)).  But see Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S.\n493, 511 (2011) (“Courts may not allow constitutional violations to continue simply\nbecause a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison administration.”).\nFor that reason, in Elizabeth M. we stated that a certification decision did not pay\n“sufficient heed” to federalism interests where the class action sought “sweeping\n-13-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 13      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  \n\ninjunctive relief which, if granted, would require the district court to mandate and\nmonitor detailed programs governing nearly every facet of the State’s operation” of\nthree residential facilities.  458 F.3d at 783, 788. The injunctions sought in this case\nare not nearly so broad and relate only to a single policy regarding one particular\nillness.  As we are satisfied that the Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 23’s requirements,\nwe may wait to consider any further concerns about the balance between state and\nfederal authority until (and if) the district court imposes an equitable remedy.\nD. Plaintiffs’ Claim under the ADA\nThe Defendants also challenge the district court’s ruling on the sufficiency of\nthe Plaintiffs’ ADA pleadings.  The limited nature of our review of class certification\nunder Rule 23(f) does not allow a defendant to make expansive arguments on the\nmerits of the underlying appeal.  See Mims v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 590 F.3d 298,\n306 (5th Cir. 2009) (“Given our limited jurisdiction in this Rule 23(f) appeal, we have\nno authority to review the district court’s conclusion that the plaintiffs have stated a\nclaim for these alleged overcharges under this theory.”); In re Delta Airlines, 310 F.3d\n953, 960 (6th Cir. 2002) (“The Rule 23(f) appeal should not become a vehicle for\nearly review of a legal theory that underlies the merits of a class action.”).  A careful\nreview of the Defendants’ ADA-related arguments reveals that they do not relate to\nthe propriety of certification under Rule 23.  Instead, they present merits challenges\nto the Plaintiffs’ claims (arguing that under the ADA plaintiffs may not challenge the\ninadequacy of the medical services offered).  Whatever the merits of the Defendants’\narguments, they do not clearly relate to whether class certification is appropriate under\nRule 23.  We therefore conclude that Defendants’ ADA arguments lie outside our\njurisdiction on this Rule 23(f) appeal.\nIII. Conclusion\nWe affirm the certification decision of the district court.\n______________________________\n-14-\nAppellate Case: 17-3029     Page: 14      Date Filed: 12/06/2018 Entry ID: 4733057  ",

Precythe \nmove to dismiss all of Plaintiffs’ claims against them.  [Doc. 103].  For the following reasons, \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. \nI.    Background1 \n  Plaintiffs Michael Postawko, Christopher Baker, and Michael Jamerson are incarcerated \nin the Missouri Department of Corrections (“MDOC”).  [Doc. 30, p. 3].  They filed this putative \nclass action for claims arising out of what they allege to be inadequate medical care for their \nchronic Hepatitis C (“HCV”) viral infections.  [Id.].  They bring claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nand  Title  II  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  against  numerous  defendants, \nincluding  their  prison  treating  physicians  and  nurses;  prison  officials  who  reviewed  their \n                                                           \n1 At the motion to dismiss stage, all of the plaintiffs’ allegations are accepted as true and \nconstrued in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.  Stodghill v. Wellston Sch. Dist., 512 F.3d \n472, 476 (8th Cir. 2008). \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 1 of 33\n\ngrievances and requests for treatment; the MDOC; and Corizon, LLC, the healthcare provider for \nall MDOC facilities.  [Id. at p. 4-9]. \n  A.   Hepatitis C  \n  HCV is a viral infection that attacks the liver and causes its inflammation, referred to as \nhepatitis.  [Id. at p. 9].  Hepatitis caused by HCV can significantly impair liver function and \ndamage its crucial role in digesting nutrients, filtering toxins from the blood, and preventing \ndisease.    [Id.].    In  turn,  liver  impairment  can  cause  severe  pain,  fatigue,  muscle  wasting, \ndifficulty or pain with urination, an increased risk of heart attacks, and other side effects.  [Id.].   \n  HCV can be either acute or chronic.  [Id.].  A small percentage of people who are \nexposed to infected blood develop an acute infection that their body resolves without treatment.  \n[Id.].  However, the majority of people who develop acute HCV, approximately 75 to 85 percent, \ngo on to develop chronic HCV.  [Id. at p. 10].  People with chronic HCV develop fibrosis of the \nliver, which is a process by which healthy liver tissue is replaced with scarring.  [Id.].  Because \nscar tissue cannot perform the jobs of normal liver cells, fibrosis reduces liver function.  [Id.].   \n  When scar tissue begins to take over most of the liver, this extensive fibrosis is termed \ncirrhosis.  [Id.].  Cirrhosis is irreversible, and it often causes additional painful complications, \nincluding  arthritic  pain  throughout  the  body,  kidney  disease,  jaundice,  fluid  retention  with \nedema, internal bleeding, easy bruising, abdominal ascites, mental confusion, lymph disorders, \nwidespread itching, and even more extreme fatigue.   [Id.].  Because  it can be difficult to \ndetermine  exactly  when  significant  hepatitis  fibrosis  becomes  cirrhosis,  most  of  these \ncomplications can occur before cirrhosis.  [Id.].  Further, if these complications go untreated, \nsome can cause death.  [Id.].  At least half of all persons diagnosed with chronic HCV will \ndevelop cirrhosis or liver cancer, and between 70 and 90 percent will develop chronic liver \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 2 of 33\n\ndisease.  [Id.].  Each day without treatment increases a person’s likelihood of developing chronic \nliver disease, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death from liver failure.  [Id.]. \n  At least 10 to 15 percent of the population under the supervision, care, and custody of the \nMDOC are infected with HCV.  [Id. at p. 11].  As of January 2015, the MDOC reported that it \nwas treating 0.11 percent of HCV-positive inmates under its supervision, or 5 inmates out of \n4,736 inmates with known HCV infections.  [Id.].   \n  B.  Standard of Care for HCV  \n  For many years, there was no effective and safe treatment for HCV.  [Id.].  The standard \ntreatment, which included the use of interferon and ribavirin medications, failed to cure most \npatients and was associated with adverse side effects, including psychiatric and autoimmune \ndisorders.  [Id. at p. 12].  However, over the past four years, the Federal Drug Administration \n(“FDA”)  has  approved  eight  new  medications,  called  direct-acting  antiviral  drugs  (“DAA \ndrugs”), which work faster, cause fewer side effects, and are more effective.  [Id.].  Over 90 \npercent of patients treated with a DAA drug are cured.  [Id. at p. 14].     \n  The CDC encourages health professionals to follow the evidence-based standard of care \ndeveloped  by  the  Infectious  Diseases  Society  of  America  (“IDSA”)  and  the  American \nAssociation for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”), which constitutes the medical standard \nof care.  [Id.].  On July 6, 2016, these organizations updated the standard of care to recommend \ntreating all persons with chronic HCV with DAA drugs.  [Id. at p. 15].  Benefits of treatment \ninclude  an  immediate  decrease  in  liver  inflammation,  reduction  in  the  progression  of  liver \nfibrosis and improvement in cirrhosis, a 70 percent reduction in the risk of liver cancer, and a 90 \npercent reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality.  [Id.].  Studies show that a delay in DAA \ndrug treatment for HCV decreases the benefits associated with cure.  [Id.].   \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 3 of 33\n\n  C.  Methods for Determining Progression of Fibrosis/Cirrhosis \n  Health care providers use several methods to determine the advancement of an HCV-\npositive person’s cirrhosis or fibrosis, including liver biopsy and APRI (AST to Platelet Ratio \nIndex).  [Id. at p. 16].  APRI is the use of a blood sample to determine the ratio of a certain \nenzyme in the blood, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), with (1) the usual amount of AST in the \nblood of a healthy person and (2) the number of platelets in the affected person’s blood.  [Id.].  \nWhen an APRI score is very high, it has good diagnostic utility in predicting severe fibrosis or \ncirrhosis, but low and mid-range scores miss many people who have significant fibrosis or \ncirrhosis.  [Id.].  For example, in more than 90 percent of cases, an APRI score of at least 2.0 \nindicates that a person has cirrhosis.  [Id. at p. 17].  However, more than half of all people with \ncirrhosis will not have an APRI score of at least 2.0.  [Id.].    \n  If a person has already been diagnosed with cirrhosis through some other means, such as \nliver biopsy, an APRI score is irrelevant and not necessary for measuring the progression of \nfibrosis.  [Id.].  In addition, because the levels of AST and ALT in one’s blood fluctuate from \nday to day, a decreased or normalized level does not mean the condition has improved, and even \na series of normal readings over time may fail to accurately show the level of fibrosis or \ncirrhosis.  [Id.].  Furthermore, the elevation levels of AST and ALT often fail to show an \nindividual’s current level of fibrosis or cirrhosis, and they often fail to predict the consequences \nof not treating that individual.  [Id.].   Although ALT is found predominately in the liver and not \nall over the body like AST, and ALT is a more specific indicator of liver inflammation than \nAST, an APRI score relies only on AST without taking ALT into account.  [Doc. 30, p. 17].  For \nall of these reasons, using an APRI score alone to determine the severity of a person’s fibrosis or \ncirrhosis is not adequate or appropriate.  [Id.].   \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 4 of 33\n\n  D.  Defendants’ HCV Treatment Policy within the MDOC \n  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Precythe, MDOC, and Corizon, LLC have the following \npolicies or customs, all of which are contrary to the prevailing standard of care: (1) not providing \nDAA drug treatment to all inmates with HCV, or even all inmates with chronic HCV; (2) using \nan APRI score, which measures the progression of fibrosis or cirrhosis, to determine whether a \nperson should be treated; (3) relying exclusively on APRI score to determine the stage of fibrosis \nor  cirrhosis,  rather  than  using  other  more  accurate  methods  of  determining  its  progression \nthrough liver biopsies, FIB-4, or FibroScan; (4) failing to consider providing treatment to HCV-\npositive inmates unless they have an APRI score above 2.0 that persists for several months, even \nthough more than half of persons with cirrhosis will not have an APRI score at or above 2.0, and \nthey know that AST levels are transient; (5) disregarding independent diagnoses of cirrhosis or \nsignificant  hepatitis  fibrosis  in  making  their  treatment  decisions;  and  (6)  basing  treatment \ndecisions on cost, rather than on need for treatment.  [Id. at p. 17-18].  Plaintiffs further allege \nthat these policies or customs have caused, and continue to cause, unnecessary pain and an \nunreasonable risk of serious damage to the health of HCV-positive inmates.  [Id. at p. 18].   \n  Contrary  to  the  proper  and  necessary  medical  procedures  and  the  standard  of  care, \nDefendants have repeatedly denied requests by Plaintiffs Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson, as \nwell as by other members of the putative class, for DAA drug treatment for their HCV infections.  \n[Id. at p. 19].  It is the policy of Defendants to classify inmates with known HCV infection as \n“Chronic Care Clinic Offenders.”  [Id.].  Rather than receiving treatment, these inmates receive a \nblood draw every six months and, at times, minimal counseling.  [Id.].  Defendants also have a \npolicy or custom of permitting “Chronic Care Clinic” visits with HCV-positive inmates to be \n5 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 5 of 33\n\nconducted by video so that there cannot be a visual and physical inspection of the liver, which is \ncontrary to the prevailing standard of care.  [Id.].   \n  E.  Plaintiffs Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson’s Claims \n  Plaintiff  Michael  Postawko  became  infected  with  HCV  while  under  the  care  and \nsupervision of the MDOC in or around 2012.  [Id. at p. 20].  Every Defendant treater who \nPostawko has seen at the MDOC or who has reviewed his HCV-related complaints has refused \nto treat Postawko with DAA drugs, contrary to the prevailing standard of care.  [Id.].  Postawko \nhas symptoms consistent with HCV, including extreme fatigue to the point that brushing his \nteeth causes intense aching in his arm muscles; fever; abdominal pain; severe headaches; almost \nconstant joint pain; and dark urine with what appear to be traces of blood.  [Id.].  Postawko \nreceives two medications for his severe headaches, sumatriptan and propranolol HCL, which are \nonly about 60 percent effective.  [Id.].  Postawko has not received any HCV treatment.  [Id.].   \n  In  2005,  Plaintiff  Christopher  Baker  was  diagnosed  with  HCV,  and  in  2007,  he \nunderwent a liver biopsy and was diagnosed with cirrhosis.  [Id. at p. 21].  In 2008, Baker was \nsentenced to ten years in the MDOC.  [Id.].  In 2009, the MDOC began treating Baker with the \nthen-prevailing  treatment,  interferon  and  ribavirin,  which  appeared  to  be  working.    [Id.].  \nHowever, after five months of treatment, the MDOC, through a provider named Dr. McKinney, \ninformed Baker that the MDOC was no longer treating HCV-positive inmates with those drugs \nand discontinued Baker’s course of treatment.  [Id.].   \n  Since early 2010, Baker has received no further treatment for HCV and has received no \ntreatment at any time with a DAA drug.  [Id.].  Each treater who Baker has seen at the MDOC or \nwho has denied his HCV-related complaints, including Defendant Adrienne Hardy, has refused \nto treat him with DAA drugs, contrary to the prevailing standard of care.  [Id.].   \n6 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 6 of 33\n\n  On March 2, 2016, while Baker was incarcerated at  JCCC, an Informal Resolution \nRequest response to Baker indicates that he was “placed on a spreadsheet” because he had an \nAPRI score above 1.0, without regard to his pre-incarceration cirrhosis diagnosis, which was \nmade based on a liver biopsy.  [Id.].  Baker did not receive any treatment as a result of either his \nindependent cirrhosis diagnosis or his placement on a spreadsheet. [Id.].  In July 2016, Baker \nwas transferred from JCCC to Algoa Correctional Center where he no longer even appears on a \nlist for treatment.  [Id.].  Baker has symptoms consistent with HCV, including nausea, severe \njoint pain, fatigue, back and chest pain, tenderness in his liver area, and dark urine.  [Id. at p. 22].   \n  Plaintiff Michael Jamerson became infected with HCV while incarcerated at the MDOC.  \n[Id.].  Jamerson has repeatedly requested treatment with DAA drugs.  [Id.].  Although Jamerson \nis enrolled in the Chronic Care Clinic, he has not received any treatment with any DAA drug.  \n[Id.].  Every medical provider Jamerson has seen at the MDOC or who has directed his course of \ntreatment, has refused to treat him with DAA drugs, contrary to the standard of care.  [Id.].  \nJamerson has symptoms consistent with HCV, including fatigue; muscle and joint pain; stomach, \nliver, and chest pain; and tenderness in his liver area.  [Id.].   \n  Plaintiffs bring claims under the Eighth Amendment and the ADA, individually and on \nbehalf of a putative class.  Plaintiffs bring two claims on behalf of a putative class: \n  Count I for prospective relief for deprivation of their Eighth Amendment rights \nagainst Precythe, in her official capacity, and Corizon, LLC; and \n  Count II for prospective relief for violation of the ADA against the MDOC. \n \nIn addition, Plaintiffs Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson bring the following individual claims: \n  Count  III  brought  by  Postawko  for  damages  for  deprivation  of  his  Eighth \nAmendment rights against Precythe, in her official capacity; Corizon, LLC; and \nten medical employees;  \n  Count IV brought by Postawko for damages for violation of the ADA against the \nMDOC.   \n7 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 7 of 33\n\n  Count V brought by Baker for damages for deprivation of his Eighth Amendment \nrights  against  Precythe,  in  her  official  capacity;  Corizon,  LLC;  and  twelve \nmedical  employees,  including  Adrienne  Hardy,  a  registered  nurse  and  the \ndirector of nursing at JCCC;  \n  Count VI brought by Baker for damages for violation of the ADA against the \nMDOC. \n  Count  VII  brought  by  Jamerson  for  damages  for  deprivation  of  his  Eighth \nAmendment rights against Precythe, in her official capacity; Corizon, LLC; and \nten medical employees; and \n  Count VIII brought by Jamerson for damages for violation of the ADA against \nthe MDOC. \n \nII.  Discussion \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims (Counts I, III, V, and VII) \nshould be dismissed because Plaintiffs fail to state a claim.  In the alternative, Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims against MDOC Director Precythe (Counts III, \nV, and VII) are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  As to Baker’s Eighth Amendment claim \nagainst Defendant Hardy (Count V), Defendants contend that Hardy is entitled to qualified \nimmunity.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ ADA claims (Counts II, IV, VI, and VIII) should be \ndismissed because they fail to state a claim.  Additionally, Defendants contend that these claims \nare also barred by the Eleventh Amendment.    \nAt the pleading stage, a plaintiff is not required to present detailed factual allegations.  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the \npleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is \nliable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009).  \nA.    Eighth Amendment Claims: Counts I, III, V, and VII \n  In Counts I, III, V, and VII, Plaintiffs bring Eighth Amendment claims for deliberate \nindifference to their serious medical needs against the MDOC; MDOC Director Anne Precythe; \nCorizon, LLC; numerous individual medical staff, including doctors and nurses; and Adrienne \n8 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 8 of 33\n\nHardy, a medical contract monitor and nurse.  Defendants MDOC and Precythe move to dismiss \nthese  counts  against  them,  arguing  that  Plaintiffs  fail  to  state  a  claim  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment because they have no constitutional right to obtain the particular course of Hepatitis \nC treatment that they demand.   \n  The Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide inmates with proper medical \ncare.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976); see also Crooks v. Nix, 872 F.2d 800, 804 (8th \nCir. 1989) (“Where a prisoner needs medical treatment prison officials are under a constitutional \nduty to see that it is furnished.”).  To prevail on a claim of constitutionally inadequate medical \ncare, the plaintiff inmate must show that the defendants “act[ed] with deliberate indifference to \nthe prisoner’s serious medical needs.”  Bender v. Regier, 385 F.3d 1133, 1137 (8th Cir. 2005) \n(quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104).  Such claims have both an objective component and  a \nsubjective component.  Dulaney v. Carnahan, 132 F.3d 1234, 1239 (8th Cir. 1997).  Specifically, \nthe plaintiff must show (1) that he had an objectively serious medical need and (2) that prison \nofficials subjectively knew of, but deliberately disregarded, that need.  Id.   \n1.  Serious Medical Need \n  Plaintiffs plausibly allege that they have a serious medical need, the first requirement for \ntheir Eighth Amendment claims.  A “serious medical need” is “one that has been diagnosed by a \nphysician as requiring treatment, or one that is so obvious that even a layperson would easily \nrecognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.”  Coleman v. Rahija, 114 F.3d 778, 784 (8th Cir. \n1997) (quoting Cambreros v. Branstad, 73 F.3d 174, 176 (8th Cir. 1995)).  “When an inmate \nalleges that a delay in medical treatment constituted a constitutional deprivation, ‘the objective \nseriousness of the deprivation should also be measured by reference to the effect of delay in \ntreatment.’” Id. (citing Crowley v. Hedgepeth, 109 F.3d 500, 502 (8th Cir. 1997)). \n9 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 9 of 33\n\n  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that they have been diagnosed with HCV, which the \nEighth Circuit has characterized as being “unquestionably a serious medical problem.”  Bender \nv. Regier, 385 F.3d 1133, 1137 (8th Cir. 2004).  Plaintiffs allege that left untreated, HCV causes \npain and lasting bodily harm, including fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver and, in the vast majority \nof cases, chronic liver disease.  The Complaint further provides that cirrhosis is irreversible and \ncan  cause  additional  painful  complications,  including  among  other  complications,  kidney \ndisease, jaundice, internal bleeding, fluid retention with edema, mental confusion, and extreme \nfatigue.   \n  Defendants respond by citing Bender v. Regier, 385 F.3d 1133, 1137 (8th Cir. 2004), \nwhich held that “the Eighth Amendment issue is not whether the infection itself is a ‘serious \nmedical  need,’  but  rather  whether  [the  plaintiffs]  had  a  serious  medical  need  for  prompt \n[treatment with DAAs].”  As to this issue, Plaintiffs allege that treatment with direct-acting \nantiviral drugs, which were first made available in 2013, produces more than a 90 percent cure \nrate.  They further allege that the current prevailing standard of care, as established by the \nInfectious Diseases Society of America (“IDSA”) and American Association for the Study of \nLiver Diseases (“AASLD”), mandates treatment of all persons with chronic HCV with a DAA \ndrug.  Plaintiffs plead that despite their HCV diagnoses, they do not receive any treatment for \ntheir  HCV  infections,  aside  from  a  blood  draw  every  six  months  and  at  times,  minimal \ncounseling.  Furthermore, they plead that delay in treatment with one of the available DAA drugs \nincreases their likelihood of developing chronic liver disease, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, \npainful complications, and death from liver failure.  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that they suffer \nindividual  complications  from  their  chronic  HCV  infections,  including  extreme  fatigue, \nabdominal pain, severe headaches, dark urine with what appear to be traces of blood, severe joint \n10 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 10 of 33\n\npain, back and chest pain, and tenderness in the area of their livers.  In addition, Plaintiff Baker \nalleges that despite being independently diagnosed with cirrhosis in 2010 via liver biopsy, a \nmore accurate indicator than APRI score, he does not receive any HCV treatment.  In light of \nthese assertions, Plaintiffs’ Complaint plausibly alleges that Plaintiffs have a serious medical \nneed for prompt treatment with DAAs. \n2.  Deliberate Indifference   \n   \n  Plaintiffs also plausibly allege the second requirement that Defendants subjectively knew \nof,  but  deliberately  disregarded,  their  serious  medical  need  for  treatment.    “Deliberate \nindifference entails a level of culpability equal to the criminal law definition of recklessness: \ndisregarding a known risk to the inmate’s health.”  Allard v. Baldwin, 779 F.3d 768, 772 (8th \nCir. 2015) (internal quotation marks removed).  Mere malpractice of medicine in prison does not \namount to an Eighth Amendment violation.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976).  In \nother words, “an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care,” such as “a complaint that \na physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a \nclaim.”  Id. (emphasis added); see also, Harrison v. Barkley, 291 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2000) \n(explaining that “[t]his principle [from Estelle] may cover a delay in treatment based on a bad \ndiagnosis or erroneous calculus of risks and costs, or a mistaken decision not to treat based on an \nerroneous view that the condition is benign or trivial or hopeless, or that treatment is unreliable, \nor that the cure is as risky or painful or bad as the malady.”).  In contrast, “refus[ing] treatment of \na properly diagnosed condition that [i]s progressively degenerative, potentially dangerous and \npainful, and that could be treated easily and without risk . . . is not ‘mere medical malpractice.’”  \nHarrison, 219 F.3d at 139.  \n11 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 11 of 33\n\n  “A plaintiff can show deliberate indifference in the level of care provided in different \nways, including by showing grossly incompetent or inadequate care,” Smith v. Jenkins, 919 F.2d \n90, 93 (8th Cir. 1990), showing a defendant’s decision to take an easier and less efficacious \ncourse  of  treatment,  id.,  or  showing  a  defendant  intentionally  delayed  or  denied  access  to \nmedical care, Meloy v. Bachmeier, 302 F.3d 845, 849 (8th Cir. 2002).”  Allard v. Baldwin, 779 \nF.3d 768, 772 (8th Cir. 2015).  Although mere medical negligence—an inadvertent failure to \nprovide adequate medical care—does not violate the Eighth Amendment, “medical treatment \nmay so deviate from the applicable standard of care as to evidence a physician’s deliberate \nindifference” in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Moore v. Duffy, 255 F.3d 543 (8th Cir. \n2001).    In  addition,  “[i]n  institutional  level  challenges  to  prison  health  care  .  .  .  systemic \ndeficiencies can provide the basis for a finding of deliberate indifference.”  Harris v. Thigpen, \n941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir. 1991).  For example, “a series of incidents closely related in time \nmay disclose a pattern of conduct amounting to deliberate indifference.” Id. (internal quotations \nomitted).  Further, “[r]epeated examples of delayed or denied medical care may indicate a \ndeliberate indifference by prison authorities to the suffering that results.”  Id. \n  In  this  case,  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  plausibly  alleges  that  Defendants  deliberately \ndisregarded and continue to disregard Plaintiffs’ serious medical need for DAA drug treatment.  \nDefendants are aware of the availability and efficacy of DAA drugs.  Defendants know that the \napplicable standard of care calls for treating all patients suffering from chronic HCV with those \nDAA drugs, regardless of their cirrhosis/fibrosis progression or APRI score, and that a delay in \ntreatment with DAA drugs increases the risks of HCV progression as well as decreases the \nbenefits of DAA treatment.  However, despite this awareness, Defendants follow a policy or \ncustom that categorically denies DAA drug treatment to inmates with chronic HCV.  Under this \n12 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 12 of 33\n\npolicy, Defendants do not even consider treating inmates with chronic HCV with DAA drugs \nunless and until those inmates have APRI scores above 2.0 that persist for several months.2  \nDefendants follow this policy despite the following alleged facts: more than half of all people \nwith cirrhosis will not have an APRI score of at least 2.0; APRI scores fluctuate from day to day, \nand an improvement in APRI score does not mean the condition has improved; an APRI score \nobtained from a blood draw is only one of several methods used to determine the progression of \nan individual’s fibrosis/cirrhosis; and the standard of care is to treat an individual with chronic \nHCV with a DAA drug, regardless of his APRI score.  As a result of this policy, Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint further alleges that as of January 2015, the MDOC reported that it was treating with \nDAA drugs only 0.11 percent of all of its HCV-positive inmates, which equates to approximately \nfive inmates out of 4,736 inmates with known HCV infections.    \n  As alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, this “wait and see” policy of relying solely on APRI \nscores and delaying DAA treatment until the disease has progressed to a far more serious level \ncontravenes the applicable medical standard of care without any medical justification.3   See, \ne.g., Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, 2017 WL 34700, at *15, quoting Monmouth Cty. Corr. Ins. Inmates v. \nLanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987) (“Deliberate indifference is also evidenced where \nprison officials erect arbitrary and burdensome procedures that result in interminable delays and \n                                                           \n2 As alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint and discussed in Section I.C., an APRI score is obtained \nfrom a blood sample and provides the ratio of a particular enzyme with platelets in the affected \nperson’s blood.  Measuring one’s APRI score is one method used to determine the progression of \na person’s fibrosis/cirrhosis.  The APRI score method has good diagnostic utility in predicting \nsevere  fibrosis  or  cirrhosis  when  the  APRI  score  is  very  high.    However,  the  test  is \nunderinclusive in that low and mid-range APRI scores miss many people who have significant \nfibrosis or cirrhosis.  For example, more than half of all people with cirrhosis will not have an \nAPRI score of at least 2.0. \n3 In addition to this policy or custom lacking any medical justification, Plaintiffs also allege that \nit results in treatment decisions based on cost, rather than on medical need, which only further \nsuggests that the condition imposed on treatment is likely an arbitrary and unreasonable one.   \n13 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 13 of 33\n\noutright denials of medical care to suffering inmates.”).  Because chronic HCV is a progressive \ndisease and delay in treatment with DAA drugs reduces the benefits associated with treatment, \nDefendant’s policy causes unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain and increases the risk of \nserious damage to the health of those inmates suffering from chronic HCV.  Taken as true, these \nfacts  plausibly  allege  a  deliberate  disregard  for  Plaintiffs’  serious  medical  needs  for  DAA \ntreatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  See, e.g., Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, 2017 WL \n34700, at *15 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2017) (finding reasonable likelihood of success on deliberate \nindifference prong where defendant prison followed policy of choosing a course of monitoring \nover DAA treatment for non-medical reasons and allowing the HCV-positive inmate’s condition \nto worsen while his liver function and health continued to deteriorate before even considering \ntreatment with DAA drugs); Harrison v. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that \nboth “outright refusal of any treatment for a degenerative condition that tends to cause acute \ninfection and pain if left untreated” and the “imposition of a seriously unreasonable condition on \nsuch treatment” constitute deliberate indifference by prison officials).   \n  Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged more than mere medical malpractice—an inadvertent \nfailure to provide adequate medical care.  For instance, their denied access to DAA treatment is \nnot the result of a misdiagnosis; they have been properly diagnosed with chronic HCV, for which \nthe medical standard of care calls for DAA drug treatment.  Cf. Allard v. Baldwin, 779 F.3d 768, \n772  (8th  Cir.  2015)  (finding  inmate  who  was  misdiagnosed  with  constipation  and  given \nextensive treatment for that diagnosis but where his proper diagnosis was for a bowel obstruction \ndid not show deliberate indifference by prison because the delay in proper treatment was the \nresult of negligent misdiagnosis, not actual knowledge of his condition coupled with denial of \nproper treatment).  Further,  Defendants’ decision to deny DAA treatment to Plaintiffs is not \n14 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 14 of 33\n\n“based on an erroneous view that the condition is benign or trivial or hopeless, or that treatment \nis unreliable, or that the cure is as risky or painful or bad as the malady.”  Harrison v. Barkley, \n291 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2000).  Plaintiffs’ chronic HCV condition is a serious and harmful \nmedical condition, which risks increasingly serious liver damage, among other bodily harms, to \nthose who have it.  Plaintiffs are not denied DAA treatment “based on an erroneous view that . . . \ntreatment is as risky or painful or bad as the malady” because DAA drug treatment is reliable, \nsafe, and highly effective with a 90 percent cure rate for those infected with HCV.  Id.  Finally, \nPlaintiffs do not  allege  entitlement to  some novel  or cutting-edge  course of  treatment that \nconstitutes something more than that required by the applicable standard of care.  Instead, they \nhave alleged that they are categorically denied access to the proper treatment for their HCV—\nDAA drug treatment—which is the medical standard of care as recommended by the CDC, \nIDSCA, and AASLD.  See also Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, 2017 WL 34700,  at *15 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 3, \n2017) (“[T]he standard of care as established by the CDC and AASLD for treatment of patients \nwith hepatitis C is the use of DAA medications. . . . The DOC’s own expert [] agreed that the \nsame standard of care as to hepatitis C treatment that is applicable to the community at large \nshould apply in a correctional setting . . . and [t]hus, the standard of care for treating Plaintiff is \nto administer DAA medications”).     \n  Defendants respond in part by asking the Court to take judicial notice of what they \nqualify  as  “indisputable  facts,”  including  that  HCV  is  “typically  an  extremely  slow-acting \ndisease” and that “the large majority of HCV-positive persons will never suffer any serious \nadverse effects from the disease.”  [Doc. 127, p. 3, n.1].  However, even if true, these facts do not \njustify as a matter of law Defendants’ policy of categorically denying the proper treatment to \ninmates with chronic HCV by imposing an arbitrary condition on that treatment unsupported by \n15 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 15 of 33\n\nmedical justification.  Defendants appear to suggest that because not every inmate infected with \nchronic-HCV will definitely suffer “serious adverse effects” from the disease, then treatment is \nnot warranted.  But, in contrast to Defendants’ contention, Plaintiffs are not required to suffer \n“imminent, life threatening circumstances” in order to allege deliberate indifference.  See, e.g., \nHarrison v. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2000) (denying qualified immunity for prison \ndoctor who refused to treat cavity in one tooth unless inmate consented to extraction of another \ninfected  tooth,  which  was  also  diseased  but  which  he  wished  to  keep)  (characterizing  the \ndoctor’s refusal of treatment as more than mere medical malpractice because he had “refuse[d] \ntreatment of a properly diagnosed condition that was progressively degenerative, potentially \ndangerous and painful, and that could be treated easily and without risk”).  Merely “opting for an \neasier and less efficacious treatment of the inmate’s condition” by adopting a monitoring policy \ninstead of treatment and waiting to see just how much the inmate’s health may deteriorate is not \npermissible.    See,  e.g.,  Abu-Jamal,  2017  WL  34700,  at  *14  (rejecting  prison’s  HCV \nfibrosis/cirrhosis monitoring and prioritization policy and stating that defendants “may not, with \ndeliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of the inmate, opt for an easier and less \nefficacious treatment of the inmate’s condition”) (quoting Monmouth Cty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. \nLanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)); see also Smith v. Jenkins, 919 F.2d 90, 93 (8th Cir. \n1990) (quoting same). \n  Next, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims must fail because \nDefendants do monitor and “treat” inmates with HCV, as well as provide “clinical care.”  [Doc. \n104, p. 13 of 19].  However, as discussed above, Plaintiffs’ Complaint plausibly alleges that the \nmedical care they have received is inadequate: what Defendants have categorized as “medical \ncare” is limited to a policy of monitoring through blood draws every six months in order to track \n16 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 16 of 33\n\nPlaintiffs’ APRI scores, as well as the provision of “minimal counseling” and classification of \nPlaintiffs as “Chronic Care Clinic Offenders.”  Any additional medical treatment alleged in the \nComplaint is limited to Defendants having prescribed two medications for Plaintiff Postawko’s \nsevere headaches, not his HCV.  The previous medical treatment pointed to by Defendants is \nakin to “mere proof of medical care,” which is not enough to disprove deliberate indifference.  \nSee Smith v. Jenkins, 919 F.2d 90, 93 (8th Cir. 1990).  Because Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged \nthat the medical care they receive falls well below the applicable standard of care without any \nmedical  justification,  they  are  “entitled  to  prove  their  case  by  establishing  [the]  course  of \ntreatment, or lack thereof, so deviated from professional standards that it amounted to deliberate \nindifference.”  Id. \n  Furthermore, at least one district court has already considered and rejected as inadequate \na similar monitoring policy for inmates with chronic HCV, but in the context of an inmate \nplaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.  Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, 2017 WL 34700, at *16 \n(M.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2017).  In Abu-Jamal, a district court in the Third Circuit granted the plaintiff \ninmate’s motion for preliminary injunction to require the prison defendants to immediately treat \nhis HCV with DAA drugs.  Id. at *20.  Similar to the case before this Court, the Abu-Jamal \nprison defendants followed a policy of barring from consideration for DAA treatment those \ninmates  with  chronic  HCV  who  did  not  have  severe  fibrosis  or  cirrhosis.    Id.  at  *15.  \nSpecifically, if an HCV positive inmate was considered for treatment, the prison would order \nshear wave elastography to determine the inmate’s fibrosis progression.  Id.  If the test indicated \na fibrosis level of F0, F1, or F2, the policy required the inmate to receive monitoring but did not \npermit treatment with DAAs.  Id. Accordingly, inmates with mild or moderate fibrosis had no \n17 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 17 of 33\n\nchance of receiving DAA drugs until their HCV had worsened, which effectively meant that \ntheir HCV had to worsen before they would even be considered for treatment.  Id.    \n  The Abu-Jamal court found the plaintiff inmate had a reasonable likelihood for success \non the merits as to his Eighth Amendment claim.  Id. at *18.  In analyzing the deliberate \nindifference prong, the district court characterized the prison’s policy as suffering from a “fatal \nflaw”: “refus[ing] without medical justification to provide treatment for certain inmates with \nhepatitis C and also impos[ing] an unreasonable condition—having vast fibrosis or cirrhosis—on \ntreatment.”  Id.  The district court further reasoned that this case was not a mere disagreement \nwith the course of care, nor was it an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care.  Id.  \nInstead, the court concluded that the plaintiff “has shown that the DOC has implemented a policy \nthat categorically denies certain inmates with chronic hepatitis C from receiving the curative \ntreatment that the DOC’s own expert testified he would recommend for a non-prisoner with the \nsame condition.”  Id.  The court went on to conclude that the plaintiff had shown that the \ndefendants deliberately denied providing treatment to inmates with a serious medical condition \nand choosing a course of monitoring instead “with the knowledge that (1) the standard of care is \nto administer DAA medications regardless of the disease’s stage, (2) inmates would likely suffer \nfrom hepatitis C complications and disease progress without treatment, and (3) the delay in \nreceiving DAA medications reduces their efficacy.”  Id.  \n  Like  in  Abu-Jamal,  the  Plaintiffs  in  this  case  have  alleged  facts  indicating  that \nDefendants refuse to treat the vast majority of inmates suffering from chronic HCV and that they \nhave  imposed  an  unreasonable  condition  on  qualification  for  treatment:  advanced \nfibrosis/cirrhosis sufficient to indicate an APRI score of over 2.0 for several months.  Despite an \neffective and near-certain cure in the form of DAA drugs, Defendants follow a prioritization and \n18 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 18 of 33\n\nmonitoring policy, which prolongs the suffering of those diagnosed with chronic HCV and \nallows the progression of the disease to accelerate.  As in Abu-Jamal, such a policy is enough to \nshow deliberate indifference, particularly at the current pleading stage. \n  Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim because they fail to “allege that \nno  other  course  of  treatment  for  HCV  would  meet  the  minimal  standards  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment” and thus, “they have not alleged a ‘serious medical need’ for  DAA drugs in \nparticular.”  [Doc. 104, p. 11 of 19].  Although it is true that inmates “have no constitutional \nright to receive a particular course of treatment” so long as they receive adequate treatment, \nDefendants’  characterization  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  as  being  a  mere  disagreement  over  their \nparticular course of treatment fails to take into account Plaintiffs’ allegations.  [Doc. 127, p. 2, \nciting Dulaney v. Carnahan, 132 F.3d 1234, 1239 (8th Cir. 1997)]; see also, Warren v. Fanning, \n950 F.2d 1370, 1373 (8th Cir. 1991) (“[A] mere disagreement with the course of the inmate’s \nmedical treatment does not constitute an eighth amendment claim of deliberate indifference.”).   \n  As already discussed, Plaintiffs allege that they are not receiving any “course of medical \ntreatment” for their HCV, except for monitoring through blood draws and minimal counseling.  \nPlaintiffs do not allege a mere dispute about which HCV medication they receive, but instead, \nthey allege that they do not receive any HCV medication.  Nor, for example, do Plaintiffs allege \na mere disagreement with a physician’s decision to not provide a particular treatment for an \nindividual  inmate  due  to  contraindications  particular  to  that  inmate.    Cf.  Holloway  v. \nCorrectional  Med.  Svcs.,  2010  WL  908491,  at  *6-7  (E.D.  Mo.  Mar.  9,  2010)  (finding  no \ndeliberate indifference where prison doctor’s decision to deny HCV-positive inmate interferon \ntreatment until he completed a drug treatment program was consistent with NIH and FBOP \nguidelines at the time and represented mere disagreement with the course of his treatment).  \n19 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 19 of 33\n\nInstead, as discussed at length above, the import of Plaintiffs’ Complaint is that Defendants do \nnot have a medical reason for deviating from the applicable standard of care, which calls for \ntreating them with DAA drugs. \n  Moreover, whether the medical “care” Plaintiffs receive is constitutionally adequate is a \nmerits issue and accordingly, a determination more appropriate for summary judgment or trial, \nnot a motion to dismiss.  For this reason, too, the cases cited by Defendants are not persuasive \nbecause they each involve a court’s decision as to the merits of the plaintiff inmate’s Eighth \nAmendment claims on summary judgment.  See, e.g., Long v. Nix, 86 F.3d 761 (8th Cir. 1996) \n(appeal on summary judgment); Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495 (11th Cir. 1991) (same).       \n  The Court also rejects Defendants’ separate contention that the Eighth Circuit and other \nfederal courts “routinely dismiss[] claims by prisoners demanding a specific course of drug \ntreatment for HCV, as well as similar infections.”  [Doc. 104, p. 12 of 19].  The cases cited by \nDefendants are distinguishable because at the time they were decided, there was no effective, \nsafe treatment  for HCV,  and DAA drugs were not  yet  available.   According to  Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint, until the recent advent and approval of DAA drugs, there was no effective and safe \ntreatment for HCV.  Historically, treatment generally included the use of interferon and ribavirin \nmedications, which  failed to  cure most patients and were contraindicated for patients  with \npsychiatric  and  autoimmune  disorders.    Therefore,  Defendants’  remaining  cases  are \ndistinguishable  because  they  were  decided  prior  to  the  approval  of  DAA  drugs  for  HCV \ntreatment when the only HCV treatments available were far less effective, as well as when the \nmedical standard of care was different from the one applicable today.  See generally Bender v. \nRegier,  385  F.3d  1133  (8th  Cir.  2004)  (ruling  only  as  to  qualified  immunity,  describing \ntreatments available in 2004 and intervening changes to the state department of health protocol, \n20 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 20 of 33\n\ncommenting that individual HCV-positive inmate was not eligible for treatment because of other \nfactors, and declining to address the district court’s holding that inmate had “serious medical \nneed for prompt interferon treatment”); Black v.

App’x 794 (11th \nCir. 2014) (per curiam) (affirming summary judgment for prison officials in pro se case where it \nwas undisputed that inmate had “not suffer[ed] any negative health consequences from not being \nin the Hepatitis C Treatment Program”); Free v. Unknown Officers of the Bureau of Prisons, 103 \nF. App’x 334 (10th Cir. 2004) (long before DAA drugs were available, holding that pro se \nprisoner had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies but alternatively affirming, in dictum, \nthat  prison  officials  had  followed  recommendations  from  National  Institutes  of  Health); \nEdmonds v. Robbins, 67 F. App’x 872 (6th Cir. 2003) (unpublished) (holding that prison official \nwas not liable under Eighth Amendment where pro se HCV-positive inmate was examined \nmonthly, sent to hospital for outside testing, and the outside medical doctors and submitted \nmedical literature all agreed that medication was not necessary); Hollis v. Dep’t of Corrs., 560 F. \nSupp. 2d 920 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (holding in individual case where no symptoms were present that \npro se HCV-positive inmate was not entitled to interferon/ribavirin in part because “therapy is \nnot universally effective”); Dotson v. Wilkinson, 477 F. Supp. 2d 838 (N.D. Ohio 2007) (holding \nin an individual case that pro se HCV-positive inmate was not entitled to interferon/ribavirin \nbecause he had high blood pressure and elevated creatinine levels that rendered him ineligible for \ntreatment under medical protocols).  \n  Finally, the Court also rejects Defendants’ separate argument that Plaintiffs fail to state a \nclaim because they “do not allege the MDOC Defendants are personally responsible for treating \nthem or for managing their HCV” and thus, “fail to state any plausible claim of individual \nindifference to their HCV.”  [Doc. 104, p. 11 of 19].  “Where a prisoner needs medical treatment \n21 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 21 of 33\n\nprison officials are under a constitutional duty to see that it is furnished.”  Crooks v. Nix, 872 \nF.2d 800, 804 (8th Cir. 1989) (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (2006)).  In their \nComplaint, Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants who have moved to dismiss—the MDOC and \nMDOC  Director  Precythe—implemented,  authorized,  or  condoned  the  treatment  policies \ndescribed previously, which plausibly makes them liable despite the fact that these Defendants \ndid not personally treat or manage Plaintiffs’ HCV.  See id. (“[A] § 1983 claimant may maintain \na theory of direct liability against a prison or other official if that official fails to properly train, \nsupervise, direct or control the actions of a subordinate who causes the injury.”).  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint “sufficiently allege[s] inadequate prison policies or medical supervision \nwhich, if true, would result in these defendants being held liable just as if they had refused to \ndeliver those services themselves.”  Id.   \nFor  the  previous  reasons,  Defendants’  motion  to  dismiss  is  denied  with  respect  to \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, Counts I, III, V, and VII. \n    B.    Eighth Amendment Claims against Precythe: Counts III, V, and VII \n  In  Counts  III,  V,  and  VII,  Plaintiffs  bring  claims  for  damages  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment  against  Defendant  MDOC  Director  Anne  Precythe  in  her  official  capacity.  \nHowever, the Eleventh Amendment bars claims against the State of Missouri and its agencies in \nfederal courts.  Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 337 (1979); Murphy v. State of Arkansas, 127 \nF.3d 750, 754 (8th Cir. 1997).  Claims alleged against state officials in their official capacity are \nanalyzed  as  claims  against  the  state.    Kentucky  v.  Graham,  473  U.S.  159,  169  (1985).  \n  Defendants argue that because these claims for damages are brought against Director \nPrecythe in her official capacity, they are claims against the state and are therefore barred.  \nPlaintiffs concede that the Eleventh Amendment bars these claims and abandon them against \n22 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 22 of 33\n\nPrecythe, only, without prejudice to later filing such claims against Precythe in her individual \ncapacity.  Therefore, the Court dismisses with prejudice Counts III, V, and VII, only as against \nDirector Precythe in her official capacity. \n  C.  Eighth Amendment Claim against Hardy: Count V \n  Plaintiff Baker’s Count V asserts a claim for damages under the Eighth Amendment \nagainst several defendants, including MDOC Defendant Adrienne Hardy.  Defendants contend \nthat this claim must be dismissed against Hardy because she is entitled to qualified immunity.  \n  “To overcome the defense of qualified immunity, a plaintiff must show: (1) the facts, \nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, demonstrate the deprivation of a constitutional \nor statutory right; and (2) the right was clearly established at the time of the deprivation.”  \nHoward v. Kansas City Police Dep’t, 570 F.3d 984, 988 (8th Cir. 2009).  The Court may \nexercise its “sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity \nanalysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.” \nMcRaven v. Sanders, 577 F.3d 974, 980 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. \n223, 235 (2009)).   \n  In support of his claim against Hardy, Baker alleges the following facts, which must be \nconstrued in his favor.  Defendant Hardy is a registered nurse working as a medical contract \nmonitor at Jefferson City Correctional Center.  Hardy knew that Baker suffered from chronic \nHCV, that he was not receiving HCV treatment, and that he required treatment with a DAA drug.  \nHardy did not intervene, provide care, or direct that care be given to Baker.  Instead, Hardy \ndenied Baker’s grievance to her for DAA treatment for his chronic HCV on the grounds that he \nwas being seen by a doctor and was enrolled in the Chronic Care Clinic.   \n23 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 23 of 33\n\nDefendants argue that Hardy is entitled to qualified immunity because she reasonably \nrelied on Baker’s treating physician’s opinion, and “[a] prison official may rely on a medical \nprofessional's opinion if such reliance is reasonable.”   McRaven v. Sanders, 577 F.3d 974, 981 \n(8th Cir. 2009) (citing Meloy v. Bachmeier 302 F.3d 845, 849 (8th Cir. 2002) (“The law does not \nclearly require an administrator with less medical training to second-guess or disregard a treating \nphysician's treatment decision.”); see also Johnson v. Doughty, 433 F.3d 1001, 1010 (7th Cir. \n2006) (“Except in the unusual case where it would be evident to a layperson that a prisoner is \nreceiving inadequate or inappropriate treatment, prison officials may reasonably rely on the \njudgment of medical professionals.”)).   \n The Eighth Circuit addressed a similar situation in Meloy v. Bachmeier, 302 F.3d 845 \n(8th Cir. 2002).  In Meloy, an inmate brought an Eighth Amendment claim against Bachmeier, a \nnurse who worked as the prison’s director of medical services.  Id. at 847.  The inmate alleged \nthat despite his request for treatment for his obstructive sleep apnea, treatment which Bachmeier \nknew he was not receiving, Bachmeier denied his request because she relied on his treating \ndoctor’s orders that the requested treatment was unnecessary.  Id.  \nThe Eighth Circuit reversed the district court’s denial of qualified immunity, holding that \nBachmeier’s reliance on the treating doctor’s order was objectively reasonable.  Id. at 849.  The \nEighth Circuit concluded that although Bachmeier had training as a nurse, she was functioning in \nan administrative role and was not personally responsible for examining and treating the inmate.  \nId.  Although the inmate told Bachmeier about his condition and need for the specific treatment, \nBachmeier relied on the opinion of his treating physicians, who had more medical training about \nthe necessary treatment for the inmate’s condition.  Id.  The Eighth Circuit reasoned that this \nmeant Bachmeier was not personally involved in an Eighth Amendment violation.  Id.  As to her \n24 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 24 of 33\n\nliability as a supervisor, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the law “does not clearly require an \nadministrator with less medical training to second-guess or disregard a treating physician’s \ntreatment decision.”  Id.  \n  In the same way, Defendant Hardy is a nurse by training but is alleged to have been \nfunctioning in an administrative role as a medical contract monitor.  Baker does not allege that \nHardy personally treated him for his chronic HCV or that she was responsible for treating him.4  \nRather, the Complaint alleges that in failing to intervene as well as denying Baker’s grievance \nfor DAA treatment, Hardy knew Baker was enrolled in the Chronic Care Clinic, and that she \ndeferred to the orders of Baker’s doctors.  As in Meloy, “the law does not clearly require an \nadministrator [like Hardy] with less medical training to second-guess or disregard a treating \nphysician’s treatment  decision.”   Meloy, 302  F.3d at  849.   Therefore,  Hardy is  entitled to \nqualified immunity.      \n  Although Plaintiffs cite McRaven v. Sanders, 577 F.3d 974 (8th Cir. 2009), in support of \ntheir contention that Hardy’s deference to Baker’s treating physicians does not excuse her from \nliability, McRaven does not support Plaintiffs’ position.  In McRaven, defendant jail officials \nwho denied treatment to an inmate claimed that they were entitled to qualified immunity because \nthey  had  relied  on  a  nurse’s  assessment  in  denying  the  inmate  treatment.    Id.  at  980-82.  \nAlthough the jail officials deferred to the nurse’s medical assessment, the jail officials were \naware of  a cocktail of  potent drugs that  the inmate had consumed;  that  the circumstances \nstrongly suggested the inmate did not consume them in prescribed dosages; that the inmate \n                                                           \n4 Plaintiffs note, “Defendants assert that Hardy was not responsible for treating Plaintiff Baker, \n[but] . . . [t]his fact is outside the pleadings, and therefore should not be considered by the Court \nin ruling on the pending motion.”  [Doc. 123, p. 15 of 24].  Although Plaintiffs’ argument is \ntechnically correct, Plaintiffs do not allege that Hardy was responsible for personally treating \nBaker anywhere in their Complaint, and therefore, this fact was not pled, which the Court can \ntake into account in ruling on the pending motion. \n25 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 25 of 33\n\nexhibited symptoms of extreme intoxication; and that the nurse based her assessment of the \ninmate on the assumption that he was under the influence of alcohol, not drugs.  Id.  The Eighth \nCircuit held that because the jail officials had such relevant personal  knowledge about the \ninmate’s  condition,  knowledge  which  they  knew  the  nurse  did  not  have,  the  jail  officials’ \nreliance on the nurse’s assessment was not objectively reasonable, and thus, they were not \nentitled to qualified immunity.  Id.     \n   Unlike in McRaven, Baker’s Complaint does not allege that Hardy had any personal \nknowledge  superior  to  or  different  from  the  knowledge  of  Baker’s  treating  doctors  or  the \nprofessionals seeing Baker in the Chronic Care Clinic.  Therefore, the fact that Hardy is alleged \nto have denied Baker’s grievance in reliance on the opinion of Baker’s doctors was objectively \nreasonable and not a clearly established violation of Baker’s constitutional rights.  Accordingly, \nCount V is dismissed with respect to Defendant Hardy because she is entitled to qualified \nimmunity.5   \n  D.  ADA Claims: Counts II, IV, VI, and VIII \n  Defendants argue that Counts II, IV, VI, and VIII should be dismissed for failure to state \na claim because medical treatment decisions cannot be challenged under the ADA.  In addition, \nthey contend that Counts IV, VI, and VIII are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. \n  1.  Medical Treatment Decisions under the ADA \n  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant MDOC discriminates against inmates with chronic HCV \nin violation of the ADA by withholding medically appropriate treatment that will likely cure \ntheir disability while, at the same time, Defendant does not withhold lifesaving treatments from \nindividuals with disabilities other than chronic HCV.  [Doc. 30, p. 27, ¶ 143].  Under Title II of \n                                                           \n5 Count V is the only claim asserted against Defendant Adrienne Hardy. \n26 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 26 of 33\n\nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., a qualified individual with a disability may not be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied benefits of services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \nor be subjected to discrimination by that entity, because of the individual's disability.  A qualified \nindividual with a disability is a person who “meets the essential eligibility requirements for the \nreceipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by the public entity.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(2).   \n  To prevail on a Title II ADA claim, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that he is a person with \na disability as defined by statute; (2) that he is otherwise qualified for the benefit in question; and \n(3)  that  he  was  excluded  from  the  benefit  because  of  discrimination  based  upon  his \ndisability.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; Randolph v. Rodgers, 170 F.3d 850, 857 (8th Cir. \n1999).  Defendants focus solely on the third factor and argue that within the Eighth Circuit, \nclaims under the ADA “cannot be based on medical treatment decisions,” which Defendants \ncontend is all that Plaintiffs’ claims allege.  Burger v. Bloomberg, 418 F.3d 882, 883 (8th Cir. \n2006).  In McElroy v. Patient Selection Committee, 2007 WL 4180695, at *2 (D. Neb. Nov. 21, \n2007), aff'd per curiam, 2009 WL 50176 (8th Cir. Jan. 9, 2009), the district court cited this \nprinciple in granting summary judgment for defendants on the inmate plaintiff’s ADA claim.  \nThe court found that the evidence undisputedly showed that the inmate, who had a history of \nmental illness, was denied a kidney transplant for a legitimate medical reason: his mental illness \nwas a contraindication for transplants. Id. \nPlaintiffs concede that medical treatment decisions cannot be challenged under the ADA, \nbut  they  argue  that  they  are  not  challenging  mere  inadequate  medical  treatment  decisions.  \nRather, Plaintiffs contend that they challenge Defendant MDOC’s policy or custom of denying \nDAA  drug  treatment  to  most  inmates  suffering  chronic  HCV,  which  effectively  prohibits \n27 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 27 of 33\n\nmedical professionals from making independent medical decisions about whether to provide \nsuch treatment.  Plaintiffs argue that this policy or custom discriminates against them by denying \nthem lifesaving treatments for HCV where Defendant MDOC does provide lifesaving treatments \nto inmates with disabilities other than HCV.  Cf. Bryant v. Madigan, 84 F.3d 246, 249 (7th Cir. \n1996) (finding inmate failed to state an ADA claim where inmate alleged prison  failed to \nadequately attend to his medical needs but where inmate did not allege discrimination or that he \nwas treated worse “because of” his disability); Moore v. Kohl, 2005 WL 2002084, at *2-3 \n(dismissing inmate’s ADA claims against two doctors and their assistant because his claims \nrelated  only  to  the  refusal  of  those  defendants  to  exercise  their  professional  judgment  in \naccordance with the plaintiff’s views of his medical needs). \nThe  Court  agrees.    Claims  of  inadequate  medical  treatment  for  a  disability  are \ndistinguishable from claims that a prisoner was denied access to medical services because of his \ndisability.  Although not directly on point, McNally v. Prison Health Services, 46 F. Supp. 2d 49 \n(D. Me. 1999), illustrates this distinction.  In McNally, an HIV-positive individual was arrested \nand held in jail.  Id. at 51.  He alleged that he informed jail personnel that he needed his HIV \nmedication, but they denied his access to it.  Id.  McNally brought an ADA claim alleging that \nthe jail’s policy regarding providing prescribed medications to inmates was different for inmates \nwith HIV.  Id. at 58-59.  The jail argued that this claim failed as a matter of law because it \nalleged only that the inmate received poor medical treatment, which could not be challenged \nunder the ADA.  Id. at 58.  However, the district court rejected this argument, noting, “Plaintiff \nhas contended that Cumberland County Jail discriminated against Plaintiff because of his HIV-\npositive status, not by providing him with inadequate care, but by denying him immediate access \nto prescribed medications, a service provided to detainees in need of prescriptions for other \n28 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 28 of 33\n\nillnesses.”  Id.  The court continued by noting that the record before it showed that the jail had \none policy for detainees taking HIV medication and one for detainees on medication for maladies \nother than HIV.  Id. at 58-59.   \nSimilarly,  Plaintiffs  in  this  case  allege  that  they  are  denied  access  to  lifesaving \nmedications,  a  service  provided  to  inmates  with  other  illnesses.   Construing  the  Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint in the light most favorable to them, Plaintiffs do not merely allege inadequate medical \ntreatment, but instead, they allege that Defendant MDOC follows one policy for inmates with \nchronic HCV and another policy for inmates with other disabilities under which they do receive \nlifesaving medications.  Defendant MDOC contends that McNally is distinguishable because \nPlaintiffs challenge the “treatment protocols themselves” and “are not challenging discriminatory \naccess to a prison service that provides them with already prescribed medication as in McNally.”  \n[Doc. 127, p. 10 (emphasis in original)].  The Court is not persuaded that the medications having \nalready  been  prescribed  in  McNally  makes  McNally  less  applicable  to  the  facts  at  hand.  \nFurthermore,  by  virtue  of  challenging  the  “treatment  protocols  themselves,”  as  Defendant \nMDOC contends, Plaintiffs do challenge discriminatory access to the prison’s services because \nthey allege a policy under which they are not provided access to lifesaving medications for their \ndisability while inmates with other disabilities do have access to lifesaving medications.    \nTherefore, at least, at the present motion to dismiss stage, Plaintiffs’ Complaint plausibly \nalleges claims under the ADA.  See also, e.g., Rogers v. Mo. Dep’t of Corrections, 2011 WL \n13051907 (W.D. Mo. Aug. 2, 2011) (rejecting prison’s argument that disabled inmate’s ADA \nclaims for prison’s refusal to provide him with an electric wheelchair “must be dismissed to the \nextent that they are based on a medical treatment decision” because the Complaint alleged a \npolicy decision by the prison, not a medical treatment decision, and it would be improper for the \n29 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 29 of 33\n\ncourt to assume that fact); Madden v. Mo. Dep’t of Corrs., 2011 WL 3101926, at *2 (W.D. Mo. \nJuly  25,  2011)  (denying  motion  to  dismiss  ADA  claim  in  part  because  the  record  lacked \nallegations that the defendants’ decision to deny inmate the use of an electric wheelchair was a \nmedical treatment decision). \nAuthorities cited by Defendants are distinguishable from the facts before this Court.  \nDefendants’  authorities  involve  situations  where  individual  plaintiffs  simply  disagreed  with \nmedical  treatment  decisions  and  did  not  challenge  a  prison’s  general  policy  or  custom,  as \nPlaintiffs do here.  See, e.g., Dinkins v. Mo. Dep’t of Corrs., 743 F.3d 633, 634 (8th Cir. 2014) \n(affirming dismissal of inmate’s ADA claims where inmate did not challenge a general policy \nbut rather challenged individual medical treatment decisions, including not properly diagnosing \nand treating his pernicious anemia).   \nOther cases cited by Defendants are also distinguishable because they were not decided at \nthe motion to dismiss stage, and in contrast to the present case, the courts in Defendants’ cases \nwere presented with actual evidence as to whether the plaintiffs were discriminated against \n“because of” their alleged disabilities.  In each of these cases, the defendants had an opportunity \nto present evidence contrary to the allegations made by the plaintiffs, which in turn, empowered \nthe court to consider the record as a whole and whether a question remained for the jury.  \nHowever, at the current stage of the litigation, this Court is bound by the allegations in Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint  and  does  not  yet  have  any  contrary  evidence  to  consider  that  would  contradict \nPlaintiffs’ allegations.  Cf., Simmons v. Navajo Cty., Ariz., 609 F.3d 1011, 1021-22 (9th Cir. \n2010) (affirming district court’s granting of summary judgment for prison where there was no \nevidence that inmate’s exclusion from outdoor recreation was “because of” his depression, as an \nalleged disability, and therefore, his exclusion did not support ADA claim); Jordan v. Delaware, \n30 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 30 of 33\n\n433  F.  Supp.  2d  433,  438-443  (D.  Del.  2006)  (granting  summary  judgment  for  prison  on \ninmate’s ADA claim for denial of a liver biopsy where evidence did not show that inmate was \ntreated differently “because of” his HCV status and where evidence showed the prison followed \nscreening and treatment guidelines developed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the NIH); \nIseley v. Beard, 200 F. App’x 137, at *4 (3rd Cir. 2006) (affirming district court’s granting of \nsummary judgment for pro se prison on inmate’s ADA claim where inmate “claim[ed] that he \nwas denied medical treatment for his disabilities, which is not encompassed by the ADA’s \nprohibitions” and where he did not argue that he was excluded from any program “because of” \nhis disability).   \n2.  Sovereign Immunity under the Eleventh Amendment \n Defendant MDOC contends that Plaintiffs Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson’s individual \nADA claims against it for monetary damages in Counts IV, VI, and VIII must additionally be \ndismissed because these claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.6  Plaintiffs contend that \nwith respect to their ADA claims for damages against MDOC, Congress has validly abrogated \nMissouri’s Eleventh Amendment immunity. \nGenerally, sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment applies to bar damage \nsuits against the State and its agencies unless Congress abrogates sovereign immunity through its \nability to enforce the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.  United States v. \nGeorgia, 546 U.S. 151, 158 (2006).  The Supreme Court has held that Title II of the ADA \nvalidly abrogates sovereign immunity for conduct that is in itself unconstitutional.  Klingler v. \nDirector, Dep’t of Revenue, 455 F.3d 888, 93 (8th Cir. 2006) (citing United States v. Georgia, \n                                                           \n6 Plaintiffs first respond that they also seek prospective relief in these counts and that there is no \nbasis for dismissing their claims insofar as they seek prospective relief.  However, Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint states only that it is a “Claim for Damages,” not prospective relief.  See [Doc. 30, p. \n29, 31, and 33].   \n31 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 31 of 33\n\n546 U.S. 151, 158 (2006)).  Therefore, “insofar as Title II [of the ADA] creates a private cause \nof  action  for  damages  against  the  States  for  conduct  that  actually  violates  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity.”  Id. \nUnder the framework set  out  by the Supreme Court  in  Georgia, whether sovereign \nimmunity bars claims under Title II of the ADA is addressed on a “claim-by-claim basis” and \nrequires an assessment of “(1) which aspects of the State’s alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) \nto what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such \nmisconduct violated Title II, but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress’s \npurported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.”  Id. \nat 892 (citing Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159).   \nFirst,  the  Court  considers  which  aspects  of  the  State  of  Missouri’s  alleged  conduct \nviolated Title II and to what extent this misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nThe Fourteenth Amendment commands that “all persons similarly situated should be treated \nalike.”  Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (internal citations omitted).  As to their ADA \nclaims, Plaintiffs allege that they have been treated differently than inmates who do not have \nHCV.  Specifically, by denying Plaintiffs the opportunity to access medical services on an equal \nbasis as persons who are not diagnosed with HCV, the State of Missouri denies them equal \nprotection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.   \nIn addition, and as already addressed, Plaintiffs plausibly allege deliberate indifference to \ntheir serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment, which is incorporated by the \nFourteenth Amendment.  See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 157 (holding that plaintiff’s claims for money \ndamages  against  the  State  under  Title  II  of  the  ADA  were  largely  based  on  conduct  that \nindependently violated the Eighth Amendment).  Therefore, as in Georgia, Defendant MDOC’s \n32 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 155   Filed 05/11/17   Page 32 of 33\n\nalleged violations of Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment rights also state a claim for violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment, actionable through Title II of the ADA.  Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159 \n(“[I]nsofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for damages against the States for conduct \nthat actually violates the Fourteenth  Amendment,  Title  II validly  abrogates state sovereign \nimmunity.”).  Because Plaintiffs have alleged Title II claims that are based on actual violations \nof the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress validly authorized their ADA claims for damages using \nits power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.    \nIII.   Conclusion \n  For the previous reasons, Defendants MDOC, Adrienne Hardy, and Anne Precythe’s \nmotion to dismiss, Doc. 103, is granted in part and denied in part.  The motion is granted as to \nDefendant Precythe in her official capacity in Counts III, V, and VII; these claims are dismissed \nagainst Defendant Precythe in her official capacity with prejudice.  The motion is also granted as \nto Defendant Hardy, only, in Count V.  Dismissal is denied for the remainder of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims. \n \n \n              /s/ Nanette K.

Plaintiffs claim that they \nand all other inmates infected with HCV are entitled, under the Eighth Amendment and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), to receive a novel course of drugs as treatment. \nHowever, Plaintiffs’ claims against MDOC, MDOC Director Anne L. Precythe, and MDOC \nemployee Adrienne Hardy (collectively the “MDOC Defendants”) should be dismissed for the \nfollowing reasons: \n1.  Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the Eighth Amendment against the \nMDOC Defendants because Plaintiffs have no constitutional right to obtain the particular course \nof treatment they demand. \n2.  Plaintiffs’  Eighth  Amendment  claims  for  damages  against  MDOC  Director \nPrecythe are not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. \n3.  Plaintiff Baker fails to state a claim against Defendant Hardy for violation of the \nEighth Amendment, and any such claim is barred by qualified immunity. \n \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04219-NKL   Document 103   Filed 02/21/17   Page 1 of 3\n\n4.  Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the ADA because an ADA claim cannot be \nbased on medical treatment decisions. \n5.  Plaintiffs’ ADA claims alleged against MDOC in Counts IV, VI, and VIII are \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment. \n6.  Pursuant  to  Local  Rule  7.0(a),  the  MDOC  Defendants  have  filed  herewith \nsuggestions in support of this motion, setting forth the authorities and arguments relied upon. \nWHEREFORE,  for  all  the  foregoing  reasons  and  for  the  reasons  set  forth  in  the \nsuggestions filed herewith, the MDOC Defendants respectfully request the Court to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claims against them, and grant the MDOC Defendants any such other and further \nrelief the Court deems fair and appropriate.  \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJOSHUA D.
