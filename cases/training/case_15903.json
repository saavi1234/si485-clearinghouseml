    "summary": "<p>On March 26, 2013, several Muslim prisoners of the Lakeland Correctional Facility (LCF) filed this lawsuit pro se in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the Deputy Director of the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC), the dietician and food service manager of the prison, and the Special Activity Coordinator of MDOC, all under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages and attorneysโ fees and costs. The case was assigned to District Judge Gordon J. Quist and Magistrate Judge Hugh W. Brenneman, Jr.</p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that MDOC violated their First and Eighth Amendment rights by failing to provide adequate nourishment to accommodate the plaintiffsโ fasting period during the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan seasons. Thus, the plaintiffs claimed, MDOC burdened the plaintiffsโ exercise of religion and inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. They also alleged that MDOC did not treat a Jewish inmate in the same way during his fasting period.</p><p>On June 14, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking that the court require the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with adequate meals during the 2013 Ramadan period. On July 8, 2013, Judge Quist denied this motion because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. The court pointed to the MDOC dietitian's testimony which stated that, at most, the Ramadan meals to be provided would be 250 calories under the required amount for prisoners in a day. In a subsequent order of clarification, the court said that the reason plaintiffs did not show irreparable harm was only because of the dietitian's testimony. Despite reaffirming the denial of the plaintiffsโ motion, the order of clarification required MDOC to provide a minimum of 2,350 calories per day during the 2013 Ramadan period. </p><p>On July 31, 2013, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies before bringing this lawsuit. The plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and the court stayed discovery pending resolution of the motions. </p><p>On July 31, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt on the ground that the actual 2013 Ramadan meals provided approximately 600 fewer calories than the defendants had represented in their answer to the complaint. On April 29, 2014, the court found the defendants in contempt of court, agreeing with the prisoners that the state had provided the plaintiffs with unduly limited calories during Ramadan, contrary to the defendantsโ own representations to the court and the court's order. The court ordered the defendants to pay $200 to each plaintiff.</p><p>On February 25, 2014, the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation regarding the cross-motions for summary judgment, recommending that the court grant defendantsโ motion, deny the plaintiffsโ cross-motion, and dismiss the case. His report argued that the plaintiffs failed to properly exhaust their administrative remedies and that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. 2014 WL 1347436.</p><p><i>Eighth Amendment Claims</i></p><p>On March 31, 2014, the court granted summary judgment against the prisoners, dismissing their Eighth Amendment claims. On May 12, 2014, however, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of this decision, which Judge Quist granted on August 15, 2014, reinstating the Eighth Amendment claim. The defendants appealed this reinstatement to the Sixth Circuit. In an unpublished opinion, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the courtโs order reinstating the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claims, finding that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the plaintiffsโ restricted diets during the Ramadan fasts violated a clearly established right.</p><p><i>RLUIPA Claims</i></p><p>Judge Quist partially agreed with Magistrate Judge Brennemanโs recommendation when on March 31, 2014 he dismissed the plaintiffsโ request for preliminary injunctive relief and their Eighth Amendment claims. However, he reversed the Magistrate Judgeโs other recommendations and held that the plaintiffs could proceed on their First Amendment and RLUIPA claims. He said that the claims were not barred by the statute of limitations, that the defendants had not shown that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and that MDOC was not entitled to qualified immunity because it was a genuine issue of fact whether MDOC provided the plaintiffs with sufficient nutrition in Ramadan 2011 and 2012. 2014 WL 1347432.</p><p>On May 13, 2014, the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to the plaintiffsโ 2011 and 2012 Ramadan claims. Magistrate Judge Brenneman filed a report and recommendation regarding this motion, recommending that the court dismiss all the plaintiffsโ Ramadan 2011 claims and the plaintiffsโ Ramadan 2012 claim for lack of exhaustion. 2015 WL 3936315.</p><p>On June 26, 2015, partially agreeing with Judge Brenneman, Judge Quist granted in part and denied in part the defendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment, dismissing some of the plaintiffsโ Ramadan 2011 claims but retaining one Ramadan 2011 claim and all Ramadan 2012 claims. 2015 WL 3936395. On July 9, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of this order. Judge Quist granted this motion and reinstated the 2011 Ramadan claims because the plaintiff showed that his exhausted grievance for Ramadan 2010 properly exhausted his Ramadan 2011 claim. </p><p><i>The Second Preliminary Injunction</i></p><p>On May 28, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a second motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs asked the court to order the defendants to provide 2,900 calories per day during the 2014 Ramadan period. Citing the defendantsโ failure to comply with the courtโs order of clarification for the 2013 Ramadan period, the plaintiffs also requested that the court appoint a monitor to ensure that the defendants comply with their legal obligation to provide the plaintiffs adequate nutrition during the 2014 Ramadan period. On June 27, 2014, the Court agreed with the defendants' position that providing prisoners participating in the Ramadan fast an average of 2,350 calories per day over a two-week period, rather than providing at least 2,350 calories every day, was consistent with sound nutritional practices and would not adversely affect prisonersโ health. Judge Quist ordered the defendants to provide the court a copy of the 2014 Ramadan menu and, on a weekly basis, a sworn statement from a representative at LCF confirming that the plaintiffs were served the food items listed on the 2014 Ramadan menu. 2014 WL 2920479.</p><p>On June 20, 2014, the United States filed a statement of interest. The United States expressed interest in whether Michigan prison officials were substantially burdening the exercise of religion in violation of the RLUIPA if they were found to provide inadequate nutrition to prisoners observing Ramadan. If the officials were inflicting a substantial burden, the United States was interested in what remedies were needed to ensure that Michigan officials comply with RLUIPA. </p><p>On September 2, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a second motion for contempt, this time for the defendantsโ failure to provide the plaintiffs an average of 2,350 calories per day over a two-week cycle during the 2014 Ramadan period. In another victory for the plaintiffs, Judge Quist granted this motion on May 4, 2015. </p><p>The court appointed a pro bono attorney from the Michigan State University Law School Civil Rights Clinic for the plaintiffs on July 2, 2015. Shortly thereafter, this case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Ray Kent from Magistrate Judge Brenneman on August 1, 2015. In November 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint adding claims for Ramadan 2013 and 2014. Those claims were substantially the same as the claims in the original complaint but also added a Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection claim based on MDOCโs differential treatment of a Jewish inmate during his fasting period and a civil conspiracy claim alleging that MDOC had conspired to provide the plaintiffs with fewer calories than required by MDOC guidelines and the courtโs previous orders because plaintiffs were Muslim. The court granted the motion on April 14, 2016, and the new claims were added to the previous ones. </p><p>On July 30, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as to the constitutional and statutory claims during the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasting, arguing that the plaintiffs were fed only 1600 calories per day. However, on August 11, 2016, the defendants filed a joint stipulation with the plaintiffs in which the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their claims for injunctive and monetary relief based on the RLUIPA.  Soon after, Judge Quist granted this proposed order, but the plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment, First Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment claims remained. Then, the defendants filed another motion for partial summary judgment on August 17, 2016. The defendants sought summary judgment in their favor on the grounds that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the law was not clearly established. </p><p>On November 4, 2016, Judge Kent filed a report and recommendation with the court regarding the plaintiffsโ July, 30, 2016 motion for summary judgment and the defendantsโ August 17, 2016 motion for partial summary judgment, recommending that the court deny all of these motions because factual uncertainties remained. Judge Kent also recommended that the court grant the defendantsโ motion as to the plaintiffsโ equal protection claim and the plaintiffsโ 2014 Ramadan claims against the prisonโs dietitian based on his lack of personal involvement; and deny the defendantsโ motion with regard to the plaintiffsโ Ramadan 2013 conspiracy claim but grant the defendants' motion with regard to the 2014 Ramadan conspiracy claim.</p><p>On February 16, 2017, Judge Quist partially agreed with Judge Kent, saying that there were still triable issues of fact that precluded summary judgment on the plaintiffs' Ramadan 2011 and 2012 claims. However, he dismissed the plaintiffsโ claims based on Ramadan 2013 and 2014 because the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. 2017 WL 631600. The parties met for a settlement conference on June 8, 2017, but they could not reach a settlement. After some rescheduling, the court set trial for October 2, 2018. </p><p>The parties went to a jury trial on October 2, 2018 and the trial lasted three days. At the conclusion of the plaintiffsโ proofs, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law and the court took the motion under advisement. The defendants again moved for judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of trial. This time, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the MDOC Deputy Director from the case, leaving the dietician as the sole defendant. </p><p>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs. The damages against the remaining defendant totaled $3,900, consisting of $150 in actual damages and $500 in punitive damages per plaintiff for each month of Ramadan included in the claims. The defendant renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law after hearing the jury verdict, but the District Court denied it. After hearing the verdict, the plaintiffs moved for a new trial as to damages for their First Amendment claim, but the Court denied their motion on November 7, 2018.</p><p>On November 27, 2018, the plaintiffs appealed the decision to deny their motion for a new trial as to damages for their First Amendment claim. The case was added to the docket of the Sixth Circuit a day later. The issue is pending on appeal. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for expenses on December 12, 2018 and as of August 9, 2020, that motion was still pending in the District Court. </p><p>The case is ongoing. </p>",

HON. GORDON J. QUIST \n              United States District Judge \n \n \nTOM FINCO, et al.,          HON. HUGH W. BRENNEMAN, JR. \n              United States Magistrate Judge     \n       \n  Defendants.       \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES  \nINTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffsโ preliminary injunction raises two crucial issues: (1) whether Michigan prison \nofficials, if found to provide inadequate nutrition to prisoners observing Ramadan,1 are \nsubstantially burdening the exercise of religion in violation of the Religious Land Use and \nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc et seq. (โRLUIPAโ); and, if so, (2) what \nremedies are needed to ensure that Michigan officials comply with RLUIPA.  The United States \nfiles this Statement of Interest to assist the Court in determining whether there has been a \nviolation of RLUIPA in the event that the Court finds that officials within the Michigan \nDepartment of Corrections (โMDOCโ) are providing inadequate nutrition to Muslim prisoners \n                                                           \n1 โRamadan is the ninth month of the Arabian lunar calendar, when practicing Muslims . . . are \nrequired to fast during daylight hours for thirty consecutive days.  This religious practice does \nnot limit food consumption between sunset and dawn.โ  Lovelace v. Bassett, 2009 WL 3157367 \nat *1 (W.D. Va. 2009).  \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #98 Filed 06/20/14  Page 2 of 9   Page ID#945\nobserving Ramadan.2  If the Court finds such a violation and issues an injunction, the United \nStates also recommends that the Court appoint an independent monitor to ensure that the \ninjunctive relief the Plaintiffs seek is properly implemented.   \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n  The United States has authority to file this Statement of Interest pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. ยง 517,3 which permits the Attorney General to attend to the interests of the United \nStates in any case pending in federal court.  The United States, acting through the Civil \nRights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, has an interest in this matter because the \nalleged unlawful practices fall within the enforcement authority of the Civil Rights Division, \nwhich enforces RLUIPA.  See, e.g., United States v. Fla. Depโt of Corr., No. 1:12-cv-22958 \n(S.D. Fla.) (8/14/12 Compl., dkt. # 1); Ali v. Thaler, No. 9:09-cv-52 (E.D. Tx.) (3/29/12 \nStatement of Interest of the United States, dkt. # 159); Prison Legal News v. Berkeley Cnty. \nSheriffโs Office, No. 2:10-02594 (D. S.C.) (04/12/11 Compl. Intervention, dkt. # 35-2); \nWillis v. Ind. Depโt of Corr., No. 1:09-cv-815 (S.D. Ind.) (1/14/11 Statement of Interest of \nthe United States, dkt. # 126).  RLUIPA, a statute unanimously passed by Congress โto \naccord religious exercise heightened protection from government-imposed burdens,โ Cutter \n                                                           \n2 The United States takes no position here regarding  the number of calories necessary to ensure \nadequate nutrition.  The United States seeks to assist the Court in determining whether the \nDefendants have violated RLIUPA if, in fact, the Court finds Defendants to be providing its \nprisoners with inadequate nutrition during Ramadan.  \n3 The full text of 28 U.S.C. Section 517 is as follows:  โThe Solicitor General, or any officer of \nthe Department of Justice, may be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the \nUnited States to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the \nUnited States, or in a court of a State, or to attend to any other interest of the United States.โ   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #98 Filed 06/20/14  Page 3 of 9   Page ID#946\nv. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 713 (2005), prohibits practices that impose a substantial burden \non the exercise of religion unless they are the least restrictive means of furthering a \ncompelling government interest. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(a).  \nBACKGROUND \n  Plaintiffs have moved the Court to issue a preliminary injunction, overseen by a monitor, \nrequiring MDOC to provide Muslim prisoners with adequate nutrition during Ramadan. (Dkt. # \n87.)  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have failed to provide them with nutritionally adequate \nmeals during Ramadan in years past and that, without action from this Court, Defendants will do \nso again.  (Id.)   \nThe uncontested facts are as follows: Last year Defendants assured this Court that they \nwould provide Plaintiffs with at least 2,350 calories each day during Ramadan.  (Dkt. # 17.)  \nBecause of concerns that Plaintiffs raised with MDOCโs proposed Ramadan menu, this Court \nordered the Defendants to provide the promised 2,350 calories each day of Ramadan 2013.  (Dkt. \n# 22.) 4  Despite both their assurances and this Courtโs order, MDOC failed to actually provide \nthe promised food.  (Dkts. # 22, 70.)   After Ramadan ended, the Court held the Defendants in \ncontempt and imposed fines for their conduct.  (Dkt. # 70.)   \n   \n                                                           \n4 Based on Defendantsโ most recent filing (dkt. # 94), it appears that the parties have conflicting \nviews about whether the Courtโs July 10, 2013 Order of Clarification binds Defendants for \nRamadan 2014. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #98 Filed 06/20/14  Page 4 of 9   Page ID#947\nDISCUSSION \n1.  Failure to Provide Adequate Nutrition to Prisoners Observing Ramadan \nSubstantially Burdens Their Religious Exercise \nThe Sixth Circuit has laid out a framework to apply when assessing whether the \ngovernment is imposing a substantial burden under RLUIPA.  In Living Water Church of God v. \nCharter Twp. of Meridian, the court noted that when deciding whether a substantial burden \nexists, a court should consider whether the government action places โsubstantial pressure on a \nreligious institution to violate its religious beliefs. . . .โ  Living Water Church of God v. Charter \nTwp. of Meridian, 258 F. Appโx 729, 737 (6th Cir. 2007); accord Evans v. Snyder, No. 2:11-cv-\n492, 2014 WL 1369301, slip op. at *3  (W.D. Mich. 2014) (โ[C]ourts have concluded that a \nburden is substantial where it forces an individual to choose between the tenets of his religion \nand foregoing governmental benefits or places โsubstantial pressure on an adherent to modify his \nbehavior and to violate his beliefsโโ (quoting Living Water, 258 F.  Appโx at 733โ34)).   \nFailure to provide a prisoner with sufficient nutrition through meals served before sunrise \nand after sunset during Ramadan imposes a substantial burden on that prisonerโs religious \nexercise by โpressur[ing a prisoner] to break the fast, in violation of Islamic tenets.โ  Couch v. \nJabe, 479 F. Supp 2d 569, 589-90 (W.D. Va. 2006).  In Couch, the court found a substantial \nburden on the free exercise of religion where Defendants failed to show that meals they provided \nto Muslim prisoners during Ramadan โwere either nutritionally or caloricallyโ adequate.  Id.  The \ncourt issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Virginia Department of Corrections to provide \nMuslim prisoners with at least 2,200 calories a day during Ramadan, an amount equivalent to the \nnumber of calories offered to non-fasting prisoners during breakfast and evening meals.  Couch \nv. Jabe, No. 7:05-cv-00642 (9/22/06 Order, dkt. # 51, at 5).  See also Heard v. Caruso, 351 F. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #98 Filed 06/20/14  Page 5 of 9   Page ID#948\nAppโx 1, 13 (6th. Cir. 2009) (โIf Heardโs religion requires adherence to a NationโofโIslam diet, \nprison officialsโ refusal to accommodate this diet would impose a substantial burden.โ (citing Alโ\nAmin v. Shear, 325 F. Appโx 190, 193โ95 (4th Cir. 2009) (unpublished) (finding that the denial \nof kosher food to a Sunni Muslim during Ramadan would be a substantial burden)); see also \nNelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 879 (7th Cir. 2009) (โWe have held that a prisonerโs religious \ndietary practice is substantially burdened when the prison forces him to choose between his \nreligious practice and adequate nutrition.โ).  If MDOC fails to provide prisoners observing \nRamadan with adequate nutrition, as defined by the Court, such failure establishes a substantial \nburden under RLUIPA. \n2.  Failure to Provide Adequate Nutrition is not the Least Restrictive Means of \nFurthering a Compelling Government Interest  \n  Once a Plaintiff has shown that the Defendant has imposed a substantial burden, the \nDefendant has the burden of showing that its action is the least restrictive means of furthering a \ncompelling government interest.  42 U.S.C.A. ยง 2000cc-2; See also Heard v. Caruso, 351 F. \nAppโx at 13.  Here, MDOC has not carried this burden, nor can it.   MDOC has failed to identify \na compelling interest implicated by its denial of sufficient calories to prisoners observing \nRamadan, let alone that depriving prisoners of calories is the least restrictive means of furthering \nthat interest.  Since MDOC has not put forth a defense, the analysis under RLUIPA stops here. \n  Even if MDOC did articulate a compelling interest, it could not demonstrate that failing \nto offer adequate nutrition is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest for two reasons.   \nFirst, MDOC has conceded that it can provide sufficient nutrition to the Plaintiffs during \nRamadan by assuring the Court it could do so last year.  (Dkt. # 17.)  Second, other prison \nsystems have shown that it is possible to put into place successful policies and procedures that \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #98 Filed 06/20/14  Page 6 of 9   Page ID#949\nensure Muslim prisoners receive timely, adequate nutrition during Ramadan.  See, e.g., Bureau \nof Prisons Policy P5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices, ยง 548.20 (Dec. 31, 2004) (โWhen \ninmates observe a public fast, i.e. one which is regulated by law or custom for all the faith \nadherents, Food Service will provide a meal nutritionally equivalent to the meal(s) missed.โ); see \nalso Garnica v. Wash. Dept. of Corrections, 965 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1269 (W.D. Wash. 2013) \n(finding prisonโs provision of an average of 2,700 calories a day to Muslim prisoners during the \nRamadan fast to be sufficient to satisfy the prisonโs obligations under RLUIPA).  For these \nreasons, it is clear that failing to adequately feed Muslim prisoners observing Ramadan is not the \nleast restrictive means to further any compelling government interest. \n3.  Failure to Provide Adequate Nutrition During Ramadan Violates RLUIPA \n  Denying adequate nutrition to prisoners fasting during Ramadan substantially burdens \nreligious exercise, and the denial is not the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling \ngovernment interest; thus, failing to provide sufficient nutrition before sunrise and after sunset to \nprisoners observing Ramadan violates RLUIPA.  This Court has recognized that MDOC \npreviously failed to provide at least 2,350 calories each day to Muslim prisoners observing \nRamadan.  If this Court finds that, absent relief, MDOC will provide inadequate nutrition to \nPlaintiffs during Ramadan 2014, then injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent violations of \nRLUIPA.  \n4.  A Monitor Will Help Ensure Compliance with the Courtโs Order \n  If the Court finds a preliminary injunction to be appropriate, it may appoint an \nindependent monitor to ensure compliance with the Courtโs order.  The authority of the Court to \nappoint a monitor is well established.  See Ex Parte Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 312โ13 (1920) \n(acknowledging inherent power of courts to โappoint persons unconnected with the court to aid \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #98 Filed 06/20/14  Page 7 of 9   Page ID#950\njudges in the performance of specific judicial duties,โ and noting that courts have long exercised \nthis power โwhen sitting in equity, by appointing, either with or without the consent of the \nparties, special masters, auditors, examiners, and commissioners.โ).  The effectiveness of \ninjunctive relief is often contingent on some level of objective compliance monitoring.  If the \ncourt does not put into place an independent, impartial monitoring system, particularly in a case \nlike this where Defendants have a history of non-compliance, reliance on a Defendant to โself-\ncertifyโ its compliance can further endanger the rights of prisoners affected by a Defendantโs \nbehavior.  See Benjamin v. Schriro, 370 F. Appโx 168, 171 (2d Cir. 2010) (affirming district \ncourtโs decision to appoint an independent monitor to oversee reforms where New York City \nDepartment of Correction had a history of noncompliance with a court order); see also United \nStates v. Michigan, No. G84-63, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25679, *23-24 (W.D. Mich. 1986) \n(noting the court โneeds . . . an independent basis for judging defendantsโ compliance efforts, \nand the case law amply supports the use of an independent expert for this purpose.โ).  \n  The United States often uses monitors to ensure compliance with settlement agreements \nor court orders.  See, e.g., United States v. Detroit Police Depโt, No. 2:03-cv-72258 (E.D. Mich.) \n(7/18/03 Consent J.:  Use of Force, Arrest, and Witness Detention, dkt. # 22; 7/18/03 Consent J.: \nConditions of Confinement, dkt. # 23); United States v. City of Detroit, No. 2:04-cv-73152 (E.D. \nMich.) (12/22/05 Settlement Order, dkt. # 43) (referring to monitor as an โindependent auditorโ); \nUnited States v. Ohio, No. 2:08-cv-475 (S.D. Ohio) (6/28/11 Am. Stipulation for Inj. Relief, dkt. \n# 85, at 16-20); United States v. Robertson Cnty., No. 3:13-cv-00392 (M.D. Tenn.) (4/30/13 \nSettlement Agreement, dkt. # 4 at 15-20) (referring to monitor as an โindependent consultantโ).  \nWhile not necessary to ensure compliance with every court order, monitoring is particularly \nimportant when an unlawful practice is entrenched.  Here, given Defendantsโ established history \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #98 Filed 06/20/14  Page 8 of 9   Page ID#951\nof providing an inadequate number of calories during Ramadan, the Court may appoint an \nindependent monitor to guide implementation and oversight of the requested injunctive relief, if \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \n  Should the Court find the Defendants are providing inadequate nutrition during Ramadan, \nthe Court should find a violation of RLUIPA for the reasons stated above.  If the Court also finds \na preliminary injunction to be the appropriate remedy, then the United States recommends that \nthe Court grant Plaintiffsโ request for a monitor to ensure that the injunctive relief is properly \nimplemented.   \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJOCELYN SAMUELS \nActing Assistant Attorney General \nCivil Rights Division \n \nDated:  June 20, 2014         MARK KAPPELHOFF \n              Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n              Civil Rights Division \n \n              JONATHAN M.

Gordon J. Quist\nvs.\nTIM FINCO, et al.,\nDefendants.\n                                                          /\nORDER\nThis is a civil rights action brought by four state prisoners.1  This matter is now before\nthe Court on plaintiffsโ โRenewed motion for a declaration of the minimum number of calories that\nis constitutionally sufficient to maintain an inmateโs health during Ramadanโ (docket no. 167).  In\ntheir motion, plaintiffs ask the Court to enter a declaratory judgment โof the minimum number of\ncalories that is constitutionally sufficient to maintain an inmateโs health during Ramadan.โ  See\nRenewed motion, PageID #1521.\nFirst, plaintiffโs request for relief falls outside of the scope of this action.  Plaintiffsโ\ncomplaint does not seek this type of sweeping declaratory relief.  Rather, the only declaratory relief\nsought in the complaint is that the Court enter a judgment โDeclaring that Defendantsโ [sic] refused\nto accommodate Plaintiffโs [sic] request for adequate meals during Ramadan violates the 1st & 8th\nAmendments and RLUIPA.โ  Compl. (docket no. 1, PageID #6). \nSecond,  this  motion  is  redundant.    The  Court  has  addressed  the  issue  of  a\nconstitutionally sufficient number of calories on two previous occasions.  In its July 10, 2013 Order,\n1 The Court notes that plaintiffs filed this pro se motion prior to the appointment of counsel.\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 215 filed 09/21/15   PageID.1825   Page 2 of 2\nthe Court determined that โthe 2013 Ramadan meal plan will provide prisoners between 2,350 and\n2,594 calories per dayโ and that this amount of calories was sufficient to satisfy defendantsโ\nconstitutional obligation to provide plaintiffs โwith a diet nutritionally adequate for the maintenance\nof normal health.โ  See Order of Clarification (docket no. 22, PageID #182), citing Cunningham v.\nJones, 567 F.2d 653, 656 (6th Cir. 1977).  Then, in its June 27, 2014 Opinion, the Court concluded\nโthat providing prisoners participating in the Ramadan fast an average of 2,350 calories over a\ntwo-week period is consistent with sound nutritional practices and will not adversely affect\nprisonersโ health.โ  See Opinion (docket no. 104, PageID #996).  Accordingly, plaintiffโs renewed\nmotion (docket no. 167) is DENIED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDated: September 21, 2015            /s/ Ray Kent                             \nRay Kent\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n2",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN\nSOUTHERN DIVISION\n__________________________\nLAMONT HEARD, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Case No. 1:13-CV-373\nTOM FINCO, et al., HON. GORDON J. QUIST\nDefendants.\n________________________/\nOPINION REGARDING (1) PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION CONCERNING RAMADAN 2014\nAND (2) DEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM AN ORDER\nPURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b)(5)\nBackground\nPlaintiffs are prisoners incarcerated with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) at\nvarious facilities and are also practicing Muslims.  Plaintiffs have sued Defendants, MDOC Deputy\nDirector Thomas Finco, MDOC special Activity Director Michael Martin, and MDOC Food Service\nManager Brad Purves, alleging that they violated Plaintiffsโ rights under the First Amendment and the\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc et seq., by failing\nto provide them adequate nutrition during the Islamic month of Ramadan, which lasts for 29 to 30 days.1 \n(Dkt. # 1 at Page ID ## 2, 5.)  โObservant Muslims fast between dawn and sunset during the thirty days\nof Ramadan.โ  Lovelace v. Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 182 (4th Cir. 2006).  They may resume eating and\ndrinking after sunset until dawn the following day.  (Dkt. # 1 at Page ID # 3.)  Plaintiffsโ claims concern\nthe 2011 and 2012 Ramadan observances.\n1Plaintiffs also alleged an Eighth Amendment claim, which the Court dismissed on March 31, 2014.  (Dkt. #\n59 at Page ID ## 708โ09.)  Plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of their Eighth Amendment claim,\nwhich the Court will address in a separate order.\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction in which Plaintiffs\nrequested that the Court order Defendants to provide Plaintiffs adequate nutrition during the 2013\nRamadan observance.  Plaintiffs argued that because MDOC policy requires that inmates be provided\n2,900 calories per day, Defendants should be required to provide Plaintiffs 2,900 calories per day during\nRamadan.  On July 8, 2013, the Court denied Plaintiffsโ motion on the basis that Defendants had shown\nthat the 2013 Ramadan menu would provide adequate nutrition to prisoners participating in the\nRamadan fast.  The Court also found that, contrary to Plaintiffsโ assertions, current MDOC policy does\nnot specify a 2,900 daily calorie requirement for prisoners.  In particular, the Court noted: \nIn their Response, Defendants note that, contrary to Plaintiffโs assertion, MDOC\nPolicy Directive 04.07.100, titled โOffender Meals,โ does not specify a minimum caloric\nmeal value.  Defendant Purves explains in his affidavit that the MDOCโs Statewide\nStandard Menu provides prisoners 2,600 calories per day.  (Purves Aff. ยถ 4, Defs.โ Resp.\nto Pls.โ Mot. Ex. 2.)  According to Purves, the MDOC sets its caloric intake level based\non Dietary Reference intake values approved by the National Research Council (NRC). \n(Id. ยถ 3.)  The NRC recommends a daily caloric intake of 2,600 to 2,800 for moderately\nactive men in their 20s; a daily caloric intake of 2,400 to 2,600 for moderately active\nmen in their 30s and 40s; and a daily caloric intake of 2,200 to 2,400 for moderately\nactive men after 50.  (Id.)  The MDOC specifies 2,600 calories per day because that\nnumber meets the needs of 95% of male prisoners in the general population.  (Id. ยถ 4.) \nPurves states that all Plaintiffs are between 36 and 46 years of age.  (Id.)  Thus, when\nPlaintiffs are moderately active, a daily caloric intake of between 2,400 to 2,600 calories\nmeets their recommended caloric intake.\nPurves also states that the Ramadan meal plan Plaintiffs attach to their Motion\nis not the meal plan that will be used for the 2013 Ramadan observance.  Instead, the\n2013 meal plan offers four different meal options to prisoners who choose to fast, and\nprovides a daily caloric content ranging from 2,350 to 2,594 calories.  (Id. ยถ 6.)  Purves\nalso confirms that a registered dietician with the MDOC has determined that a daily\ncaloric intake of 2,350 to 2,594 calories will not pose a health risk to healthy, moderately\nactive males.  (Id. ยถ 7.)\nIn light of the information set forth in Purvesโs affidavit, Plaintiffs have failed\nto demonstrate that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. \nFirst, Plaintiffsโ motion is based on an out-of-date meal plan that will not apply to the\n2013 Ramadan observance.  Second, Defendants have shown that the meal plan for the\n2013 Ramadan observance provides between 2,350 and 2,594 calories per day, which\nsubstantially meets the recommended calorie requirements for most moderately active\nprisonersโdefined as โโa lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking\n2\n\nabout 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the light physical\nactivity associated with typical day-to-day life.โโ (Purves Aff. ยถ 3 (quoting 2010 Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans).)  Third, Plaintiffs wholly fail to show that they will suffer\nany harm from a slight reduction in their daily caloric intake during the 30-day Ramadan\nobservance. . . .\n(Dkt. # 21 at Page ID ## 178โ79.)\nOn July 10, 2013, the Court issued an Order of Clarification Regarding Memorandum Opinion\nand Order Denying Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which noted that, since the entry of\nthe July 8, 2013 Memorandum Opinion and Order, Plaintiffs had submitted information that โappear[ed]\nto be reasonably accurateโ and suggested that the facility in which Plaintiffs were incarcerated had or\nwould be providing Ramadan meals averaging only approximately 1,149.2 calories per day.  (Dkt. # 22\nat Page ID # 182.)  Because Plaintiffsโ evidence was contrary to Purvesโ representations and, if true,\nwould have sufficed to show irreparable harm, the Court ordered Defendants to provide Plaintiffs at\nleast 2,350 calories per day during the 2013 Ramadan observance.  (Id. at Page ID ## 182โ83.)\nSubsequently, Plaintiffs moved to hold Defendants in contempt on the ground that the actual\n2013 Ramadan meals provided approximately 600 fewer calories than Defendants had represented. \n(Dkt. # 23.)  After reviewing the partiesโ evidence pertaining to the contempt motion, the Court\nconcluded  that  Defendantsโ  calorie  figures  were  likely  more  accurate  than  Plaintiffsโ  figures. \nNonetheless, the Court noted that Defendantsโ own evidence showed that, on several days, the meals\nPlaintiffs received provided less than the 2,350 calories specified in the July 10, 2013 Order.  The Court\nrejected  Defendantsโ explanation that the 2013 Ramadan menu complied with the July 10, 2013 Order \nbecause it provided a daily average of 2,361.246 calories per day, on the basis that Purves had\nrepresented that the 2013 Ramadan meal plan would provide a minimum of 2,350 per day rather than\na daily average of 2,350 calories.  (Dkt. # 58 at Page ID # 698.)  Accordingly, the Court found\nDefendants in contempt and awarded Plaintiffs compensation.  (Dkt. # 70.)  \n3\n\nMotions Before the Court\nThe Court addresses two pending motions in this Opinion.  First, Plaintiffs have filed a Motion\nfor Preliminary Injunction, in which they request that the Court order Defendants to provide 2,900\ncalories per day during the 2014 Ramadan observance, as specified by MDOC policy.  Citing\nDefendantsโ failure to comply with the July 10, 2013 Order for the 2013 Ramadan observance, Plaintiffs\nalso request that the Court appoint a monitor to ensure that Defendants comply with their legal\nobligation to provide Plaintiffs adequate nutrition during Ramadan.  Plaintiffs state that a monitor is\nparticularly appropriate for the current Ramadan observance because the MDOC has contracted with\na private company, Aramark, to perform its food service operations.\nDefendants have filed a Motion for Relief from the July 10, 2013 Order, in which they request\nthat the Court relieve them of any obligation to provide at least 2,350 calories per day and instead permit\nthem to provide Plaintiffs an average of 2,350 calories, based on a two-week menu period.  Defendants\nargue that such request is reasonable because the MDOC formulates its menus based on average calorie\ncounts over a two-week cycle, and this practice is healthy and well-accepted.\nFinally, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 517, the United States has filed a Statement of Interest in\nfurtherance of its enforcement authority under RLUIPA.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-2(f).  The United\nStates advises that, through its Statement of Interest, it seeks to assist the Court in determining whether\nthe Defendants have violated RLUIPA by failing to provide adequate nutrition to Muslim prisoners\nobserving Ramadan.  The United States recommends the appointment of a monitor in the event that the\nCourt finds a RLUIPA violation and issues an injunction, to ensure that the injunctive relief is properly\nimplemented.\nDiscussion\nโA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be granted only if the\nmovant carries his or her burden of proving that the circumstances clearly demand it.โ  Overstreet v.\n4\n\nLexington-Fayette Urban Cnty. Govโt, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002).  Moreover, because Plaintiffs\nseek injunctive relief against prison officials concerning a matter of prison administration, this Court\nis required to proceed with the utmost care and must recognize the unique nature of the prison setting. \nKendrick v. Bland, 740 F.2d 432, 438 n.3 (6th Cir. 1984).\nIn ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction, a court considers four factors: โ(1) whether\nthe plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm\nin the absence of an injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others;\nand (4) whether the issuance of the injunction is in the public interest.โ  Mich. State AFL-CIO v. Miller,\n103 F.3d 1240, 1249 (6th Cir. 1997).  These are factors to be balanced, not prerequisites that must be\nmet.  See Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1099 (6th Cir. 1994).  A district court need not make\nspecific findings on each of the four factors if fewer factors are dispositive of the issue.  See In re\nDeLorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, 1228 (6th Cir. 1985).\nSection 3 of RLUIPA, which addresses prisonersโ religious beliefs, provides:\nNo government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person\nresiding in or confined to an institution, as defined in section 1997 of this title, even if\nthe  burden  results  from  a  rule  of  general  applicability,  unless  the  government\ndemonstrates that imposition of the burden on that personโ\n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and\n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(a).  โCourts entertaining complaints under ยง 3 should apply โdue deference to the\nexperience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary regulations and\nprocedures to maintain good order, security and discipline, consistent with consideration of costs and\nlimited resources.โโ Coleman v. Governor of Mich., 413 F. Appโx 866, 875 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting\nCutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 723, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 2123 (2005)).  The Sixth Circuit has held that\nan action is a substantial burden if it โforce[s] an individual to choose between โfollowing the precepts\n5\n\nof [his] religion and forfeiting benefits,โ or when the action in question place[s] โsubstantial pressure\non an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.โโ Living Water Church of God v.\nCharter Twp. of Meridian, 258 F. Appโx 729, 734 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S.\n398, 404, 83 S. Ct. 1790, 1794 (1963), and Thomas v. Review Bd. of In. Empโt Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707,\n718, 101 S. Ct. 1425, 1432 (1981)).  โ[A]t a minimum the substantial burden test requires that a\nRLUIPA plaintiff demonstrate that the governmentโs denial of a particular religious item or observance\nwas more than an inconvenience to oneโs religious practice.โ  Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th\nCir. 2007), abrogated on other grounds by Sossamon v. Texas, 536 U.S. __, 131 S. Ct. 1651 (2011). \nInadequate nutrition may impose a substantial burden on a prisonerโs religious practices.  See Heard v.\nCaruso, 351 F. Appโx 1, 13 (6th Cir. 2009).\nInitially, the Court considers Plaintiffsโ assertion that MDOC policy provides that they are\nentitled to 2,900 calories per day.  The Court previously addressed this issue in its July 8, 2013 Order\ndenying Plaintiff sโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, noting that MDOC Policy Directive 04.07.100\ndoes not specify a particular number of calories, but instead relies on the Dietary Reference intake\nvalues approved by the National Research Council.  (Dkt. # 21 at Page ID # 178.)  The Court found that\nthe MDOC has determined that based on those values, 2,600 calories per day is appropriate because that\nlevel of nutrition meets the dietary requirements of 95% of the male prisoner general population based\non a moderately active lifestyle.  (Id. at Page ID ## 178โ79.)  Thus, even if Plaintiffs were not\nparticipating in the Ramadan observance, MDOC policy would provide them only 2,600 calories, not\n2,900 calories.\nThe Court previously concluded that a Ramadan menu that provided at least 2,350 calories per\ndayโwhich Defendants state will be provided again for the 2014 Ramadan observanceโsubstantially\nmeets the calorie requirements set by the MDOC and appears to provided a nutritionally-adequate diet. \nWhile the Court did not expressly consider whether that level of nutrition substantially burdened\n6\n\nPlaintiffsโ exercise of their religion in the context of RLUIPA, it now concludes that this level of\ncalories does not substantially burden Plaintiffsโ participation in the Ramadan fast.  At 2,350 calories,\na prisoner participating in the Ramadan fast will receive 90% of the calories he would otherwise receive\nwhen not participating in the fast.  While receiving 250 fewer caloriesโthe approximate equivalent of\nan energy bar or two pieces of fruitโper day for 30 days might make Plaintiffsโ participation in the\nRamadan fast more difficult or less enjoyable, there is no indication that a diet of 2,350 calories would\nforce Plaintiffs to refrain from participating in, or abandon, the Ramadan fast. In fact, this daily number\nof calories is 150 more than the 2,200 calories the court ordered in Couch v. Jabe, No. 7:05-cv-642\n(W.D. Va. Sept. 22, 2006) (dkt. # 6 at Page ID #513) (ordering โthat the defendants, between sunset and\ndawn during the 2006 Ramadan period beginning September 23, shall daily provide Couch with food\nitems containing approximately 2,200 caloriesโ), which Plaintiffs cite in their brief.2  Moreover,\nalthough Plaintiffs complain about the ill effects they suffer during Ramadanโanger, headaches,\ndecreased energy, dizziness, etc.โas a result of lack of proper food, it is questionable whether\nadditional calories would alleviate them.  After all, a Ramadan observant foregoes food and drink for\nsubstantial periods of time each dayโas long as fifteen hours at a time when Ramadan occurs during\nthe summer months.  Thus, regardless of the amount of calories consumed between sunset and sunrise,\nit is unsurprising that Plaintiffs experience abnormal physical symptoms during the fast.  See J. B.\nLeiper et al., Effects on Health of Fluid Restriction During Fasting in Ramadan, 57 European J. of\nClinical Nutrition (2003), available at http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n2s/full/1601899a.html\n(noting that โ[a] frequently cited problem of Ramadan fasting is an increased incidence of headachesโ);\nFrench v. Md. Div. of Corr., CCB-11-2142, CCB-11-3301, 2013 WL 1104995, at *7 (D. Md. Mar. 15,\n2The MDOC does not explain why it does not simply provide prisoners observing Ramadan the same 2,600\ncalories per day that it normally provides other prisoners.  See Garnica v. Wash. Depโt  of Corr., 965 F. Supp. 2d 1250,\n1262 (W.D. Wash. 2013) (โAccording to Mr. Carney, the calorie level for Ramadan was set at 2700 calories per day to\nstay within DOC guidelines of 2700 to 3000 calories per day, a range which is well above USDA Dietary Reference\nIntake recommendations.โ).  \n7\n\n2013) (โThe court does not doubt that fasting, which includes the skipping of meals during the day, may\nlead to some weight loss or the intake of fewer calories relative to non-fasting inmates, but those are\nanticipated effects of the practice of fasting.โ).       \nDefendantsโ motion raises the question of whether it is sufficient to provide Plaintiffs with an\naverage of 2,350 calories per two week cycle during Ramadan 2014, rather than with 2,350 on a daily\nbasis.  As a point of clarification, while the Courtโs prior contempt order might suggest that the Court\nwould answer no, the contempt was imposed because Defendants failed to do what they told the Court\nthey would do (provide a minimum of 2,350 calories each day), and not because they provided an\naverage of 2,350 calories.\nIn support of their motion, Defendants present an affidavit from Norma Killough, RD, a\nregistered dietician employed by the MDOC.  Ms. Killough states that all MDOC menus are designed\nto comply with the nutritional and caloric recommendations set forth in the Dietary Reference Intakes: \nThe Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements, which are โa common set of reference values for a\nhealthy population based on the relationships between nutrient intakes and health or the prevention of\ndisease.โ  (Dkt. # 95-1 at Page ID # 939.)  Ms. Killough also states that the MDOC follows the current\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, issued by the United States Departments of Health and Human\nServices and Agriculture, for menu planning.  (Id.)  Because the Dietary Guidelines recommends an\neating pattern that meets nutrient needs over time at an appropriate calorie level, the MDOC plans its\nmenus to meet nutrient and caloric needs over a two-week menu cycle rather than individual days. \nThus, ordinarily, โ[t]he nutritional and caloric content of the meals planned will fluctuate daily because\nthe nutrient density of the food items will vary from day to day.โ  (Id. at Page ID ## 939โ40.)\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that providing prisoners participating in the\nRamadan fast an average of 2,350 calories over a two-week period is consistent with sound nutritional\npractices and will not adversely affect prisonersโ health.  In fact, it is reasonable to assume that most\n8\n\npeople do not consume a set number of calories per day, but vary the amount of calories each day. \nThus, the Court will grant Defendantsโ motion.\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not shown irreparable harm, and\ntherefore, are not entitled to a preliminary injunction.  For the same reasons, the Court will not appoint\na monitor.  The Court does have some concerns, however, about Defendantsโ follow-through on their\nrepresentations, in light of the fact that the MDOC is using a private food service company to furnish\nprisoner meals.  Accordingly, the Court will order Defendants to provide the Court a copy of the 2014\nRamadan menu and, on a weekly basis, a sworn statement from a representative at Plaintiffsโ facilities\nconfirming that Plaintiffs were served the food items listed on the 2014 Ramadan menu and identifying\nany actual variations and the calorie content of such.                   \nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and\ngrant Defendantsโ Motion for Relief From an Order.\nAn Order consistent with this Opinion will enter.\nDated:  June 27, 2014               /s/ Gordon J.

Case No. 1:13-CV-373\nTOM FINCO, et al., HON. GORDON J. QUIST\nDefendants.\n_________________________/\nORDER ADOPTING IN PART AND REJECTING IN\nIN PART11/04/2016 REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\nPlaintiffs and Defendants have filed Objections to Magistrate Judge Ray Kentโs November 4,\n2016, Report and Recommendation (R & R), which addressed Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment\nagainst Defendants Finco and Purves on Plaintiffsโ First and Eighth Amendment claims for Ramadan\n2011 and 2012, and Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ claims based on Ramadan\n2013 and 2014.  The magistrate judge recommended that the Court: (1) deny Plaintiffsโ motion as to\nboth the First and Eighth  Amendment claims for 2011 and 2012 because issues of fact remain โwith\nrespect to each plaintiffโs daily caloric content, the duration of the diet, and their nutritional needs\nduring that timeโ (ECF No. 302 at PageID.2392); (2) deny Defendantsโ motion as to the First and Eighth\nAmendment claims for Ramadan 2013 and 2014 based on qualified immunity because issues of fact\nremain as to the amount of calories Plaintiffs received in 2013 and 2014 (id. at PageID.2395); (3) grant\nDefendantsโ motion as to Plaintiffsโ equal protection claim (id. at PageID.2399-2400); (4) grant\nDefendantsโ motion as to Plaintiffsโ 2014 Ramadan claims against Defendant Purves based on Purvesโ\nlack of personal involvement (id. at PageID. 2401โ02); and (5) deny Defendantsโ motion with regard\nto Plaintiffsโ Ramadan 2013 conspiracy claim, but grant the motion with regard to the 2014 Ramadan\nconspiracy claim (id. at PageID.2402โ03).\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1), upon receiving objections to a report and recommendation,\nthe district judge โshall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified\nproposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.โ  After conducting a de novo review\nof the R & R, the partiesโ Objections, and the pertinent portions of the record, the Court concludes that\nthe R & R should be adopted in part and rejected in part.  The Court will reject the R & R with regard\nto its recommendation that Defendants are not entitlement to qualified immunity on Plaintiffsโ First and\nEighth Amendment claims for Ramadan 2013 and 2014 and with regard to its recommendation to deny\nsummary judgment on Plaintiffsโ Ramadan 2013 conspiracy claim.1  The Court will adopt the R & R\nin all other respects. \nPlaintiffsโ Objections\nPlaintiffs argue that the magistrate judge erred in his analysis of their First and Eighth\nAmendment claims for Ramadan 2011 and 2012.  First, Plaintiffs argue that the magistrate judge failed\nto properly analyze their First Amendment claims that the amount of calories they were provided during\n2011 and 2012 diminished the spiritual experience they otherwise would have had if Defendants had\nserved them the full amount of calories they would have received had they not participated in Ramadan. \nPlaintiffs note that they presented evidence of the effects that the reduced calories had on their health\nduring the month of Ramadan, and Defendants failed to provide any evidence to rebut Plaintiffsโ\nevidence.  Plaintiffs argue that such evidence shows that the substantial reduction of calories in both\nyears substantially burdened their exercise of their religion.  Regarding their Eighth Amendment claims,\nPlaintiffs argue that the magistrate judgeโs analysis is contrary to case law, the established facts in the\n1Defendants brought their motion as a motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  However, their\nargument concerning the conspiracy claim was based on the sufficiency of Plaintiffsโ complaint, under the Twombly\npleading standard.    \n2\n\nrecord, and previous rulings by this Court.  In spite of Plaintiffsโ Objections, the Court concurs with the\nmagistrate judgeโs analysis.\n   โโ[W]here the moving party has the burdenโthe plaintiff on a claim for relief or defendant on\nan affirmative defenseโhis showing must be sufficient for the court to hold that no reasonable trier of\nfact could find other than for the moving party.โโ Calderone v. United States, 799 F.2d 254, 259 (6th\nCir. 1986) (quoting W. Schwarzer, Summary Judgment Under the Federal Rules: Defining Genuine\nIssues of Material Fact, 99 F.R.D. 465, 487โ88 (1984) (emphasis in original)).  โ[I]f the moving party\nalso bears the burden of persuasion at trial, the moving partyโs initial summary judgment burden is\nโhigher in that it must show that the record contains evidence satisfying the burden of persuasion and\nthat the evidence is so powerful that no reasonable jury would be free to disbelieve it.โโ Arnett v. Myers,\n281 F.3d 552, 561 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting 11 James Wm. Moore, et al., Mooreโs Federal Practice ยง\n56.13[1], at 56-138 (3d ed. 2000)).  \nAs for Plaintiffsโ First Amendment claim, in Welch v. Spaulding, 627 F. Appโx 479 (6th Cir.\n2015), the Sixth Circuit said that the plaintiff, who alleged receiving only 1300 calories per day during\nRamadan, โhad a clearly established right to a nutritious diet during Ramadan.โ  Id. at 483.  The court\ndeclined to define nutritional adequacy in terms of calories, however, holding instead that whether a\nprisoner received a nutritionally-adequate diet โis a fact-specific inquiry that requires consideration of,\ninter alia, daily caloric content, duration of the diet, and the nutritional needs of the prisoner.โ  Id.  As\nthe magistrate judge noted in the instant case, Defendants provided evidence that the caloric content of\nthe Ramadan diet for 2011 ranged from 1,767 to 1,810 calories per day, and that the caloric content of\nthe  Ramadan  diet  for  2012  averaged  1,756  calories  per  day,  (ECF  No.  294-5  at\nPageID.2323)โsubstantially below the average 2,600 calories the regular general population diet\nprovides.  However, Defendants also provided evidence that 1,800 calories per day would be sufficient\n3\n\nโfor many prisoners to be on for 30 days,โ and that โ[m]ost people eating [an average of 1,756 calories\nper day for 28-30 days] would not be harmed by it.โ  (ECF No. 294-6 at PageID.2326.)  Although\nPlaintiffs allege that they suffered adverse effects from this reduction of calories during Ramadan, in\nlight of Defendantsโ evidence, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs have met their burden of\nshowing that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for Plaintiffs.  In fact, in its Order rejecting\nDefendantsโ interlocutory appeal in this case, the Sixth Circuit said that โit is clear that a diet consisting\nof 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day can violate [the] right [to a nutritionally adequate diet.โ  (ECF No.\n229 at PageID.1921.)  Thus, contrary to Plaintiffsโ argument, whether Plaintiffs were provided adequate\nnutrition during Ramadan 2011 and 2012 remains an issue for the jury.\nAs for Plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment claim, Plaintiffsโs argument that the Court has previously\ndetermined that Plaintiffs need an average of 2,350 calories during the month of Ramadan is inaccurate. \nAs the Court will explain in more detail below, the Courtโs orders regarding Defendantsโ proposed diets\nproviding 2,350 calories per day did not purport to set a minimum number of calories that Ramadan\nobservants require.  Thus, for the reasons stated above, genuine issues of material fact remain as to\nPlaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment claims.  \nDefendantsโ Objections\nDefendants argue that the magistrate judge erred in concluding that they are not entitled to\nqualified immunity on Plaintiffsโ claims based on Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  The Court agrees.  โThe\ndoctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from\ncivil liability for damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.โ  Baynes v. Cleland, 799 F.3d\n600, 609 (6th Cir. 2015) (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2738 (1982)). \nA right is โclearly establishedโ if โ[t]he contours of the right [are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable\n4\n\nofficial would understand that what he is doing violates that right.โ  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.\n635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 3039 (1987).  Although the Supreme Court has recognized that the Eighth\nAmendment requires prison officials to provide prisoners โhumane conditions of confinement,โ\nincluding adequate food, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1976 (1994), neither\nthe Supreme Court nor the Sixth Circuit have specified a minimum number of calories required for a\nnutritionally-adequate diet.  See Welch, 627 F. Appโx at 482.  However, in Cunningham v. Jones, 667\nF.2d 565 (6th Cir. 1982) (per curiam), the Sixth Circuit affirmed a district courtโs finding that a daily\ndiet of 2,000 to 2,500 calories for fifteen days sufficed to maintain normal health.\nOn July 8, 2013, this Court entered an order denying Plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary\ninjunction to require Defendants to provide Plaintiffs 2,900 calories per day during Ramadan 2013. \n(ECF No. 21.)  The Court denied the motion, in part, because Defendants represented that the 2013\nRamadan diet would provide a daily caloric content ranging from 2,350 to 2,594 calories, which would\nnot pose a risk to healthy, moderately active males.  (Id. at PageID.179.)  On July 10, 2013, the Court\nissued an Order of Clarification (ECF No. 22), in which it notified Defendants that, per their\nrepresentations, they would be required to provide Plaintiffs at least 2,350 calories per day during the\n2013 Ramadan observance.  Subsequently, on April 29, 2014, the Court entered an Order of Contempt\nholding Defendants in contempt for providing Plaintiffs fewer than 2,350 calories each day during\nRamadan 2013.  (ECF No. 70.)  In an Opinion entered on June 27, 2014, the Court explained that it\nissued the April 29, 2014 Order of Contempt, even though Defendants represented that they provided\nan average of 2,361 calories per day during Ramadan 2013, because Defendants had represented that\nthey would provide  a minimum of 2,350 calories each day, and Defendantsโ use of an average number\nof calories meant that, on some days, Plaintiffs were receiving several hundred fewer calories, i.e., 2,148\ncalories.  (ECF No. 104 at PageID.996; see also ECF No. 58 at PageID.698.)  In the same Opinion and\n5\n\naccompanying Order, however, the Court also concluded that provision of an average of 2,350 calories\nper day during Ramadan 2014 would not harm Ramadan observants because the practice of providing\na diet that varied in calories each day was โconsistent with sound nutritional practices.โ  (ECF No. 104\nat PageID.996.)  To ensure that Plaintiffs received the calories Defendants said they would provide, the\nCourt ordered Defendants to file sworn statements on a weekly basis verifying that the food items listed\non the 2014 Ramadan menu were actually served.  (Id. at PageID.997.)  Finally, on May 4, 2015, the\nCourt issued a second contempt order, concluding that, contrary to the affidavits Defendants submitted,\nPlaintiffs submitted credible evidence (favorable grievance findings) that they had not been given\nvarious food items.  (ECF No. 191.)\nThe magistrate judge concluded that an issue of fact remains as to whether Plaintiffs received\nsufficient calories for Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  The magistrate judge found that Defendants could not\nrely on the 2,350 daily calories listed in the Courtโs Order of Clarification because Defendantsโ own\nevidence did not establish that Defendants provided at least 2,350 calories each day.  (ECF No. 302 at\nPageID.2396โ97.)  However, the magistrate judge may have overlooked this Courtโs June 27, 2014\nOpinion and Order approving Defendantsโ request to provide an average of 2,350 calories per day for\nRamadan 2014.  (ECF Nos. 104, 105.)  Had Defendants made the same request for Ramadan 2013, the\nCourt likely would have approved it.\nIn 2013 and 2014, it was not clearly established that 2,350 calories or more per day, or even an\naverage of 2,350 calories per day, was required for prisoners fasting for the 28โ30 days of Ramadan to\nmaintain normal health. There was scant case law from the Sixth Circuit, and Cunningham v. Jones, 667\nF.3d 565 (6th Cir. 1982) (per curiam), one of the most cited cases on the issue, said that between 2,000\nand 2,500 calories per day for 15 days did not violate the Eighth Amendment.  Although Plaintiffs\ndispute that they actually received all the calories in 2013 and 2014 that Defendants said they would\n6\n\nprovide, it is undisputed that Defendants created Ramadan diets for 2013 to provide an average of 2,350\ncalories per day.  Moreover, it appears that any shortage of food items occurred because or errors or\nmismanagement at the local facility level and not because the MDOCโs Ramadan diet was inadequate. \nIn any event, there is no indication that Plaintiffs received substantially less than a daily average of\n2,350 calories in either 2013 or 2014 or that such average fell below the 2,000 calorie floor cited in\nCunningham.\n Accordingly, the Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment based on\nqualified immunity on Plaintiffsโ First and Eighth Amendment claims for Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  In\naddition, because the Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffsโ\nclaims based on Ramadan 2013 and 2014, Plaintiffsโ conspiracy claims fail as a matter of law.  See Hale\nv. Townley, 45 F.3d 914, 921 (5th Cir. 1995) (concluding that the plaintiffโs โconspiracy claim [wa]s\nnot actionableโ because all of the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffโs First\nAmendment claim); Dorlett v. Butkiewicus, No. 11-cv-1461 (TLM), 2013 WL 4760943, at *17 (D.\nConn. Sept. 4, 2013) (โThe Court will . . . grant summary judgment against Plaintiff sua sponte on his\nconspiracy claim and dismiss that claim . . . as the Court has dismissed all of the underlying ยง 1983\nclaims upon which the conspiracy claim is based.โ).    \nTherefore,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation issued\nNovember 4, 2016 (ECF No. 302) is ADOPTED IN PART AND REJECTED IN PART.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 281)\nis DENIED.\n7\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendantsโ Motion For Partial Summary Judgment (ECF\nNo. 288) is GRANTED.  Plaintiffsโ claims based on Ramadan 2013 and 2014 are DISMISSED WITH\nPREJUDICE.\nThe case will continue on Plaintiffsโ First and Eighth Amendment claims based on Ramadan\n2011 and 2012.\nDated:  February 16, 2017               /s/ Gordon J.

Motion for partial summary judgment\nA. Legal standard\nโThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).   Rule 56 further provides that a party asserting that a fact cannot be or is\ngenuinely disputed must support the assertion by:\n(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions,\ndocuments, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations\n(including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory\nanswers, or other materials; or \n(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a\ngenuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\nsupport the fact. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).\nIn Copeland v. Machulis, 57 F.3d 476 (6th Cir. 1995), the court set forth the partiesโ\nburden of proof in deciding a motion for summary judgment:\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of establishing an absence of evidence to\nsupport the nonmoving partyโs case.  Once the moving party has met its burden of\nproduction, the nonmoving party cannot rest on its pleadings, but must present\nsignificant probative evidence in support of the complaint to defeat the motion for\nsummary judgment. The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence to support\nplaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury\ncould reasonably find for the plaintiff. \nCopeland, 57 F.3d  at 478-79 (citations omitted).  โIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the\ncourt views the factual evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\nparty.โ  McLean v. 988011 Ontario Ltd., 224 F.3d 797, 800 (6th Cir. 2000).\n2\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #181 Filed 03/27/15  Page 3 of 8   Page ID#1620\nB. Exhaustion requirement\nThe PLRA provides that a prisoner bringing an action with respect to prison\nconditions under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 must first exhaust available administrative remedies.  See Porter\nv. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2001).  A prisoner must exhaust\navailable administrative remedies, even if the prisoner may not be able to obtain the specific type\nof relief he seeks in the state administrative process. See Porter, 534 U.S. at 520; Booth, 532 U.S.\nat 741.  One reason for creating prisoner grievance procedures under the PLRA was to create an\nadministrative record for the court.  \nRequiring exhaustion allows prison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes\nconcerning the exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into court.  This\nhas the potential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to improve the\nquality of suits that are filed by producing a useful administrative record.\nJones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 204 (2007). In order to properly exhaust administrative remedies,\nprisoners must complete the administrative review process in accordance with the deadlines and\nother applicable procedural rules.  Id. at 218; Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90-91 (2006).\nโCompliance with prison grievance procedures, therefore, is all that is required by the PLRA to\nโproperly exhaust.โโ  Jones, 549 U.S. at 218.\nThe MDOC requires prisoners to follow a three-step process to exhaust grievances. \nSee Policy Directive 03.02.130 (effective July 9, 2007).  A prisoner must first attempt to resolve a\nproblem with the staff member within two business days of becoming aware of the grievable issue,\nunless prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control.  Id. at ยถ P.  If the issue is not resolved,\nthen the grievant may file a Step I grievance on the prescribed form within five business days after\nthe grievant attempted to resolve the issue with appropriate staff.  Id. at ยถยถ P and R.  The Policy\nDirective provides the following directions for completing grievance forms: \n3\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #181 Filed 03/27/15  Page 4 of 8   Page ID#1621\nThe issues should be stated briefly but concisely.  Information provided is to be\nlimited to the facts involving the issue being grieved (i.e., who, what, when, where,\nwhy, how).  Dates, times, places and names of all those involved in the issue being\ngrieved are to be included.\nId. at ยถ R (emphasis in original).  The prisoner must send the Step I grievance to the appropriate\ngrievance coordinator.  Id. at ยถ V.  If the prisoner is dissatisfied with the Step I response, or does not\nreceive a timely response, he must request the appropriate form and send it to the Step II Grievance\nCoordinator.  Id. at ยถ BB.  Finally, if a prisoner is dissatisfied with the Step II response, or does not\nreceive a timely response, he must send a completed Step III grievance, using the appropriate form,\nto the Grievance and Appeals Section.  Id. at ยถ FF.\nC. Ramadan 2011\n1. Plaintiff Heard\nIn an affidavit, Richard D. Russell, Manager of the Grievance Section in the Office\nof Legal Affairs, Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC), stated that the MDOCโs Grievance\nTracking database contains only one grievance filed by plaintiff Heard in 2011 which was exhausted\nthrough Step III.  Russell Aff. (docket no. 76-2 at pp. ID## 778-85).  That grievance, SRF 11-05-\n0717-15b (โ717โ) involved a claim that staff at the Saginaw Correctional Facility (SRF) opened his\nlegal mail in violation of MDOC policy.  Id.; Grievance No. 717 (docket no. 76-2 at pp. ID## 786-\n91).  There is no evidence that Heard properly exhausted a grievance regarding Ramadan 2011.  In\nhis response, Heard contends that because he filed grievances related to Ramadan 2010 at SRF and\nthe Chippewa Correctional Facility, he did not have to renew his grievances with respect to\nRamadan 2011.  See Response (docket no. 85 at pp. ID## 857-58).2  In short, Heard contends that\n2 The Court notes that Heard did not include copies of any 2010 grievances with his response.\n4\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #181 Filed 03/27/15  Page 5 of 8   Page ID#1622\nhis grievances filed in 2010 serve as perpetual grievances against all MDOC employees for claims\nrelated to future Ramadan meals, regardless of who is responsible for the meals, where Heard is\nincarcerated, or the consistency of the meal.  Heardโs contention is without merit.  His claims in this\naction arise from a particular instance of alleged wrongdoing, i.e., individual MDOC defendants did\nnot provide sufficient calories in the meals served to him during Ramadan 2011.  If Heard wanted\nto dispute the adequacy of these meals on constitutional and statutory grounds, then he was required\nto file a grievance in 2011 addressing the meals, which named the particular MDOC employees who\nwere responsible, the date of the occurrence and the nature of the alleged wrongful act.  Policy\nDirective 03.02.130 ยถ R; Siggers v. Campbell, 652 F.3d 681, 691-93 (6th Cir. 2011) (under\nMichiganโs grievance scheme, a prisoner has to file separate grievances for discrete events).\nAccordingly, defendants are entitled to summary judgment with respect to Heardโs claims related\nto Ramadan 2011.\n2. Plaintiff Johnson\nIn a separate affidavit, Richard D. Russell stated that the MDOCโs Grievance\nTracking database contains no grievances filed by plaintiff Johnson in 2011 which he exhausted\nthrough Step III.  Russell Aff. (docket no. 76-3 at pp. ID## 793-98).  In sum, there is no evidence\nthat Johnson properly exhausted a grievance regarding Ramadan 2011.  Furthermore, in his\nresponse, Johnson admitted that he did not exhaust a 2011 Ramadan grievance against defendants. \nSee Response (docket no. 85 at p. ID# 857).  Accordingly, defendants are entitled to summary\njudgment with respect to Johnsonโs claims related to Ramadan 2011.\n5\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #181 Filed 03/27/15  Page 6 of 8   Page ID#1623\n3. Plaintiff Moses\nIn a separate affidavit, Richard D. Russell stated that the MDOCโs Grievance\nTracking database contains no grievances filed by plaintiff Moses in 2011 which he exhausted\nthrough Step III.  Russell Aff. (docket no. 76-4 at pp. ID## 800-04).  Since there is no evidence that\nMoses properly exhausted a grievance regarding Ramadan 2011;3 defendants are also entitled to\nsummary judgment with respect to Mosesโ claims related to Ramadan 2011.\n4. Plaintiff Nelson\nIn a separate affidavit, Richard D. Russell stated that the MDOCโs Grievance\nTracking database contains one grievance, SRF 2011-09-1270-09A (โ1270โ), filed by plaintiff\nNelson regarding Ramadan 2011.  Russell Aff. (docket no. 76-5 at pp. ID## 806-16).  While  Nelson\nexhausted grievance no. 1270 through Step III, this grievance did not name any of the defendants\nin this action.  Id.  Moreover, Russell stated in his affidavit that Nelson did not exhaust any other \ngrievances through Step III from May 2009 through April 22, 2014.  Id.  Thus, there is no evidence\nthat  Nelson  properly  exhausted  a  grievance  against  defendants  regarding  Ramadan  2011.4 \nAccordingly, defendants are entitled to summary judgment with respect to Nelsonโs claims related\nto Ramadan 2011.\n3 The Court notes that in a response to defendantsโ motion filed by plaintiffs Heard and Johnson,\nthose two plaintiffs โadmitโ that plaintiff Moses did not exhaust a grievance against defendants regarding\nRamadan 2011.  See Response (docket no. 85 at p. ID# 857).  However, because Moses did not join in this\nresponse, and neither Heard nor Johnson represent him in this matter, this alleged admission is irrelevant. \nSee Order (docket no. 161) (the pro se plaintiffs in this action are not attorneys and cannot file papers on\nbehalf of each other).\n4 The Court notes that Heard and Johnson also provided a response on behalf of plaintiff Nelson,\nclaiming that Nelson properly exhausted a grievance against defendants regarding Ramadan 2011.  See\nResponse (docket no. 85 at pp. ID## 858-59).  Since Nelson did not join in this response, and neither Heard\nnor Johnson represent him in this matter, this alleged response is irrelevant.  See Order (docket no. 161).\n6\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #181 Filed 03/27/15  Page 7 of 8   Page ID#1624\nD. Ramadan 2012\n1. Plaintiffs Heard, Johnson and Moses\nDefendants concede that plaintiffs Heard, Johnson and Moses exhausted their\nadministrative remedies as to Ramadan 2012.  Defendantsโ Brief (docket no. 76 at p. ID# 774). \n2. Plaintiff Nelson\nAs discussed in ยง II.C.4., there is no evidence that plaintiff Nelson filed a grievance\nthrough Step III during 2012.  Accordingly, defendants are entitled to summary judgment with\nrespect to Nelsonโs claims related to Ramadan 2012.5\nIII. Recommendation\nFor the reasons set forth above, I respectfully recommend that defendantsโ motion\nfor partial summary judgment (docket no. 75) be GRANTED as to all of plaintiffsโ claims arising\nfrom Ramadan 2011 and as to plaintiff Nelsonโs claims arising from Ramadan 2012.\n \n5 T The Court notes that Heard and Johnson also provided a response on behalf of plaintiff Nelson,\nclaiming that Nelson properly exhausted a grievance against defendants regarding Ramadan 2012.  See\nResponse (docket no. 85 at pp. ID## 859-60).  However, because Nelson did not join in this response, and\nneither Heard nor Johnson represent him in this matter, this alleged response is irrelevant.  See Order (docket\nno. 161).\n7\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-HWB  Doc #181 Filed 03/27/15  Page 8 of 8   Page ID#1625\nI further recommend that plaintiff Nelson be DISMISSED from this action and that\nthis action proceed only as to plaintiffs Heard, Johnson and Mosesโ claims arising from Ramadan\n2012.\nDated:  March 27, 2015 /s/ Hugh W.

Case No. 1:13-CV-373\nTOM FINCO, et al., HON. GORDON J. QUIST\nDefendants.\n________________________/\nMEMORANDUM ORDER: (1) GRANTING PLAINTIFFS HEARDโS\nAND JOHNSONโS MOTION TO HOLD DEFENDANTS IN CONTEMPT\nFOR VIOLATING THE COURTโS JUNE 27, 2014 ORDER (Dkt. # 124);\n(2) DENYING PLAINTIFFSโ MOTIONS FOR RULE 11 SANCTIONS\n(Dkt. ## 169, 175, 178); (3) GRANTING PLAINTIFFS HEARDโS AND JOHNSONโS\nMOTIONS TO SUPPLEMENT (Dkt. ## 158, 162); and (4) DISMISSING\nPLAINTIFFSโ OBJECTION TO SWORN STATEMENTS (Dkt. # 115)\nBACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs are prisoners incarcerated with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) at\nvarious facilities and are also practicing Muslims.  Plaintiffs have sued Defendants, alleging that they\nhave violated Plaintiffsโ rights under the First Amendment, the Eighth Amendment1, and the Religious\nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc et seq. by failing to provide\nthem adequate nutrition during the Islamic month of Ramadan.  Because the background of this case\nis set forth in extensive detail in the Courtโs prior opinions and orders, the Court will recount only those\nfacts that are pertinent to the instant motions.\nOn June 14, 2013, shortly after Plaintiffs filed this case, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary\ninjunction requesting that the Court order Defendants to provide Plaintiffs adequate nutrition during the\n2013 Ramadan observance.  (Dkt. # 14.)  The Court denied Plaintiffsโ motion on the basis that\nDefendants had shown that the 2013 Ramadan menu would provide adequate nutrition to prisoners such\n1The Eighth Amendment claim is currently on appeal to the Sixth Circuit.\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1721   Page 2 of 12\nas Plaintiffs, who planned to participate in the 2013 Ramadan fast.  (Dkt. # 21.)  On July 10, 2013, the\nCourt issued an Order of Clarification ordering Defendants to provide Plaintiffs 2,350 calories per day\nduring the 2013 Ramadan observance, as Defendants represented they would do.  (Dkt. # 22.)  Prior to\nthe end of the Ramadan observance, Plaintiffs filed a motion to hold Defendants in contempt for failing\nto provide Plaintiffs at least 2,350 calories per day during Ramadan.  Following a hearing on Plaintiffsโ\nmotion, the Court entered an Order holding Defendants in contempt and ordering Defendants to pay\neach Plaintiff $200 as compensation for damages caused by Defendantsโ noncompliance.  (Dkt. # 70.) \nAlthough Defendants argued that they had complied with the Order of Clarification by giving Plaintiffs\nan average of 2,350 calories per day, the Court found that Defendants had represented that they would\nprovide Plaintiffs a minimum of 2,350 calories per day and had not done so.\nOn May 28, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a second motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that\nthe Court order Defendants to provide Plaintiffs 2,900 calories per day during the 2014 Ramadan\nobservance.  (Dkt. # 87.)  On June 16, 2014, Defendants filed a motion for relief from the Courtโs July\n10, 2013 Order of Clarification, requesting that they be permitted to provide Plaintiffs an average of\n2,350 calories per day over a two-week period.  (Dkt. # 94.)  On June 27, 2014, the Court entered an\nOpinion and accompanying Order denying Plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary injunction and granting\nDefendantsโ motion for relief from the July 10, 2013 Order.  (Dkt. ## 104, 105.)  As part of its ruling,\nthe Court determined that providing Plaintiffs an average of 2,350 calories per day would not\nsubstantially burden Plaintiffsโ exercise of their religion.  (Dkt. # 104 at Page ID##994โ95.)  However,\nthe Court was concerned โabout Defendantsโ follow-through on their representations [about the number\nof calories that Plaintiffs would receive]โ and therefore required Defendants to submit sworn statements\non a weekly basis confirming that Plaintiffs were actually served the food items listed on the 2014\nRamadan menu and identifying any actual variations and the calorie content of such.  (Id. at Page\nID#997.)\n2\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1722   Page 3 of 12\nPursuant to the Courtโs June 27, 2014 Order, Defendants submitted their first sworn statements\non July 7, 2014.  (Dkt. # 109.)  Patricia Popoff provided an affidavit regarding Lakeland Correctional\nFacility, David Mastaw provided an affidavit for the Kinross Correctional Facility, and Robert Beaulieu\nprovided an affidavit for the Chippewa Correctional Facility.  Popoff said that from June 28, 2014\nthrough July 5, 2014, all of meals were served as listed.  Mastaw said that for the same period, no food\nitems were omitted, although one was added on June 30.  Beaulieu stated that all of the food items were\nserved, except that a high fiber bran cake that was omitted from the breakfast on June 29, 2014 was\nprovided in addition to the food served for breakfast the following day.  According to all three affiants,\nthe information recited was provided by Aramark, MDOCโs contract food service provider.\nOn July 14, 2014, Defendants submitted their next set of affidavits, all of which were based on\ninformation provided by Aramark.  (Dkt. # 110.)  Popoff stated that all meals were served as listed for\nthe period of July 6 through July 12 at the Lakeland facility, except for four instances in which certain\nfood items were substituted for listed items, resulting in a net increase of 502 calories.   Mastaw stated\nthat all of the listed items were served at the Kinross facility, and Beaulieu stated that all listed items\nwere served at the Chippewa facility, except for one instance in which the replacement item resulted in\na net increase of 50 calories.\nDefendants submitted their third set of affidavits on July 21, 2014, based on information\nprovided by Aramark.  (Dkt. # 114.)  Popoff stated that from July 13 through July 19, all items listed\nwere served at the Lakeland facility except on five occasions, for which the substituted food items\nresulted in a net increase of 560 calories.  Mastaw and Beaulieu stated that all of the listed food items\nwere served, without exception, at the Kinross and Chippewa facilities.  \nOn July 28, 2014, Defendants submitted their final set of affidavits, for the period of July 20,\n2014 through July 27, 2014, based on information provided by Aramark.  (Dkt. # 119.)  Popoff and\nKimberly Atkinson, representing the Kinross facility, stated that all of the items listed on the Ramadan\n3\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1723   Page 4 of 12\nmenu were served, without exception, at the Kinross and Lakeland facilities.  Beaulieu stated that all\nof the items listed on the menu were served at the Chippewa facility, except that on one occasion 3 diet\njelly pouches were served in place of the regular jelly pouch, resulting in no net change in calories.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Plaintiffs Heardโs and Johnsonโs Motion for Contempt and Motions to Supplement\nPlaintiffs Heard and Johnson have filed a motion to hold Defendants in contempt for violating\nthe June 27, 2014 Order for failing to provide them a daily average of 2,350 calories during the 2014\nRamadan observance.  In connection with their motion for contempt, Plaintiffs have filed two motions\nto submit supplemental supporting materials.  Both motions to supplement, which Defendants have not\nopposed, will be granted.\nIt is well established that courts have the inherent power to manage and control proceedings\nbefore them.  See Brown v. City of Upper Arlington, 637 F.3d 668, 671 (6th Cir. 2011) (โFederal courts\nhave broad contempt power, which exists for the preservation of order in judicial proceedings, and to\nthe enforcement of the judgments, orders, and writs of the courts.โ (internal quotations omitted)). \nโโCourts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested, by their very creation, with power to\nimpose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence, and submission to their lawful mandates.โโ\nChambers v. Nasco, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S. Ct. 2123, 2132 (1991) (quoting Anderson v. Dunn, 6\nwheat. 204, 227 (1821)); see also Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370, 86 S. Ct. 1531, 1535\n(1966) (โThere can be no question that courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their\nlawful orders through civil contempt.โ).\nIn order to hold a litigant in civil contempt, the moving party must establish, through clear and\nconvincing evidence, a prima facie case that the contemnor โviolated a definite and specific order of the\ncourt requiring [it] to perform or refrain from performing a particular act or acts with knowledge of the\ncourtโs order.โ  Elec. Workers Pension Trust Fund of Local Union #58 v. Garyโs Elec. Serv. Co., 340\n4\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1724   Page 5 of 12\nF.3d 373, 378 (6th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted).  โThe order in question must be โdefinite and specific,โ\nand โambiguities must be resolved in favor of persons charged with contempt.โโ United States v. Conces,\n507 F.3d 1028, 1042 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Grace v. Ctr. for Auto Safety, 72 F.3d 1236, 1241 (6th Cir.\n1996)).  Once the movant makes its prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the alleged contemnor to\nproduce evidence that it was presently unable to comply with the courtโs order.  Elec. Workers Pension\nTrust Fund., 340 F. 3d at 379 (citing United States v. Rylander, 460 U.S. 752, 757, 103 S. Ct. 1548,\n1552 (1983)).  A defendant may satisfy this burden by showing โcategorically and in detail why [it] is\nunable to comply with the courtโs order.โ  Id. at 379 (citation omitted).  โGood faith is not a defense in\ncivil contempt proceedings.  Likewise, wilfulness is not an element of civil contempt, but the state of\nmind of the contemnor is relevant only in the consideration of sanctions.โ  Gnesys, Inc. v. Greene, 437\nF.3d 482, 493 (6th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).  \nPlaintiffs Heard and Johnson have carried their initial burden of producing clear and convincing\nevidence that they were not provided certain items listed on the Ramadan menu and that substitute food\nitems were not provided.  (Dkt. # 154-1 at Page ID##1422โ34.)  In their response, Defendants argue that\nPlaintiffs dispute Defendantsโ affidavits.  Defendants provide an affidavit from Beaulieu and an affidavit\nfrom Robert Autore, Aramarkโs food service director at the Chippewa facility, to explain the basis of\nthe information Beaulieu included in his affidavits submitted to the Court and to explain the process that\nAramark used to prepare and serve the Ramadan trays and bagged meals.  Beaulieu explains that he\nโhad no personal involvement in the preparation of meals provided to prisoners during Ramadan,โ and\nthat he obtained the information provided in his affidavits โthrough weekly meetings with Mr. Autore\nfor the sole purpose of completing the affidavits [he] submitted.โ  (Dkt. # 145-2 at Page ID#1327.)  In\nhis affidavit, Autore explains that Aramark oversees prisoner workers who prepare the meals and\ndeposit the appropriate food items into a sealed bag or place them on a styrofoam tray.  (Dkt. # 145-3\nat Page ID#1329.)  The prisoner workers then load the food items onto carts, and Aramark inspects the\n5\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1725   Page 6 of 12\nbags/trays periodically to ensure that all of the appropriate food items are included in the bags and on\nthe trays.  Aramark also confirms that the appropriate number of bags and trays have been prepared. \nThe meals are then secured in refrigerated coolers, and later distributed by prisoner workers supervised\nby corrections officers.  (Id. at Page ID#1330.)  Autore also states that on occasions when there was an\ninsufficient supply of a particular food item, a substitute food item of the same or greater nutritional\nvalue would be provided.  Finally, Autore states that when a prisoner complained of missing food,\nAramark would attempt to replace the missing food item as quickly as possible.  (Id.)  Defendants\ncontend that in light of the process Aramark used to distribute food, it was reasonable for them to be\nskeptical of Plaintiffsโ claims that they were missing food items.  In addition, Defendants note that\nAramark disputed several of Plaintiff Heardโs claims that he was missing food.\nThe June 27, 2014 Order acknowledged that there may be instances in which food items on the\nRamadan menu would be unavailable and thus, not provided, but that Defendants (and those actually\nproviding food services, including Aramark) would be expected to provide substitute food items of the\nsame or greater nutritional value in those instances.  It is therefore not unreasonable to expect that, on\noccasion, a specified food item would not be provided, and the Court recognizes that, from time to time,\nconsidering the number of meals being served, ordinary error or inmate deceit could occur.  However,\nPlaintiffsโ filings show that food items were missing on more than a few occasions, and that substitute\nfood items were not provided.  In fact, Plaintiffs have presented, in addition to their own affidavits, step\nIII grievance responses, issued after a complete investigation, concluding that Plaintiffsโ claims of\nmissing food items (and in one instance, an entire meal) without substituted items were supported. \nMoreover, this appears to have been an ongoing problem during the 2014 Ramadan observance, at least\nat the Chippewa facility.  The problem could have easily been addressed by providing substitute food\nitems.   Although Autore states in his affidavit that Aramark would attempt to replace missing items\nwhen they received notice that items were missing, the grievance responses that Plaintiffs have\n6\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1726   Page 7 of 12\nsubmitted show that this was not the case.  For example, the October 2, 2014 step II grievance response\nto Plaintiff Heardโs grievance URF 14072393 09Z stated:\nFindings: Staff has confirmed the prisoner was shorted two slices of whole wheat\nbread on 7/25/14.  However, it appears no specific action was taken to provide the\ngrievant with the shorted items.  The grievant requested as resolution that the incident\nbe reported in the Ramadan food service report.\nConclusion: There is no Ramadan food service report, however, the shortage has been\nrecorded as requested by the grievant and, therefore, this grievance is considered\nRESOLVED.  In addition, MDOC staff and Aramark staff have been instructed that\nwhen any future food portions are confirmed as missing they must provide a make-up\nportion (or portions) to the prisoner at that time or as near to that time as is practicable\n(e.g., on the next meal tray or with a meal on the next day).\n(Dkt. # 158-2 at Page ID#1451.)  This was not the only occasion a Plaintiff was shorted food without\nresponse from Aramark.  (Dkt. # 154-1 at Page ID#1422 (โClearly this prisoner [Heard] is missing\nseveral items in his food trays and the problem is not getting resolved.  If a Aramark employee was\npresent during the time Ramadon (sic) meals were being served these errors could be resolved on site.โ);\nDkt. # 154-1 at Page ID #1423 (โClearly this prisoner [Heard] is missing several items in his food trays\nand the problem is not getting resolved.  If a Aramark employee was present during the time Ramadon\n[sic] meals were being served these errors could be resolved on site.โ); Dkt. # 154-1 at Page ID#1424\n(โThe grievant should have received his aloted [sic] meal noted on the menu.

This grievance\nwill be forwarded to Aramark food service staff to correct for future purposes.  Prisoner Johnson wishes\nto go to step Two on this complaint.โ).)  Defendants do not dispute any of this.  In this Courtโs\njudgment, Plaintiffsโ evidence of favorable step III grievance findings constitutes clear and convincing\nevidence.\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Defendants should be held in civil contempt\nof the June 27, 2014 Order.  Given that Plaintiffs received most of their food items, the Court finds that\na substantial award of compensation is not warranted.  Accordingly, the Court will award Plaintiffs\nHeard and Johnson $250 each for damages resulting from Defendantsโ contempt.  In addition, although\nPlaintiffs Nelson and Moses have not moved for contempt, the Court has reviewed their affidavits and\n8\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1728   Page 9 of 12\nconcludes that they also constitute clear and convincing evidence that Defendants failed to comply with\nthe June 27, 2014 Order as to Plaintiffs Nelson and Moses.  In their affidavits, Plaintiffs Nelson and\nMoses describe several instances in which they did not receive listed food items and were not given\nsubstitute items.  (Dkt. # 111 at Page ID#1051; Dkt. # 115-1 at Page ID#1086.)  Although Defendants\nargue that the affidavits they submitted create a question of fact, Defendants are mistaken.  As noted\nabove, the information from Aramark, which the Popoff and Mastaw affidavits recite, does not provide\na credible basis to dispute Plaintiffsโ assertions, because there is no indication that the Aramark\nrepresentatives who provided the information to Popoff and Mastaw had personal knowledge of the food\nitems that Plaintiffs actually received.  Thus, the Court will also award Plaintiffs Nelson and Moses each\n$250.2\nII. Plaintiffsโ Motions for Rule 11 Sanctions\nPlaintiffs have filed motions for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c)\nagainst Defendantsโ counsel, the Michigan Attorney Generalโs Office, and non-parties Beaulieu, \nMastaw, and Popoff for filing and refusing to withdraw false affidavits.  Plaintiffs contend that the\nBeaulieu, Mastaw, and Popoff affidavits were false because they failed to disclose that on many\noccasions, Plaintiffs did not receive food items and no substitutions were provided, and Defendantsโ\ncounsel refused to withdraw the affidavits after being informed of their deficiencies.3\nRule 11 provides that by signing, filing, or submitting a pleading, written motion, or other paper,\nan attorney โcertifies that to the best of the personโs knowledge, information, and belief, formed after\nan inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,โ that, among other things, โthe factual contentions have\n2The Court recognizes that there could be a difference between what was put on a tray and what was actually\nโprovidedโ to Plaintiffs.  The Courtโs concern in this regard, however, is satisfied by the favorable step III grievance\nfindings.  Furthermore, Defendants did not raise this issue in their briefs to the Court.  See n. 4, infra..\n3The Court concludes that Plaintiffs properly complied with the notice and safe harbor provisions of Rule\n11(c)(1) and (2).\n9\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1729   Page 10 of 12\nevidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a\nreasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3).  The rule\nโauthorizes a court to impose sanctions if papers are filed containing statements that are not well-\ngrounded in fact.โ  Gentek Bldg. Prods., Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 491 F.3d 320, 332 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(citing 16 Mooreโs Federal Practice ยง 107.30[2][a][ii][A]).  The Courtโs focus, therefore, is whether the\nconduct was โobjectively unreasonableโ or whether Defendantsโ counsel lacked a reasonable basis for\nthe facts asserted in the submitted affidavits.  Montell v. Diversified Clinical Servs., Inc., 757 F.3d 497,\n510 (6th Cir. 2014).  โRule 11 sanctions are warranted if the attorneyโs conduct was unreasonable under\nthe circumstances.โ  Andretti v. Borla Performance Indus., Inc., 426 F.3d 824, 833 (6th Cir. 2005).\nInitially, the Court notes that to the extent Plaintiffs seek sanctions under Rule 11 against\nBeaulieu, Mastaw, and Popoff based on the affidavits they submitted, their motion is without merit\nbecause Rule 11 โapplies only to attorneys and unrepresented parties.โ  Manez v. Bridgestone Firestone\nN. Am. Tire, LLC, 533 F.3d 578, 591 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Fed. R. Civ. 11(a) and (c)); Stephens v.\nJones, No. CIV-10-166-D, 2011 WL 4588909, at *2 (W.D. Okla. June 3, 2011) (holding that Rule 11\ndid not apply to the filer of a special report because it was not a party to the litigation).  Because\nBeaulieu and Mastaw are not parties to the instant litigation, they are not subject to sanctions under Rule\n11.\nWith regard to Defendantsโ counsel and the Michigan Attorney Generalโs office, Plaintiffs argue\nthat the Beaulieu, Mastaw, and Popoff affidavits were fraudulent because they omitted information\nshowing that, on numerous occasions, the meals that Plaintiffs received were missing food items listed\non the Ramadan menu, for which substitute food items were not provided.  Plaintiffs further argue that\neven after they notified Defendantsโ counsel through affidavits and other court filings that the affidavits\nwere false and/or inaccurate, Defendantsโ counsel refused to withdraw the affidavits.  Plaintiffs contend\nthat Defendantsโ counsel failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry before filing the July 7, 14,\n10\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1730   Page 11 of 12\n21, and 28, 2014 submissions and affidavits because counsel should have gone beyond the information\nprovided by Aramark and consulted grievance coordinators and others to determine whether Plaintiffs\nactually received the listed food items or appropriate substitutes.\nAlthough Plaintiffsโ submissions have shown that the information contained in the Beaulieu, \nMastaw, and Popoff affidavits was incomplete and inaccurate, the Court concludes that Defendantsโ\ncounselโs reliance on the affidavits was not objectively unreasonable at the time they were filed.  In\nother words, Defendantsโ counsel could have reasonably believed that information furnished by prison\nofficials located at the particular facilities, which was in turn supplied by the Aramark food service\ndirectors at the facilities, would be reasonably accurate.  The information and documents Plaintiffs have\nprovidedโsome of which were generated after Defendants filed the Beaulieu, Mastaw, and Popoff\naffidavitsโnow shows that the information provided by Aramark was not a reliable means of verifying\nthat Plaintiffs received the listed food items or acceptable substitutes satisfying the caloric minimum\nthat the Court ordered.  In hindsight, Defendantโs counsel could have done more to ensure that the\nrepresentations to the Court were accurate.  However, in the Courtโs judgment, Plaintiffs have not shown\nthat Defendantsโ counselโs filing of the Beaulieu, Mastaw, and Popoff affidavits was unreasonable under\nthe circumstanced.4  Thus, the Court will deny Plaintiffsโ motions for Rule 11 sanctions.\nTherefore, for the foregoing reasons,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs Heardโs and Johnsonโs Motion to Hold Defendants\nin Contempt for Violating the Courtโs June 27, 2014 Order (dkt. # 124) is GRANTED.  Within thirty\n4Counselโs future reliance on information from Aramark, alone, would be unreasonable because a disconnect\nexists between the information Aramark provided and what actually occurred.  Plaintiffsโ evidence shows that for some\nreasonโperhaps carelessness by prisoner workers in preparing the Ramadan bags/traysโPlaintiffs did not receive all\nof the items of food on the Ramadan menu or adequate replacement items.  It seems that these problems could have been\neasily handled by, for example, providing a supply of food items that corrections officers could have given to Plaintiffs\nif a food item was determined to be missing.  If a โreserveโ supply were available and a prisoner could simply show that\nan item was missing and obtain a replacement, a prisoner would have a difficult time showing that he was shorted in his\nmeal. \n11\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 191 filed 05/04/15   PageID.1731   Page 12 of 12\n(30) days of the date of this Order, Defendants shall pay a total of $250 to each Plaintiff as\ncompensation for damages caused by Defendantsโ noncompliance with the June 27, 2014 Order. \nAlthough Plaintiffs Nelson and Heard did not file a separate motion to hold Defendants in contempt,\nthe Court includes an award of damages in favor of Plaintiffs Nelson and Moses because their affidavits\nprovide clear and convincing evidence that Defendants also failed to comply with the Courtโs June 27,\n2014 Order as to Plaintiffs Nelson and Moses.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Heardโs and Johnsonโs Motions to Supplement\n(dkt. ## 158, 162) are GRANTED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motions for Rule 11 Sanctions (dkt. ## 169, 175,\nand 178) are DENIED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Objection to Defendantsโ Verification Regarding\nRamadan Meals (dkt. # 115) is DISMISSED AS MOOT.\n            \nDated:  May 4, 2015               /s/ Gordon J.

(Dkt. # 204 at Page ID##1774โ75.)\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), an order that disposes of fewer than all claims\nor parties to an action โmay be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the\nclaims and all the partiesโ rights and liabilities.โ   To prevail on a motion for reconsideration, the movant\nmust โnot only demonstrate a palpable defect by which the Court and the parties have been misled, but\n[must] also show that a different disposition of the case must result from a correction thereof.โ  See\nW.D. Mich. LCivR 7.4(a).\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 212 filed 08/04/15   PageID.1820   Page 2 of 2\nPlaintiff Heard suggests that, in requiring him to support his response to Defendantsโ motion\nwith  evidence, the Court improperly shifted the burden of proof to Heard on the issue of exhaustion. \nThe Court disagrees.  Defendants bore the burden of proving that Heard failed to exhaust his Ramadan\n2011 and 2012 claims.  Heard conceded that he did not exhaust a grievance for his Ramadan 2011 claim,\nbut he argued that his grievance concerning Ramadan 2010 served to exhaust his Ramadan 2011 claim. \nAs the Court noted in its June 26, 2015 Order, as the party responding to a motion for summary\njudgment, Heard was obligated to come forward with evidence showing that a genuine issue of fact\nremained with regard to exhaustion.  This was Heardโs burden.  Nonetheless, the Court concludes that\nHeard is entitled to reconsideration of the dismissal of his Ramadan 2011 claim because, as Heard\ncorrectly points out, while Defendants disputed the effect of Heardโs grievance for Ramadan 2010, they\ndid not dispute the fact that Heard exhausted a grievance for Ramadan 2010.  In addition, Heard has\nsupported his instant motion with evidence demonstrating that he exhausted a grievance for Ramadan\n2010.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Heard has shown that his exhausted grievance for\nRamadan 2010 properly exhausted his Ramadan 2011 claim.\nTherefore,   \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Plaintiff Heardโs Motion to Alter or Amend and\nReconsider Part of June 26, 2015 Order Dismissing His 2011 Ramadan Claim (dkt. # 208) is\nGRANTED.  Plaintiff Heardโs Ramadan 2011 claim is reinstated. \nDated:  August 4, 2015               /s/ Gordon J. Quist                  \nGORDON J. QUIST\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n2",

Case No. 1:13-CV-373\nTOM FINCO, et al., HON. GORDON J. QUIST\nDefendants.\n_____________________________/\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFSโ APPEAL OF MAGISTRATE\nJUDGEโS DECEMBER 28, 2015 ORDER (ECF NO. 231)\nPlaintiffs have filed Objections to the magistrate judgeโs December 28, 2015 Order denying\nPlaintiffsโ motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n15(d), in which Plaintiffs sought to add claims relating to Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  Plaintiffsโ\nObjections are properly construed as an appeal of a pretrial order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(a),\nsubject to the โclearly erroneous or contrary to lawโ standard.  For the following reasons, the Court will\ngrant Plaintiffsโ appeal and reverse the December 28, 2015 Order.\nBackground\nOn January 12, 2015, Plaintiffs, while proceeding pro se, filed a Renewed Motion for Leave to\nFile Their First Verified Amended Civil Complaint and Supplemental Pleading pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), 15(c)(1)(A)โ(C), and 15(d).  (ECF No. 216.)  In their pro se motion,\nPlaintiffs sought to add additional claims relating to Ramadan 2011 and 2012 (violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause and conspiracy), as well as entirely new claims relating to Ramadan 2009 and\n2010โwhich preceded the date Plaintiffs filed their initial complaintโand Ramadan 2013 and\n2014โwhich arose after Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint.\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 244 filed 04/14/16   PageID.2014   Page 2 of 8\nOn July 2, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing counsel for Plaintiffs.  (ECF No. 207.) \nOn September 25, 2015, Magistrate Judge Kent entered an order denying Plaintiffsโ pending pro se\nmotion for leave to file a first amended verified complaint and to file a supplemental complaint.  (ECF\nNo. 216.)  The magistrate judge concluded that, because Plaintiffs had since been appointed counsel,\nโ[a]llowing plaintiffs to file the proposed amended complaint would defeat the assistance of counsel.โ \n(Id. at PageID.1827.)  Alternatively, the magistrate judge noted that Plaintiffs failed to explain why they\nwaited two years to seek to add claims arising from Ramadan 2009 and 2010, and he opined that\nPlaintiffsโ request to add the new claims arising from Ramadan 2013 and 2014 was essentially an\nattempt to circumvent the exhaustion requirement.  (Id. at Page ID.1827โ28.)\nOn  November  6,  2015,  Plaintiffs,  through  counsel,  filed  a  Motion  for  Leave  to  File  a\nSupplemental Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d).  (ECF No. 224.)  In support\nof their motion, Plaintiffs argued that they should be granted leave to supplement their complaint\npursuant to Rule 15(d) because their claims arose after the date they filed their original complaint and\nthey properly exhausted their 2013 and 2014 Ramadan claims, as required by the Prison Litigation\nReform Act (PLRA), prior to filing their motion to supplement.  (Id. at PageID.1858.)  Plaintiffs further\nargued  that  Defendants  would  not  be  prejudiced  by  the  supplemental  complaint.      (Id.  at\nPageID.1858โ59.)  On December 28, 2015, Magistrate Judge Kent issued an order denying the motion. \n(ECF No. 231.)  The magistrate judge concluded that denial was proper because Plaintiffs failed to\nappeal the September 25, 2015 Order denying their pro se motion to add claims for Ramadan 2013 and\n2014, as authorized by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a), and therefore Plaintiffs waived any\nalleged error in the September 25, 2015 Order.  The magistrate judge alternatively concluded that\nPlaintiffs sought the same relief they sought in their prior motion, and he had previously concluded that\nPlaintiffsโ request circumvented the exhaustion requirement.\n2\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 244 filed 04/14/16   PageID.2015   Page 3 of 8\nDiscussion\nFirst, the Court rejects the magistrate judgeโs waiver analysis because the September 25, 2015\nOrder denying Plaintiffsโ pro se motion for leave to file a first amended complaint and supplemental\npleading did not unequivocally indicate that Plaintiffsโ request to amend and/or supplement their\npleading was forever foreclosed.  While the magistrate judge cited alternate grounds for denying the\nmotion, his primary basis was that, being represented by counsel, justice did not require that Plaintiffsโ\npro se amended pleading be allowed.  Given that no Case Management Order had been issued setting\na deadline for amendment of pleadings, Plaintiffโs counsel could have reasonably understood that the\nmagistrate judgeโs statement suggested that Plaintiffs were free to seek leave to amend or supplement\nthrough counsel.  Thus, in the Courtโs judgment, Plaintiffsโ failure to appeal the September 25, 2015\nOrder did not result in a waiver of any arguments regarding exhaustion.\nThe Court also rejects the magistrate judgeโs alternative basis for denying the motionโthat\nPlaintiffsโ motion was an attempt to circumvent the exhaustion requirement by adding claims that had\nnot been exhausted prior to the filing of the original complaint.  The PLRA provides that:\nNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. ยง 1983],\nor any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional\nfacility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).  The exhaustion requirement is mandatory and applies to all suits by prisoners\nregarding prison conditions, regardless of the nature of the wrong or the type of relief sought.  Porter\nv. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S. Ct. 983, 992 (2002); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 738โ39, 121\nS. Ct. 1819, 1823โ24 (2001).  In addition, โexhaustionโ under the PLRA means โproper exhaustion,โ\ni.e., โcompliance with an agencyโs deadlines and other critical procedural rules.โ  Woodford v. Ngo, 548\nU.S. 81, 90, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 2385โ86 (2006).  \n3\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 244 filed 04/14/16   PageID.2016   Page 4 of 8\nPlaintiffs requested leave to supplement their complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 15(d), which provides that โ[o]n motion and reasonable notice, the court may, on just terms,\npermit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that\nhappened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d).  โThe purpose of\na supplemental pleading is to set out claims arising from transactions or events that happened after the\ndate of the original pleading.โ  Eidam v. Bailey, No. 1:10-CV-34, 2011 WL 2600678, at *4 (W.D. Mich.\nJune 29, 2011).  To the extent Plaintiffs seek to supplement their claims based on events that occurred\nduring Ramadan 2013 and 2014โafter they filed their original complaintโtheir motion was authorized\nunder Rule 15(d).  The magistrate judge concluded, however, that Plaintiffsโ request should be denied\nbecause it would allow Plaintiffs to circumvent the exhaustion requirement.  In light of Plaintiffsโ\nallegation in their motion that they properly exhausted Ramadan 2013 and 2014 claims prior to filing\ntheir motion to supplement, it is difficult to see how Plaintiffsโ motion could have circumvented the\nexhaustion requirement.  Moreover, Freeman v. Francis, 196 F.3d 641 (6th Cir. 1999), which the\nmagistrate judge cited, is inapplicable to the instant case.  The prisoner plaintiff in Freeman filed his\ninitial complaint before fully exhausting his administrative remedies as to the claims he asserted in his\ninitial complaint.  The court held that because โ[t]he plain language of the statute makes exhaustion a\nprecondition to filing an action in federal court[,] [t]he prisoner may not exhaust administrative remedies\nduring the pendency of the federal suit.โ  Id. at 645 (citation omitted).  In the instant case, because the\nclaims that Plaintiffs seek to assert by way of a supplemental pleading had not arisen at the time\nPlaintiffs filed their initial complaint, Plaintiffs could not have exhausted those claims prior to filing\nsuit.\nThe issue Plaintiffsโ motion presents is whether 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a) bars a prisoner from\nasserting a claim in a supplemental pleading that arose after the date of the original complaint if the\n4\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 244 filed 04/14/16   PageID.2017   Page 5 of 8\nprisoner exhausts such claim before the supplement is filed.  The Sixth Circuit has not addressed this\nprecise issue, although it has implicitly suggested that ยง 1997e(a) does not preclude supplementation\nunder Rule 15(d) in prisoner cases.  See Spies v. Voinovich, 48 F. Appโx 520, 527 (6th Cir. 2002) (noting\nthat the district court abused its discretion by failing to address the plaintiff-prisonerโs motion to\nsupplement to add a claim based on post-complaint retaliation).  In Rhodes v. Robinson, 621 F.3d 1002\n(9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit considered the interplay between supplemental pleadings and the\nexhaustion requirement under ยง 1997e(a) and concluded that new claims asserted in a supplemental\npleading are โbroughtโ within the meaning of ยง 1997e(a) at the time the supplemental pleading is filed\nand that the exhaustion requirement is satisfied so long as the prisoner exhausts the claims prior to filing\nthe supplemental pleading.  Id. at 1005.  The court observed that โCongress has never indicated . . . that\nit intended to do away with Rule 15(d) and supplemental pleadings in PLRA actions,โ id. at 1007, and\nit noted that in Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 127 S. Ct. 910 (2007), the Supreme Court โheld that the\nPLRA โdoes notโexplicitly or implicitlyโjustify deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond\nthe departures specified by the PLRA itself.โโ Id. at 1005 (quoting Jones, 549 U.S. at 214, 127 S. Ct.\nat 920).  The Rhodes court cited a โclosely analogousโ case from the Seventh Circuit, Barnes v. Briley,\n420 F.3d 73 (7th Cir. 2005), as supporting its conclusion.  In Barnes, the plaintiff, a federal prisoner,\ninitially brought claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) based on his conditions of\nconfinement.  The district court concluded that the plaintiff properly exhausted his FTCA claims and\nthereafter appointed counsel.  Subsequently, the plaintiffโs counsel determined that the plaintiffโs claims\nwere proper under ยง 1983 and filed a motion for leave to amend to substitute a claim under ยง 1983.   The\ndistrict  court  granted  the  motion,  but  subsequently  dismissed  the  plaintiffโs  ยง  1983  claims  as\nunexhausted at the time the plaintiff filed his original complaint, even though the plaintiff had exhausted\nhis claims before seeking leave to amend.  On appeal, the Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that the\n5\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 244 filed 04/14/16   PageID.2018   Page 6 of 8\nplaintiff โcomplied with the purpose and letter of the PLRA.โ  Barnes, 420 F.3d at 678.  The court\nreasoned that by completing the grievance process before seeking to amend to add his ยง 1983 claims,\nthe plaintiff satisfied the PLRA by affording the defendants an opportunity to address his grievance prior\nto filing suit.  Id.  Moreover, the court found that the district courtโs rationale (requiring exhaustion prior\nto the filing of the original complaint) required the plaintiff to โshoulder an impossible taskโto exhaust\nremedies not yet pertinent to the allegations of the filed complaint.โ  Id.  Accord Boone v. Nose, 530 F.\nAppโx 112, 113 n.1 (3d Cir. 2013) (stating that prisoners may file supplemental pleadings under the\nPLRA โif the claims in question 1) have truly accrued since the beginning of the suit and 2) are\nexhausted per 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a) before the supplement is filedโ).\nDistrict courts within the Sixth Circuit and elsewhere have also concluded that prisoners may\nsupplement their pleadings under Rule 15(d) so long as the new claims have been properly exhausted\nprior to the amendment or supplementation.  See Robbins v. Payne, No. 11-15140, 2012 WL 4812495, \nat *3 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 10, 2012) (noting that โcase law from this district and elsewhere supports the\nconclusion that 1997e(a) does not bar supplemental claims pertaining to events occurring after the action\nwas filedโ); Romano v. Secโy, DOC, No. 2:06-cv-375-FtM-29DNF, 2011 WL 1790125, at *4 (M.D. Fla.\nMay 10, 2011) (finding that the PLRA only required exhaustion of the plaintiffโs new claims at the time\nhe filed his amended complaint); Hoyt v. Rogers, No. 10-CV-10262, 2011 WL 940350, at *4โ6 (E.D.\nMich. Mar. 16, 2011) (concluding that Rule 15(d) allowed the plaintiff to supplement his complaint to\nadd new retaliation claims but denying the motion to supplement because the plaintiff failed to exhaust\nhis administrative remedies).  The Court finds these cases, as well as the Ninth Circuitโs decision in\n6\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 244 filed 04/14/16   PageID.2019   Page 7 of 8\nRhodes and the Seventh Circuitโs decision in Barnes, persuasive and concludes that the PLRA does not\npreclude supplementation under Rule 15(d) of properly exhausted claims.1  \nHaving concluded that the PLRA does not preclude Plaintiffโs motion to supplement, the Court\nnext considers whether other considerations justify denial of Plaintiffsโ motions.  The standards\napplicable to motions to amend also apply to motions to supplement.  See Spies v. Voinovich, 48 F.\nAppโx 520, 527 (6th Cir. 2002).  \nUndue delay in filing, lack of notice to the opposing party, bad faith by the moving\nparty, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, undue prejudice to\nthe opposing party, and futility of amendment are all factors which may affect the\ndecision.  Delay by itself is not a sufficient reason to deny a motion to amend.  Notice\nand substantial prejudice to the opposing party are critical factors in determining whether\nan amendment should be granted.\nWade v. Knoxville Utils. Bd., 259 F.3d 452, 458โ59 (6th Cir. 2001) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).  In their response, Defendants argued that Plaintiffsโ motion should be denied because\nit is untimely, was filed in bad faith, and is unduly prejudicial to Defendants.  Defendantsโ arguments\nare unpersuasive.  Plaintiffs did not delay in seeking to add their Ramadan 2013 and 2014 claims.  Their\nfirst motion was denied without prejudice because it was signed by fewer than all Plaintiffs, (ECF. No.\n161), and their second motion was denied because Plaintiffs were represented by counsel.  Plaintiffs\nhave thus been diligent in seeking to add their new claims.  Moreover, Defendants have not shown bad\nfaith.  Plaintiffs are seeking to add claims that arose after they filed their initial complaint.  Nothing\nindicates that Plaintiffs are seeking to circumvent the Courtโs prior rulings.  Defendants also fail to show\n1The Court in Mattox v. Edelman, No. 12-13762, 2016 WL 398242 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 12, 2006), report and\nrecommendation adopted, 2016 WL 945340 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 14, 2016), reached the opposite conclusion, based largely\non the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Cox v. Mayer, 332 F.3d 422 (6th Cir. 2003).  However, Cox, which addressed the Rule\n15(d) issue in dicta, does not address the present circumstances.  After filing his complaint, the plaintiff in Cox was\nparoled.   The plaintiff failed to properly exhaust his claims but argued that he could cure his failure to exhaust by\nsupplementing his pleadings to allege that exhaustion did not apply to him because he was no longer a prisoner.  Cox,\n332 F.3d at 428.  The court stated that the plaintiff could not use Rule 15(d) to avoid ยง 1997e(a)โs exhaustion\nrequirement.  Unlike Cox, Plaintiffs in the instant case properly exhausted most of their claims in their initial complaint. \nThus, there was no need to cure failure to exhaust through supplementation. \n7\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 244 filed 04/14/16   PageID.2020   Page 8 of 8\nsubstantial prejudice.  Plaintiffsโ claims for 2013 and 2014 essentially mirror their claim for prior years,\nand ample time remains under the Case Management Order for Defendants to conduct discovery and\nfile dispositive motions on these claims.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will sustain Plaintiffsโ Objections to (appeal of) the\nDecember 28, 2015 Order and grant Plaintiffs leave to file their supplemental complaint.\nTherefore,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the magistrate judgeโs December 28, 2015 Order (ECF No.\n231) denying Plaintiffsโ Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Complaint is REVERSED.

The Sixth Circuit affirmed, stating in pertinent part:\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2385   Page 2 of 20\nThe defendants argue that there is no clearly established law requiring that\nprisoners receive a specific number of calories per day, here between 1,000 and 1,500\ncalories. But  it  is  clear that a prisoner has the clearly established right  to a\nnutritionally adequate diet.  See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994).  And\nit is clear that a diet consisting of 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day can violate that\nright.  Welch v. Spaulding, No. 14-2050, 2015 WL 5729466, at *4-5 (6th Cir. Sept.\n30, 2015).  For reasons of their own, the defendants did not submit evidence about\nthe 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts, instead accepting that the prisoners were only\ngiven between 1,000 and 1,500 calories per day during those years.  That number of\ncalories, the prisoners allege, caused dizziness, weakness, dehydration, hunger pains,\nand loss of weight. These allegations establish a genuine issue of material fact\nregarding whether the plaintiffsโ restricted diets during the Ramadan fasts violated\na clearly established right of which a reasonable officer would have known.  Id.; see\nByrd v. Wilson, 701 F.2d 592, 595 (6th Cir. 1983) (per curiam).  While it is not clear\nto us whether the plaintiffs can receive relief on both their First and Eighth\nAmendment claims, at this point both can go forward.\nHeard v. Finco, No. 14-2195 (6th Cir. Dec. 21, 2015), slip op. at p. 4 (docket no. 229, PageID.1921).\nThe Court later allowed plaintiffs to file a supplemental complaint, which expanded\ntheir cause of action to include additional claims for Ramadan 2013 and 2014 for violations of the\nFirst  Amendment,  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment, and Civil Conspiracy.  See Supplemental Compl. (docket no. 245); Order (docket no.\n244).  Finally, the RLUIPA claims have been dismissed.  See Order of partial dismissal (docket no.\n287).  This matter is now before the Court on plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment (docket no.\n281) and defendant Tom Finco and Brad Purvesโ motion for partial summary judgment (docket no.\n288).\nII. Legal standard\nโThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ \n2\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2386   Page 3 of 20\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).   Rule 56 further provides that a party asserting that a fact cannot be or is\ngenuinely disputed must support the assertion by:\n(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions,\ndocuments, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations\n(including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory\nanswers, or other materials; or \n(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a\ngenuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\nsupport the fact. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).\nIn Copeland v. Machulis, 57 F.3d 476 (6th Cir. 1995), the court set forth the partiesโ\nburden of proof in a motion for summary judgment:\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of establishing an absence of evidence to\nsupport the nonmoving partyโs case.  Once the moving party has met its burden of\nproduction, the nonmoving party cannot rest on its pleadings, but must present\nsignificant probative evidence in support of the complaint to defeat the motion for\nsummary judgment. The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence to support\nplaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury\ncould reasonably find for the plaintiff. \nCopeland, 57 F.3d  at 478-79 (citations omitted).  โIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the\ncourt views the factual evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\nparty.โ  McLean v. 988011 Ontario Ltd., 224 F.3d 797, 800 (6th Cir. 2000).\nIII. Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment\nA. Eighth Amendment and First Amendment claims\nIn their complaint, plaintiffs seek relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, which confers\na private federal right of action against any person who, acting under color of state law, deprives an\nindividual of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution or federal laws.   Burnett\n3\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2387   Page 4 of 20\nv. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 45 n. 3 (1984);  Stack v. Killian, 96 F.3d 159, 161 (6th Cir.1996).  To state\na ยง 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege two elements: (1) a deprivation of rights secured by the\nConstitution and laws of the United States, and (2) that the defendant deprived him of this federal\nright under color of law.  Jones v. Duncan, 840 F.2d 359, 360-61 (6th Cir. 1988); 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\nIn the context of prison conditions, the Eighth Amendmentโs Cruel and Unusual\nPunishment Clause โforbids conditions that involve the โwanton and unnecessary infliction of pain,โ\nor are โgrossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.โโ Hadix v. Johnson, 367 F.3d 513, 525\n(6th Cir. 2004), citing Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981). โTo succeed in an Eighth\nAmendment challenge, [p]laintiff must establish that (1) a single, identifiable necessity of civilized\nhuman existence is being denied (objective prong) and (2) the defendant prison official acted with\na sufficiently culpable state of mind.โ  Hadix, 367 F.3d at 525, citing Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294,\n298 (1991).  \nWith respect to the objective prong, โ[t]he contemporary standards of civilized\ndecency that currently prevail in society determine whether conditions of confinement are cruel and\nunusual.โ  Hadix, 367 F.3d at 525, citing Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 346.  Extreme deprivations are\nrequired and only deprivations denying โthe minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessitiesโ are\ngrave enough to create a violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  Hadix, citing\nHudson v. McMcillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9 (1992) and quoting Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 347.  โHarsh and\nuncomfortable prison conditions do not automatically create such a violation.โ  Hadix, 367 F.3d at\n525.  To establish an Eighth Amendment claim based upon an alleged inadequate diet, plaintiffs\nmust demonstrate that they were denied โthe minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities.โ  Sims\n4\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2388   Page 5 of 20\nv. Michigan Department of Corrections, 23 Fed. Appx. 214, 216 (6th Cir. 2001), citing Rhodes, 452\nU.S. at 347 and Cunningham v. Jones, 667 F.2d 565, 566 (6th Cir.1982).  \nThe subjective prong requires that the defendant acted with deliberate indifference\nto an inmateโs health or safety.  See Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 302-03 (1991).  To establish the\nsubjective component, the plaintiff must show that โthe official knows of and disregards an excessive\nrisk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.โ\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  Mere negligence does not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation.  Id.\nat 835. โIt is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that characterize the\nconduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.โ  Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312,\n319 (1986).\nThe First Amendment โprohibits governments from โabridging the freedom of speechโ\nand โprohibiting the free exerciseโ of โreligion.โโ  Ward v. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 732 (6th Cir. 2012). \nThe core of the guarantee of the First Amendment right to freely exercise oneโs religious beliefs is\nthe right to practice any religion privately.  See Walker v. Mintzes, 771 F.2d 920, 930 (6th Cir. 1985). \nโ[T]he circumstances of prison life may require some restriction on prisonersโ exercise of their\nreligious beliefs.โ  Id. at 929.  Nevertheless, prisoners have both โa constitutional right to meals that\nmeet their nutritional needsโ and โa constitutional right to be served meals that do not violate their\nsincerely-held religious beliefs.โ  Robinson v. Jackson, 615 Fed. Appx. 310, 314 (6th Cir. 2015),\nciting Colvin v. Caruso, 605 F.3d 282, 290 (6th Cir.2010).\n5\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2389   Page 6 of 20\nB. Discussion\nThe gist of plaintiffsโ motion is that they are entitled to summary judgment on their\nEighth and First Amendment claims because:  (1) they had a constitutional right to receive more than\n1,500 calories per day during the Ramadan fast in 2011 and 2012; (2) based on previous rulings in\ndocket nos. 22, 59 and 122, โthis Court found that the Sixth Circuit had established that the\nminimum calories to be provided to prisoners were between 2,400 to 2,600 caloriesโ; (3) this Court\npreviously deemed 2,350 to 2,594 calories per day to be sufficient; and, (4) plaintiffs are entitled to\nsummary judgment on both their constitutional claims because they received only about 1,600\ncalories per day during Ramadan 2011 and 2012.\nPlaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment should be denied.   As an initial matter, the\nSixth Circuit has not established a minimum number of calories to be served to a prisoner,\nexplaining in Colvin, 605 F.3d 282 that:\nThis court has previously held that โprison administrators must provide an\nadequate diet without violating the inmate's religious dietary restrictions.โ  Alexander\nv. Carrick, 31 Fed.Appx. 176, 179 (6th Cir.2002).  โIf the prisoner's diet  .  .  .  is\nsufficient to sustain the prisoner in good health, no constitutional right has been\nviolated.โ  Id.\nColvin, 605 F.3d at 290.  \nRather than adopting a specific number of calories, the Sixth Circuit has recognized\nthat the adequacy of a religious diet presents a multi-faceted issue of fact:\nIn Colvin, we held that it was clearly established in the First Amendment\ncontext that โprison administrators must provide an adequate diet without violating\nthe inmate's religious dietary restrictions.โ  605 F.3d at 290 (quoting Alexander v.\nCarrick, 31 Fed.Appx. 176, 179 (6th Cir.2002)).  A number of other circuits have\nsimilarly recognized that โ[i]nmates .  .  .  have the right to be provided with food\nsufficient to sustain them in good health that satisfies the dietary laws of their\nreligion.โ  McElyea v. Babbitt, 833 F.2d 196, 198 (9th Cir.1987); see also Nelson v.\n6\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2390   Page 7 of 20\nMiller, 570 F.3d 868, 879-80 (7th Cir.2009); Kind v. Frank, 329 F.3d 979, 981 (8th\nCir.2003).   In Colvin, a prison chaplain mistakenly refused the plaintiff's application\nfor a kosher diet; as a result, the prisoner was limited to eating only fruit for 16 days. \nColvin, 605 F.3d at 291.   While noting that the case โpresents a clos[e] call regarding\nwhether Colvin received food sufficient to sustain him in good health,โ we ultimately\ngranted the chaplain qualified immunity because Colvin failed to point to any\nevidence that the chaplain acted unreasonably or knowingly, and the chaplain\nโworked as quickly as possible to ensure that Colvin received kosher mealsโ once the\nmistake was discovered.  Id.  (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn Cunningham I [Cunningham v. Jones, 567 F.2d 653, 656-59 (6th Cir.\n1977)], a prisoner in solitary confinement was given only one meal per day for 15\ndays.  In the absence of any proof as to the calorie count of that meal, we could not\ndetermine whether this one meal per day โwas sufficient to maintain normal healthโ\nso as to comply with the Eighth Amendment, and remanded the case to the trial court\nto determine the nutritional content of that meal.  Cunningham I, 567 F.2d at 660. \nAlthough Judge Edwards's opinion observed that โsedentary men on the average need\n2000 calories or more to maintain continued health,โ id. at 657, it did not clearly\nestablish a minimum caloric requirement.  On appeal after remand, the jail cook\nestimated that the caloric content of the single meals was between 2,000 and 2,500\ncalories.  Cunningham v. Jones, 667 F.2d 565, 566 (6th Cir.1982) (Cunningham II). \nOn that evidence, we affirmed the district court's dismissal of the claim, finding that\n2,000 to 2,500 calories per day โwas sufficient to maintain normal health for the 15\ndays involved.โ  Id.\n[Plaintiff prisoner] had a clearly established right to a nutritious diet during\nRamadan.  While we should avoid โdefin[ing] clearly established law at a high level\nof generality,โ Plumhoff, 134 S.Ct. at 2023, we also decline to define nutritional\nadequacy  in  the  First  Amendment  context  in  terms  of  specific  daily  caloric\nrequirements. This is because nutritional adequacy is a multi-factored concept.\nAccordingly, the question of whether a prison official has knowingly provided a\nnutritionally inadequate diet is a fact-specific inquiry that requires consideration of,\ninter alia, daily caloric content, duration of the diet, and the nutritional needs of the\nprisoner. \nWelch v. Spaulding, 627 Fed. Appx. 479, 482-83 (6th Cir. 2015), cert. denied (U.S. Oct. 3, 2016).\nAs discussed, plaintiffs previously alleged that they received 1,000 to 1,500 calories\nper day during Ramadan 2011 and 2012. In support of their motion, plaintiffs rely on their\nallegations and the Sixth Circuitโs statement that based on these allegations, โ[I]t is clear that a\n7\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2391   Page 8 of 20\nprisoner has the clearly established right to a nutritionally adequate diet. .  .   And it is clear that a\ndiet consisting of 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day can violate that right.โ  Heard, No. 14-2195, slip\nop. at p. 4 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs also rely on the deposition of defendant Purves, in which he\nstated that prisoners were being provided โthe equivalent of two meals worth of caloriesโ per day\n(docket no. 282, PageID.2231), that lunch calories were not being provided to prisoners fasting for\nRamadan (id.), and that the average daily calorie intake at the MDOC was roughly 2,600 calories\n(id.).  In addition, plaintiffs rely on the deposition testimony of MDOC dietician Barbara Anderson. \n Although Dietician Anderson never calculated how many calories were on the breakfast and dinner\nmenus for Ramadan, she did testify that from 2010 through 2014, prisoners participating in Ramadan\nโwere required to get the same calorie intake as a general population inmate.โ  Anderson Dep.\n(docket no. 281-5, PageID.2214-2215).\nIn response to this motion, defendants rely on the affidavit of another dietician,\nPatricia Willard, and other deposition testimony of Dietician Anderson.  In her affidavit, Ms. Willard\nstated  that  she  has  been  a  registered  dietician  for  the  MDOC  for  30  years,  and  that  her\nresponsibilities include โevaluating prisoners with medical nutritional concerns, recommending and\ncounseling prisoners in nutritional care plans, writing therapeutic diet menus, recommending and\nevaluating the medical necessity of a therapeutic diet order and providing technical assistance to the\nMDOC Food, Service program and Health Care staff in the area of medical nutritional therapy.โ \nWillard Aff. (docket no. 294-5, PageID.2322-2323).  In 2011 and 2012, the MDOC used a tool\nknown as โNutrionist Proโขโ [sic] software to assist in menu development.  Id. at PageID.2323. \nAccording to Dietician Willard, this software, which was developed in 1982, provides โa thorough\nanalysis of diets, menus and recipes,โ and is used in several states to assist in planning nutritional\n8\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2392   Page 9 of 20\n(including Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, New York and Illinois).  Id.  Dietician Willard further stated\nthat:\nI have evaluated the 2011and 2012 Statewide Standard Ramadan Menus and\ndetermined the menus failed to meet the estimated caloric needs per the 2010 Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans.  The 2010 Dietary Guidelines indicate an estimated\ncalorie need of 2000 calories to 2800 calories for sedentary to moderately active men,\n19 years to 51+ years of age.  The 2011 Ramadan menu provided a range of 1767 to\n1810 calories per day, based on a two-week average.  The 2012 Ramadan menu\nprovided an average of 1756 calories per day, based on a two-week average.  \nId.  Defendants also refer to other deposition testimony by Dietician Anderson that the daily number\nof calories the MDOC reportedly provided during Ramadan 2011 (i.e., 1803 calories for 30 days)\nโwould be sufficient for many prisonersโ and  provided during Ramadan 2012 (i.e., 1756 calories\nfor 28 to 30 days) would not be harmful to โ[m]ost people eating that number of calories.โ  Anderson\nDep. (docket no. 294-6, PageID.2326).\nIn order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment, each of the four plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate that defendants Finco and Purves knowingly provided them a nutritionally inadequate\ndiet.  See Welch, 627 Fed. Appx. at 483.  While plaintiffs have presented some evidence with respect\nto meals provided during Ramadan 2011 and 2012, questions of fact exist with respect to each\nplaintiffโs daily caloric content,  the duration of the diet, and their nutritional needs during that time. \nId.  In this regard, the Court notes that plaintiffs have not established the threshold issue of the\ncalories they received during Ramadan 2011 and 2012.  Accordingly, plaintiffsโ motion for summary\njudgment should be denied.  \n9\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2393   Page 10 of 20\nIV. Defendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment\nDefendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment is limited to the allegations in\nplaintiffsโ supplemental complaint regarding Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  See Defendantsโ Brief\n(docket no. 289, PageID.2254).\nA. Qualified immunity\nDefendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on the affirmative\ndefense of qualified immunity.  Under this affirmative defense, โgovernment officials performing\ndiscretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct\ndoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known.โ  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  The dispositive question is\nwhether the violative nature of the particular conduct at issue in the lawsuit is clearly established. \nSee Mullenix v. Luna, -- U.S. --, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308 (2015). โA right is clearly established only if\nits contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\nviolates that right.โ  Carroll v. Carman, -- U.S. --, 135 S. Ct. 348, 350 (2014).  โIn other words,\nexisting precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.โ  Id. \nThus, the doctrine of qualified immunity โgives government officials breathing room to make\nreasonable but mistaken judgments, and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.โ  Carroll, 135 S. Ct. at 350.  \nWhen a defendant raises the issue of qualified immunity on summary judgment,\nโ[t]he ultimate burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the defendant is not entitled to\nqualified immunity.โ  Gardenhire v. Schubert, 205 F.3d 303, 311 (6th Cir. 2000).  Although the\nplaintiff bears the ultimate burden, โ[t]he defendant bears the initial burden of coming forward with\n10\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2394   Page 11 of 20\nfacts to suggest that he acted within the scope of his discretionary authority during the incident in\nquestion.โ  Id.  Once this is accomplished, โthe burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish that the\ndefendantโs conduct violated a right so clearly established that any official in his position would have\nclearly understood that he was under an affirmative duty to refrain from such conduct.โ  Id.  To meet\nhis burden on summary judgment, a plaintiff must show (1) that a constitutional right was violated,\nand (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the violation. Chappell v. City Of\nCleveland, 585 F.3d 901, 907 (6th Cir. 2009).  The court may exercise its discretion to decide which\nprong of the test to address first in light of the circumstances of the case.  Bishop v. Hackel, 636 F.3d\n757, 765 (6th Cir 2011), citing Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232-33 (2009).\n1. Plaintiffsโ  claims  under  the  Eighth  and  First\nAmendments\nDefendants contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity because the law was\nnot clearly established such that reasonable officials in defendantsโ positions would believe that\nproviding prisoners with 2,350 calories a day for 30 days violated their First and Eighth Amendment\nrights during Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  As discussed in ยง III.B., supra, the Constitution does not\nmandate a minimum daily caloric content for inmates.  However, this Court did conclude that the\n2013 Ramadan meal plan which provided prisoners โbetween 2,350 and 2,594 calories per dayโ was\nโsufficient  to  satisfy  Defendantsโ  constitutional  obligation  to  provide  Plaintiffs  with  a  diet\nnutritionally adequate for the maintenance of normal health.โ  Order of Clarification (docket no. 22). \nDefendants have provided an affidavit from Dietician Willard that the 2013 Ramadan menu\nโprovided a range of 2361 to 2618 calories per day, based on a two-week average,โ and that the 2014\n11\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2395   Page 12 of 20\nRamadan menu โprovided a range of 2711 to 2721 calories per day, based on a two-week average.โ \nWillard Aff. at PageID.2283.  \nPlaintiffs contend that there is an issue of fact regarding the sufficiency of the calories\nthey received.  Heard testified that he lost weight during Ramadan 2013,  and that he had โsimilar\nsymptomsโ as described during Ramadan 2011 and 2012 of dizziness, feeling lethargic and hunger\npains.  Heard Dep. (docket no. 298-1, PageID.2357).  Heard experienced the same symptoms during\nRamadan 2014.  Id. at PageID.60.  Johnson testified that during Ramadan 2013, he suffered from\nโ[h]eadaches, dizziness  .  .  .  faint, weakness, and not being able to work out.โ  Johnson Dep.\n(docket no. 298-1, PageID.2362).  Johnson also stated that he lost ten pounds during Ramadan 2014,\nand suffered from โheadaches, dizziness, weakness, [and] a lack of energy.โ  Id. at PageID.2363. \nMoses testified that during Ramadan 2013 he lost 18 pounds since the last time he had been weighed\nin February 2013, and suffered from dizziness and headaches.  Moses Dep. (docket no. 298-1,\nPageID.2365, 2368).  Moses also testified that during Ramadan 2014 he suffered from weight loss\nand dizziness.  Id. at PageID.2366.  Nelson testified that during Ramadan 2013 he lost 10 to 15\npounds and suffered from dizziness.  Nelson  Dep. (docket no. 298-1, PageID.2371).  Finally, Nelson\ntestified that in Ramadan 2014, he lost โclose to 30 pounds,โ apparently due to the amount of fruits\nand vegetables in the menu, and that he suffered from hunger pains, โheadaches, nausea, dizziness,\n[and] lacking a pleasant experience that came with Ramadan  .  .  .โ  Id. at PageID.2373-2375.  Based\non this testimony, plaintiffs claim their symptoms during Ramadan 2013 and 2014 were similar to\ntheir symptoms experienced during Ramadan 2011 and 2012, even though they were receiving, on\naverage, significantly more calories per day in 2013 and 2014.  Whether the amount of calories\nprovided in 2013 and 2014 was sufficient presents an issue of fact to be decided by the jury.\n12\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2396   Page 13 of 20\nDefendantsโ qualified immunity claim is based upon the fact that the calories\nprovided in 2013 and 2014 exceeded the amount of calories found to be sufficient in the Courtโs July\n13, 2013 Order of Clarification.  The undersigned disagrees.  The Courtโs Order of Clarification\nreferred to a minimum number of calories to be provided per day.  In this regard, the Courtโs April\n29, 2014 Order for contempt stated in pertinent part:\n1. Defendants violated this Courtโs July 13, 2013 Order of Clarification\non  several  occasions  during  the  2013  Ramadan  observance  by\nproviding Plaintiffs with fewer than 2350 calories each day, contrary\nto Defendantsโ own representations to the Court;\n2. The Courtโs May 13, 2010 was clear and unambiguous in requiring\nDefendants to provide Plaintiffs 2350 calories per day[.]\nOrder of Contempt (docket no. 70).  \nIn an affidavit executed prior to the contempt order, Mr. Purves stated that during\nRamadan 2013, โ[t]he calorie counts provided by Nutritionist Proโข show an average daily count\nof 2,361.246 calories per day.โ  Purves Aff. (docket no. 25-3, PageID.234).  The Court notes that this\nis consistent with the Menu Template Report, which states that the โAvg. Daily Kcalsโ was\n2361.246.  Menu Template Report (docket no. 25-3, PageID.235).  While the average daily calorie\ncount exceeded the 2,350 calories per day deemed sufficient by the Court, the actual calorie count\nfor certain days fell below that minimum amount (see, e.g., Tuesday Week 1 (2146.785 calories),\nThursday  Week  1  (2243.915  calories),  and  Saturday  Week  1  (2160.465  calories)).    Id.  at\nPageID.237-238.  Given this record, defendants cannot rely on the daily amount of calories cited in\nthe Courtโs Order of Clarification, because the evidence presented by defendants did not establish\nthat they provided at least 2,350 calories during each day of Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  Rather,\ndefendantsโ evidence presented for Ramadan 2013 and 2014 established that the MDOC provided,\n13\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2397   Page 14 of 20\non average, at least 2,350 calories per day as calculated over a two-week period.  See Willard Aff.\nat PageID.2283.\nGenuine disputes of material fact preclude an entry of summary judgment on a\ndefense of qualified immunity.  King v. Taylor, 694 F.3d 650, 664 (6th Cir. 2012).  See Bletz v.\nGribble, 641 F.3d 743, 749 (6th Cir. 2011) (โif genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether\nthe officer committed acts that would violate a clearly established right, then summary judgment is\nimproperโ).  Accordingly, defendantsโ motion should be denied  with respect to plaintiffsโ Eighth\nand First Amendment claims arising from Ramadan 2013 and 2014.\n2. Plaintiffsโ claim under the Equal Protection Clause\nDefendants also contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity because the law\nwas not clearly established such that reasonable officials in defendantsโ positions would believe that\nproviding prisoners with 2,350 calories a day for 30 days would violate their rights under the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Based on this record, the Court concludes that\ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the Equal Protection claim, because no\nconstitutional right was violated.  The Equal Protection Clause provides that a state may not โdeny\nto any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, ยง\n1.  โThe Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination by government which either burdens a\nfundamental right, targets a suspect class, or intentionally treats one differently than others similarly\nsituated without any rational basis for the difference.โ  Loesel v. City of Frankenmuth, 692 F.3d 452,\n461 (6th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, plaintiffsโ Equal Protection claim is based upon allegations that they were\ntreated differently than similarly situated Jewish prisoners:\n14\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2398   Page 15 of 20\n85. During Jewish Passover and Seder, prisoner participants receive\nadequate meals that are prepared in accordance with their dietary\nregimen.\n86. Defendants did not reduce Jewish fast participantsโ menu below\ncivilized norms.\n87. Defendants discriminated against Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs are\nMuslim, in violation of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution\nduring the 2013 and 2014 Ramadan.\nPlaintiffsโ Supplemental Compl. (docket no. 245, PageID.2030).\nIn Small v. Secretary Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, 592 Fed. Appx. 62\n(3d Cir. 2014), the Court rejected a similar Equal Protection claim raised by a Muslim prisoner,\nconcluding in that case that the plaintiff (Small) failed to demonstrate that Muslim inmates observing\nRamadan were similarly situated to Jewish inmates observing two one-day fasts:\nโThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .  .  .  is essentially a\ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.โ  City of\nCleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87\nL.Ed.2d 313 (1985).  As such, we found no equal protection violation in DeHart v.\nHorn, 390 F.3d 262, 272 (3d Cir.2004), because the plaintiff, a Buddhist inmate,\nfailed to prove that he was similarly situated to Muslim and Jewish inmates regarding\nhis religious dietary restrictions.  DeHart was not similarly situated because his\nproposed diet imposed a greater burden on the prison than Muslim and Jewish\ninmates' diets.  Id.  Thus, although the prison treated DeHart differently, it did not\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause.\nThe same is true here.  The two Jewish fasting days Small identified are not\ncomparable to Ramadan.  As the Magistrate Judge noted, Ramadan is much longer,\ninvolves more logistical challenges, and ends with a communal feast.  Therefore,\ninmates seeking to participate in Ramadan are not similarly situated to inmates\nseeking to participate in the Jewish fasting days, and the prison did not violate the\nEqual Protection Clause by treating such inmates differently.  Under DeHart,\nsummary judgment for the defendants was appropriate.\nSmall, 592 Fed. Appx. at 64 (3d Cir. 2014).\n15\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2399   Page 16 of 20\nThe reasoning in Small is applicable here.  In their supplemental complaint, plaintiffs\nallege that Ramadan โis not a fast in the sense of not eating for 30 consecutive days,โ that they  โfast\nduring daylight hours of the Arabic Lunar month of Ramadan,โ that they โabstain[] from food and\nliquid during daylight hours,โ and that the โ[o]nce the sun sets, Muslims consume an adequate meal\nthat meets the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.โ    Suppl. Civil Compl. at PageID.2022-2023.  As\nan initial matter, Passover does not involve this type of fast.  The dietary restriction for an observant\nJew during Passover involves not eating khametz (e.g., breads, cakes and pasta) for seven days.1 \nWith respect to fasting, Judaism includes two major fast days2 and additional minor fast days.3  The\nfact that both Jews and Muslims observe fast days does not make them similarly situated. As the\ndistrict court in Small aptly noted, โ[t]o say that the two observances are similarly situated because\nboth involve fasts is simplistic.โ  Small v. Wetzel, No. 3:12-CV-83, 2014 WL 295714 at *2 (W.D.\nPa. Jan. 24, 2014), affirmed 592 Fed. Appx. 62 (3d Cir.).  Other courts have concluded that Muslim\ninmates and Jewish inmates were not similarly situated for purposes of Equal Protection claims\nsimply because they had distinctive religious diets which involved fasting or dietary restrictions. \nSee, e.g., Robinson v. Jackson, No. 1:14-CV-115, 2014 WL 4988152 at *5 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 6, 2014),\n1 โBread products [khametz] are forbidden during all eight days of the holiday (seven days in Israel). \n.  .  Khametz is any foodstuff containing flour that has fermented (such as breads, cakes, and pasta), and\ndough made from wheat, barley, rye, spelt, and oats.โ  Rabbi Joseph Telushkin, Jewish Literacy at 642\n(1991).\n2 โOn the โmajorโ fast days, Yom Kippur and Tisha Be-Av  .  .  ., food is forbidden from the eve of\nthe fast day to the following evening.โ Telushkin, supra, at 657-58.\n3  โThe minor fast days do not commemorate โminorโ events in Jewish history.  They are called minor\nbecause they are only halfday fasts; food is forbidden only from dawn till evening.โ  Telushkin, supra, at\n657-659.  โ[T]he three minor fasts associated with the Templeโs destruction are kept only by very observant\nJews.โ  Id. at 658-59.  โAnother minor fast falls on the day preceding Purim.โ  Id. at 659.  โA final fast is\nobligatory for only a small percentage of Jews, firstborn children who are males.  .  .  This day is called,\nlogically enough, the Fast of the First-born, and it is observed the day before Passover.โ  Id. \n16\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2400   Page 17 of 20\naffirmed 615 Fed. Appx. 310 (6th Cir. 2015) (where plaintiff prisoner alleged that the defendant\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause โby granting kosher meals to Jewish inmates while denying\nHalal meals to Muslim inmates,โ the court rejected the claim in part stating โthese classes of inmates\n(Jewish v. Muslim) are not similarly situated because they differ greatly in numberโ) (emphasis in\noriginal); Hearn v. Kennell, No. 07-1235, 2009 WL 3460455 at *6 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 22, 2009),\naffirmed, 433 Fed. Appx. 483 (7th Cir. 2011) (โ[T]he plaintiff [a Muslim inmate] is not similarly\nsituated to the Jewish inmates.  The dietary restrictions of Muslims are not the same as those of the\nKosher diet for Jewish inmates.  Accordingly, different steps must be taken to accommodate the\nvarious dietary restrictions.โ).\nFurthermore, plaintiffs do not present any reasoned argument to support their claim\nthat a Muslim inmate observing Ramadan is similarly situated to a Jewish inmate observing Passover\nor a fast day.  Rather, plaintiffs present cursory arguments which refer to the calories which they\nbelieve are provided to โthe regular prison population, including Jewish prisonersโ during Ramadan:\nUsing the rational basis test, there is no legitimate reason to provide the regular\nprison population, including Jewish prisoners, 2,600 calories daily while Plaintiffs\nreceived approximately 2,350 calories daily or less during Ramadan 2013 and 2014. \nIt would not have burdened Defendants to provide the same 2,600 calories daily to\nPlaintiffs during Ramadan 2013 and 2014.  Furthermore, Defendants have failed to\nstate a legitimate reason as to why Plaintiffs should have received 2,350 calories\ndaily or less instead of the 2,600 calories provided to all other prisoners.\nPlaintiffsโ Response (docket no. 298, PageID.2346).  In summary, plaintiffs have not demonstrated\nthat defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The absence of a constitutional violation\nentitles defendants to qualified immunity on this claim.  See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 232-33; Bishop,\n636 F.3d at 765.\n17\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2401   Page 18 of 20\n3. Plaintiffsโ claims  against  defendant  Purves for\nRamadan 2014\nDefendant Purves seeks qualified immunity with respect to plaintiffsโ claims for\nRamadan 2014 because he did not have the requisite personal involvement to be liable under 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1983.  Although defendants have raised this claim in the context of qualified immunity, it\nappears to the Court that the doctrine of qualified immunity does not address Mr. Purvesโ claim that\nhe lacked personal involvement in Ramadan 2014.  By its very nature, the doctrine of qualified\nimmunity involves personal involvement because the doctrine โgives government officials breathing\nroom to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,โ Carroll, 135 S. Ct. at 350, while โperforming\ndiscretionary functions,โ  Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818.  Nevertheless, Mr. Purves is entitled to summary\njudgment for any claims arising in Ramadan 2014 due to his lack of personal involvement.  \nโPersonal involvement is necessary to establish section 1983 liability.โ  Murphy v.\nGrenier, 406 Fed. Appx. 972, 974 (6th Cir. 2011).  โIt is axiomatic that the liability of persons sued\nin their individual capacities under section 1983 must be gauged in terms of their own actions.โ \nRogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999).  Here, there is no evidence that Mr. Purves was\ninvolved in any decisions made with respect to Ramadan 2014.  At his deposition, Purves testified\nthat his position as Food Service Program Manager was eliminated on December 7, 2013.  Purves\nDep. (docket no. 289-3, 2275).  Since that time, he has been employed as the administrative assistant\nto the chief medical officer for the Bureau of Health Care Services.  Id. at PageID.2274.  There is\nno evidence that Mr. Purves played any role in the meals provided in Ramadan 2014, which began\non June 28, 2014, more than six months after his position of Food Service Program Manager was\neliminated  See Plaintiffโs Notice to correct error (docket no. 89); Purves Dep. at PageID.2275. \n18\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2402   Page 19 of 20\nAccordingly, defendant Purves is entitled to summary judgment with respect to all claims arising\nfrom Ramadan 2014.\nB. Civil conspiracy claim\nFinally, defendants seek summary judgment on plaintiffsโ civil conspiracy claim.  โA\ncivil conspiracy under ยง 1983 is an agreement between two or more persons to injure another by\nunlawful action.โ  Bazzi v. City of Dearborn, 658 F.3d 598, 602 (6th Cir. 2011).\nExpress agreement among all the conspirators is not necessary to find the existence\nof a civil conspiracy. Each conspirator need not have known all of the details of the\nillegal plan or all of the participants involved. All that must be shown is that there\nwas a single plan, that the alleged coconspirator shared in the general conspiratorial\nobjective, and that an overt act was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy that\ncaused injury to the complainant.\nHooks v. Hooks, 771 F.2d 935, 943-44 (6th Cir. 1985).  Conclusory allegations of a conspiracy are\nnot sufficient to state a claim under ยง 1983.  See Gutierrez v. Lynch, 826 F.2d 1534, 1538 (6th\nCir.1987).\nDefendants contend that โ[t]he Plaintiff [sic] failed to make any specific allegations\nagainst the Defendants in either 2013 or 2014.โ  Defendantsโ Brief (docket no. 289, PageID.2265). \nSee Guitierrez, 826 F.2d at 1538.  However, defendants do not address the allegedly defective\nallegations or point out how those allegations fail to meet the pleading requirements for a civil\nconspiracy claim.  In their reply brief, defendants present conclusory statements (e.g., โ[t]he\nPlaintiffs utterly failed to show that the Defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy,โ โ[t]he Plaintiffs\nmust plead a civil conspiracy with particularity,โ and โ[t]he Plaintiffs have done nothing more than\nmake vague allegations as to the alleged civil conspiracyโ).  Defendantsโ cursory briefing fails to\naddress the legal issue of whether plaintiffs alleged the necessary elements of a civil conspiracy\n19\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 302 filed 11/04/16   PageID.2403   Page 20 of 20\nunder ยง 1983. โ It is not sufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in a most skeletal way,\nleaving the court to  . . . put flesh on its bones.โ  McPherson v. Kelsey, 125 F.3d 989, 995-96 (6th\nCir. 1997).  This being said, the Court concludes that there could be no civil conspiracy between\ndefendants Finco and Purves related to Ramadan 2014 because, as discussed in ยง IV.A.3, Mr. \nPurves was not the Food Service Program Manager during Ramadan 2014.  Accordingly, defendantsโ\nmotion should be denied with respect to Ramadan 2013 and granted with respect to Ramadan 2014.\nV. Recommendation\nFor the reasons set forth above, I respectfully recommend that plaintiffsโ motion for\nsummary judgment (docket no. 281) be DENIED.\nI further recommend that defendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment (docket\nno. 288) be GRANTED with respect to plaintiffsโ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims against\ndefendant Purves arising from Ramadan 2014, GRANTED with respect to plaintiffsโ Fourteenth\nAmendment Equal Protection claims arising from Ramadan 2013 and 2014, GRANTED with\nrespect to plaintiffsโ civil conspiracy claim arising from Ramadan 2014,  and DENIED in all other\nrespects.\nDated:  November 4, 2016 /s/ Ray Kent                                                  \nRAY KENT\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be served and filed with the Clerk\nof the Court within fourteen (14) days after service of the report.

Plaintiff Anthony Nelson (Nelson) is incarcerated in the custody of MDOC. He is \ncurrently located at Lakeland Correctional Facility, 141 First Street, Coldwater, MI., \n49306, prison number 210771.  \n5.  Defendant Thomas Finco is Deputy Director of MDOC. He is personally responsible for \napproving religious menus between the years 2011 to present.  \n6.  Defendant Brad Purves is a retired MDOC Food Service Manager. Between the years \n2010-2014, his responsibilities included preparing Ramadan menus, advising and \nmanaging Ramadan meal plans, and determining how much calories, nutrition, and food \nMuslim Ramadan participants received. \n7.  Both Defendants are sued as to the 2013 and 2014 claims in their individual capacities \n8.  Each defendant acted under the color of law during the entire relevant time period.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n9.  Plaintiffs Heard, Johnson, Moses, and Nelson (herein known as โPlaintiffsโ) are Muslim \nand members of the protected class; the Nation of Islam Prison Reform Ministry.  \n10.  The Plaintiffs sincerely held beliefs are found in the Holy Qurโan, the divine scriptures of \nthe Muslims.  \n11.  One of the tenets of Plaintiffs sincerely held beliefs mandates that they fast during the \ndaylight hours of the Arabic Lunar month of Ramadan.  \n12.  Ramadan was the month the Holy Qurโan was revealed to Prophet Muhammad, and is a \nHoly month in Islamic Jurisprudence. \n13.  The โfastโ is not a fast in the sense of not eating for 30 consecutive days.  \n(cid:2) (cid:4)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 3. 2o0f 2131      PPaaggee I3D o.1f 81619\n14.  A Ramadan fast means abstaining from food and liquid during the daylight hours. \n15.  Once the sun sets, Muslims consume an adequate meal that meets the Dietary Guidelines \nfor Americans, recommended caloric and nutritional intake levels for their age group and \nactivity level, and civilized norms.  \n16.  The fast also include[s] the achievement of a blessed experience. \n17.  During Ramadan, Muslims seek spiritual bliss and brotherhood; read the entire Holy \nQurโan; maintain a peaceful mindset and God consciousness and oneness with Allah, and \ngood physical health. \n18.  Mental, physical, and spiritual health goes hand in hand in Islam. A Muslim cannot have \none without the other.  \n19.  Plaintiffs expected Defendants to provide them with adequate meals that met the Dietary \nGuidelines for Americans between 2013-2014, as well as Plaintiffsโ โactiveโ to \nโmoderateโ lifestyles and age bracket. However, these expectations were not met.  \n20.  Plaintiffs know of no actual MDOC Ramadan policy. Ramadan is instituted based on the \nprison official in office. Thus, Plaintiffs use the nomenclature โcustom and policyโ to \ndescribe Defendantsโ procedure and treatment of Plaintiffs during previous Ramadans. \n21.  It is the custom and policy of MDOC to post a pre-Ramadan notice in housing units, \ninforming Muslims how to sign-up to participate in Ramadan and the Ramadan eating \nschedule.  \n22.  MDOCโs custom and policy is to provide a fast observant with a pre-dawn meal and a \npost-sunset meal during Ramadan. \n23.  Once the person notifies the designated prison official- usually the Chaplain- of his \nintentions to participate in the fast, that personโs name is compiled with a list of other fast \n(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 4. 2o0f 2141      PPaaggee I4D o.1f 81710\nparticipants. The list is subsequently posted in each housing unit, food service, and \nfacility control center.  \n24.  Once Ramadan starts, participants are given an itinerary, which regulates the times they \ncan enter the dining hall to receive their pre-dawn and post-sunset meals. \n25.  The itinerary specifically denies them access to the dining hall to receive their normal \nlunch meal.  \n26.  If a Ramadan participant enters the dining hall during lunch and accepts the meal, he will \nreceive a misconduct and an administrative hearing to determine if he should be removed \nfrom the Ramadan list. \n27.  An adequate meal, according to the MDOC โOffender Mealโ policy directive is a daily \nmeal that meets the Dietary Reference Caloric Values as approved by the National \nResearch Council and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  \n28.  Each facility Food Service Director had the option to make his or her own Ramadan \nmenu or follow the statewide menu. If the statewide menu did not meet civilized norms, \nFood Service Directors would add more calories and nutrition to the menu.  \n29.  Prior to 2009, MDOC custom and policy was to provide both Jewish and Muslim \nprisoners with adequate meals for the holidays that included fasting, such as Seder and \nRamadan. \n30.  Plaintiffs have personal knowledge of this because they have been participating in \nRamadan since the 1990โs while incarcerated in MDOC, plus during those times, they \nwere employed by the MDOC Food Service Department.  \n(cid:2) (cid:6)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 5. 2o0f 2151      PPaaggee I5D o.1f 81711\n31.  After 2008, the former MDOC Deputy Director Straub, approved the reduction of \nRamadan observant meals, based on MDOC dietician Anderson and Purvesโ \nrecommendations. He then reduced Ramadan meals by two-thirds of civilized norms.  \n32.  Also, he did that, despite the fact that in 2001 MDOC settled in Hudson-Bey v. Martin \nCase No. No. 1:00โcvโ389 (Order) (May 23, 2002) (Enslen, J.) (docket no. 51โ1). In \nHudson-Bey, the Court held that providing Muslims with less than 2,000 kcals per day \nduring Ramadan violates both the First and Eight Amendments. \n33.  Also, the change included mandating all Food Service Directors follow the statewide \nmenu and prohibited adding additional food, even if the daily calories did not meet \ncivilized norms.  \n34.  However, that restriction and custom change was not placed on Jewish holiday menus \nthat were made to accommodate daily fasts.  \n35.  In or around 2010, Deputy Director Straub appointed Defendant Purves-former MDOC \nFood Service Manager- to enforce MDOC Ramadan custom and policy.  \n36.  Plaintiffs notified Deputy Director Straub and Defendant Purves that the meals were \ninadequate and contained food items that Plaintiffs were prohibited to eat, such as bean \nburgers, turkey ham and certain beans.  \n37.  Deputy Director Straub and Purves not only provided inadequate meals, they also put \nfood items on the menu that they knew Muslims were prohibited to eat. \n38.  Plaintiffs also requested to enter the dining hall to package their lunch meal to eat after \nsunset to compensate for the inadequate meals.  \n39.  Defendants responded with a no, telling Plaintiffs, โYou chose to fast, thus you have to \nstay restricted to the statewide Ramadan meals.โ  \n(cid:2) (cid:7)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 6. 2o0f 2161      PPaaggee I6D o.1f 81712\n40.  Furthermore, Defendants Finco and Purves claimed the menu met national norms.  \n41.  If the Plaintiffs had not learned how to count calories, they would not have known the \nRamadan meals did not meet civilized norms.  \n42.  Defendants were aware of the facts that Plaintiffs were being fed between 1,000 โ 1,500 \ndaily during Ramadan from 2009 through 2013 when the original complaint was filed. \n43.  Defendants were aware that this practice of not providing the equivalent of three meals a \nday at Ramadan had been the practice of the MDOC for years. \n44.  Defendant Purvis needed the approval of Defendant Finco to provide such limited \nnumber of calories to Muslim during Ramadan. \n45.  After learning Defendants had deceived Plaintiffs regarding the adequacy of Ramadan \nmeals, Plaintiffs filed the original civil action against Defendants Finco and Purves, and \nrequested a Preliminary Injunction mandating Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with \nadequate meals during Ramadan.  \n46.  Before the Court granted the injunction, Defendants Finco and Purves added another \nthird of food to the menu and MDOC Dietician Anderson misrepresented to the Court \nthat the Ramadan menu met civilized norms.  \n47.  In March of 2014, the Court found Defendants did not comply with the Courtโs order and \nheld Defendants in contempt.  \n48.  Defendants Finco and Purves instructed subordinates not to comply with the Court Order, \nthus denying Plaintiffs adequate meals during Ramadan 2013 and 2014. \n49.  Defendants basically robbed Plaintiffs of their Ramadan experience. \n50.  Each inadequate meal took Plaintiffsโ focus off the objectives of the fast. \n(cid:2) (cid:8)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 7. 2o0f 2171      PPaaggee I7D o.1f 81713\n51.  Defendantsโ acts in effect pressured the Plaintiffs to break the fast. Plaintiffs felt like they \nwere in a David vs. Goliath situation.   \n52.  Plaintiffs held hate in their hearts against Defendants and prison staff. Prison staff would \nlaugh at Plaintiffs saying, โIf you want to eat an adequate meal, stop fasting.โ \n53.  During Ramadan, instead of studying the words of God and communing with God, \nPlaintiffsโ focus was diverted instead toward filing complaints, grievances, researching \ncase law and maintaining their health. \n54.  Plaintiffs were depressed and suffered mental anguish, spiritual deprivation, and \nhumiliation.  \n55.  Physically, they were dizzy, suffered significant weight loss, migraine headaches, hunger \npains, fatigue and decrease in mental alertness -among other symptoms.  \nCAUSES OF ACTIONS FOR RAMADAN 2013 and 2014 \nFIRST AMENDMENT AND RLUIPA CLAIM \n56.  Plaintiffs Re-incorporate the above Paragraphs. \n57.  Defendants Finco and Purves were personally involved in substantially burdening \nPlaintiffsโ exercise of religion by requiring them to abandon precepts of religion in order \nto survive during the 2013 and 2014 Ramadan.  \n58.  Defendant Purves authored the Ramadan menus and managed the operation of Ramadan. \n59.  Defendant Purves knew that some of the food items he placed on the menus for Ramadan \nviolated the dietary laws of Plaintiffsโ faith and that Plaintiffs would not eat such items. \n60.  Defendant Purves knew that the menu contained inadequate daily calories and nutrition, \nand thus, would make Plaintiffs upset and take Plaintiffs out of the spirit of fasting, and \n(cid:2) (cid:9)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 8. 2o0f 2181      PPaaggee I8D o.1f 81714\ntherefore deteriorate Plaintiffsโ health. The menus provided approximately 1,000-1,500 \nkcals per day.  \n61.  Defendant Finco approved Ramadan menus and mandated each facility to abide by the \nsame menu, without deviation.  \n62.  Defendant Finco knew the menu had false representations and was inadequate, which \nwould make Plaintiffs angry and take Plaintiffs out of the spirit of fasting.  \n63.  Plaintiffs filed complaints, grievances, and proposals to MDOC dietician Anderson and \nDefendants Finco and Purves, notifying them of the negative impact the Ramadan \ncustoms, policies, and menus were having on Plaintiffsโ exercise of religion. \n64.  Defendants responded, โNo change will be made to the Ramadan menuโ, and instructed \nsubordinates not to add food to the menu.  \n65.  These actions by the Defendants caused Plaintiffs to be depressed and pressured them to \nthink about discontinuing Ramadan.  \n66.  This pressure caused the Plaintiffs to be taken out of the spirit of fasting.  \n67.  Thus, because of Defendants actions, Plaintiffs were taken out of the spirit of fasting and \nPlaintiffs lost the concentration, peace of mind, etc. and grew hatred toward prison staff. \n68.  Defendants burdened the practice of Plaintiffsโ faith and inhibited the free exercise of \ntheir religion during Ramadan.  \n69.  Defendants placed a substantial burden on the practice of the religious beliefs of the \nPlaintiffs. \n70.  The Plaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies.  \n71.  Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity, see Welch v. Spaulding, Case No. 14-\ncv-2050, --Fed.Appx. -- (6th Cir. Sept. 30, 2015) (unpublished). \n(cid:2) (cid:10)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 9. 2o0f 2191      PPaaggee I9D o.1f 81715\n EIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM \n72.  Defendants Finco and Purves denied Plaintiffs adequate meals during 2013 and 2014 \nRamadan. \n73.  During a normal day in prison, prisoners receive breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. \n74.  During Ramadan, fast participants are prevented from entering the dining hall during \nlunch to receive a lunch meal.  \n75.  If Plaintiffs had entered the dining hall, they would have received a misconduct. \n76.  Thus, during Ramadan, Defendants deny Plaintiffs their normal lunch meal. \n77.  The meal calories and nutrients are not made-up in other meals.  \n78.  Plaintiffs have filed complaints, grievances and proposals requesting to package their \nlunch meal for eating after sunset, since the statewide Ramadan menu is inadequate.  \n79.  Defendants Finco and Purves responded โnoโ claiming MDOC Dietician Anderson, \nstated the menu is sufficient, since Plaintiffs chose to fast.  \n80.  Defendants inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs are \nMuslims. \n81.  Almost every day of Ramadan each of the Plaintiffs suffered from different level of \nhunger due to the low level of calories that were provided each day. \n82.  As a result of Defendantsโ action, Plaintiffs were subjected to both physical and mental \npain. \n83.  Defendantsโ actions have caused significant injury to Plaintiffsโ emotional, mental and \nphysical health during the 2013 and 2014 Ramadan.  \nEQUAL PROTECTION \n84.   Plaintiffs Re-incorporate the above Paragraphs. \n(cid:2) (cid:11)(cid:2)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 1.02 0o3f 01 1   P  aPgaeg e1I0D o.1f 81716\n85.  During Jewish Passover and Seder, prisoner participants receive adequate meals that are \nprepared in accordance with their dietary regimen.  \n86.  Defendants did not reduce Jewish fast participants menu below civilized norms.  \n87.  Defendants discriminated against Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs are Muslim, in violation of \nthe 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution during the 2013 and 2014 Ramadan.  \nCIVIL CONSPIRACY \n88.  Plaintiffs Re-incorporate the above paragraphs. \n89.  Defendants had a meeting of the minds regarding the insufficient Ramadan menus for \n2013 and 2014 Ramadan. \n90.  It was at that time Defendants Finco and Purves agreed to provide Muslims with less \ncalories and nutrition than MDOC policy regulates and constitutional norms demand. \n91.  Defendants did deprive Plaintiffs of adequate meals through their Ramadan policy. \n92.  Neither Defendant Finco nor Purves abandoned the conspiracy, or exposed it.   \n93.  These Defendants did conspire for the purpose of depriving Plaintiffs of privileges and \nrights secured by the United States Constitution in violation of 42 USC ยง 1983. \nWHEREFORE, this Court should grant the following relief to the Plaintiffs: \n1.  Grant a declaratory judgment that Plaintiffsโ rights were violated during the 2013 \nand 2014 Ramadan. \n2.  Award Plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages. \n3.  Award attorneysโ fees and costs.  \n4.  Award any other relief that this Courts find is just and equitable. \n \n(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:12)\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:133-c-cvv-0-000337733-G-GJJQQ-R-RSSKK     E ECCFF N Noo. .2 22445-1 f iflieledd 0 141/1/046/1/165     P PaaggeeID 1.12 0o3f 11 1   P  aPgaeg e1I1D o.1f 81717\nRespectfully submitted, \ns/ Daniel E.

Case No. 1:13-CV-373\nTOM FINCO, et al., HON. GORDON J. QUIST\nDefendants.\n_____________________________/\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING\nPLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nPro se Plaintiffs Lamont Heard, William Johnson, Jamero Moses, and Anthony Nelson are\nprisoners incarcerated with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) at Lakeland Correctional\nFacility.  Plaintiffs allege that they are practicing Muslims and that, as part of their adherence to their\nreligion, they fast from dawn until sunset each day during the Islamic month of Ramadan, which lasts\nfor 29 to 30 days.  (Compl. ยถยถ 15, 17, 41.)  During the fasting hours, Muslims are required to refrain\nfrom consuming food, drinking liquids, and engaging in certain activities.  (Id. ยถ 21.)  They may resume\neating and drinking after sunset until dawn the following day.  (Id. ยถ 22.)  Plaintiffs state that during\nRamadan, โMuslims seek spiritual bliss, brotherhood and read the entire Holy Qurโan throughout the\nmonth.  Muslims [sic] mind-set is of peace and oneness with Allah (GOD).  There is no other alternative\nfor this once a year experience.โ  (Id. ยถ 20.)\nPlaintiffs allege that during past Ramadan observances, the MDOC has provided Muslim\nprisoners who choose to fast two meals per dayโone before sunrise and one after sunset.  (Id. ยถ 23.) \nPlaintiffs allege that these meals, which are served either as bagged meals or in the dining hall, provide\nonly approximately 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day and therefore do not meet the MDOCโs mandated\n2,900 calorie per day requirement for prisoners.  (Id. ยถยถ 25, 26.)  Plaintiffs claim that as a result of the \nreduced caloric intake during Ramadan, they became physically weak, lost weight, experienced hunger\npains, and had a less fulfilling religious experience.  (Id. ยถ 30.)  Plaintiffs allege that they complained\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 21 filed 07/08/13   PageID.177   Page 2 of 5\nabout the insufficient nutrition offered to Muslims during Ramadan, but prison officials rejected their\ngrievances, stating that a fast is by definition a lower caloric intake and that Muslim prisoners who\nchoose to fast elect to consume fewer calories.  (Id. ยถยถ 31, 34.)  Plaintiffs have sued MDOC Deputy\nDirector Tom Finco, MDOC Special Activity Coordinator Mike Martin, and MDOC Food Service\nManager Brad Purves, alleging that their refusal to accommodate Plaintiffsโ requests for adequate meals\nbefore the start and at the end of the daily fast during Ramadan violated their rights under the First and\nEighth Amendments, as well as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.\nPlaintiffs have now filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (dkt. #14) seeking an order\nrequiring Defendants to provide Plaintiffs adequate meals and nutrition during Ramadan 2013, which\ncommences July 8, 2013 and concludes August 7, 2013.  Pursuant to the Courtโs June 19, 2013 Order,\nDefendants have filed a Response.  For the following reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiffsโ motion.\nโA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be granted only if the\nmovant carries his or her burden of proving that circumstances clearly demand it.โ  Overstreet v.\nLexington-Fayette Urban Cnty. Govโt, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002).  Moreover, because Plaintiffs\nseek injunctive relief against prison officials concerning a matter of prison administration, this Court\nis required to proceed with the utmost care and must recognize the unique nature of the prison setting. \nKendrick v. Bland, 740 F.2d 432, 438 n.3 (6th Cir. 1984).\nIn ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction, a court considers four factors: โ(1) whether\nthe plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm\nin the absence of an injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others;\nand (4) whether the issuance of the injunction is in the public interest.โ  Mich. State AFL-CIO v. Miller,\n103 F.3d 1240, 1249 (6th Cir. 1997).  These are factors to be balanced, not prerequisites that must be\nmet.  See Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1099 (6th Cir. 1994).  A district court need not make\n2\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 21 filed 07/08/13   PageID.178   Page 3 of 5\nspecific findings on each of the four factors if fewer factors are dispositive of the issue.  See In re\nDeLorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, 1229 (6th Cir. 1985).\nIn the instant case, Court need not address all of the factors because Plaintiffs have failed to\ndemonstrate irreparable harm.  The Supreme Court has emphasized that a plaintiff seeking injunctive\nrelief must do more than show that irreparable harm is merely possible.  Rather, โplaintiffs seeking\npreliminary relief [must] demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.โ \nWinter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22, 129 S. Ct. 365, 375 (2008).  In evaluating the\nharm that will occur depending on whether preliminary injunctive relief is granted, courts consider three\nfactors: (1) the substantiality of the injury alleged; (2) the likelihood of its occurrence; and (3) the\nadequacy of the moving partyโs proof.  Mich. Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog,\n945 F.2d 150, 154 (6th Cir. 1991) (citing Ohio ex rel. Celebrezze v. Nuclear Regulatory Commโn, 812\nF.2d 288, 290 (6th Cir. 1987)).  Moreover, โ[w]hen courts consider irreparable harm, the key word . .\n. is irreparable, and the possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available\nat a later date . . . weighs heavily against [the] claim.โ  Brake Parts, Inc. v. Lewis, 443 F. Appโx 27, 32\n(6th Cir. 2011) (internal quotations and alterations omitted).\nIn their Response, Defendants note that, contrary to Plaintiffโs assertion, MDOC Policy Directive\n04.07.100, titled โOffender Meals,โ does not specify a minimum caloric meal value.  Defendant Purves\nexplains in his affidavit that the MDOCโs Statewide Standard Menu provides prisoners 2,600 calories\nper day.  (Purves Aff. ยถ 4, Defs.โ Resp. to Pls.โ Mot. Ex. 2.)  According to Purves, the MDOC sets its\ncaloric intake level based on Dietary Reference intake values approved by the National Research\nCouncil (NRC).  (Id. ยถ 3.)  The NRC recommends a daily caloric intake of 2,600 to 2,800 for moderately\nactive men in their 20s; a daily caloric intake of 2,400 to 2,600 for moderately active men in their 30s\nand 40s; and a daily caloric intake of 2,200 to 2,400 for moderately active men after 50.  (Id.)  The\n3\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 21 filed 07/08/13   PageID.179   Page 4 of 5\nMDOC specifies 2,600 calories per day because that number meets the needs of 95% of male prisoners\nin the general population.  (Id. ยถ 4.)  Purves states that all Plaintiffs are between 36 and 46 years of age. \n(Id.)  Thus, when Plaintiffs are moderately active, a daily caloric intake of between 2,400 to 2,600\ncalories meets their recommended caloric intake.\nPurves also states that the Ramadan meal plan Plaintiffs attach to their Motion is not the meal\nplan that will be used for the 2013 Ramadan observance.  Instead, the 2013 meal plan offers four\ndifferent meal options to prisoners who choose to fast, and provides a daily caloric content ranging from\n2,350 to 2,594 calories.  (Id. ยถ 6.)  Purves also confirms that a registered dietician with the MDOC has\ndetermined that a daily caloric intake of 2,350 to 2,594 calories will not pose a health risk to healthy,\nmoderately active males.  (Id. ยถ 7.)\nIn light of the information set forth in Purvesโs affidavit, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate\nthat they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief.  First, Plaintiffsโ motion is based\non an out-of-date meal plan that will not apply to the 2013 Ramadan observance.  Second, Defendants\nhave shown that the meal plan for the 2013 Ramadan observance provides between 2,350 and 2,594\ncalories per day, which substantially meets the recommended calorie requirements for most moderately\nactive prisonersโdefined as โโa lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking about 1.5\nto 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the light physical activity associated with\ntypical day-to-day life.โโ (Purves Aff. ยถ 3 (quoting 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans).)  Third,\nPlaintiffs wholly fail to show that they will suffer any harm from a slight reduction in their daily caloric\nintake during the 30-day Ramadan observance.  As Defendants note, because Ramadan is a time of\nconstant prayer and reflection, it is questionable wether an observant Muslim would be deemed\nmoderately active during Ramadan.  Finally, to the extent Plaintiffs seek additional food during\n4\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 21 filed 07/08/13   PageID.180   Page 5 of 5\nRamadan, they may purchase it from the prison store, as they have done in the past.  (Defs.โ Br. Resp.\nPls.โ Mot. Ex. 3.)\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to show that they will likely suffer irreparable\nharm absent injunctive relief.   Therefore,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffโs Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Motion to\nPost Security for Preliminary Injunction (docket no. 14) is DENIED.\nDated: July 8, 2013               /s/ Gordon J.

Case No. 1:13-CV-373\nTOM FINCO, et al., HON. GORDON J. QUIST\nDefendants.\n________________________/\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION\nFOR RECONSIDERATION\nPlaintiffs request that the Court reconsider that portion of its March 31, 2014 Memorandum\nOrder Adopting in Part and Rejecting in Part Report and Recommendation (dkt. # 59) dismissing their\nEighth Amendment claim.  To prevail on a motion for reconsideration, the movant must \"not only\ndemonstrate a palpable defect by which the Court and the parties have been misled, but [must] also show\nthat a different disposition of the case must result from a correction thereof.\"  See W.D. Mich. LCivR\n7.4(a).  Having reviewed Plaintiffsโ motion, the Court concludes that reconsideration is warranted.  \nIn concluding that Plaintiffs failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim, the Court analogized\nthe circumstances in this case to those presented in Mobley v. Smith, No. 4:05-cv-153, 2007 WL\n1650934 (W.D. Mich. June 4, 2007).  The court in Mobley concluded that the plaintiff failed to state an\nEighth Amendment claim because the plaintiff was not denied food, but instead elected to eat only some\nof the food that he was provided because of his religious preferences.  See id. at *6.  Applying Mobleyโs\nreasoning, this Court concluded that Plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment claims fail because Plaintiffs were\ndenied a nutritionally-adequate diet only because they chose to participate in the Ramadan fast.  In other\nwords, Defendants provided Plaintiffs an adequate diet though the regular prison diet, but Plaintiffs\nchose not to eat it due to their religious practices.  (Dkt. # 59 at Page ID#709.)\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 122 filed 08/15/14   PageID.1110   Page 2 of 3\nPlaintiffs contend that Mobley is distinguishable from this case because the plaintiff in Mobley\nrejected the nutritionally-adequate food that he was provided, whereas in this case Plaintiffs did not\nreject the food they were given; instead, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to provide them \nadequate  food  as  part  of  the  Ramadan  menu.    The  Court  agrees.    Mobley  involved  different\ncircumstances because the plaintiff in Mobley declined to eat some of the food he was given, while in\nthis case, Plaintiffs allege that they were not provided adequate food in the first instance.  Assume, for\nexample, that Plaintiffs suffered from a medical condition that required them to have a special medical\ndiet.  The availability of the regular prison diet would provide no defense to an Eighth Amendment\nclaim for failing to provide a proper medical diet.  See Byrd v. Wilson, 701 F.3d 592, 595 (6th Cir. 1983)\n(per curiam) (recognizing Eighth Amendment liability for failing to provide a prescribed medical diet). \nPlaintiffsโ circumstances are not materially different.  Plaintiffsโ religious practices require that they\nrefrain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset each day during Ramadan.  Defendants may not\ndefend an Eighth Amendment claim simply by pointing to the availability of the regular prison diet,\nbecause Plaintiffs would have been required to break the Ramadan fast, contrary to their religious\npractices, in order to eat the regular diet that was served during the day.  Thus, just as a prisoner with\na medical condition requiring a special diet should not be expected to consume a regular diet, a prisoner\nshould not be expected to violate his religious beliefs or practices in order to obtain nutritionally-\nadequate food.   Moreover, Plaintiffsโ allegation that they received only between 1,000 and 1,500\ncalories per day during the entire 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts alleges sufficiently serious deprivations\nof adequate food for purposes of an Eighth Amendment claim.  Hudson-Bey v. Martin, No. 1:00-CV-389\n(W.D. Mich.) (5/23/02 Order & Partial J., dkt. # 51-1.); see also Berry v. Brady, 192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th\nCir. 1999) (โThe Eighth Amendment requires that inmates be provided well-balanced meals, containing\nsufficient nutritional value to preserve health.โ) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \n2\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 122 filed 08/15/14   PageID.1111   Page 3 of 3\nTherefore,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motion for Reconsideration and Relief From\nMemorandum Order Adopting in Part and Rejecting in Part Report and Recommendation (dkt. # 73)\nis  GRANTED, and Plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment claim is reinstated.\nDated:  August 15, 2014               /s/ Gordon J.

Case No. 1:13-CV-373\nTOM FINCO, et al., HON. GORDON J. QUIST\nDefendants.\n_____________________________/\nORDER ADOPTING IN PART AND REJECTING IN\nIN PART 3/27/15 REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\nOn March 27, 2015, Magistrate Judge Hugh Brenneman issued a Report and Recommendation\n(R & R) recommending that the Court grant Defendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment based\non lack of exhaustion.  In particular, the magistrate judge recommended that the Court dismiss all\nPlaintiffsโ Ramadan 2011 claims and Plaintiff Nelsonโs Ramadan 2012 claim for lack of exhaustion.\nWith regard to Plaintiff Heardโs Ramadan 2011 claim, the magistrate judge rejected Heardโs\nargument that his 2010 grievance concerning Ramadan 2010 also exhausted his Ramadan 2011 claim. \n(R & R at 4โ5.)  With regard to Plaintiff Johnson, the magistrate judge noted that Defendants established\nthat Johnson failed to exhaust a grievance for Ramadan 2011, and Johnson admitted such fact.  Plaintiffs\nMoses and Nelson were in a different position than Plaintiffs Heard and Johnson because Moses and\nNelson had not signed the response.  (Dkt. # 85 at Page ID#860.)  Therefore, the magistrate judge\nrefused to consider the statements that Plaintiffs Heard and Johnson made on behalf of Plaintiffs Moses\nand Nelson.  (R & R at 6 nn. 3, 4.)  The magistrate judge found that Moses failed to exhaust a grievance\nfor Ramadan 2011 and that, while Nelson exhausted a grievance through Step III for Ramadan 2011,\nhe did not name any Defendant in this action in his grievance.  (Id.) \n\nFinally, with regard to Ramadan 2012, the magistrate judge concluded that Plaintiffs Heard,\nJohnson, and Moses had exhausted their claims, but Plaintiff Nelson did not exhaust his claim.\nIn response to the R & R, Plaintiffs have filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure 11(a) and 15(c) to resubmit their response to Defendantโs motion for partial summary\njudgment, which all Plaintiffs have now signed.  In addition, all Plaintiffs have signed and submitted\na partial Objection to the R & R.  Finally, Plaintiff Nelson has filed his own Objection to the R & R with\nregard to his Ramadan 2011 claim.\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1), upon receiving objections to a report and recommendation,\nthe district judge โshall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified\nproposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.โ  After conducting a de novo review\nof the R & R, Plaintiffsโ Objections, and the pertinent portions of the record, the Court concludes that\nthe R & R should be adopted in part and rejected in part.  In addition, the Court will grant Plaintiffsโ\nmotion to resubmit their fully-signed response to Defendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment.\nPlaintiffsโ Motion to Resubmit Their Response \nHaving reviewed Plaintiffsโ motion to resubmit their response to Defendantsโ motion for partial\nsummary judgment, that is now signed by all Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that the motion should be\ngranted.  In their response, Plaintiffs concede that Plaintiffs Johnson and Moses did not exhaust a\ngrievance through Step III for Ramadan 2011 and that such claims should be dismissed.  Therefore,\nJohnsonโs and Mosesโs Ramadan 2011 claims will be dismissed.\nPlaintiffsโ Objections\nI. Ramadan 2011โPlaintiff Heard\nPlaintiff Heard contends that, although he did not exhaust a grievance for Ramadan 2011, the\nmagistrate judge erred in concluding that Heardโs grievance for Ramadan 2010 did not exhaust his claim\n2\n\nfor Ramadan 2011.  The magistrate judge concluded that Heardโs Ramadan 2010 grievance could not\nhave exhausted his claim for Ramadan 2011 because the violation that occurred during Ramadan 2011\nwas a discrete event that required Heard to identify the particular MDOC employees responsible for the\nviolation, the date of the occurrence, and the alleged wrongful conduct.  Heard contends that the 2011\nRamadan violation resulted from a continuation of the same policy (providing Ramadan observants \nsignificantly fewer calories than what they received on the regular diet) that caused the violation for\nRamadan 2010.  Heard thus contends that because the Ramadan 2011 violation resulted from the\napplication of the same unconstitutional policy, he was not required to file a new grievance.  In support\nof his contention, Heard relies on Ellis v. Vadlamudi, 568 F. Supp. 2d 778 (E.D. Mich. 2008), and\nJohnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503 (5th Cir. 2004), both of which the Sixth Circuit discussed in Siggers\nv. Campbell, 652 F.3d 681 (6th Cir. 2011).\nIn Siggers, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated his First Amendment rights by\nimproperly rejecting his incoming mail on several occasions.  The Sixth Circuit held that the plaintiffโs\nfiling of a single September 16, 2006 grievance was insufficient to exhaust claims relating to several\nprevious mail rejections that occurred many months before the grievance was filed and that the\ngrievance was also insufficient to exhaust mail rejections that occurred after the plaintiff filed the\ngrievance.  Siggers, 652 F.3d at 690.  Citing both Ellis and Johnson, the plaintiff argued that his\ngrievance put the defendants on notice of a continuing violation.  The Sixth Circuit distinguished both\ncases.  It noted that the plaintiff in Ellis complained of the defendantsโ deliberate indifference in failing\nto treat his chronic medical condition that caused pain, and that the defendantsโ alleged failure to treat\nthe plaintiffโs โongoing medical conditionโ was not โone discrete harm-causing act by the government.โ \nId. at 692โ93.  In contrast to Ellis, the Sixth Circuit said that each of the mail rejections of which Siggers\ncomplained was a discrete event that required a separate grievance.  Id. at 693.  The Sixth Circuit noted\n3\n\nthat the Fifth Circuitโs decision in Johnson was distinguishable because the plaintiff in that case alleged\nthat the defendants failed to protect him from repeated sexual assaults that occurred over the course of\neighteen months.  The Sixth Circuit noted that the plaintiff in Johnson complained of a single\ngovernment failure (to protect the plaintiff) and that his grievance โproperly sufficed to exhaust\nsubsequent harms because the government was put on notice of its failure, and any subsequent grievance\nfiled would have complained of the exact same government failing.โ  Id.  The Sixth Circuit found that\nthe subsequent violations that Siggers alleged were not based on a single government failure, because\ntwo of the three subsequent violations were based on different MDOC policy directives than the\nviolation alleged in the plaintiffโs sole grievance.  Id.\nIn the Courtโs judgment, Plaintiffsโ claims in this case are not based on discrete events, but\ninstead upon Defendantsโ alleged policy of providing Ramadan observers significantly fewer calories\nin the Ramadan diet than they would have received in the regular diet.  In other words, as the Court\nunderstands  Plaintiffsโ claims, the injury they claim resulted from an MDOC-wide policy that\nsignificantly reduced the calories that Ramadan observers received rather than from discrete deviations\nthat occurred from prison to prison.  This fact renders the instant case more like Johnson rather than\nSiggers, because Plaintiffsโ claims for each Ramadan celebration arise from โa single government\nfailure.โ  Siggers, 652 F.3d at 693; see also Turley v. Rednour, 729 F.3d 645, 650 (7th Cir. 2013) (โIn\norder to exhaust their remedies, prisoners need not file multiple, successive grievances raising the same\nissue (such as prison conditions or policies) if the objectionable condition is continuing.โ).\nAlthough the Court disagrees with the magistrate judge that Heardโs 2010 grievance could not\nhave exhausted his 2011 claim, the Court nonetheless concludes that the magistrate judge did not err\nin recommending dismissal.  As the party opposing Defendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment,\nHeard was obligated to produce evidence showing that he actually exhausted a grievance for Ramadan\n4\n\n2010.  See Plant v. Morton Intโl, Inc., 212 F.3d 929, 934 (6th Cir. 2000) (noting that after the moving\nparty carries its initial burden on summary judgment, โ[t]he burden then shifts to the nonmoving party\nto come forward with evidence showing that there is a genuine issue [of material fact].โ).  Heard failed\nto attach copies of his 2010 grievance through Step III to Plaintiffsโ initial response, to Plaintiffsโ motion \nto resubmit their response, or to Plaintiffsโ partial Objection.  Moreover, although not obligated to do\nso, the Court searched the record for evidence pertaining to Heardโs 2010 grievance, but it found no\nsuch evidence.  Accordingly, Heard failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact that he exhausted his Ramadan 2011 claim.\nII. Ramadan 2011 and 2012โPlaintiff Nelson\nPlaintiff Nelson contends that the magistrate judge erred in concluding that Nelson failed to\nexhaust his claims for Ramadan 2011 and 2012.  The Court agrees.\nWith regard to Ramadan 2011, the magistrate judge noted that while Nelson did exhaust a\ngrievance through Step III for Ramadan 2013, he did not name any Defendant in this case in the\ngrievance.  While such failure would normally be a basis for concluding that the prison failed to\nproperly exhaust his claim, Nelson notes that prison officials addressed his grievance through all steps\nwithout enforcing the rule requiring the grievant to identify the individuals involved in the issue.  As\nthe Sixth Circuit has observed, โ[w]hen prison officials decline to enforce their own procedural\nrequirements and opt to consider otherwise-defaulted claims on the merits, so as a general rule will we.โ \nReed-Bey v. Pramstaller, 603 F.3d 322, 325 (6th Cir. 2010).  Thus, because the MDOC failed to enforce\nits own rules in considering Nelsonโs grievance and instead ruled on the merits, Defendants may not\nnow claim that Nelson failed to properly exhaust.\nFollowing Heardโs lead, Nelson argues that his 2011 grievance properly exhausted his 2012\nRamadan claim.  For the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that a grievance for Ramadan\n5\n\n2011 would exhaust a claim for Ramadan 2012.  In contrast to Heard, however, Nelson has attached\ncopies of his 2011 grievance to Plaintiffsโ partial Objection.  Therefore, Nelson has carried his burden\nof producing evidence that he actually exhausted his Ramadan 2011 claim.  Therefore, Nelsonโs\nRamadan 2012 claim may proceed.\nTherefore,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation issued\nMarch 27, 2015 (dkt. # 181) is ADOPTED IN PART AND REJECTED IN PART.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendantsโ Motion For Partial Summary Judgment (dkt\n# 75) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  Defendantsโ motion is granted with regard\nto Plaintiffs Heardโs, Mosesโs, and Johnsonโs claims based on Ramadan 2011.  The motion is denied\nwith regard to Plaintiff Nelsonโs claims for Ramadan 2011 and 2012.  Therefore, the case will proceed\non Plaintiff Nelsonโs Ramadan 2011 claim and on Plaintiff Heardโs Mosesโs, Johnsonโs, and Nelsonโs\nclaims for Ramadan 2012.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motion to Re-Submit Signed Plaintiffsโ Response\nPartially Opposing Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (dkt. # 188) is GRANTED. \nDated:  June 26, 2015               /s/ Gordon J.

Fed. R. App. P. 34(a). \n  Plaintiffs Lamont Bernard Heard, William M. Johnson, Jamero T. Moses, and Anthony \nLee Nelson, Muslim prisoners proceeding pro se, filed this civil rights action alleging, in part, \nthat the defendants violated their First and Eighth Amendment rights by depriving them of \nadequate nutrition during their 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts by serving them a total of 1,000 to \n1,500  calories  per  day.    The  defendants  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint  or  for  summary \njudgment.  A magistrate judge recommended granting the defendantsโ motion for summary \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 229 filed 12/21/15   PageID.1919   Page 3 of 5 (3 of 5)\nNo. 14-2195 \n- 2 - \njudgment,  reasoning,  in  part,  that  the  plaintiffsโ  First  Amendment  claims  were  barred  by \nqualified  immunity  because  there  was  no  clearly  established  federal  law  that  entitled  the \nplaintiffs to the 2,900 calories a day allegedly mandated by MDOC policy.  The magistrate judge \ndid not address whether the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffsโ \nEighth Amendment claim arising from the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts, where they allegedly \nreceived only 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day.     \nThe district court adopted in part and rejected in part the report and recommendation.  It \ndetermined that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffsโ First \nAmendment claim because a reasonable prison official should have known that a diet consisting \nof 1,000 to 1,500 calories a day was inadequate to sustain a prisonerโs health over a thirty-day \nperiod.  And it dismissed the plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment claim because the plaintiffs were \noffered  the  same  nutritionally  adequate  diet  as  the  general  prison  population  but  chose  to \nparticipate in the Ramadan fast.  \nThe plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of their Eighth Amendment claim, arguing that \nthey were deprived of adequate nutrition based on their participation in the Ramadan fasts and \nthat they never chose to give up adequate meals but were deprived of them when they were not \nallowed to take a mid-day meal from the cafeteria to eat after sunset.  The district court granted \nthe plaintiffsโ motion, concluding that the plaintiffs could only obtain adequate nutrition by \nviolating their religious beliefs.  It thus reinstated the plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment claims.   \nThe defendants filed this interlocutory appeal, arguing that they are entitled to qualified \nimmunity  on  the  plaintiffsโ  Eighth  Amendment  claim,  that  the  district  court  defined  the \nconstitutional issue too generally, and that there is no clearly established law dictating the \nnumber of calories that a prisoner must have per day during a thirty-day period.  The defendants \ndo not appeal the denial of qualified immunity on the plaintiffsโ First Amendment claims, asking \nus only to  reverse and โremand with  instructions to  dismiss Plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment \nclaim.โ  Appellantsโ Br. 16.  The plaintiffs contend that the defendants did not raise a qualified-\nimmunity argument below and that their clearly established Eighth Amendment rights were \nviolated by the denial of adequate nutrition during the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts.  The \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 229 filed 12/21/15   PageID.1920   Page 4 of 5 (4 of 5)\nNo. 14-2195 \n- 3 - \nplaintiffs also move to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for the \nappointment of counsel.  \nThe plaintiffs move to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing \nthat the district court never ruled on whether the defendants were immune from suit on their \nEighth Amendment claim.  Qualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages \nso long as their conduct does not violate a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of \nwhich a reasonable person would have known.  Stanton v. Sims, 134 S. Ct. 3, 4 (2013) (per \ncuriam).  A district courtโs denial of qualified immunity on purely legal grounds is immediately \nappealable.  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526โ27, 530 (1985).  This is so even when the \ndenial of qualified immunity is implicit.  See, e.g., Summers v. Leis, 368 F.3d 881, 887 (6th Cir. \n2004); In re Montgomery Cty., 215 F.3d 367, 370, 374 (3d Cir. 2000); Heggs v. Grant, 73 F.3d \n317, 321 (11th Cir. 1996); Musso v. Hourigan, 836 F.2d 736, 740โ41 (2d Cir. 1988).  Here, the \ndefendants moved for summary judgment or dismissal claiming that they were shielded by \nqualified  immunity.    The  district  court  reinstated  the  plaintiffsโ  Eighth  Amendment  claim \nwithout expressly deciding the issue of qualified immunity.  Because the district court allowed \nthe claim to proceed, it implicitly rejected the defendantsโ qualified-immunity argument.  See \nSummers, 368 F.3d at 887.  Thus, we have jurisdiction to decide whether the facts alleged by the \nplaintiffs establish a prima facie violation of their clearly established Eighth Amendment rights.  \nWe  review  de  novo  a  district  courtโs  order  denying  qualified  immunity.    Range  v. \nDouglas, 763 F.3d 573, 588 (6th Cir. 2014).  To determine whether government officials are \nshielded by qualified immunity, a court must decide (1) whether the facts as alleged by the \nplaintiff establish that a constitutional violation occurred and (2) whether the right was clearly \nestablished at the time of the violation.  Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2020 (2014).  A \nright is clearly established when its contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official \nwould  have  understood  that  what  he  was  doing  violated  that  right.    Id.  at  2023.   Clearly \nestablished law should not be defined at a high level of generality.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. \nCt. 2074, 2084 (2011).  The focus should be on whether the law provided fair warning.      \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00373-GJQ-RSK   ECF No. 229 filed 12/21/15   PageID.1921   Page 5 of 5 (5 of 5)\nNo. 14-2195 \n- 4 - \nThe defendants argue that there is no clearly established law requiring that prisoners \nreceive a specific number of calories per day, here between 1,000 and 1,500 calories.  But it is \nclear that a prisoner has the clearly established right to a nutritionally adequate diet.  See Farmer \nv. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994).  And it is clear that a diet consisting of 1,000 to 1,500 \ncalories per day can violate that right.  Welch v. Spaulding, No. 14-2050, 2015 WL 5729466, at \n*4โ5 (6th Cir. Sept. 30, 2015).  For reasons of their own, the defendants did not submit evidence \nabout the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts, instead accepting that the prisoners were only given \nbetween 1,000 and 1,500 calories per day during those years.  That number of calories, the \nprisoners allege, caused dizziness, weakness, dehydration, hunger pains, and loss of weight.  \nThese allegations establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the plaintiffsโ \nrestricted  diets  during  the  Ramadan  fasts  violated  a  clearly  established  right  of  which  a \nreasonable officer would have known.  Id.; see Byrd v. Wilson, 701 F.2d 592, 595 (6th Cir. 1983) \n(per curiam).  While it is not clear to us whether the plaintiffs can receive relief on both their \nFirst and Eighth Amendment claims, at this point both can go forward.     \nThe plaintiffs also move for the appointment of counsel.  The appointment of counsel in a \ncivil proceeding is a privilegeโโnot a rightโโthat is warranted only in exceptional circumstances.  \nLavado v. Keohane, 992 F.2d 601, 605โ06 (6th Cir. 1993).  Since the filing of the plaintiffsโ \nmotion and after merits briefing was completed, counsel has entered an appearance and filed \npleadings on the plaintiffsโ behalf.  Counsel has not requested appointment, and that request is \nnow moot.  \nAccordingly, the district courtโs order is AFFIRMED, the plaintiffsโ motions to dismiss \nand for the appointment of counsel are DENIED, and this case is REMANDED to the district \ncourt.    \n       \n            ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT \n \n \n \n \n            Deborah S.

Thus, while Plaintiffs \nNot Reported in F.Supp.3d, 2014 WL 1347432 \nhave sufficiently alleged a First Amendment claim, their \n!\nallegations  fail  to  establish  an  Eighth  Amendment \nviolation.4 \nFootnotes!\n!\n1!

QUIST\nDefendants.\n_____________________________/\nORDER OF CONTEMPT\nFor the reasons stated on the record following the hearing on Plaintiffsโ Motion to Hold\nDefendants in Contempt, the Court concludes that:\n1. Defendants violated this Courtโs July 13, 2013 Order of Clarification on\nseveral  occasions  during  the  2013  Ramadan  observance  by  providing\nPlaintiffs with fewer than 2350 calories each day, contrary to Defendantsโ\nown representations to the Court; \n2. The  Courtโs  May  13,  2010  was  clear  and  unambiguous  in  requiring\nDefendants to provide Plaintiffs 2350 calories per day; and\n3. Within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order, Defendants shall pay a total\nof  $200  to  each  Plaintiff  as  compensation  for  damages  caused  by\nDefendantsโ noncompliance with the July 13, 2013 Order of Clarification.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n \nDated:  April 29, 2014               /s/ Gordon J.
