    "summary": "<p>On October 25, 2013, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP) filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The plaintiff, which served as Alabamaโs designated protection and advocacy program for people with disabilities, sued SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (SafetyNet) under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI), the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (PADD Act), and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of 1993 (PAIR). The plaintiff alleged that SafetyNet had unlawfully failed to allow it, as Alabamaโs Protection and Advocacy (P&A) provider, to monitor the defendant's facilities. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to grant ADAP access to facilities used for SafetyNet Academy, a program operated by the defendant for male youths with emotional or behavioral disabilities. The plaintiff claimed that, despite several attempts to explain to the staff at SafetyNet Academy why they were required by law to allow ADAP into all of the Academy's facilities for monitoring and investigation purposes, the defendant repeatedly refused to grant ADAP access to what it referred to as its Moderate Program. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to compel the SafetyNet Academy to grant them reasonable access to the facilities.</p><p>On December 2, 2013 โ the same day the defendant filed an answer denying that it was required to allow the plaintiff access to its Moderate Program โ it also filed a third-party complaint against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). SafetyNet claimed that, because it had acted on the advice and counsel of DHR, which served as its licensing authority, any potential violations on its own part were caused by DHR. On this basis, it sought indemnification from DHR for any recovery that may be received by the plaintiff against SafetyNet. </p><p>Unable to agree on terms of a settlement, the parties proceeded with discovery. On September 19, 2014, all three parties moved for summary judgment. While the plaintiff held onto its position that it was allowed access to all of SafetyNet Academyโs programs, the defendants argued that because the individuals in the Moderate Program had moderate (rather than severe) mental illness, they were excluded from P&A protection. </p><p>Shortly afterward, on October 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest supporting the plaintiffโs position that summary judgment against the defendants was appropriate. The DOJ asserted that the defendantโs facilities at SafetyNet Academy fell squarely within the parameters of PAIMI regulations and, as such, the plaintiff must be granted reasonable unrestricted access to all of the academyโs programs. </p><p>On December 12, 2014, Judge Callie V.S. Grande awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff, denying both defendantsโ requests for summary judgment as well as SafetyNetโs request for indemnification and contribution against DHR. The judge found that, as a facility that provided residential treatment for individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, PAIMI, PADD, and PAIR applied to SafetyNet Academy. Rejecting defendantsโ assertion that individuals with moderate mental illness may be excluded from P&A protection, she emphasized that the protections offered by these laws were intended to be broad in scope and did not define P&A access โone resident at a time.โ Accordingly, Judge Grande held that ADAP was authorized to monitor all SafetyNet Academy programs and must be allowed reasonable access by law and awarded declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiff. She also ordered ADAP and SafetyNet to meet and prepare a protocol for ADAPโs monitoring and investigation visits. Finally, the order denied SafetyNetโs request for indemnification against DHR and held that each party should bear its own attorneysโ fees and costs. 65 F.Supp.3d 1312.</p><p>The parties met and submitted access protocol on January 30, 2015. In addition to describing ADAPโs scope of access to SafetyNet and its records, the protocol outlined procedures ADAP may follow should SafetyNet deny or delay access to its facilities in the future. </p><p>Also following the grant of summary judgment, ADAP submitted a motion for reconsideration of the courtโs denial of attorneysโ fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, Judge Grande issued an order awarding the plaintiff filing fees as the prevailing party. However, the order denied the plaintiff attorneysโ fees, citing a failure to raise an applicable exception to the American Rule stating that litigants are generally expected to bear their own attorneysโ fees and costs. 2015 WL 566946.</p>",

(SAFETYNET)  FACILITIES \nSection  I \nIntroduction \nProtection  and  advocacy  (โP&Aโ)  agencies  are  federally  mandated  to  provide  legal  and \nother  advocacy  services  on  behalf  of  persons  with  disabilities,  including  persons  with  mental \nillness  and  persons  with  developmental  disabilities.  They  are  authorized  to  investigate  potential \nabuse  or  neglect  impacting  such  persons  and  to  monitor  their  health  and  safety  in  both \ninstitutional  and  community  settings.  They  are  also  authorized to  pursue  legal,  administrative  and \nother  remedies  and  other  approaches  to  ensure  the  protection  of  the  rights  of  persons  with \ndisabilities.  These  authorities  are  conferred  under  federal  statutes,  including  the  Protection  and \nAdvocacy  for  Individuals  with  Mental  Illness  Act  (\"PAIMI  Act\"),  42  U.S.C.  ยง  10801  ef seg.,  and \nits  implementing  regulations  at  42  C.F.R.  ยง  51;  the  Protection  and  Advocacy  for  Individuals \nwith  Developmental  Disabilities  Act  (โPADD  Actโ),  and  its  implementing  regulations  at  42 \nU.S.C.  ยง  ยง  15041  et  seg.,  45  C.F.R.  ยง  1386  et  seqg.;  and  the  Protection  and  Advocacy  for \nIndividual  Rights  Act  (โPAIR  Actโ),  29  U.S.C.  ยง  794e  and  its  implementing  regulations  at  34 \nC.F.R.  ยง  381.  These  statutes  will  be  referred  to  collectively  as  \"the  P  &  A  Acts.\"\nSection  II \nVisitation  --  Monitoring  and  Training \n.  Introduction \nADAP  monitors  SafetyNet  facilities  to  observe  and  identify  policies  or  procedures; \nenvironmental,  staffing,  or  service  planning  issues;  staff-on-youth  and  youth-on-youth \ninteractions;  and,  other  general  conditions  or  circumstances  that  could  impact the  safety  and \nrights  of youth  served  by  SafetyNet. |  In  addition,  ADAP  conducts  informational  visits  to \nSafetyNet  facilities  to  provide  information  on  legal  rights  to  youth โ both  in  general  and  in \nrelation  to  the  particular circumstances  of an  individual  youth.โ \n2.  Notice  Required \nADAP  will  provide  SafetyNet  seven  days  advance  written  notice  for  ADAPโs \nmonitoring  activities.  Such  notice  will  include the  names  of the  individuals  who  will  have \naccess,  the  name  of the  facility  and  the  date  and  the  approximate  time  ADAP  will  be  on-site. \n.  Notice  to  Whom \nADAP  will  contact the  identified  SafetyNet  staff member  at  each  facility  to  set  up \nmonitoring  visits.  Upon  adoption  of this  protocol,  SafetyNet  and  ADAP  will  exchange \nagency  and  contact  information,  including  the  relevant  contact  names,  telephone  numbers, \nfacsimile  numbers  and  mailing addresses  for  each  SafetyNet  facility.  The  parties  will  update \nsuch  information  as  necessary. \n4.  Hours \nADAP  is  authorized  to  have  access  at  all  reasonable  times,  which,  at  a  minimum,  shall \ninclude  normal  working  hours  and  visiting  hours.โ  While  after-hour visits  (e.g.  third  shift\nvisits)  will  be  permitted  with  notice,  as  outlined  above,  it  is  anticipated  that the  majority  of \nADAPโs  monitoring  and  training visits  will  occur  during  normal  working  and  visiting  hours. \n5.  Scope  of Facility Access \nADAP  monitors  SafetyNet  facilities  to  observe  and  identify  policies  or procedures; \nenvironmental,  staffing,  or  service  planning  issues;  staff-on-youth  and  youth-on-youth \ninteractions;  and,  other  general  conditions  or circumstances  that  could  impact  the  safety  and \nrights  of youth  served  by  SafetyNet.โ  In  addition,  ADAP  conducts  informational  visits  to \nSafetyNet  facilities  to  provide  information  on  legal  rights  to  youth โ both  in  general  and  in \nrelation  to  the  particular  circumstances  of an  individual  youth.ยฐ \nADAP  staff may  meet  youth  individually  or  in  groups,  with  or without  a  request  from  the \nyouth  or their  families,  during  monitoring  visits.  ADAP  may  also  request  individual \nSafetyNet  staff to  speak with  ADAP. \nADAP  will  conduct  its  monitoring  in  a  manner that: \na.  minimizes  interference  with  the  facilityโs  programs; \nb.  respects the  legitimate  privacy  interests  of youth  and  facility  staff; \nc.  honors  a  youthโs  request  to  terminate  an  interview;  and \nd.  honors  a  SafetyNet  staff memberโs  refusal  to  speak  with  ADAP  for  other than  routine \nscheduling  or  procedural  matters.โ \nADAPโs  monitoring  activities  reflect  ADAPโs  statutory mandate  to: \na.  interact  regularly with  those  individuals  who  are  current  or  potential  recipients  of \nP&A  services; \nb.  interact  regularly with  staff providing  care  or  treatment; \n  \n'  For example,  when monitoring a  SafetyNet classroom  or other program,  ADAP  staff will not interrupt the class  or \nprogram to  make any  announcements.  If ADAP  staff wants to  make a brief announcement,  ADAP  staff will wait \nuntil  the conclusion of the class or program to  do  so.\nc.  obtain  information  and  review records  (See  Section  V  for  more  detail);  and \nd.  communicate  with  family  members,  social  and  community  service  workers  and  others \ninvolved  in  providing  care  or treatment.* \n6.  SafetyNet  Oversight  of ADAP  Staff and  Interviewees \nADAP  shall  have  private  and  unaccompanied  access  to  meet  and  communicate  privately \nwith  youth  served  by  SafetyNet  regularly,  both  formally and  informally. \nTo  encourage  dialogue  between  youth  and  ADAP  staff,  SafetyNet  may  not  pre-screen \nyouth  before  they talk with  ADAP  staff during  a  monitoring  visit.  SafetyNet  may  not \ndiscourage  youth  from  talking to  ADAP  staff and  may  not take  or  imply  any  action  against \nany  youth  in  retaliation  for talking  with  ADAP.  Further,  SafetyNet  may not  conduct  post- \ninterview  debriefings  of youth  regarding  the  nature  of their  conversations  with  ADAP  though \nthis  prohibition  is  not  intended  to  prevent  SafetyNet  staff from  investigating,  per  its  own \npolicies  and  procedures,  reported  incidents  of abuse  and/or  neglect. \nADAP  Staff Obligations \nTo  protect the  safety  and  rights  of individuals  with  disabilities  in  SafetyNet  facilities, \nADAP  will,  as  soon  as  feasible,  advise  SafetyNet  staff of safety  or rights  violations  revealed \nthrough  its  monitoring. \nSafetyNet  Obligation  if Access  is  Denied  or  Delayed \nIf ADAP  access to  facilities,  programs,  youth,  or  records  are  denied  or  delayed,  ADAP \nwill  promptly  contact  SafetyNet  Legal  Counsel.  SafetyNet  must  promptly  provide  ADAP \nwith  a  written  statement  of the  reasons  for  such  denial  or delay.'ยฐ\nPart  III \nVisitation  --  Visiting  with  Youth  who  are  Current  or  Potential  Clients \nof Protection  and  Advocacy  Services \n.  Introduction \nAn  ADAP  lawyer  or  advocate  may  meet  and  confer with  his  client  or potential  client \nregarding  confidential  matters.  ADAP  will  certify  in  writing  that  a  youth  is  a  client  or \npotential  client,  including the  basis  (if known  at the  time)  upon  which  ADAP  concludes the \nyouth  is  an  individual  with  a  disability. \nNotice  Required \nADAP  will  endeavor to  provide  reasonable  advance notice  (24-48  hours)  when  it  seeks \nto  meet  with  ADAP  clients  (or potential  clients)  with  the  understanding  that  emergency  or \nexigent  situations  may  arise  that  prevent  such  notification.  ADAP will  endeavor to  provide \nwritten  notification  to  the  Guardian  Ad  Litem  (GAL)  of the  youth  notifying  the  GAL that \nADAP  has  scheduled  to  talk privately with  a  youth.  SafetyNet  will  provide  GAL  contact \ninformation  to  ADAP to  facilitate  this  communication. \n.  Notice  to  Whom \nADAP  will  contact  the  identified  SafetyNet  staff member at  each  facility to  set  up  client \nvisits.  Upon  adoption  of this  protocol,  SafetyNet  and  ADAP  will  exchange  agency  contact \ninformation,  including  the  relevant  contact  names,  telephone  numbers,  facsimile  numbers \nand  mailing  addresses  for each  SafetyNet  facility.  The  parties  will  update  such  information \nas  necessary.\n4.  Hours \nADAP  is  authorized to  have  access  at  all  reasonable  times,  which,  at  a  minimum,  shall \ninclude  normal  working  hours  and  visiting  hours.''  While  after-hour visits  (e.g.  third  shift \nvisits)  will  be  permitted,  it  is  anticipated  that the  majority  of ADAPโs  visits  with  current  or \npotential  clients  will  occur  during  normal  working  and  visiting  hours. \n5.  Location  of Visits \nADAP  client  (or potential  client)  visits will  take  place  in  each  facilityโs  administration \nbuilding. \n6.  On-Site  Supervision  of ADAP  Staff \nADAP  shall  have  private  and  unaccompanied  access to  meet and  communicate  privately \nwith  clients  (or potential  clients),  both  formally and  informally.  Among  other reasons,  these \nmeetings  may  be  needed  to  ascertain  a youthโs  eligibility  for ADAPโs  services;' โ  to  conduct  a \npreliminary  assessment  regarding  an  eligible  residentโs  concerns;  to  provide  information \nabout  ADAP;  or to  discuss  matters  related  to  ADAPโs  representation  of the  individual.โ \nTo  encourage  dialogue  between  youth  and  ADAP  staff,  SafetyNet  may  not  pre-screen \nyouth  before  they  talk  with  ADAP  staff.  SafetyNet  may  not  discourage  youth  from  talking  to \nADAP  staff and  may  not  take  or  imply  any  action  against  any  youth  in  retaliation  for talking \nwith  ADAP.  Further,  SafetyNet  may  not  conduct  post-interview debriefings  with  youth \nregarding  the  nature  of their  conversations  with  ADAP  though  this  prohibition  is  not \nintended  to  prevent  SafetyNet  staff from  investigating,  per  its  own  policies  and  procedures, \nreported  incidents  of abuse  and/or  neglect.  a\n7.  Off-Site  Communication  between  ADAP  and  Facility  Youth \nADAP  shall  have  access  to  youth,  both  formally  and  informally,  by telephone  and  mail.โยฐ \nAll  such  conversations  and  correspondence  shall  be  afforded  the  confidentiality  given  to \nlegal  or judicial  interactions. \n8.  _ADAP  Staff Obligations \nADAP  will  conduct  its  visits  in  a  manner that: \nminimizes  interference  with  the  facilityโs  programs; \na. \nb.  respects  the  legitimate  privacy  interests  of youth  and  facility  staff; \nhonors  a  youthโs  request to  terminate  an  interview;'ยฐ \nhonors  a  SafetyNet  staff personโs  refusal  to  speak with  ADAP  for  other than  routine \nscheduling  or procedural  matters;  and \nรฉ.  abides  by  security  policies  of SafetyNet  facilities. \nTo  protect  the  safety  and  rights  of individuals  with  disabilities  in  SafetyNet  facilities, \nADAP  will,  as  soon  as  feasible,  advise  SafetyNet  staff of safety  or rights  violations  revealed \nthrough  its  client representation. \n9.  SafetyNet  Obligation  if Access  is  Denied  or Delayed \nIf ADAP  access  to  facilities,  programs,  youth,  or records  are  denied  or  delayed,  ADAP \nwill  promptly notify  SafetyNet  Legal  Counsel.  SafetyNet  must  promptly  provide  ADAP \nwith  a  written  statement  of the  reasons  for  such  denial  or  delay.'โ\nPart IV \nInvestigations \n1.  Introduction \nADAP  conducts  investigations 'ยฎ  of alleged  incidents  of abuse  or  neglect  at  SafetyNet \nfacilities  when  it  receives  a  complaint  of such  incidents,  when  it  makes  a  probable  cause \ndetermination  that  such  incidents  have  occurred,  or when  ADAP  determines  that  there  is  or \nmay  be  imminent  danger  of serious  abuse  or neglect  of an  individual  with  a disability.'ยฐ \n2.  Complaint \nA  complaint  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  any  report  or communication,  whether  formal \nor  informal,  written  or  oral,  received  by  ADAP,  including  media  accounts,  newspaper \narticles,  telephone  calls  (including  anonymous  calls)  from  any  source  alleging  abuse  or \nneglect  of an  individual.โยฐ \nProbable  Cause \nProbable  cause  means  reasonable  grounds  for belief that  an  individual  with  a disability \nhas  been,  or may  be  at  significant  risk  of being  subject to  abuse  or  neglect.  ADAP makes  this \ndetermination  basing  the  decision  on  reasonable  inferences  drawn  from  its  experience  or \ntraining regarding  similar  incidents,  conditions  or  problems that are  usually  associated  with \nabuse  or neglect.โ ! \nADAPโs  determination  of probable  cause  may  result  from  its  monitoring  or  other \nactivities,  including  observation  by  ADAP  personnel  and  reviews  of monitoring  and  other \nreports  prepared  by  others  whether pertaining to  individuals  disabilities  or to  general \nconditions  affecting their  health  or  safety.โ\nSafetyNet  reserves  the  right to  contest  ADAPโs  statement  of probable  cause  and  to  file \nwith  the  appropriate  court  a  motion  for  injunctive,  declaratory  or  other  applicable  relief. \nDespite  the  foregoing  reservation,  ADAP  affirms  its  position  that  statutory,  regulatory  and \ncase  law  hold  that  a  determination  of probable  cause  is  within  ADAPโs  discretion  alone. \n.  Notice \nBy  statute,  regulation  and  case  law,  ADAP  is  not required  to  give  advance  notice  to \naccess  a  facility,  its  employees  or to  youth  served  by the  facility  in  order to  conduct  an \ninvestigation  of suspected  abuse  or neglect.โ>  However,  ADAP  will  provide  72  hours \nadvance  written  notice  to  conduct  investigatory  activities,  except  in  emergency  or exigent \nsituations.  The  notice  will  include  the  name  of the  youth;  a  statement  of ADAPโs \ndetermination  of the  youthโs  eligibility  for  services  under ADAPโs  enabling  statutes;  and  a \nbrief summary  of the  facts  upon  which  probable  cause  is  based.*  The  notice  will  be  signed \nby  an  ADAP  staff member with  knowledge  of the  facts.  Notice  will  be  provided  to  the \nidentified  SafetyNet  facility  staff person. \nHours \nADAP  shall  endeavor to  conduct  all  investigations  during  normal  business  hours. \nHowever,  in  emergency  situations,  ADAP  will  have  reasonable  unaccompanied  access  at  all \n  \ntimes  necessary  to  conduct  a  full  investigation  of an  incident  of abuse  or neglect,  including \nnight and  weekend  hours.โ \n.  Where  in  Facility \nDuring  an  investigation,  ADAP  personnel  shall  have  reasonable  unaccompanied  access to \nall  areas  of the  facility  which  are  used  by  youth  or  are  accessible  to  youth.โ  This  authority \nincludes  the  right to  inspect,  view  and photograph  all  areas  of a  facility's  premises  that  might\nbe  reasonably  believed  by  ADAP  to  have  been  connected  with  the  incident  under \ninvestigation.โโ \nAccess  to  Residents \nDuring  an  investigation,  ADAP  personnel  shall  have  reasonable  unaccompanied  access  to \nyouth  and  facility  staff.2ยฎ  This  access  shall  include  the  opportunity:  to  interview  any  youth, \nemployee,  or  other person,  including the  person  thought  to  be  the  victim  of an  incident  of \nabuse  or neglect  or who  might  be  reasonably  believed  by  ADAP  to  have  knowledge  of the \nincident  under  investigation.โ \nTo  encourage  dialogue  between  youth  and  ADAP  staff,  SafetyNet  may  not  pre-screen \nyouth  before they talk with  ADAP  staff during  an  investigation.  SafetyNet may  not \ndiscourage  youth  from  talking to  ADAP  staff and  may  not  take  or  imply  any  action  against \nany  youth  in  retaliation  for talking  with  ADAP.  Further,  SafetyNet  may  not  conduct  post- \ninterview  debriefings  with  youth  regarding  the  nature  of their  conversations  with  ADAP \nthough  this  prohibition  is  not  intended  to prevent  SafetyNet  staff from  investigating,  per  its \nown  policies  and  procedures,  reported  incidents  of abuse  and/or  neglect.ยฐโ \nAccess  to  Records \nADAP  staff will  have  access  to the  records  of a  youth  who  is the  subject  of an \ninvestigation  being  conducted  pursuant  to  this  Section.  For  further  information  on  record \naccess,  see  Section  V. \nOn-Site  Supervision  of ADAP  Staff \nADAP  shall  have  private  and  unaccompanied  access  to  meet  and  communicate  privately \nwith  youth.>! \n10\n10.  ADAP  Staff Obligations \nADAP  will  conduct  its  investigatory visits  in  a  manner that: \na.  minimizes  interference  with the  facilityโs  programs; \nb.  respects  the  legitimate  privacy  interests  of youth  and  facility  staff; \nc.  honors  a  youthโs  request to  terminate  an  interview;  and \nd.  honors  a  SafetyNet  staff personโs  refusal  to  speak with  ADAP  for  other than  routine \nscheduling  or procedural matters.โ \nTo  protect the  safety  and  rights  of individuals  with  disabilities  in  SafetyNet  facilities, \nADAP  will,  as  soon  as  feasible,  advise  SafetyNet  staff of safety  or rights  violations  revealed \nthrough  its  investigations. \n11.  SafetyNet  Obligation  if Access  is  Denied  or Delayed \nIf ADAP  access  to  facilities,  programs,  residents,  or records  are  denied  or  delayed,  ADAP \nwill  promptly notify  SafetyNet  Legal  Counsel.  SafetyNet  must  promptly  provide  ADAP  with \na written  statement  of the  reasons  for  such  denial  or  delay.โ 3 \n1]\nPart V \nRecord  Access \n1.  Request  Procedure \nADAP  will  provide  the  facility  administrator  with  a written  request  for  a  youthโs  record. \nIf applicable,  the  request  will  include  a release  signed  by the  youthโs  parent  or  legal  guardian. \nADAP  will  certify  in  the  written  request  if the  purpose  of the  record  review  is  in \nfurtherance  of an  investigation  conducted  pursuant  to  Section  IV.  In  such a  situation  a \nrelease  signed  by the  youthโs  parent  or  legal  guardian  is  not  required. \nADAP  is  not required  to  provide  a  conclusive,  individualized  showing  of an  individualโs \ndisability before  being  allowed  access  to  the  records. \nOn-site  Review \nUpon  presentation  of the  written  request,  ADAP  staff will  have  immediate  access  to \nrecords  which  are  available  at  the  facility.โ \nUnder no  circumstances  will  ADAP  staff remove  the  original  record  or any  part  thereof \nfrom  the  control  of the  facility  or add  or make  changes  to  the  record.  Any  problems  with  an \nADAP  staff memberโs  handling  of the  records  should  be  reported  to the  ADAP  Executive \nDirector. \nPhotocopies  of Records \nSafetyNet  will  provide  space  for ADAP  to  set  up  its  own  copier or  scanner on  site  to \nphotocopy  records.  In  those  instances  in which  SafetyNet provides  ADAP  with  copies  of \nrequested  records,  ADAP  will  pay  five  cents  per  copied  page.  If a  death  has  occurred  or  if \nADAP  asserts  probable  cause  of serious  and  immediate jeopardy to  the  health  or  safety  of an \n12\nindividual,  copies  must  be  provided to  the  ADAP  staff member  making the  request  within  24 \nhours.ยฐยฐ \nDefinition  of Recordsโยฎ \nInformation  and  individual  records,  obtained  in  the  course  of providing  intake, \na. \nassessment,  evaluation,  supportive  and  other  services,  including medical  records, \nfinancial  records,  and  reports  prepared  or  received  by  a  member of the  staff of a  facility \nor program  rendering  care  or treatment. \nReports  prepared  by  individuals  and  entities  performing  certification  or  licensure \nreviews,  or by  professional  accreditation  organizations,  as  well  as  related  assessments \nprepared  for the  facility  by  its  staff,  contractors  or related  entities,  except that  nothing  in \nthis  section  is  intended  to  preempt  State  law protecting  records  produced  by  medical  care \nevaluation  or  peer review  committees. \nDischarge  planning  records. \nProfessional,  performance,  building  or other  safety  standards,  demographic  and  statistical \ninformation  relating to  the  facility. \nReports  prepared  by  an  agency  charged  with  investigating  abuse  neglect,  or  injury \noccurring  at  a  facility  rendering  care  or treatment,  or  by  or  for the  facility  itself,  that \ndescribe  any  or  all  of the  following: \ni.  Abuse,  neglect,  or  injury  occurring  at  the  facility; \nii.  | The  steps  taken  to  investigate the  incidents; \niii.  | Reports  and  records,  including  personnel  records,  prepared  or  maintained  by the \nfacility,  in  connection  with  such  reports  of incidents;  or \n13\niv.  Supporting  information  that  was  relied  upon  in  creating  a  report,  including  all \ninformation  and  records  used  or  reviewed  in  preparing  reports  of abuse,  neglect  or \ninjury  such  as  records  which  describe  persons  who  were  interviewed,  physical  and \ndocumentary  evidence  that  was  reviewed,  and the  related  investigative  findings. \n5.  Duty  to  Maintain  Confidentiality  of Records \nADAP  will  maintain the  confidentiality  of records  and  information  regarding  residents \nand  will  only  use  such  information  as  necessary to  fulfill  its  own  duties  under the  law.  ADAP \nwill  maintain  the  confidentiality  of records provided  to  it  to  the  same  extent  as  is  required  of \nSafetyNet  under the  laws  of both  the  State  of Alabama  and  the  United  States  of America. \nADAP  will  not  release  or  disclose  to  a  third  party  any  individual  records  without  the \nauthorization  of the  individual  or his/her  guardian. \nPersonal  Identifiable  Information  (PII)  ADAP  obtains  from  SafetyNet  in  the  course  of \ncommunicating  with  clients  and  potential  clients,  and  through  monitoring  and  investigations \nADAP  conducts  pursuant  to  ADAP's  federal  access  authority,  is  protected  from  disclosure  to \nthird  parties  per the  Alabama  Rules  of Professional  Conduct,  ADAP's  enabling  statutes  and \nimplementing  regulations  (PADD,  PAIMI,  and  PAIR),  attorney  client  privilege,  and  the \nattorney-  work  product  doctrine.  Nothing  in  this  agreement,  however,  prohibits  ADAP  from \ndisclosing  PII  if demanded  by  subpoena  from  a  legally  authorized  federal  or  state  agency. \nADAP  is  obligated  to  release  to  an  ADAP  client  information  in  the  clientโs  file  at the  client's \nrequest.  Nonetheless,  ADAP  must  keep  confidential  information  pertaining  to  individuals  to \nthe  same  extent  as  is  required  under Federal  or  State  law  for a  provider of mental  health \nservices,  except  as  provided  for  under  42  C.F.R.  ยง51.46. \n14\nPart VI \nMiscellaneous \n1.  ADAP  will  abide  by the  Alabama  Rules  of Professional  Conduct  in  its  interactions  with \nclients  and  potential  clients  of its  services  at  ADAP. \nNothing  in  this  protocol  shall  be  construed to  bar either  SafetyNet  or ADAP  from \nseeking  injunctive,  declaratory  or  other relief from  an  appropriate  court. \n3.  ADAP  and  SafetyNet  consent to  the  following-described  procedure  for  resolving  any \ndisputes  regarding  this  agreement: \nIf either party  reasonably  believes  that the  other party  is  not  complying  with \na. \nthis  agreement,  the  party  will  notify the  other  in  writing  regarding  the  nature \nof the  alleged  non-compliance  and  will  propose  recommended  corrective \naction.  Not  less than  10  days  after the  receipt  of this  notice,  the  parties  shall \nconfer  in  a  good-faith  effort to  resolve  the  matter.  If they  fail  to  reach  an \nagreement  which  resolves  the  dispute,  either ADAP  or  SafetyNet  may  request \nthat  the  Court appoint  a Mediator. \nThis  procedure  shall  be  deemed  a  condition  precedent  to  either partyโs  filing \nof any  enforcement  motion  with  the  District  Court,  except  that  it  shall  not be \nconstrued  to  bar ADAP  from  seeking  immediate judicial  relief upon  a \nreasonable  belief that  a  SafetyNet  youth  is  threatened  by  an  imminent  or \ncontinuing  risk  of serious  harm,  and  that  SafetyNet  cannot,  or will  not, \neradicate  or minimize  such  risk  effectively,  regardless  of prior notice. \n15\nc.  For the  purpose  of this  provision,  \"risk  of serious  harm\"  shall  refer to  an \nimminent threat to  life  or personal  safety  as  a  result  of physical  or  emotional \nabuse,  extreme  neglect,  physical  injury,  sexual  exploitation  or  sexual  assault. \n4,  The  parties  shall  review this  protocol  annually,  on  or  about  January  30. \n5.  Either party  may,  with  thirty days  written  notice  to  the  other party,  withdraw  its  consent \nto  be  bound  by the  terms  of the  protocol. \n6.  It  is  the  intent  of the  parties  that  all  issues  relating  to  access  by ADAP,  statutory  or \notherwise,  to  SafetyNet  facilities  are  resolved  in  this  agreement. \n16\nEndnotes \n\"45  C.F.R.  ยง  1386.22(g)(2);  42  C.F.R.  ยง  51.42(c)(2). \n745  C.F.R.  ยง  1386.22(g)(1);  42  C.F.R.  ยง  51.42(c)(1). \n3  PAIMI  regulation  interpretive  guidance  states that  in  non-emergency  (i.e.  non-investigative)  situations, \nadvance  notice to a facility may  be  reasonable  but the  guidance  does  not describe when  it would be \nappropriate  to  provide  advance  notice  and  no  description  of what  constitutes  reasonable notice.  62  F.R. \n53561.

Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act \n(โPAIMI Actโ), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801โ10851 (1991); 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42 (1997).  The PAIMI Act \nregulations define what constitutes a โfacility,โ what it means to provide โcare and treatment,โ \nand who is an โindividual with a mental illness.โ  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2 (1997).  Once a residential \ntreatment program falls within the scope of the applicable federal regulations, the treatment \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 2 of 16\nprogramโs access obligation is triggered and the treatment program must allow the P&A to have \naccess to the facility and its residents.   \nDefendant SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc. (โSafetyNetโ)1 operates a residential treatment \nfacility that fits squarely within the PAIMI Act regulations.  SafetyNet provides care and \ntreatment for a variety of mental health and emotional disorders.  Indeed, SafetyNet has already \nconceded that plaintiff Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (โADAPโ) is entitled to access \nthe part of its facility called the โIntensive Program.โ  Nevertheless, SafetyNet denied ADAP \naccess to its โModerate Program,โ arguing that the children in it have less serious mental health \nand emotional disabilities than the children in the Intensive Program.  \nSafetyNetโs position is based on a misinterpretation of the PAIMI Act that would \nundermine the ability of P&As to protect individuals confined in residential treatment facilities.  \nSafetyNet concedes it provides mental health care to some individuals:  the children in the \nIntensive Program.  Once the court finds as a matter of law that SafetyNet is a facility providing \ncare and treatment to some individuals with mental illness, the PAIMI Act applies to SafetyNet \nand SafetyNet must comply in all respects.   \nThis case presents a straightforward application of the PAIMI Act that is appropriate for \ndisposition as a matter of law.  SafetyNet exists for one purpose:  to provide care and treatment \nfor children with mental health and emotional disorders.  Once a residential facility falls within \nthe ambit of the PAIMI Act, the facility must provide access to all areas that โprovide overnight \ncare accompanied by treatment services . . . including all general areas as well as special mental \nhealth or forensic units.โ  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2.  There could of course be situations in which a \n                                                 \n1  SafetyNet claims it acted on the advice of the Alabama Department of Human Resources \n(โDHRโ) and filed a third-party complaint against DHR for indemnification and contribution.  \nSafetyNet Third Party Complaint at ยถยถ 12-14, 16-17.  For simplicity, we refer to SafetyNet and \nDHR collectively as โSafetyNet.โ \n2 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 3 of 16\ncovered facility includes such distinct and unrelated functions that those distinct functions might \nfall outside the purview of the PAIMI Act โ for example, a general hospital that includes a \npsychiatric ward and also wards for completely separate patients not receiving mental health \ncare.  This is not such a case.  SafetyNetโs Intensive and Moderate Programs both exist to \nprovide for the care and treatment of children with mental health and emotional disabilities, and \nSafetyNet is the type of facility Congress envisioned that the PAIMI Act would cover.  The \nPAIMI Act regulations should be interpreted to mean exactly what they say, and ADAP should \nbe granted reasonable unaccompanied access to SafetyNetโs facilities and residents. \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nThe United States submits this Statement of Interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 517 (1966),2 \nbecause this litigation involves the proper interpretation and application of federal law.  As the \nUnited States has made clear in litigation across the country,3 it has a strong interest in the \ninterpretation of the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801โ10851.  People living in psychiatric \nresidential treatment facilities are isolated from their families and communities, and their ability \nto contact outside advocates is restricted.  In addition, they are often unfamiliar with their rights \nโ including the right under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 12101 \n                                                 \n2  Section 517 provides that the โSolicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, \nmay be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the \ninterests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court of a \nState, or to attend to any other interest of the United States.โ 28 U.S.C. ยง 517.  A submission by \nthe United States pursuant to this provision does not constitute intervention under Rule 24 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n3  See, e.g., Statement of Interest of the United States, Disability Rights Miss. v. Miss. Childrenโs \nHome Servs., 3:13-CV-547-HTW-LRA, (S.D. Miss. Feb. 5, 2014); Statement of Interest of the \nUnited States, Ga. Advocacy Office, Inc., v. Shelp 1:09-CV-2880-CAP (N.D. Ga.

L.C., 527 U.S. 581, \n607 (1999).  The Department of Justice has authority to enforce Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \nยงยง 12133, 12134) and the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997 et seq.  The \nnational network of P&As with โaccess to facilities in the State providing care or treatmentโ (42 \nU.S.C. ยง 10805), play a significant role in ensuring compliance with those laws.  See ADA.gov, \nStatement of the Department of Justice on the Integration Mandate of Title II of the ADA and \nOlmstead v. L.C., http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm#_ftn10 (last updated June 22, \n2011) (providing guidance for ADA and Olmstead enforcement).  Therefore, the United States \noffers the court its understanding of the statutes and regulations at issue in this case. \nFACTS \nADAP is Alabamaโs designated federally funded program authorized to protect and \nadvocate for the civil rights of persons with disabilities in the state.

A \nchildโs treatment team can โat any timeโ determine a childโs placement, which โcould mean a \nstep up to an acute setting or a step down to a less restrictive setting.โ  Third Party Defendant \nDHRโs Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at ยถ 23 (filed Sept. 19, 2014) (โDHR \nBriefโ); see also DHR Brief at 10 (the childโs treatment team โmakes a determination of the \ncontinuing necessity for and appropriateness of the childโs placementโ).   \nIn their motions for summary judgment, ADAP and SafetyNet have submitted \nconsiderable evidence concerning the characteristics of SafetyNetโs Moderate and Intensive \nPrograms.  The United States will not repeat those assertions.  The partiesโ evidentiary \nsubmissions reveal one key area of agreement, however:  All SafetyNet children are there to \nreceive care in a residential setting due to diagnosed mental health or emotional disorders. \nB.  SafetyNet Has Denied ADAP Access to Residents and Facilities in its Moderate \nProgram. \nFor over a year, ADAP repeatedly requested access to monitor SafetyNetโs facility \npursuant to the PAIMI Act.  ADAP Motion ยถ 17.  Neither SafetyNet nor DHR โcontest[ed] \nADAPโs access to those children in SafetyNetโs Intensive Program.โ  DHR Brief at 1.  \n5 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 6 of 16\nNevertheless, SafetyNet denied ADAP access to the Moderate Program.  See SafetyNet \nAdmission Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9.  SafetyNet gave as the grounds for the refusal that โModerate facilities \nare not Intensive treatment programs and are not considered a part of the Psychiatric Services for \nIndividuals under the Age of 21.โ  Answer of Defendant SafetyNet at ยถ 30.  SafetyNet stated that \nit would provide conditional access if there was โan incident or complaint made to ADAP as to \nthe SafetyNetโs [sic] moderate program; or . . .  there is probable cause to believe an incident has \noccurred at SafetyNetโs moderate program.โ  Exhibit 6 to Complaint (emphasis in original).   \nARGUMENT \nCongress enacted the PAIMI Act because โindividuals with mental illness are vulnerable \nto abuse and serious injury,โ and โ[s]tate systems for monitoring compliance with respect to the \nrights of individuals with mental illness vary widely and are frequently inadequate.โ  42 U.S.C. \nยง 10801.  The purpose of the PAIMI Act is โto ensure that the rights of individuals with mental \nillness are protected and to assist States to establish and operate a protection and advocacy \nsystem that will (1) protect and advocate for the rights of those individuals; and (2) investigate \nincidents of abuse and neglect.โ  H.R. Rep. 102-319, November 15, 1991.  It is imperative that \nP&As are able both to independently monitor facilities and to investigate claims of abuse and \nneglect, and the PAIMI Act regulations authorize broad access to facilities and their residents.   \nA.  Under the PAIMI Act Regulations, SafetyNet is a Facility Providing Care or \nTreatment to Individuals with Mental Illness. \nThe PAIMI Act regulations state that โA P&A system shall have reasonable \nunaccompanied access to public and private facilities and programs in the State which render \ncare or treatment for individuals with mental illness . . .โ  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42.  In other words, if \n6 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 7 of 16\nSafetyNet is a facility that renders care or treatment for individuals with mental illness, ADAP is \nentitled to access.  The regulations define those terms as follows: \nโข  โFacility includes any public or private residential setting that provides overnight care \naccompanied by treatment services.  Facilities include, but are not limited to the \nfollowing: general and psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, board and care homes, \ncommunity housing, juvenile detention facilities, homeless shelters, and jails and \nprisons, including all general areas as well as special mental health or forensic units.โ \n \nโข  โIndividual with Mental Illness means an individual who has a significant mental \nillness or emotional impairment, as determined by a mental health professional \nqualified under the laws and regulations of the State and 1) Who is an inpatient or \nresident in a facility rendering care or treatment . . .โ  \n \nโข  โCare or Treatment means services provided to prevent, identify, reduce or stabilize \nmental illness or emotional impairment such as mental health screening, evaluation, \ncounseling, biomedical, behavioral and psychotherapies, supportive or other \nadjunctive therapies, medication supervision, special education and rehabilitation, \neven if only โas neededโ or under a contractual arrangement.โ \n \n42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2. \nSafetyNet does not dispute that it is a โfacility.โ  Nor does it dispute that it provides โcare \nor treatment.โ  SafetyNetโs denial of P&A access is premised on the definition of โIndividual \nwith Mental Illness.โ  If some children do not meet the definition because their mental illness or \nemotional impairment is not โsignificant,โ SafetyNet reasons, then ADAP cannot have access to \nthose children.   \nSafetyNetโs position rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the PAIMI Act \nregulations.  The threshold inquiry is whether SafetyNet does or does not fit within the PAIMI \nAct based on the three definitions.  If SafetyNet is operating a โfacilityโ that provides โcare or \ntreatmentโ to โindividuals with mental illness,โ the PAIMI Act applies to SafetyNet.  In that \nevent, ADAP is entitled to access consistent with the PAIMI Act regulations. \nThe court should reject SafetyNetโs novel proposal that P&A access depends on \nevaluating the diagnoses of residents one-by-one.  Nothing in the PAIMI Act compels a court to \n7 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 8 of 16\nparse the residents of a facility into groups depending on the severity of their mental illness, and \ndoing so would be impractical and counterproductive.  That is especially so when SafetyNet can \nโat any timeโ change a childโs placement, which โcould mean a step up to an acute setting or a \nstep down to a less restrictive setting.โ  DHR Brief at ยถ 23; see also DHR Brief at 10 (the childโs \ntreatment team โmakes a determination of the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the \nchildโs placementโ).  Conditioning ADAPโs access on SafetyNetโs constantly shifting placement \ndecisions would undermine ADAPโs ability to perform functions such as monitoring and \nproviding information to residents.5  \nWith a correct interpretation of the PAIMI Act regulations, this case can be decided as a \nmatter of law without resolving the partiesโ disagreement over the severity of each childโs mental \nhealth condition.  SafetyNet concedes that the children in its Intensive Program โhave been \ndetermined to have severe problems.โ  DHR Brief at 40.  SafetyNet also concedes that ADAP is \nentitled to access the Intensive Program.  DHR Brief at 1.  Once SafetyNetโs facility fits within \nthe PAIMI Act regulations, there is no need to parse children based on their disability or current \nprogram placement because the PAIMI Act regulations grant ADAP access to facility \nโresidents.โ  \nB.  A P&A Is Entitled to Access if Some Facility Residents Fall Within the PAIMI \nAct. \nSafetyNetโs admission that the PAIMI Act applies to its Intensive Program is dispositive \nof the cross-motions for summary judgment.  Once the court concludes that โsomeโ of a \n                                                 \n5  P&As are authorized to, among other things, provide information to residents, monitor and \ntake photographs.  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c)(1-3).  ADAP might wish to speak to groups of residents \nin a cafeteria or observe children in class, for example.  Allowing access to some residents but \nnot others based on SafetyNetโs dynamic classifications of the childrenโs conditions would make \nthese P&A tasks difficult or impossible and introduce needless confusion and disruption. \n8 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 9 of 16\nfacilityโs residents are covered by the PAIMI Act, that finding triggers the P&Aโs access as a \nmatter of law without a showing that all of the residents are covered.   \nCourts that have considered the issue in the context of records access have rejected the \nargument that access can be denied because only some residents have a serious mental illness.  In \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Armstrong, 266 F. Supp.2d \n303, 314 (D. Conn. 2003), the state Department of Corrections denied records access to a P&A \non the ground that the P&A could not establish that the inmates in question โfit the definition of \nโindividuals with a mental illness.โโ  Id. at 314.  The Armstrong court rejected the idea that the \nP&A must make a threshold showing of mental illness to obtain access to inmates.  Instead, \nโevidence that a facility has previously housed individuals who are mentally ill, as well as \nevidence that some current residents may be mentally ill is sufficient under PAIMI to merit \naccess by [P&As].โ  Id. at 314 (emphasis added).   \nThe court in Michigan Protection & Advocacy Service, Inc. v. Miller, 849 F. Supp. 1202, \n1208 (W.D. Mich. 1994), also rejected the argument that access should be denied because only \nsome residents had a mental illness.  There, the Michigan Department of Social Services denied \nP&A access because โthe youth in the system have not recently been determined to be mentally \nill or emotionally impaired by a mental health professional.โ  Id. at 1207.  The P&A offered \nevidence that many Michigan state facilities had in the past housed minors with mental illness as \nwell as recent evidence that โsome current [Department of Social Services] residents may be \nmentally ill.โ  Id. (emphasis added).  The court granted โfull accessโ to the P&A because the \nstateโs policy โdefeats the very purpose of [PAIMI] . . . to provide effective protection and \nadvocacy services to mentally ill . . . individuals.โ  Id.  \n9 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 10 of 16\nThe heart of SafetyNetโs argument is that it can deny access if some residents do not have \na significant mental health illness, even if other residents do.  Defendants are incorrect as a \nmatter of law.  Armstrong and Miller establish that if โsomeโ facility residents have a mental \nillness, that triggers the P&Aโs right of access to monitor the entire facility and its residents to \nthe extent the PAIMI Act regulations allow.  In this situation, ADAP is entitled as a matter of \nlaw to monitor all areas of SafetyNetโs facility to which residents have access, including the \nModerate Program.  \nC.  Because the PAIMI Act Regulations Apply to SafetyNet, ADAP Is Entitled to \nReasonable Unrestricted Access to All Facility Residents. \nOnce the court determines that the PAIMI Act applies to a residential treatment facility, \nthe court must consider the permissible scope and purpose of the P&Aโs access.  The PAIMI Act \nregulations state that P&As are entitled to โreasonable unaccompanied accessโ to residents of the \nfacility:  \n[A] P&A system shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to facilities including all \nareas which are used by residents, are accessible to residents, and to programs and their \nresidents at reasonable times, which at a minimum shall include normal working hours \nand visiting hours.  Residents include adults or minors who have legal guardians or \nconservators.  P&A activities shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with \nfacility programs, respect residents' privacy interests, and honor a resident's request to \nterminate an interview.   \n42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c).   \nPut simply, P&A access is meant to encompass all areas of the facility and all its \nresidents.  โFacilityโ means the โresidential setting that provides overnight care accompanied by \ntreatment services . . . including all general areas as well as special mental health or forensic \nunits.โ  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2.  The regulations do not limit facility access based on the type of or \nlevel of disability โ the sole consideration is whether the facility exists to provide overnight care \n10 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 11 of 16\nand treatment.  So long as the facility provides overnight care accompanied by treatment \nservices, P&As are entitled to access to the residents. \nSafetyNetโs position that facility โresidentsโ can only mean โresidents in the Intensive \nProgramโ is counter to the plain language of the regulations.  The PAIMI Act regulations specify \nthat access is to โresidents.โ  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42.  The drafters of the PAIMI Act regulations could \nhave limited access to โindividuals with significant mental illness,โ but instead chose the \nbroadest possible term:  โresidents.โ  When a court is confronted with a state agency's \ninterpretation of a federal regulation, โthe court must first consider whether the federal regulation \nclearly and unambiguously addresses the question at issue.  If it does, then that is the end of the \nmatter and the court must give effect to the unambiguous language of the regulation.โ  Yelder v. \nHornsby, 666 F. Supp. 1518, 1520 (M.D. Ala. 1987) (finding that the regulatory phrase โactually \nexistsโ cannot be interpreted to mean โfictitiousโ or โimputedโ).  Because the regulations by the \nagency entrusted to administer the PAIMI Act program elucidate and give force to the statute, \nthey are afforded great deference.  See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Def. Council, \nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984) (โWe have long recognized that considerable weight should be \naccorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to \nadminister, and the principle of deference to administrative interpretations.โ).  Here, the plain \nmeaning of โresidentsโ is the children who reside at SafetyNet, and the court should use that \nmeaning in applying the PAIMI Act regulations. \nAllowing access to all SafetyNet residents is consistent with the purpose of the PAIMI \nAct.  If courts interpreted โresidentsโ narrowly to mean โonly the most severely ill residents,โ \nfacilities could keep some residents off-limits simply by classifying them differently.  Rather \nthan rely on a facilityโs unilateral determination of which residents will receive protection and \n11 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 12 of 16\nadvocacy, the drafters mandated that P&As have access to โresidentsโ of the facility and placed \nno limitations on that term.  This broad coverage is also clear from the PAIMI Act regulationsโ \ndefinition of โcare and treatmentโ to include services to โpreventโ mental illness or emotional \nimpairment, including โhealth screening [and] evaluation.โ  The regulations could have limited \ncovered activities to those responding to existing significant mental illness, but, instead, chose to \nexpand access to services, such as those provided in SafetyNetโs Moderate Program, which are \ndesigned to prevent children from developing more serious mental illness. \nThere could, of course, be some types of facilities that serve multiple functions, with \nsome functions that fall within the PAIMI Act and other functions that do not.  Hospitals, for \ninstance, could be โfacilitiesโ within the PAIMI Act for some functions (e.g. psychiatric \nservices) but outside of the PAIMI Act for other functions (e.g. oncology).  In that case, the \nPAIMI Act would apply to that portion of the facility that provides mental health care, so the \nP&A would have access to the psychiatric services areas and general areas but could not venture \ninto the oncology department.  SafetyNetโs division of its facility into Intensive and Moderate \nPrograms for children with mental disorders, however, does not take it outside of the reach of the \nPAIMI Act because both programs concern overnight care accompanied by mental health \ntreatment services. \nD.  SafetyNet Cannot Place Conditions on ADAPโs Access or Dismiss ADAPโs \nFunction as Superfluous. \nAfter disclaiming ADAPโs access to the Moderate Program entirely, SafetyNet tried to \nimpose conditions.  It proposed that access to the SafetyNet Moderate Program be conditioned \nupon:   \na) an incident or complaint made to ADAP as to SafetyNetโs moderate program; or  \n12 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 13 of 16\nb) there is probable cause to believe an incident has occurred at SafetyNetโs moderate \nprogram. \nEx. 6 to Complaint (emphasis in original).   \nSafetyNetโs position rests on a misreading of the regulations.  One PAIMI Act regulation \ndoes grant access to P&As to investigate if there has been a reported incident, a complaint, \nprobable cause or imminent danger.  See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(b).  That access in subsection (b) is \nin addition to subsection (c) access for other purposes, such as monitoring and providing \ninformation to residents.  See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c) (allowing access โ[i]n addition to access as \nprescribed in paragraph (b) of this section . . .โ) (emphasis added).  Thus, ADAP is entitled to \nreasonable unaccompanied access for the purposes outlined in subsection (c) โ providing \ninformation and training, monitoring compliance, and inspecting, viewing and photographing โ \nwithout proof of an incident, complaint, probable cause or imminent danger that would trigger an \ninvestigation under subsection (b).6 \nSafetyNetโs position is also at odds with the purpose of the PAIMI Act.  The Act was \nintended to protect individuals with mental illness by affording broad access rights to protection \nand advocacy organizations.  A central function of these organizations is to conduct monitoring, \neven in the absence of abuse and neglect complaints from residents.  Monitoring activities \ninclude facility visits and also unaccompanied opportunities to speak with residents of the \nfacilities.  The PAIMI Act is undermined if P&As are denied these rights, if they must litigate \n                                                 \n6  SafetyNet cites Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program v. J.S. Tarwater Dev. Ctr., 97 F.3d \n492 (11th Cir. 1996), as the basis for its demand that ADAP demonstrate probable cause or \nreceipt of a complaint.  DHR Brief at 35.  In Tarwater, the P&A sought access to records, which \nby statute is limited to situations in which the P&A demonstrates probable cause or receipt of a \ncomplaint.  Id. at 497.  ADAP is seeking access to monitor and does not seek records, so \nTarwater does not justify the conditions SafetyNet has imposed.    \n13 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 14 of 16\neach time they seek access to a facility and its residents, or if facilities can avoid access by \ncharacterizing some residents as less seriously ill than others.   \nDespite the compelling need articulated by Congress for P&As to monitor facilities that \nprovide care or treatment for individuals with mental illness, SafetyNet suggests that any \nmonitoring ADAP might do is superfluous.  SafetyNet argues that the involvement of parents, \nsocial workers and government is adequate protection for those children it has admitted for \nresidential treatment โ but whose issues SafetyNet deems to be only mild to moderate in severity.  \nDHR Brief at 40-41.  SafetyNetโs opinion about the merits of ADAPโs oversight is beside the \npoint.  Congress passed the PAIMI Act in 1991 to prevent the terrible abuses that can occur in \nfacilities absent effective protection and advocacy.  See H.R. Rep. 102-319, November 15, 1991. \nThe need for thorough and active monitoring is as important now as it was then, and facilities \ncannot block PAIMI Act access simply because they claim no abuse is occurring. \nCONCLUSION \nThe PAIMI Act is a critical component in the system of legal protections for people with \ndisabilities and its words must be given full force and effect.  Congress unambiguously afforded \nprotection and advocacy organizations the authority to access the facilities serving people with \ndisabilities and the individuals themselves.  This court should affirm that the PAIMI Act and \nregulations require facilities to permit reasonable unaccompanied access to all areas that are used \nby or are accessible to residents if the facility provides care and treatment to individuals with \nmental illness. \n   \n14 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 74   Filed 10/14/14   Page 15 of 16\nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nMOLLY J.

(โSafetyNetโ);  2) the motion  for  summary  judgment  \n(Doc.  62) filed  by  Defendant/Third-Party  Plaintiff SafetyNet  on  ADAPโs  claim  \nagainst it;  and  3) the motion  for  summary  judgment  (Doc.  64) filed  by  Third-\nParty  Defendant  Alabama  Department  of Human  Resources  (โDHRโ) on  \nSafetyNetโs  claims  against  it  for  indemnity  and  contribution.  \nSafetyNet  operates  a  residential  facility,  licensed  by  DHR,   which \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 2 of 33 \nprovides  services  and  treatment  for  males,  from  the age 10  years  to the age of \n18  years,  who have certain  behavioral  and  mental  health  needs.   It  provides  \nboth  a  Moderate Residential  Service (โmoderate programโ) and   an  Intensive \nResidential  Service (โintensive programโ).   ADAP is  Alabamaโs  designated,  \nfederally  funded  program  authorized  by  Congress  to protect  and  advocate for  \nthe civil  rights  of persons  with  disabilities  in  Alabama.  \nThe issues  involved  in  the motions  require the Court  to  determine  \nwhether  ADAP  may  legally  access  SafetyNetโs  moderate program  over  the \nobjections  of DHR.   ADAP,  seeking  injunctive and  declaratory  relief,  alleges  \nSafetyNet  failed  or  refused  to provide ADAP access  to monitor  all  programs  \nat  its  facility,  in  violation  of  the Protection  and  Advocacy  for  Mentally  Ill  \nIndividuals  Act  (โPAMIIโ),  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง 10801  โ  10851  (2012); the Protection  \nand  Advocacy  for  Individuals  with  Developmental  Disabilities  statutes  \n(โPADDโ),  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง 15041  โ  15045  (2012); and  the Protection  and  \nAdvocacy  of Individual  Rights  statute  (โPAIRโ), 29 U.S.C. ยง  794e  (2012).  (Doc.  \n1, pp. 1 โ  2, 10).  SafetyNet  answered  ADAPโs  complaint  (Doc.  7) and  filed  a  \nthird-party  complaint  against  DHR  (Doc.  8),  requesting  indemnification  and  \ncontribution  from  the state agency.  SafetyNet  alleges  DHR  told  it  not  to allow  \nADAP access  to the moderate program.  (Doc.  8,  p.  3).  ADAP,  SafetyNet,  and  \nDHR  subsequently  filed  motions  for  summary  judgment.  (Docs.  62,  63,  64, \n70).  All  three parties  responded,  opposing  each  otherโs  motions.  (Docs.  71,  72,  \n73).  SafetyNet  and DHR  then  filed  their  replies.  (Docs.  75,  76,  77).  The  \n  2\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 3 of 33 \nDepartment  of Justice filed  a  Statement  of Interest  supporting  ADAPโs  \nposition.  (Doc.  74).  After  careful  consideration,  the Court  finds  that  ADAPโs  \nmotion  for  summary  judgment  is  due to be granted  for  the reasons  set  forth  \nherein,  and  SafetyNetโs  motion  for  summary  judgment  and  request  for  \nindemnification  and  contribution  are  due to be denied. DHRโs  motion  for  \nsummary  judgment  is  also  due to be denied.  \n \nI.   FACTS  \n \nThe dispute began  in  October  2012,  when  ADAP  sought  access  to a \nstate-licensed  facility,  SafetyNet,  which  provides  residential  care and  \ntreatment  to  male youths  with  behavioral  health  needs.  (Doc.  62,  Exh. 1, p. 2;  \nExh. 3, p. 1 โ  5;  Doc.  63,  Exh.  2,  p.  8). The parties  agree ADAP is  allowed  \naccess  to the intensive program  at  the facility.  (Doc.  65,  p.  4).  The dispute lies  \nin  whether  ADAP may  access  the moderate program.   \nA.  The  Moderate  Program  \nThe intensive and  moderate programs  at  the SafetyNet  facility  provide  \na  residential  setting  with  overnight  care for  males  ages  10- to 18-years-old.  \n(Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  1).  Residents  in  the intensive and  moderate programs  are \nhoused  separately  at  the facility.  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  2).  โIntensive residential  \nservices  are provided  in  a  more restrictive setting,โ  (Doc.  65,  p.  12),  whereas  \nthe moderate program  is  less  restrictive.  (Doc.  65,  pp.  18  โ  19).  DHR  \ngenerally  โpursues  the least  restrictive setting  โฆ possible [for  the child].โ  \n  3\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 4 of 33 \n(Doc.  65,  p.  12).  \nAccording  to the DHR  Moderate Residential  Services  for  Children  \nRequest  for  Proposals  (โRFPโ), the moderate program  is  specifically  intended  \nto provide:  \n[R]oom,  board  and  an  array  of services  for  a  child  with  moderate \nand/or  serious  emotional  and/or  behavioral  management  \nproblems  that  interfere with  the childโs  ability  to function  in  the \nfamily,  school  and/or  community  setting  in  other  than  a  \nresidential  environment.  Moderate placement  services  are \nlimited  to children  whose needs  cannot  be met  in  their  own  \nhome,  traditional  foster  home,  basic  residential  care,  or  children  \nwho have reached  their  treatment  goals  in  a  more restrictive \nsetting  and  are ready  to be โstepped  down.โ  (Doc.  66,  Exh.  15,  \npp. 17, 36).  \n \nAdditionally,  the moderate program  serves  only  youth  with a \nโDiagnostic  &  Statistical Manual, Fifth  Edition  (DSM-V) diagnosed  \nmental  illness  from  a  psychological  evaluation  conducted  within  the \npast  24  months.โ  (Doc.  66,  Exh.  15,  pp.  17,  36).1  Individuals with a \ndiagnosis  of mental  retardation  are excluded  from  moderate programs,  \nunless  DHR  makes  an  exception.  (Doc.  65,  p.  27;  Doc.  66,  Exh.  10,  p.  8).  \nModerate programs  also exclude individuals  who pose a  substantial  \nrisk  to the safety  of others,  individuals  who need  frequent  physical  \nmanagement  because of aggressive behavior  or  require intensive \nbehavioral  modification  strategies,  and  individuals  identified  as  sex  \noffenders.  (Doc.  65,  p.  27).   \n                                            \n1  The 2009  RFP cited  the Fourth  Edition  (DSM-IV) of the manual.  (Doc.  66,  \nExh. 15, p. 17)  \n  4\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 5 of 33 \nIn  general,  โ[m]oderate residential  facilities  are rehabilitative \nand  group  home in  focus  where individual  basic  living  skills  and  group  \nand individual  counseling  are emphasized.โ  (Doc.  65,  p.  25).  To help  \ncare for  moderate program  residents,  SafetyNet  provides  daily  \ninstruction  on  basic  living  skills.  (Doc.  65,  pp. 13, 18).  SafetyNet  also \nprovides  its  moderate program  residents  with  individual and  group  \ncounseling,  crisis  intervention,  psychiatric  services,  psychological  \ntesting,  medication  monitoring  and  administering,  mental  health  \nconsultations,  constant  adult  supervision,  and  special  education. (Doc.  \n63, Exh. 2, p. 8; Doc.  65,  pp.  13,  18).   \nBetween  January  1, 2012,  and August  31,  2014,  the moderate \nprogram  at  SafetyNet  housed  forty-two children  with  a  variety  of \ndiagnoses,  which  included:  Bi-Polar  Disorder,  Major  Depressive \nDisorder,  Mood  Disorder,  Complex  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  \nwith mixed  Disturbance of Emotions  (anxiety) and  Conduct,  \nGeneralized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Oppositional  Defiant  Disorder,  \nPersistent  Depressive Disorder,  Aspergerโs  Disorder,  Disruptive \nBehavior  Disorder,  Pervasive Developmental  Disorder,  Disorder  of \nWritten  Expression,  Dysthymic  Disorder,  Reactive Attachment  \nDisorder,  Anxiety  Disorder,  Intermittent  Explosive Disorder,  Learning  \nDisorder  NOS,  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  \nDepressive Disorder,  Conduct  Disorder,  Adjustment  Disorder  with  \n  5\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 6 of 33 \nmixed  disturbance of emotion  and  Conduct.  (Doc.  70,  pp.  2  โ  3;  Doc.  70,  \nExh. 1, pp. 4 โ  7).  Approximately  72% of the residents  took  medication  \nto treat  a  psychiatric  condition,  mental  disorder,  emotional  disorder,  or  \na  behavioral  disorder  during  this  period.  (Doc.  63,  Exh.  2,  p.  10).  \nPursuant  to  the DSM-V,  many  of the listed  disorders  are  not  โstaticโ  \nbut are  diagnosed  on  a  continuum  from  โmoderateโ  to โsevere.โ  (Doc.  \n65, p. 28;  Doc.  72,  p.  6).  Thus  depending  on  the individual  needs  of \nresidents  in  the moderate program,  it  is  possible that  they  can  be \nโstepped  upโ  to an  acute setting  or  โstepped  downโ  to a  less  restrictive \nsetting  following  an  evaluation.  (Doc.  65,  pp.  20  โ  21).   \nB.  Refusing  ADAP  Access to  the  Moderate  Program  \nFrom  October  2012  to October  2013,  ADAP wrote to SafetyNet,  \nrequesting,  but  never  gaining,  direct  physical  access  to the moderate \nprogram.  (Doc.  63,  Exh.  2,  p.  12;  Doc.  72,  p.  2).  ADAP also tried  to monitor  \nthe moderate program  during  this  period.  (Doc.  63,  Exh.  2,  p.  12).  SafetyNet,  \nadhering  to โexplicit  instructionsโ  from  DHR,  continuously  denied  ADAP \naccess  to the moderate program.  (Doc.  8,  p.  2;  Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  pp.  2  โ  3).   \nOn  October  7,  2013,  ADAP sent  a  demand  letter  to SafetyNet  (Doc.  62,  \nExh.  5,  p.  1),  threatening  suit  if SafetyNet  again  refused  them  access.  \nSafetyNet  called  DHR  to โconfirm  that  it  was  still  [DHRโs] position  that  \nADAP did  not  have authority  to access  residents  in  the Moderate Program.โ  \n(Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  3).  On  October  10,  2013,  Sharon  Ficquette,  DHR  General  \n  6\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 7 of 33 \nCounsel,  responded  to ADAP in  writing.  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  6,  p.  1).  Ficquetteโs  \nletter  said  โ[DHR] and  SafetyNet  agree to access  by  ADAP to SafetyNetโs  \nmoderate program  based  upon  Eleventh  Circuit  standard  for  intensive \nprograms  as  set  out  in  the case of Alabama  Disabilities  Advocacy Program  v.  \nJ.S.  Tarwater  Developmental Ctr.,  97  F.3d  492  (11th  Cir.  1996).โ  (Doc.  62,  \nExh.  6,  p.  1;  Doc.  65,  p.  5).  Based  on  this  case,  the letter  further  stated,  \nโaccess  to the SafetyNet  Moderate Program  is  conditioned  uponโ  โan  incident  \nor  complaint  made to ADAPโ  about  the program;  or  โprobable cause to believe \nan  incident  has  occurredโ  at  the program.  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  6,  p.  1).  DHR  also \nasserted,  โModerate facilities  are not  Intensive treatment  programs  and  are \nnot  considered  a  part  of the Psychiatric  Services  for  Individuals  under  the \nAge of 21.โ  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  6,  pp.  2  โ  3;  Doc.  65,  p.  7).  Therefore,  DHR  did  not  \nbelieve ADAP had the  right to  access  or  monitor  the moderate program.  (Doc.  \n62,  Exh.  6,  p.  2).   \nDHR  argues  โ[t]his  case involves  a  fundamental  difference in  the \nconcept  and  purpose of moderate residential  services  between  ADAP and  \n [DHR]. [DHR]  maintains  that  the moderate services  program  is  not  \naccessible to ADAP.โ  (Doc.  65,  p.  4).  SafetyNet  argues  it  is  caught in a Catch-\n22:  it  can  either  comply  with  ADAP and  violate the orders  of DHR, its \nlicensing  authority,  or  follow  the advice of DHR  and  violate federal  law.  (Doc.  \n62,  Exh.  1,  p.  7).  SafetyNet  asserts  it  โdoes  not,  nor  has  it  ever,  objected  to \ngranting  ADAP access  to residents  in  SafetyNetโs  Moderate Program.  \n  7\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 8 of 33 \nSafetyNet  has  and  continues  to comply  with  the explicit  instructions  of its  \nlicensing  agency,  [DHR].โ  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  5).  ADAP states  SafetyNet  \nviolated  its  federal  right  to access  the  facility,  thereby  preventing  it  from  \nโconducting  statutorily-authorized  monitoring  activities  designed  to protect  \nthe civil  rights  and  safety  of individuals  with  disabilities.โ  (Doc.  63,  Exh.  2,  p.  \n1 โ  2).   \nII.   STANDARD OF  REVIEW  \n \nThe court  may  grant  summary  judgment  โif the movant  shows  that  \nthere is  no genuine dispute as  to any  material  fact  and  the movant  is  entitled  \nto judgment  as  a  matter  of law.โ  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  56(a).  The substantive law  \napplicable to the case determines  what  is  material.  Lofton  v.  Secโy  of Depโt  of \nChildren  &  Family  Servs., 358  F.3d  804,  809  (11th  Cir.  2004),  cert.  den.,  534  \nU.S.  1081  (2005).  If the nonmoving  party  fails  to make โa  sufficient  showing  \non  an  essential  element  of her  case with  respect  to which  she has  the burden  \nof proof,โ  the moving  party  is  entitled  to summary  judgment.  Celotex  Corp.  v.  \nCatrett,  477  U.S.  317,  323  (1986).   \nIn  evaluating  the movantโs  arguments,  the court  must  view  all  \nevidence and  resolve all  doubts  in  the light  most  favorable to the nonmovant.  \nBurton  v.  City  of Belle Glade,  178  F.3d  1175,  1187  (11th Cir.  1999).  โIf \nreasonable minds  might  differ  on  the inferences  arising  from  undisputed  \nfacts,  then  [the  court] should  deny  summary  judgment.โ  Hinesville Bank  v.  \nPony  Express  Courier  Corp.,  868  F.2d  1532,  1535  (11th  Cir.  1989).  The basic  \n  8\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 9 of 33 \nissue before the  court  then  is  โwhether  the evidence presents  a  sufficient  \ndisagreement  to require submission  to a  jury  or  whether  it  is  so one-sided  \nthat  one party  must  prevail  as  a  matter  of law.โ  Anderson  v.  Liberty  Lobby,  \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 251โ52  (1986).  The mere existence of any  factual  dispute \nwill  not  automatically  necessitate denial  of a  motion  for  summary  judgment;  \nrather,  only  factual  disputes  that  are material  preclude entry  of summary  \njudgment.  Lofton,  358  F.3d  at  809.  \nIII.   THE STATUTES  AND REGULATIONS  AT  ISSUE  \n \nPADD,  PAMII,  and  PAIR  help  protect  and  advance the interests  of \nthose with  mental  illness  or  developmental  disabilities.  Collectively,  these \nlaws  grant  a  stateโs  protection  and  advocacy  system  (โP&Aโ)  the powers  to \ninvestigate allegations  of abuse and  neglect,  respond  to rights  violations,  and  \nprovide general  advocacy  services  on  behalf of state residents  with  \ndisabilities  or  mental  illness.2  See  Ala. Disabilities  Advocacy  Program  v.  J.S.  \nTarwater  Developmental  Ctr.,  97  F.3d  492,  497  (11th  Cir.  1996) (discussing \nโbroad  remedial  frameworkโ  of the  P&A  laws).  The statutes  grant  each  P&A \ncertain  rights  and  responsibilities, including the  authority  to โpursue legal,  \n                                            \n2  The statutes  authorizing  the PAMII  P&A  systems  are currently  codified  in  \n42  U.S.C.  ยงยง 10801  โ  10851,  and  the corresponding  regulations  are found  in  \n42  C.F.R.  part  51.  The PADD  P&A  systems  are currently  codified  in  42  \nU.S.C.  ยงยง 15041  โ  15045,  and  the corresponding  regulations  are found  in  45  \nC.F.R.  parts  1385,  1386,  1387,  and  1388.  The PAIR  P&A  systems  are \ncurrently  codified  in  29  U.S.C.  ยง 794e,  and  the corresponding  regulations  are \nfound  in  34  C.F.R.  part  381.  The United  States  Code is  published  every  six  \nyears,  so each  citation  to the statutes  refers  to the 2012  version  unless  \notherwise stated.  The Code of Federal  Regulations  is  updated  annually,  so \neach  citation  to the regulations  refers  to the 2014  edition.  \n  9\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 10 of 33 \nadministrative,  and  other  appropriate remediesโ  on  behalf of individuals  with  \ndisabilities.  42 U.S.C.  ยง 15043(a)(2)(A)(i); see  also  ยง 10805(a)(1)(B) (giving  \nP&A  the authority  to โpursue administrative,  legal,  and  other  appropriate \nremedies  to ensure the protection  of individuals  with  mental  illness  who are \nreceiving  care  or  treatment  in  the Stateโ).  \nTo โcarry  out  the purposeโ  of the laws,  the statutes  and  regulations  \nexpressly  provide each  P&A  with  access  authority  to 1) individuals,  2) \nrecords,  and  3) public  and  private facilities. 42 U.S.C. ยงยง  15043(a)(2)(H);  \n10805(a)(3) (authorizing  โaccess  to facilities  in  the State providing  care or  \ntreatmentโ);  see  also  Tarwater  Developmental  Ctr.,  97  F.  3d  at  497  (โIt  is  \nclear  that  the Act  provides  express  authority  for  P&As  to gain  broad  access  to \nrecords,  facilities,  and  residents  to ensure that  the Actโs  mandates  can  be \neffectively  pursued.โ).  P&A  access  to individuals  is  authorized  โat  reasonable \ntimes  . . .  in  a  location  in  which  services,  supports,  and  other  assistance are \nprovided  to such  an  individual.โ42  U.S.C.  ยง 15043(a)(2)(H);  see  also  42  C.F.R.  \nยง 51.42(c)  (โa  P&A  system  shall  have reasonable unaccompanied  access  to \nfacilities  including  all  areas  which  are used  by  residents,  are accessible to \nresidents,  and  to programs  and  their  residents  at  reasonable times,  which  at  \na  minimum  shall  include normal  working  hours  and  visiting  hoursโ) \n(emphasis  added).  P&A  access  to the records  of individuals  with  mental  \nillness  or  disabilities  is  also authorized;  and,  in  certain  situations,  a  P&A  \nmay  access  records  without  consent  of either  the individual  or  her  legal  \n  10\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 11 of 33 \nguardian. 42 U.S.C.  ยงยง 10805(a)(4);  15043(a)(2)(I).  Additionally,  P&A  access  \nto individuals  and  records  is  available at  any  time for  the purposes  of \nconducting  a  โfull  investigation  of an  incident  of abuse or  neglect.โ  42  C.F.R.  ยง \n51.42(b);  45  C.F.R.  ยง 1386.22(f).  Where a  P&A  is  not  investigating  a  specific  \nincident,  it  is  entitled  to access  facilities  โat  reasonable timesโ  for  the \npurposes  of general  advocacy  (for  example,  the distribution  of information  or  \nroutine health  and  safety  monitoring).  42  C.F.R.  ยง 51.42(c);  45  C.F.R.  ยง \n1386.22(g);  see  also  42  C.F.R.  ยง 51.31(c) (a P&A  โshould  establish  an  ongoing  \npresence in  residential  mental  health  care or  treatment  facilities,  and  \nrelevant  hospital  unitsโ).  Because the statutes  and  regulations  applicable to \nthis action  are numerous,  they  are discussed  in  more detail  below.    \nA.  PADD  \nIn 1975, Congress  passed  the Developmental  Disabled  Assistance and  \nBill  of  Rights Act  (the โDD  Actโ).  Pub.  L.  94-103,  89  Stat.  486  (1975).  The DD  \nAct  offered  federal  funding  to assist  states  in  providing  services  to individuals  \nwith  developmental  disabilities.  To receive this  funding,  states  were required  \nto establish  a  โsystem  to protect  and  advocate the rights  of persons  with  \ndevelopmental  disabilities.โ  42  U.S.C.  ยง 6012  (1975);  Pub.  L.  94-103, 89 Stat. \n504.  At  that  time,  the DD  Act  defined  developmental  disability  to include \nspecific  conditions  (e.g.,  mental  retardation  and  other  conditions  closely  \nrelated  to mental  retardation,  cerebral  palsy,  epilepsy,  autism,  and  dyslexia),  \nthat originated  prior  to age 18,  were  expected  to  continue indefinitely,  and  \n  11\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 12 of 33 \nconstituted  a substantial handicap. 42  U.S.C.  ยง 6001(7) (1975).  In  1978,  \nCongress  amended  the DD Act by raising  the age of onset  to 22,  deleted  all  \nreferences  to specific  handicapping  conditions,  and  effectively  broadened  the \ndefinition  of โdevelopmental  disabilitiesโ  by  basing  it  on  functional  \nlimitations.

Congress  also made clear  โthe overall  purposeโ  \nof the DD  Act  is  โto assure that  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  \nreceive the care,  treatment,  and  other  services  necessary  to enable them  to \nachieve their  maximum  potential  through  a  system  which  coordinates,  \nmonitors,  plans,  and  evaluates  those services  and  which  ensures  the \nprotection  of legal  and  human  rights  of persons  with  developmental  \ndisabilities.โ  Id.  at 3004.  \nIn 2000, Congress  repealed  the 1975 DD Act and  replaced  it  with  the \nDevelopmental  Disabilities  Assistance and  Bill  of Rights  Act  of 2000.  Pub.  L.  \nNo.  106-402, 114 Stat. 1677  (codified  as  amended  at  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง 15001  โ  \n15115  (2012)).  In  doing  so,  Congress  specifically  included  the need  for  \nโprotection  and  advocacy  systems  in  each  State to protect  the legal  and  \nhuman  rights  of individuals  with  developmental  disabilitiesโ  as  one of  the \nprimary  purposes  of the law. 42  U.S.C.  ยง 15001(b)(2).  The 2000  DD  Act  \nredefined  โdevelopmental  disabilityโ  and  again  framed  it  in  terms  of a  \npersonโs  functional  limitations,  instead  of referring  to any  specific  diseases  or  \n  12\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 13 of 33 \ncauses.  42  U.S.C.  ยง 15002(8);3  see  also  Tenn.

The legislative history  of the DD  Act  shows  that  Congress  has \nconsistently  sought  to assist  all  developmentally  disabled  persons,  and  has \nroutinely  acted  to ensure P&As are  empowered  by  law.   \n \n                                            \n3  The statute defines  โdevelopmental  disabilityโ  as  follows:   \n(A) In  general  \nThe term  โdevelopmental  disabilityโ  means  a  severe,  chronic  disability  of an  \nindividual that โ   \n(i)\t   is  attributable to a  mental  or  physical  impairment  or  combination  \nof mental  and  physical  impairments;   \n(ii)\t   is  manifested  before the individual  attains  age 22;   \n(iii)\t   is  likely  to continue indefinitely;   \n(iv)\t   results  in  substantial  functional  limitations  in  3  or  more of the \nfollowing  areas  of major  life activity:   \n(I)\t        Self-care.   \n(II)\t     Receptive and  expressive language.   \n(III)\t   Learning.   \n(IV)\t   Mobility.   \n(V)\t     Self-direction.   \n(VI)\t   Capacity  for  independent  living.   \n(VII)\t   Economic  self-sufficiency;  and   \n(v)\t   reflects  the individualโs  need  for  a  combination  and  sequence of \nspecial,  interdisciplinary,  or  generic  services,  individualized  \nsupports,  or  other  forms  of assistance that  are of lifelong  or  \nextended  duration  and  are individually  planned  and  coordinated.   \n(B) An  individual  from  birth  to age 9,  inclusive,  who has  a  substantial  \ndevelopmental  delay  or  specific  congenital  or  acquired  condition,  may  be \nconsidered  to have a  developmental  disability  without  meeting  3  or  more of \nthe criteria  described  in  clauses  (i) through  (v) of subparagraph  (A) if the \nindividual,  without  services  and  supports,  has  a  high  probability  of  meeting  \nthose criteria  later  in  life.  42  U.S.C.  ยง 15002(8).   \n  13\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 14 of 33 \nB.

There is  \nalso evidence that  some residents  in  the moderate program  may  suffer  from  \nmental  illness  or  developmental  disabilities  based  on  the diagnoses  of  those  \nresidents  and  their  need  for  involved,  daily  care and  support.  (Doc.  63,  Exh.  \n2, p. 24; Doc.  70,  pp.  2  โ  4).  Moreover,  PAIR  expands  on  the rights  and  \nprotections  created  by  PAMII  and  PADD,  and  includes  individuals  with  \ndisabilities  who do not  otherwise  qualify  for  services  under  those  statutes.  29  \nU.S.C.  ยง 794e.  If  a  child  diagnosed  with  โmajor  depressive disorderโ  or  \nโpervasive developmental  disorder,โ  for  example,  is  not  considered  disabled  \nfor  the purposes  of PADD  or  to have a  mental  illness  for  the purposes  of \nPAMII,  that  child  may  nevertheless  be subject  to PAIR.  Regardless,  ADAP  is \nentitled  access  to the  intensive and  moderate programs  at  SafetyNet  in \naccordance with  PAMII.   \nDHR,  however,  tries  to argue that  โthe plain  meaning  of the statutesโ  \ndifferentiates  between  โsevereโ  and  โmoderateโ  mental  illness  or  disability, \nand  individuals  with  only  โmoderateโ  illness  or  disability  are not  afforded  \nP&A  protection.  (Doc.  65,  pp.  33  โ  35).  For  this  argument,  DHR  contends  \nโsignificant  mental  illness,โ  42  U.S.C.  ยง  10802(4),  and  โsevere,  chronic  \ndisability,โ 42 U.S.C. ยง  15002(8)(A),  means  โmore than  just  a  diagnosis.โ  (Doc.  \n65, pp.  31  - 36, 43;  Doc.  72,  pp. 13, 15).  The Court  disagrees,  and  finds  that  \nthe statutes  and  regulations  do not  state that  individuals  with  โmoderateโ  \nmental  illness  or  developmental  disability  are excluded  from  P&A  services.  \n  20\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 21 of 33 \nNothing  in  the legislative history  of the P&A  system  suggests  that Congress  \nsought  to restrict  P&As  from  serving  individuals  with  โmoderateโ  mental  \nillness  or  disabilities.  To the contrary,  the statutes  and  regulations  speak  of \ngeneral  access  to residents  and  facilities, e.g.,  42  C.F.R.  ยง 51.42(c),  and  the \ndefinitions  of mental  illness  and  developmental  disability  are intentionally  \nbroad  in  scope.  Congress  also expanded  P&A  reach  by  enacting  PAIR  to \nspecifically  cover  individuals  not  protected  by  PADD  or  PAMII. DHRโs  \nargument  that  moderately  ill  or  developmentally  disabled  individuals  are \nexcluded  from  P&A  oversight  is  without  merit.  \nFurthermore,  assuming  for  the sake of argument  that  the law  requires  \nโmore than  just  a  diagnosis,โ  that  heightened  standard  is  met  here.  Residents  \nin  the moderate program  receive regular  care and  instruction  on  โbasic  living  \nskills  for  a  minimum  of 2  hours  daily,โ  counseling,  medication,  mental  \nconsultations,  bi-weekly  contact  with  a  therapist,  and  bi-weekly  group  \ntherapy,  among  other  things.  (Doc.  65,  pp.  18  โ  19).  Residents  are placed  in  \nthe moderate program  because the โchildโs  needs  can  only  be met  in  a  more \nrestrictive placement.โ  (Doc.  65,  p.  12;  Doc.  66,  Exh.  15,  pp.  17,  36).  The \nresidents  thus  need  care that  extends  beyond  a  mere diagnosis,  and  they  \nreceive several  treatment  options  and  individualized  service plans  for  their  \nbehavioral  health  needs.     \nMoreover,  SafetyNet  is  operating  a  โfacilityโ  that  provides  โcare or  \ntreatmentโ  to โindividuals  with  mental  illness.โ  42  C.F.R.  ยง 51.42(b).  \n  21\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 22 of 33 \nSafetyNet  is  not,  for  instance,  a  hospital  that  is  fixing  broken  bones  on  one \nside and  providing  some patients  with  psychiatric  care on  the other.  (Doc.  74,  \np.  2).  Indeed,  SafetyNet  exists  for  one purpose:  to provide care and  treatment  \nfor  children  with  a  variety  of mental  health  and  emotional  disorders.  This  \nputs  it  squarely  under  the purview  of PAMII.  Nothing  in  the statutes,  \nregulations,  or  legislative history  suggests  that  P&A  access  is  determined  one  \nresident  at  a  time.  Nor  is  P&A  access  limited  to only  those residents  with  the \nmost  severe mental  illness,  especially  when  SafetyNet  can  at  any  time \nchange a  childโs  placement  to a  more or  less  restrictive setting.   \nDHR  also relies  on  Alabamaโs  Medicaid  statutes  and  regulations  for  its  \nposition.  (Doc.  65,  pp. 36 โ  37;  Doc.  77,  pp.  5  โ  7).  The Medicaid  rules  do not  \ntrump  PADD,  PAMII,  or  PAIR,  nor  do the rules  control  the interpretation  of \nthese  federal  laws. States  and  state-licensed  facilities  must  comply  with  \nfederal  law.  See  MโCulloch  v.  Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 435 (1819) (discussing  \nstate laws  in  relation  to  the Supremacy  Clause).   \nAdditionally,  DHR  cannot  successfully  argue that  PADD,  PAMII,  or  \nPAIR  do  not  apply  to SafetyNet  because certain  Medicaid  services  are billed  \non  an  outpatient  basis.  (Doc.  65,  p.  9).  The statutes  make clear  that  P&A  \nsystems  are afforded  monitoring  and  access  rights  to individuals  with  mental  \nillness  or  disability  even  when  they  are not  residing  full-time in  a  facility.  \nCongress  designed  PAMII  to protect  individuals  with  mental  illness  who live \nand  receive treatment  outside of inpatient  treatment  facilities.  42 U.S.C.  ยงยง \n  22\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 23 of 33 \n10802(3),  (4)(B);  10841(3)(C); Conn.

The argument  \nthat  ADAP cannot  access  the moderate program  because some of the services  \nprovided  by  that  program  are considered  โoutpatientโ  services  under  the \nstate Medicaid  regulations  fails.   \nIt  is  also  perplexing  that  DHR  โthought  it  best  to follow  the Tarwater  \ncase to resolve issues  with  ADAP.โ  (Doc.  65,  p.  38).  Tarwater  is  a  case about  \nrecords,  not  facility  access  or  monitoring,  and  it  analyzed  whether  an \nanonymous  telephone call  implying  that  abuse or  neglect  may  have caused  \ndeath  constituted  a  โcomplaintโ  and  established  probable cause  for  purposes  \nof gaining  record  access.  97  F.3d  492,  496  (11th  Cir.  1996).6  DHR  and \nSafetyNet  cannot  claim  that  Tarwater  applies  to the moderate program, and \nyet  deny  ADAP access  to monitor  its  facility  and moderate program  residents. \nIn  doing  so,  DHR  and  SafetyNet  essentially  decided  they  must  comply  only  \nwith some provisions  of the P&A  statutes  and  regulations.  DHR  and \nSafetyNet  do not  get  to  conveniently  pick  and  choose which  provisions  of \nfederal  law  they  will  ignore.   \n                                            \n6  Notably,  PAMII  and  its  regulations  have been  amended  since Tarwater.  \n  23\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 24 of 33 \nDHR  also complains  that  giving  ADAP โaccess  to moderate really  \nunderminesโ  the work  performed  by  SafetyNet  and  the state.  (Doc.  72,  p.  13).  \nTo be clear,  the focus  here is  not  on  any  party  โunderminingโ  the other.  The \npriority  remains  the safety,  health,  and  well  being  of SafetyNetโs  residents,  \nand all  individuals  served  by  the P&A  system.    \nC.

The access  authority  is  one \nof the most  important  features  of the  P&A  system.  The  three primary  types  of \naccess  - to individuals,  their  records,  and  the facilities  or  residences  in  which  \nthey  live  - are key  to ensuring  the P&A  system  fulfills  its  Congressional  \npurpose.

This  means  ADAP is  authorized  to \nmonitor  both  the intensive and  moderate programs.  Furthermore,  ADAP is  \nallowed  โreasonable accessโ  to the facility  as  required  by  law.  The \nregulations,  discussed  above,  are helpful  in  outlining  what  is  considered  \nโreasonable.โ  To clarify,  ADAP is  entitled  access  to the residents  and  facilities  \nat SafetyNet  to perform  its  monitoring  and  educating  functions,  despite the \nlack  of a  court  order,  an  investigation,  or  a  complaint.  DHR  and  SafetyNet  \nthwarted  the purpose of the P&A  system  by  refusing  to grant  ADAP  any \naccess  whatsoever  to the moderate program.  Such  inaction  clearly  violates  \nfederal  law.   \nP&A  access  is  broad,  but  it  is  not  unfettered.  P&As  must  conduct  their  \nactivities  โso as  to minimize interference with  facility  programs,  respect  \nresidentsโ  privacy  interests,  and  honor  a  residentโs  request  to terminate an  \ninterview.โ  42  C.F.R.  ยง 51.42(c).  โReasonable  accessโ  must  also take into \naccount  the distinctions  between  the right  of access  to facilities  versus  the \nright  of access  to patients,  as  well  as  between  the right  of access  for  \nmonitoring  purposes  versus  the right  of access  for  educating  or  advocacy  \npurposes.  When  a  P&A  system  exercises  its  monitoring  function,  reasonable \naccess  includes  unannounced  access.  If it  is  monitoring  the program,  the  P&A \nsystem  may  inspect,  view,  and  photograph  those areas  to which  it  has  access, \n                                                                                                                                  \nor  developmentally  disabled.โ).   \n \n  26  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 27 of 33 \nand  photograph  patients  under  strict  guidelines.  When  a  P&A  system  \nexercises  its  educating  function,  reasonable access  does  not  include \nunannounced  access.  Giving  at  least  24-hours  notice before accessing  \nfacilities  and  exercising  this  function  is  reasonable.  DHR  complained  that  an  \nADAP representative interrupted  a  classroom  session  in  the intensive \nprogram  to announce her  name and  provide materials  to the residents.  (Doc.  \n77, pp. 15 โ  16).  When  planning  to engage with  residents  for  educating  \npurposes,  ADAP should  provide notice before entering  the classroom  and  \nrefrain  from  interrupting.    \nFinally,  this  Court  ORDERS  ADAP and  SafetyNet  to meet  and  \nprepare a  protocol  with  respect  to situations  in  which  ADAP  requests  access  \nbut  lacks  a  court  order,  a  complaint,  or  an  investigation.  See,  e.g., Protection  \n&  Advocacy  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  Freudenthal,  412  F.  Supp.  2d  1211,  1212  (D.  Wyo.  \n2006)  (submitting  โAccess  Agreementโ  for  court  approval).   This protocol \nmust  be  submitted to  the  Court  for approval  no  later than  January  \n30, 2015.   Furthermore,  this  Court  strongly  encourages  ADAP  and DHR  to \ndevelop  a  standard  protocol  that  will  govern  to what  extent  ADAP  will \nrequest  access  to a  facility,  and  to distribute the protocol  to facilities  ADAP  \nserves  within Alabama.  In  the end,  the parties  in  this  case have the same \ninterests  in  mindโthe best  interests  of the  SafetyNet  residentsโand  should  \nwork  together  to serve those common  interests.   \n \n  27\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 28 of 33 \nD.  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF  \nA  plaintiff seeking  a  permanent  injunction  must  satisfy  a  four-factor  \ntest  before a  district  court  may  grant  such  relief.  โA  plaintiff must  \ndemonstrate:  (1) that  it  has  suffered  an  irreparable injury;  (2) that  remedies  \navailable at  law,  such  as  monetary  damages,  are inadequate to compensate \nfor  that  injury;  (3) that,  considering  the balance of hardships  between  the \nplaintiff and  defendant,  a  remedy  in  equity  is  warranted;  and  (4) that  the \npublic  interest  would  not  be disserved  by  a  permanent  injunction.โ  eBay  Inc.  \nv.  MercExchange,  L.L.C.,  547  U.S.  388,  391  (2006) (citations  omitted).  In  this  \ncase,  ADAP satisfies  each  factor.  (Doc.  73,  pp.  9  โ  10).  It  has  suffered  an  \nirreparable injury  by  being  denied  access  to fulfill  its statutorily  authorized  \nlegal  duty,  monetary  damages  will  not  fix  the problem,  a  remedy  in  equity  is  \nwarranted,  and  the public  interest  is  served  by  a  permanent  injunction.   \nADAP is  awarded  injunctive relief,  and  SafetyNet  must  give ADAP access  to \nthe moderate program  in  accordance with  this  Order.    \nE.  COSTS  \nADAP and  SafetyNet  seek  from  each  other  an  award  of attorneyโs  fees  \nand  costs.  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  9;  Doc.  71,  p.  3;  Doc.  73,  p.  11;  Doc.  75,  p.  4).  \nNeither  party  provides  legal  authority  for  awarding  fees  and  costs  in  this  \ntype of dispute.  The P&A  statutes  and  regulations  are silent  on  this  issue,  \nthough  the regulations  provide that  a  P&A  system  receives  allotments  that  \nmay  be used  to bring  lawsuits  in  their  own  right  to redress  incidents  of abuse \n  28\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 29 of 33 \nor  neglect,  discrimination,  and  other  violations.  45  C.F.R. ยง  1386.25. \nGenerally, litigants are expected  to bear  their  own  attorneyโs  fees  and  costs  \npursuant  to the โAmerican  Rule.โ  Mayer  v.  Wall  St.  Equity  Grp.,  Inc.,  514  F.  \nAppโx  929,  932  (11th  Cir.  2013).  Because neither  party  cites  an  applicable \nexception  to this  rule,  the Court  finds  that  each  party  must  bear  its  own  \ncosts.    \nF.  INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION  \nSafetyNet  is  not  entitled  to indemnification  and  contribution  from  \nDHR  as  a  matter  of law.8  SafetyNet  seeks  indemnification  and  contribution  \nfrom  DHR  because  SafetyNet  followed  DHRโs instructions  to deny  ADAP \naccess  to the moderate program.  To support  its  position,  SafetyNet  states,  \nโADAP has  not  and  cannot  provide any  Alabama  precedent  or  statutory  \nauthority  that  would  legally  compel  SafetyNet  to disregard  instructions  from  \n[DHR],  the governmental  agency  which  licenses  SafetyNet.โ  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  \npp. 5, 8).  SafetyNet  also argues  DHR  could  have revoked  SafetyNetโs  license \nor  refused  to renew  their  contract  should  it  fail  to follow  DHRโs  directive.  \n(Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  7).  SafetyNet  cites  its  contract  with  DHR  to support  the \n                                            \n8    Eleventh  Amendment  Immunity  is  not  at  issue here.  The Supreme \nCourt  โhas  consistently  held  that  an  unconsenting  State is  immune from  \nsuits  brought  in  federal  courts  by  her  own  citizens  as  well  as  by  citizens  of \nanother  State.โ  Edelman  v.  Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662โ63  (1974) (internal  \ncitations  omitted).  If properly  raised,  the Eleventh  Amendment  bars  actions  \nin  federal  court  against  a  state,  state agencies,  or  state officials  acting  in  \ntheir  official  capacities.  Id.  at  663.  By  failing  to raise this  Eleventh  \nAmendment  issue, DHR  waived  this  non-jurisdictional  defense.  See  Wisc.  \nDepโt  of Corrections  v.  Schacht,  524  U.S.  381,  389  (1998).  \n \n  29\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 30 of 33 \nfact  that  it  agreed  โto adhere to DHR  policies  and  requirements,  which  have \nbeen  provided  to [SafetyNet].โ  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  8).  Because SafetyNet  \nfollowed  DHRโs  instructions,  SafetyNet  argues  equity  and  fairness  favor  \nawarding  it  indemnification  and  contribution  from  DHR.  \nThe Court  first  notes  SafetyNet  is  required  to follow  federal  law.  To \nargue indemnification  is  required  because ADAP did  not  provide SafetyNet  \nwith  any  Alabama  precedent  or  statutory  authority  saying  it  could  ignore \nDHRโs  instructions  is  erroneous.  ADAP wrote to SafetyNet  explaining  its  \nauthority,  and  provided  SafetyNet  with  citations  to federal  law  supporting  its  \nposition.  ADAP cannot  provide SafetyNet  with  Alabama  precedent  or  \nstatutory  authority  that  contravenes  the Supremacy  Clause,  i.e., telling  \nSafetyNet  it must  adhere to instructions  from  a  state agency  even  when  those \ninstructions  violate federal  law,  because such  precedent  does  not  exist. See  \nConst.  Art.  VI  cl.  2; PLIVA,  Inc.  v.  Mensing,  131  S.  Ct.  2567,  2577  (2011) \n(explaining  when  the Supremacy  Clause of the U.S. Constitution  mandates  \nstate law  give way  to federal  statute); Iowa  Protection  &  Advocacy  Servs.,  \nInc.  v.  Rasmussen,  206  F.R.D.  630,  639  (S.D.  Iowa  2001)  (โIn  the case of \n[PAMII],  the state law  is  expressly  preempted.โ).  Though  it  is  unfortunate \nSafetyNet  and  DHR  failed  to understand  the federal  rules  and  regulations  \napplicable to this  dispute,  this  lack  of understanding  does  not  entitle \nSafetyNet  to indemnification.  \nSecond,  nothing  in  the record  supports  the notion  that  DHR  \n  30\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 31 of 33 \nthreatened  retaliation  against  SafetyNet  should  it  allow  ADAP access  to the \nmoderate program.  (Doc.  76).  SafetyNet  merely  argues  its  contract  with  DHR  \nrequires  compliance,  โand  non-compliance could  result  in  [DHR]  revoking  \nSafetyNetโs  license.โ  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  2,  p.  3).  Nor  does  the record  show  \nSafetyNet  objected  to DHRโs  instructions,  or  promptly  sought  independent  \nlegal  counsel  or  mediation  to help  resolve this  dispute.  Instead,  the record  \nshows  that  for  twelve months  ADAP tried  to gain  access  to the moderate \nprogram,  only  to have SafetyNet  refuse them.  SafetyNet  was  not  without  \noptions.  Only  after  a  year  of being  denied  access  did  ADAP file this  lawsuit.  \nAdditionally,  SafetyNet, as a behavioral  health  care facility,  is  responsible for  \nunderstanding  and  following  the federal  and  state laws  that  apply  to its  \nprograms.  It  cannot  use DHRโs  flawed  guidance as  an  impenetrable  shield  for  \nits  own  violations.   \nFinally,  the contract  requires  the parties  to adhere to DHR  policies  and  \nrequirements.  (Doc.  62,  Exh.  1,  p.  8).  But  the contract  does  not  authorize the \nparties  to violate federal  law.  To the contrary,  the contract  states  more than  \nonce that  SafetyNet  must  โcomply  with  all  federal,  state,  and  local  laws.โ  \n(Doc.  66,  Exh.  16,  pp.  6,  9, 11).  Moreover,  the contract  and RFPs  refer  \nrepeatedly  to Alabamaโs  Medicaid  manual  and  regulations, and Alabamaโs \nMedicaid  program  must  be administered  in  compliance with  federal  law.9  \n                                            \n9    As  the Eleventh  Circuit  has  explained,  โMedicaid  is  a  cooperative \nventure of the state and  federal  governments.  A  state which  chooses  to \nparticipate in  Medicaid  submits  a  state plan  for  the funding  of medical  \n  31\n  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 78   Filed 12/12/14   Page 32 of 33 \nSimply  put,  SafetyNet  and  DHR  cannot  contract  their  way  out  of compliance \nwith  the applicable federal  rules,  and  nothing  in  the record  suggests  that  \nthey  attempted  to do so. Instead  it  appears  that DHR  and  SafetyNet  did  not  \nunderstand  the  P&A  broad  remedial  framework,  and  this  led  to violations  of \nfederal  law. For  the foregoing  reasons,  SafetyNet  is  not  entitled  to indemnity  \nand  contribution  from  DHR.  \nCONCLUSION  \nAfter  careful  consideration, the Court  finds  that  there  is  no genuine \ndispute as  to any  material  fact  and  ADAP  is  entitled  to judgment  as  a  matter  \nof law.  SafetyNetโs  complete refusal  to allow  ADAP to access  its  moderate \nprogram  violates  PAMII.  ADAP is  entitled  to reasonable unaccompanied  \naccess  to both  programs  at  SafetyNet,  as  well  as  the patients  and  programs  \ntherein.  ADAPโs  motion  for  summary  judgment  is  therefore GRANTED, and \nSafetyNetโs  motion  for  summary  judgment  is  DENIED.  DHRโs  motion  for  \nsummary  judgment  is  DENIED, but  SafetyNet  is  not  entitled  to \nindemnification  and  contribution  from  DHR.  ADAP and  SafetyNet  are \nrequired  to meet  and  to develop  a  protocol  consistent  with  this  order  for  \npresentation  to the Court  no later  than  January  30, 2015.  Declaratory  \njudgment,  therefore,  is  entered  against  SafetyNet,  and  SafetyNet  is  hereby  \n                                                                                                                                  \nservices  for  the needy  which  is  approved  by  the federal  government.  The \nfederal  government  then  subsidizes  a  certain  portion  of the financial  \nobligations  which  the state has  agreed  to bear.  A  state participating  in  \nMedicaid  must  comply  with  [the applicable federal  laws].  Harris  v.

Alabama, \nBACKGROUND \nNorthern Division. \nEach party in this action filed a motion for summary \nALABAMA DISABILITIES ADVOCACY \njudgment, asking the Court to determine whether ADAP \nPROGRAM, Plaintiff, \nhad federal authorization to access the moderate program \nv. \nfor male youth at the SafetyNet facility. (Docs.62, 63, 64). \nSAFETYNET YOUTHCARE, INC., Defendant and \nThe Court granted the motion for summary judgment filed \nThirdโParty Plaintiff, \nby ADAP, finding federal law grants ADAP the right to \nv. \naccess  the  program,  and  denied  the  motions  filed  by \nAlabama Department of Human Resources, \nSafetyNet  and  DHR.  (Doc.  78,  p.  28).  In  the  order \nThirdโParty Defendant. \ngranting summary judgment for ADAP, the Court denied \nits request for attorneysโ fees and costs. (Doc. 78, pp. 28โ\nCivil Action No. 13โ0519โCGโB. \n29). The Court denied the request because ADAP did not \n| \nraise an applicable exception to the American Rule, which \nSigned Feb. 10, 2015. \nstates litigants are generally expected to bear their own \n| \nattorneysโ fees and costs. (Doc. 78, p. 29). \nFiled Feb. 11, 2015. \n  \nIn its motion for reconsideration, ADAP raises several \nAttorneys and Law Firms  arguments to support an award of attorneysโ fees and \ncosts.  First,  ADAP  relies  on  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nAndrea  Jane  Mixson,  Alabama  Disabilities  Advocacy  Procedure 54(d)(1) to show it is entitled to costs. (Doc. \nProgram,  David  John  Slawkowski,  Nancy  Ellen  80, p. 2). Second, ADAP asserts it acted as a private \nAnderson, William Van Der Pol, Jr., Tuscaloosa, AL, for  attorney general through this action to ensure that youth \nPlaintiff.  receiving treatment in the moderate program are informed \nof their right to be free from abuse and neglect and to \nMartha  Leach  Thompson,  Stewart  D.  McCloud,  Huie,  monitor conditions in that program. (Doc. 80, p. 2). Third, \nFernambucq  &  Stewart,  LLP,  Birmingham,  AL,  for  ADAP argues SafetyNet acted in bad faith, and bad faith \nDefendant and ThirdโParty Plaintiff.  is an established exception to the American Rule. (Doc. \n80,  p.  2).  Finally,  ADAP  contends  the  Declaratory \nFelicia Marshea Brooks, State of Alabama, Department of \nJudgment  Act  and  principles  of  equity  entitle  it  to \nHuman  Resources,  Montgomery,  AL,  for  ThirdโParty \nattorneysโ fees and costs in this matter. (Doc. 80, p. 2). \nDefendant. \nADAP  then  proceeds  to  document  and  explain  its \n \nrequested fees and costs. (Doc. 80, Exh. 1, pp. 7โ14). \n \n  \nDHR responded to ADAPโs motion, noting that ADAP \nseeks  only  attorneysโ  fees  and  costs  from  SafetyNet. \n(Doc.  83,  p.  2).  DHR also  โadopts  the  arguments  by \nORDER \nSafetyNet in its objection (Doc. 82) to ADAPโs Motion.โ \n(Doc. 83, p. 2). In its response, SafetyNet argues ADAP is \nCALLIE V.S. GRANADE, District Judge.  not  entitled  to  fees  under  a  private  attorney  general \nframework (Doc. 82, p. 2), it did not act in bad faith (Doc. \n*1  This  matter  is  before  the  Court  on  Alabama  82,  p.  3),  and  ADAPโs  request  for  attorneysโ  fees  is \nDisabilities  Advocacy  Programโs  (โADAPโ)  motion  to  excessive  and  unreasonable.

All Citations \nAccordingly,  the  Court  finds  its  previous  denial  of \nNot Reported in F.Supp.3d, 2015 WL 566946 \nattorneysโ fees did not amount to clear error or manifest \n \ninjustice, and ADAPโs request for such fees is DENIED. \nEach party must bear its own fees related to the motion \nFootnotes \n \n1  Though not an issue here, a statute may nevertheless limit a courtโs discretion in several ways, and it need not expressly state \nthat it is displacing Rule 54(d)(1) to do so. For instance, a statute providing that โplaintiffs shall not be liable for costsโ is contrary \n \nto Rule 54(d)(1) because it precludes a court from awarding costs to prevailing defendants.

(\"SafetyNet\"), pursuant to Rule 14(a) of the \nFederal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  asserts  the  following  third-party  claim  against \nAlabama Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\"), in the above action, as follows: \nFACTUAL INFORMATION \n1.  At all material times, SafetyN  et was and is a domestic nonprofit \ncorporation, with its principal place of business located in Dallas County, Alabama. \n2.  Third-party Defendant, Alabama Department of Human Resources, was \ncreated in 1935  to administer to the  assistant programs that are  part of the Social \nSecurity  Act,  with  its  mission  to  provide for  the  protection,  well-being,  and  self \nsufficiency of children and adults.  Alabama Code Title 38, 26, 42. \n3.  DHR is the licensing authority for SafetyNet. \n4.  Defendant brings this action pursuant to Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure which permits a Defendant to file an interpleader action where there is \n{01852124.1} \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 8   Filed 12/02/13   Page 2 of 7\nmore than one person with claims that may expose the Defendant to double or multiple \nliabilities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  Jurisdiction is proper in this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 as to the \nFederal statutory claims. \n6.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).  Defendant \nDHR  is  headquartered  in  Montgomery,  Alabama,  and  has  offices  and  employees \nthroughout all sixty-seven (67) of Alabama's counties. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n7.  As  outlined  in ADAP's Complaint of October 25,  2013,  SafetyNet has \nrepeatedly referred ADAP to the DHR Legal Division to address ADAP's access to \nSafety Net. \n8.  Furthermore, on October 10, 2013, DHR wrote ADAP stating that ADAP \ndoes not have sufficient legal basis for the relief sought. (See correspondence of October \n10,2013, from Alabama Department of Human Resources to ADAP, attached as Exhibit \n\"1 \"). \n9.  On October 21,  2013, counsel for SafetyNet and DHR met with ADAP. \nADAP,  at  that  time,  requested  access  to  monitor  Defendant's  Moderate  Program; \nhowever,  on the  advice  of  DHR  counsel,  and  its  reading  of  the  federal  statutes, \nSafetyNet denied ADAP access to monitor SafetyNet's Moderate Program. \nCAUSES OF ACTION- INDEMNIFICATION \n10.  SafetyNet adopt and incorporates by reference as if fully set forth herein \nParagraphs 1 through 9 of its Third-Party Claim. \n11.  SafetyNet denies that it has violated and continues to violate ADAP's \nrights to exercise access to all residents of SafetyNet's facilities. \n12.  If SafetyNet  was  found  to  be  in  violation  of  ADAP's  rights,  which \nSafetyNet vehemently  denies,  then SafetyNet alleges  that said violations  were  not \n{01852124.1} \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 8   Filed 12/02/13   Page 3 of 7\nproximately  caused  by  any  fault,  negligence,  or  want of  due  care  on  the  part of \nSafetyNet, but rather was caused by the fault, negligence, and want of due care on the \npart of DHR. \n13.  Additionally, if SafetyNet was held to be in violation of ADAP's rights or \nfor  any  part  or  all  of  the  prayer for  relief  alleged  by  ADAP,  which  violation  is \nvehemently denied, then SafetyNet alleges that it is without fault and that its violation \nwould be vicarious, derivative, constructive, on the part of DHR. \n14.  DHR is the licensing authority for SafetyNet and any decisions made by \nSafetyNet with regard to ADAP's access has been made at the direction of the Alabama \nDepartment of Human Resources and therefore, SafetyNet is entitled to indemnification \nfrom DHR for any recovery obtained by ADAP against Safety Net. \nWHEREFORE, SafetyNet prays that this Court will enter judgment in its favor \nand against Alabama Department of Human Resources for  any and all judgments, \ndamages, awards, or injunctive relief which may be rendered against SafetyNet in the \nADAP case, if any, and for all costs and fees,  including attorney's fees,  incurred by \nSafetyNet in defending the claims asserted by ADAP in prosecuting this matter, and for \nany further relief this Court deems just and proper. \nCONTRIBUTION \n15.  SafetyNet adopt and incorporates by reference as if fully set forth herein \nParagraphs 1 through 15 of its Third-Party Claim. \n16.  If Safety Net is held responsible for any and all parts of the prayer for relief \nsought by ADAP, which violation is vehemently denied, then SafetyNet alleges that the \nAlabama Department of Human Resources is a joint tortfeasor and SafetyNet may have \nto pay more than the proper share of any liability is found to have to ADAP. \n17.  SafetyNet hereby  demands contribution from  Alabama  Department of \nHuman  Resources  for  any  prayer  for  relief  or  obligations  to  ADAP  in  excess  of \nSafetyNet's proper share. \nWHEREFORE, SafetyNet prays that this Court will enter judgment in its favor \nand against Alabama Department of Human Resources for  any and all judgments, \ndamages, awards, or injunctive relief which may be rendered against SafetyNet in the \nADAP case, if any, and for all costs and fees, including attorney's fees, incurred by \nSafetyNet in defending the claims asserted by ADAP in prosecuting this matter, and for \nany further relief this Court deems just and proper. \n{01852124.1} \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 8   Filed 12/02/13   Page 4 of 7\nRespectfully Submitted, \nIs/ Martha Leach Thompson \nMartha Leach Thompson \nAttorney for Defendant, \nSafety Net Youthcare, Inc. \nOF COUNSEL: \nHUIE, FERNAMBUCQ & STEWART, LLP \nThree Protective Center \n2801 Highway 280 South, Suite 200 \nBirmingham, AL 35223-2484 \n(205) 251-1193 \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI hereby certify that on December 2, 2013, I have electronically filed the foregoing \npleading with the Clerk of the Court which will send notification of the filing to: \nAlabama Department of Human Resources \nP 0  Box 304000 \n50 Ripley Street, Suite 2122 \nMontgomery, AL 36130-4000 \nDavid Slawkowski \nAlabama Disabilities Advocacy Program \nBox 870395 \nTuscaloosa, AL 35487 \n/ยง/Martha Leach Thompson \nOf Counsel \n{01852124.1} \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 8   Filed 12/02/13   Page 5 of 7\nExhibit ''1'' \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 8   Filed 12/02/13   Page 6 of 7\nโข' \n. \n~ยท  State of Alabama \nDepartment of Ruman Resources \nS.

In  1975,  the  PADD  Act  established the  Protection and  Advocacy  (\"P&A\") \nSystem  to monitor and investigate incidents of abuse and neglect and to pursue legal, \nadministrative, and other appropriate remedies to safeguard the rights of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.

The scope of the \nP&A system was further expanded in 1993 when the PAIR Act was enacted. \n10.  To receive federal funding under the PAlMI, PADD and PAIR Acts, states must have \nin effect a P&A system. ADAP is designated as Alabama's P&A system. \n11.  Under the PAlMI Act, \"any public or private residential setting that provides overnight \n------- -----c-are-accompanied--by-treatment services'_!_ is-a-facilit-y-which a-P&A is-authorized to access and-----\nmonitor: \nFacilities include, but are not limited to the following: General and psychiatric \nhospitals, nursing homes, board and care homes, community housing, juvenile \ndetention facilities, homeless shelters, and jails and prisons, including all general \nareas as well as special mental health or forensic units. \n42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2 (emphasis added). \n12.  Under the PADD Act, facilities include \"any setting that provides care, treatment, \nservices and habilitation ... Facilities include, but are not limited to the following: Community \nliving arrangements ... , day programs, juvenile detention centers, hospitals, nursing homes, \nhomeless shelters, jails and prisons.\"  45 C.F .R. ยง 13 86.19 (emphasis added). \n13.  Under the PAlMI Act, \"care\" and \"treatment\" are defined as services: \n... provided to prevent, identify, reduce or stabilize mental illness or emotional \nimpairment  such  as  mental  health  screening,  evaluation,  counseling, \nbiomedical,  behavioral  and psychotherapies,  supportive or other adjunctive \ntherapies, medication supervision, special education and rehabilitation, even if \nonly \"as needed\" or under a contractual agreement. \n42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2. \n14.  The  PAlMI  and  PADD  Acts  provide  ADAP  reasonable  unaccompanied  access \nto  all residents of a facility at reasonable times to provide P&A service and contact \ninformation, rights information, monitor compliance with respect to the rights and safety of \nservice recipients, and to view and photograph all areas of the facility that are used by \n4 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 5 of 12\nresidents or are accessible to residents. 42 U.S.C. ยง10805(3); 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c); 42 \nU.S.C. ยง15043(H); 45 C.F.R. ยง1386.22(g). \n15.  The PAlMI and PADD Acts provide ADAP unaccompanied access to residents of \nfacilities, including the opportunity to meet and communicate privately with such individuals \nregularly, both formally and informally, by telephone, mail and in person. 42 C.F .R. ยง 51.42( d); \n.  ยง-1386-:22(h}.  --- -\n45-C.ER~ \n16.  ADAP has authority to interact regularly with those individuals who are current or \npotential recipients of protection and advocacy services.  ADAP may use any appropriate \ntechniques and pursue administrative, legal or other appropriate remedies to protect and \nadvocate on behalf of, e.g., individuals with mental illness, to address abuse, neglect or other \nviolations ofrights.  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.31(a)(d).4 \n17 .  The access provisions of the P AIMI, PAD D, and PAIR statutes are interrelated and \nit is clear that Congress intended that they be applied in a consistent manner. The PAIR Act \nexpressly incorporates by reference the authority regarding access to facilities and records as \nwell as the other general authorities granted to P&As set forth in the PADD Act. See 29 \nU.S.C. ยง 794e (f). Moreover, the preamble to the PAlMI Act regulations states that it is the \ngoal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \"to ensure that all facets of the \nP&A system administered by the Department [i.e., the PAlMI and PADD Acts] are subject \nto the same requirements.\" 62 Fed. Reg. 53549 (Oct. 15, 1997). \n18.  The PAlMI Act's implementing regulations state that a P&A entity such as ADAP has \nauthority to access all residents of a facility where those with mental illness and emotional \n4 ADAP also possesses the authority to investigate allegations of abuse/neglect. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043(2)(B); 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 10805(l)(A).

SafetyNet Academy is licensed to provide services to youth with emotional and \nbehavioral disabilities in two programs at its Minter Campus: the Moderate Program and the \nIntensive Program.  The Intensive Program is commonly known as a \"psychiatric residential \ntreatment facility for youth under the age of 21\" (\"PRTF\").

On numerous occasions in the past year ADAP communicated with SafetyNet Youth \nCare Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lyn Wheatley, and Corporate Clincial Director, Ms. \nSheila Hatfield, to describe ADAP's authority to  monitor and to seek to gain access to all \nparts of the SafetyNet Academy facility that provide care and treatment of any persons with \ndisabilities,  regardless of what particular SafetyNet program may serve those persons. \n5 SafetyNet Behavioral Health Services, http://safetynetbhc.com/intensive-treatment-programs.html; \nhttp://safetynetbhc.com/moderate-treatment-program.html (Last Visited October 3, 2013) \n6 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 7 of 12\n22.  ADAP's efforts to monitor and gain access to all parts of the SafetyNet Academy \nfacility that provide care and treatment of any persons with disabilities, including its Moderate \nProgram, have been denied. \n23.  In an October 2, 2012, letter to Mr. Wheatley and Ms. Hatfield, ADAP provided \ncitations to its federal statutory authority to conduct monitoring activities in all parts of \n---- facilities providing care-and -treatment-of any individuals with disabiliti~s (Ex. l). +hat n~quest --- ----\nto monitor was denied. \n24.  On January 14, 2013, ADAP wrote to SafetyNet Academy Clincial Director, Ms. \nValerie Schroeder, notifying her of ADAP's intent to conduct a monitoring visit to SafetyNet \nAcademy in Minter, Alabama, on January 22,2013, and informing her of ADAP' authority to \nmonitor and gain access to SafetyNet's facilities. ADAP's January 14, 2013, letter explained \nin language similar to ADAP's October 2, 2012, correspondence ADAP's federal statutory \nauthority to conduct monitoring activities, unaccompanied, in all parts of facilities like \nSafetyN  et that provide care and treatment of any individuals with disabilities (Ex. 2). \n25.  On January 22, 2013, ADAP Senior Case Advocate Christy Johnson arrived at \nSafetyNet Acaemy and was told by Ms. Valerie Schroeder that she could meet with six boys \nwho were outside playing Frisbee.  After meeting with the residents playing Frisbee, Ms. \nJohnson asked Ms. Schroeder to allow her to meet with the residents assigned to the SafetyN  et \nModerate Program.  Ms. Schroeder denied Ms. Johnson access to Defendant's Moderate \nprogram stating she was instructed not to allow ADAP to meet with the boys in the Moderate \nProgram.  Ms. Schroeder Ms. Schroeder stated ADAP was not allowed access to talk \nwith Moderate Program residents because they do not receive psychiatric \nservices.  Ms. Johnson explained to Ms. Schroeder that the Protection and Advocacy Statutes \nallow ADAP broad access and allow ADAP to determine if a child meets the criteria to receive \n7 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 8 of 12\nP&A services; therefore, a facility like SafetyNet must allow P&A access to all residents.  Ms. \nSchroeder stated she read and understood ADAP's letter prior to the January 22, 2013, visit, \nbut she did not have authority to make decisions regarding ADAP's access. Ms. Schroeder \nreferred Ms. Johnson to the DHR legal division to address ADAP's access to SafetyNet.

On April 29, 2013, ADAP wrote Ms. Schroeder to inform her of ADAP's intent \nto monitor Defendant's facility on Wednesday, May 1, 2013. (Ex.4) \n28.  On May 1, 2013, Ms. Johnson arrived at Defendant's facility and informed \nMs.  Hatfield she would like to meet with all SafetyNet Academy residents during her \nmonitoring visit that day.  Ms. Hatfield stated she was instructed to deny ADAP access to \nModerate Program residents. On May 1, 2013, ADAP was again denied access to SafetyNet's \nModerate Program. \n29.  On October 7, 2013, ADAP wrote SafetyNet Chief Executive Officer, Lyn Wheatley, \nstating that despite ADAP's numerous efforts to resolve its access to Defendant's Moderate \nProgram over the past year, the Defendant continued to deny ADAP its right to monitor \nDefendant's facility. ADAP informed Mr. Wheatley it sought to resolve Defendant's failure to \nprovide access within 14 days so as to avoid litigation.  (Ex. 5) \n30.  On October 10,2013, DHR wrote ADAP claiming ADAP has no legal basis to monitor \nDefendant's Moderate Program because: \"Moderate facilities are not Intensive treatment \nprograms and are not considered part of the Psychiatric Services for Individuals under the Age \n8 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 9 of 12\nof21 ('Psych 21 ').\"(Ex. 6) \n31.  On October 15, 2013, ADAP corresponded with Defendant's counsel to explain \nADAP's authority under the PADD and PAlMI statutes, and their implementing regulations, to \nmonitor facilities like Defendant's that provide care and treatment for individuals with \ndisabilities.  (Ex. 7) \n32. On October 17,2013, ADAP arranged to meet with counsel for Defendant and DHR at \nDefendant's facility on Monday October 21, 2013, to address ADAP's access authority and to \nseek to be granted access to monitor Defendant's Moderate Program by 5:00PM on October \n21, 2013. (Ex. 8) \n33  On October 21,2013, ADAP met as arranged with counsel for Defendant and DHR, \nand with Defendant's Executive Director and Clinical Coordinator. ADAP explained again its \nauthority to monitor Defendant's Moderate Program.  ADAP again requested access to monitor \nDefendant's Moderate Program by 5:00PM on that date. Defendant, through its counsel and on \nthe advice ofDHR counsel, again denied ADAP access to monitor Defendant's Moderate \nProgram. \n34.  Defendant has repeatedly refused to provide ADAP with access to all parts of \nDefendant's facility that provide care and treatment of any individuals with disabilities in \nviolation of federal law. \n35.  Despite ADAP's repeated attempts to resolve the dispute described herein, Defendant \nhas refused to allow ADAP to have access to Defendant's facilities in violation of the federal \nstatutes and regulations cited herein. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n36.  The actions of the Defendant, its agents, and employees, violate and continue to violate \n9 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 10 of 12\nthe ADAP's rights to exercise full, reasonable, and unaccompanied access to all residents of \nDefendant's facility at reasonable times to provide P&A service and contact information, \nrights information, monitor compliance with respect to the rights and safety of service \nrecipients, and to view and photograph all areas of the facility which are used by residents \nor are accessible to residents  in violation ofthe PAlMI, PADD, and PAIR Acts and their \nimplementing regulations. 42 C.P.R.ยง 51.42; 42 C.P.R.ยง 1386.22; 34 C.P.R.ยงยง 381.1 et \nInjunctive Relief \n37.  ADAP does  not  have  an  adequate  remedy at law to redress Defendant's failure to \nprovide ADAP with access to Defendant's facility in violation ofthe PAlMI, PADD, and \nPAIR Acts and their implementing regulations. 42 C.P.R.ยงยง 51.42; 42 C.P.R.ยงยง 1386.22; 34 \nC.P.R.ยงยง 381.1 et seq. \n38.  ADAP will be irreparably harmed if the Defendant is permitted to continue denying \nADAP with access to all residents of Defendant's facility and to portions of Defendant's facility \nthat are used and accessed by residents of Defendant's facility. Defendant's past and continuing \nrefusal to allow access causes irreparable harm to ADAP by preventing it from carrying out its \nstatutory mandate to monitor facilities like the Defendant's for compliance with respect to the \nrights and safety of residents and to provide residents with information and training about how \nresidents may obtain ADAP's services. \n39.  The Defendant will not be harmed by the issuance of the requested injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief because the Defendant is required by law to grant ADAP access to \nmonitor all areas of its facilities accessible to individuals for whom it provides treatment. \n40.  Granting ADAP access to all residents of Defendant's facility and to all parts of \n10 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 11 of 12\nDefendant's facility where ADAP may lawfully gain access is in the public interest. \nADAP must have full and unaccompanied access to residents of Defendant's \nfacilities and to all areas that are used by residents and are accessible to residents so \nADAP may fulfill its Congressional mandate to protect and advocate for the civil rights of \npersons, including children and youth, with disabilities. There is no lawful basis for \n-D~f~ndant'-s-refusal--to deny-ADAP-with-access-to-the residents-of-any program,-ineluding \nthe Moderate Program, at Defendant's facility. \nDeclaratory Judgment \n41.  An actual controversy exists between ADAP and the Defendant regarding \nADAP's authority to gain access to Defendant's Moderate Program located at Defendant's \nfacility known as the SafetyNet Academy in Minter, Alabama. The controversy described is \nwithin the jurisdiction of this Court, and ADAP seeks a declaration of its right to gain access \nto Defendant's facilities, including Defendant's Moderate Program, pursuant to the relevant \nfederal statutes and regulations identified in this Complaint. \nPRAYER FOR BELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that this Court will grant the following relief: \n(A)  Declare that ADAP shall have reasonable access under ADAP's federal \naccess authority to all parts of Defendant's facility known as the SafetyNet \nAcademy, including but not limited to the Moderate Program, which are used \nby and accessible to residents of Defendant's facility. \n11 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 12 of 12\n(B)  Declare that ADAP shall have reasonable access under ADAP's federal \naccess authority to residents  of Defendant's facility known as the \nSafetyNet Academy, including but not limited to the Moderate  Program. \n(C)  Declare that Defendant's denial of access by ADAP to Defendant's facilities, \nincluding but not limited to the SafetyNet Academy Moderate Program, and to \nresidents of-I)efendant-'s-facilities, is unlawful;---- - -- --~~ --- --------\n(D)  Issue a preliminary injunction enjoining the Defendant from further denying \nADAP access to Defendant's facilities, including but not limited to the \nSafetyNet Academy Moderate Program, and to residents of Defendant's \nfacilities including, but not limited to, the Moderate Program at SafetyNet Academy. \n(E)  After a trial on the merits, issue a permanent injunction enjoining the Defendant \nfrom further denying ADAP access to Defendant's facilities, including but not \nlimited to, the SafetyNet Academy Moderate Program, and to residents of \nDefendant's facilities including, but not limited to, the Moderate Program at \nSafetyNet Academy. \n(F)  A ward Plaintiff its costs and reasonable attorney fees; and \n(G)  Grant Plaintiff such other relief as the Court deems necessary and just. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nIs/ David Slawkowski \nDavid J.

The PAlMI Act provides parallel protections for individuals with \nmental illness using the same mechanisms as the DD Act. \nUnder the Rehabilitation Act's PAIR program, P&As are authorized to use the same \nmechanisms as provided under the DD Act to serve persons with disabilities who are \nnot eligible under either the DD Act or PAlMI Act. 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e. \nCongress has continued to expand the mission of the P&A system beyond these three \nprograms.  Now, through a total of eight federally funded programs, P&As address a broad \nrange of legal rights on behalf of persons with disabilities, whether those persons live in \ninstitutions or in community settings, including special education, employment preparation, \nhealthcare access, architectural and programming accessibility, and voting. \nDespite its expanded mission, the P&A system remains committed to ensuring the safety and \nwell-being of persons with disabilities who live in institutional settings.  In part, P&As carry \nout this work by conducting on~site facility monitoring and investigations, empowered by \nfederal law providing the P&As with broad access rights to facilities and to their residents \nand staff members. \nADAP's monitoring work brings it to a variety of facilities that provide persons with \ndisabilities services, support, care or treatment. These settings include, but are not limited \nto, public or private residential settings like residential and day schools, day treatment \nprograms, general and psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, board and care homes, \ncommunity housing, juvenile detention facilities, homeless shelters, and jails and prisons, \nincluding all general areas as well as special mental health or forensic units. \nThe goals of ADAP's facility monitoring are: \nโข  To provide information on programs addressing the needs of individuals with \ndisabilities to facility residents, \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 4 of 34\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B  Document 1-1  Filed 10/25/13  Page 4 of 34 \n3 \nโข  To provide information about individual rights and ADAP's advocacy services to \nfacility residents, and \nโข  To monitor compliance regarding the rights and safety of residents. \nAs found in the DO Act, PAlMI Act and Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and interpreted through \ncase law over the last thirty years, the P&A access authority for monitoring and investigation \ncan be summarized.as follows:_ \nโข  Persons with disabilities may not be aware of their state's P&A or be able to contact \nthe P&A on their own. To ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the \nagency's protection and advocacy services, federal law provides P&As with the right \nto unaccompanied access to all residents of a facility at reasonable times (including, \nat a minimum, normal working hours and visiting hours) to provide information, \ntraining and referrals to facility residents. \nโข  P&As have broad authority to conduct--without probable cause to suspect abuse or \nneglect or other justification-- on-site monitoring of health and safety conditions in \nboth institutional and community settings. \nโข  Access to facility residents and staff to discuss issues relating to rights protections \nand treatment may not be restricted in most circumstances, and notice to a facility is \ngenerally not required prior to meeting with residents or staff. \nโข  P&A staff have a right to have unaccompanied access to residents, which includes the \nopportunity to meet and communicate privately with them, both formally and \ninformally, by telephone, mail and in person.  The right of informal access applies to \nall residents of a facility, including those who may eventually be found not to meet \nthe P&A eligibility criteria. The P&A is the final arbiter of what individuals served by a \nfacility are, or are not, P&A clients and a facility may not require, as a condition of \ngranting access to records or facilities, that the P&A make a definitive showing that \nparticular individuals have a disability. \nโข  Permission of a parent or guardian of a resident is not necessary for P&A staff to \nmeet informally with any resident.  However, the P&A staff must honor a resident's \nrequest to terminate an interview. A request to terminate an interview should not \nmean, however, that the P&A never again approaches the individual. Most advocates \nhave worked with clients who will not talk with them one day, but welcome a \nrespectful approach on the next. \nโข  The P&A is allowed reasonable, unaccompanied access to facilities and community \nsettings to investigate potential abuse or neglect. This access includes the right to \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 5 of 34\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B  Document 1-1  Filed 10/25/13  Page 5 of 34 \n4 \nspeak with any service recipient or staff member who may have knowledge of the \nincident being investigated. \nโข  The P&A has the right to access the records of individuals, including investigation \nreports of other agencies, with consent of the individual or his guardian.  Even \nwithout such consent, under certain circumstances, the P&A has a right to such \nrecords if it has probable cause to believe that an abuse or neglect incident has \noccurred or it has received a complaint. The P&A is the final arbiter regarding the \ncir.cumstances_tbat_amolJnUo pr.obable __ca use._Qn_e_cir_cumstam:e_that_w_o_ul_d_allo_w. ...__ _______  \nP&A to access records without consent involves individuals who do not have a legal \nguardian, conservator or other legal representative, or when the individual's guardian \nis the State or one of its political subdivisions. \nโข  Records must be provided to the P&A within three days of a written request in most \ncases. However, in the case of an investigation of a death or suspicion of an \nimmediate threat to health or safety, records must be provided within 24 hours. \nUnder the DD Act (and the PAIR Program), access to records under these \ncircumstances is mandated without the consent of any third party {e.g., a guardian). \nUnder the PAlMI Act, access must be afforded without such consent in the case of a \ndeath investigation; in the case where there is an immediate threat to health or \nsafety and the individual has a guardian, access shall be provided over the guardian's \nobjection (so long as his or her consent was sought). \nโข  The P&A is required to protect the confidentiality of records provided to it to the \nsame extent required by the facility/provider. \nI hope this brief summary of ADAP's access authority has been helpful.

To ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the \nagency's protection and advocacy services, federal law provides PI&As with the right \nto unaccompanied access to all residents of a facility at reasonable times (Including, \nat a minimum, normal working hours and visiting hours) to provide Information, \ntraining and referrals to facility residents. \nโข P&As have broad authority to conduct-without probable cause to suspect abuse or \nneglect or other justification - on-site monitoring of health and safety conditions In \nboth Institutional and community settings. \nโข Access to facility residents and staff to discuss Issues relatlns to rights protections \nand treatment may not be restricted In most circumstances, and notice to a faciiJty Is \ngenerally not required prior to meeting with residents or staff. \nโข P&A staff have a right to have unaccompanied access to residents, which Includes the \nopportunity to meet and communicate privately with them, both formally and \nlnformally by telephone, mall and in person. The rfght of Informal acc~ss applies to \n1 \nall residents of a fa(:llity, Including those who may eventually be found not to meet \nthe P&A eligibility criteria. The P&A 19 the final arbiter of what Individuals served by a \nfacility are, or are not, P&A clients and a facility may not require, as a condition of \ngranting I(:Cess to records or facilities, that the P&A make a definitive showing that \nparticular Individuals have a disability. \nโข Permission of a parent or guardian of a resident Is not necessary for P&A staff to \nmeet Informally with any resident. However, the P&A staff must honor a resldenrs \nrequest to terminate an Interview. A request to termlmtte an Jntervfew should not \nmean, however, that the P&A never again approaches the Individual. Most advocates \nhave worked with clients who will not talk with them one day, but welcome a \nrespectful approach on the next. \nโขThe P&A Is allowed reasonable, unaccompanied access to-facflrtles and communtty \nsettings to Investigate potential abuse or neglect. This access ''\"'eludes the rlsht to \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 21 of 34\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B  Document 1-1  Filed 10/25/13  Page 21 of 34 \n4 \nspeak with any service recipient or staff member who may have knowledge of the \nIncident being Investigated. \nโข The P&A has the right to access the records of Individuals, Including Investigation \nreports of other agencies, with consent of the lndlvldl!al or his guardian. Even \nwithout such consent, under certain drcumstances, the P&A has a rlsht to such \nrecords If It has probable cause to believe that an abuse or neglect Incident has \n-ยท occurred_or It has received a complaint. The P&A.Is theJln.~J ~;~.rblt~r .reg~n:llog th~ __ _ \ncircumstances that amount to probable cause. One circumstance that would allow a \nP&A to access records without consent Involves Individuals who d.o not have a legal \nguardian, conservator or other legal representative, or. when the Individual's guardian \nIs the State or one of Its political subdivisions. \nโข Records must be provided to the P&A within three days of a written request in most \ncases. However, In the case of an Investigation of a death or suspicion of an \nImmediate threat to health or safety, records must be provided within 24ยท hours. \nUnder the DO Act (and the PAIR Program), access to records under these \ncircumstances is mandated without the consent of any third party (e.g., a guardian). \nUnder the PAlMI Act, access must be afforded without such consent in the case of a \ndeath Investigation; In the case where there Is an lmm'edlate threat to health or \nsafetv and the individual has a guardian, access shall be provided over the guardian's \nobjection (so long as his or her consent was sought). \nโข The P&A is required to protect the confidentiality of records provided to It to the \nsame extent required by the facility/provider. \nI hope this brief summary of ADAP's access authority has been helpful.  I would like to \nschedule a monitoring visit to the Minter campus Tuesday, January 22.  I will contact you \nby phone to discuss any questions you may have and to schedule a time for this visit. \nWith Best Regar:ds, \nc~~ \nSenior Case Advocate \ncc: Lyn Wheatley, CEO \nSheila Hatfield, Corporate Clinical Director \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 22 of 34\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B  Document 1-1  Filed 10/25/13  Page 22 of 34 \nEXHIBIT 4 \nCV-13-519 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/13   Page 23 of 34\nCase 2:13-cv-00519-CG-B  Document 1-1  Filed 10/25/13  Page 23 of 34 \nSent VIa Email & U.S. Mall \nApril 29, 2013 \nMs. Valerie Schroeder \nClinical Director \nSafetyNet Academy \nBO Mel Bailey Drive \nProtection & Advocacy for  Minter, Alabama 36761 \nPersons with Developmental \nDisabilities \nRE: Monitoring & Investigation \nProtection & Advocacy for \nIndividuals with Mental  Dear Ms. Schroeder:ยท \nDlness \nProtection&Advocacyof  ADAP plans to conduct a monitoring visit and an Investigation on \nIndividual Rights  Wednesday,  April  1  beginning  at  10:00  a.m.  at  SafetyNet \nAcademy. \nProtection & Advocacy for \nAssistive Technology \nDuring the monitoring, ADAP plans to meet with all residents at \nProtection & Advocacy for  SafetyNet to Inform of ADAP's services.

The PAlMI regulations broadly \ndefine the term \"facility\" as follows: \nA!.lY.  public or private P-\"el'idential  setting that  provides _Q.~I:!!lgJtLJ.!_m:_e_accorni~U_lied by  trentment \nservices.  Facilities include but arc not  limited to the  following:  general and  psychiatric hospitals, \nnursing homes,  board  and  care homes,  community  housing, juvenile detention  facilities,  homeless \nshelters, and jails and prisons, including all general areas as well as special mental health or forellsic \nunits. \n42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2 (emphasis mine) \nLikewise, the terms \"care\" and \"treatment\" arc defined undel' the PAlM I regulations as those services: \nProvided to prevent, idenlil)', reduce or stabilize mental illness or emotional impairment such \nas mental health screening, evaluation, counseling, biomedical, behavioral and \npsychotherapies, suppotiive or other adjunctive therapies, medication supervision, special \neducation and rehabilitation, even if only \"as needed\" or under a contractual arrangement. \n42. C. F.R. 51.2 \nThus, under the PAlMI Act, facilities indudc any public and private entities that serve-in pat1 or \nwhole- individuals with mental illness, and in which one or more individuals with mental illness reside \nor may reside, when those entities provide some care or treatment for person with mental illness, even \nifthose services are only incidental to the primary function of the entity. SafetyNeL's Moderate \nPrograms clearly fit within the PA IMI regulation's brood definition of fi1cilities and are accessible to \nADAP for monitoring purposes as well as investigation purposes. \nWhilt: Ms. Ficquelte states in her correspondence that DHR and SafetyNet are willing to implement a \nprotocol for ADAP's access to SafetyNet's Moderate Program, ADAP will not enter into a protocol \nwith SafctyNet that will place limits on the monitoring and investigative activities it is authorized \nunder federal law to conduct. \nADAP has successfully detended our access rights across a variety of settings and involving a variety \nof defendants which also included the recovery of attomey's fees.
