    "summary": "<p>On October 16, 2014, three individuals with significant physical disabilities requiring substantial medical care filed this lawsuit against the California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that the state had violated Section II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which require public entities to provide services to persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and to prevent unnecessary institutionalization. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing DHCS from reducing at-home medical care and support for the plaintiffs, and a permanent injunction preventing unnecessary institutionalization in the future. They also sought attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs were represented by Disability Rights California.</p><p>At the time, the plaintiffs, who were once institutionalized because of their disabilities, were living in their own homes where they received Medicaid-funded nursing and attendant care through the California Medi-Cal Home and Community Based Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver Program (“Waiver Program”). They alleged that they were at risk of institutionalization because DHCS maintained unnecessarily low cost limits for these services.</p><p>On January 29, 2015, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. The amended complaint added an organizational plaintiff, In Spirit, a non-profit organization that provided financial assistance to persons with disabilities to receive medical care in their home. </p><p> </p><p>On July 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. This complaint added a new named plaintiff, dismissed one of the existing named plaintiffs, elaborated on the factual allegations, and added a third claim for violations of California state law. On September 23, 2015, In Spirit was voluntarily dismissed as a party in the lawsuit. </p><p>On January 26, 2016, the parties held a mediation session but were unable to reach an agreement. Throughout the mediation, the parties continued to engage in discovery. On March 8, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On March 10, 2016, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgement. District Judge Fernando Olguin denied both motions on April 27, 2016. He further set out deadlines for continued discovery.</p><p> </p><p>On March 29, 2016, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division (\"DOJ\") filed a statement of interest to clarify the defendant’s obligations under the ADA. The DOJ explained that the ADA prohibits unjustified institutionalization and requires individuals with disabilities receive support and services in the most integrated setting as mandated in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The DOJ also clarified that the defendants could not administer the Medicaid waiver without accounting for individual needs and that the integration mandate protects individuals at serious risk of institutionalization. The DOJ filed subsequent statements of interest on August 4, 2016 and September 16, 2016, which further clarified the states’ ADA obligations in light of DHCS’s arguments against the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgement.</p><p>On July 18, 2016, the plaintiffs again moved for summary judgement, which Judge Olguin denied on August 4, 2016 due to continued factual disputes. Judge Olguin also noted being “deeply troubled” by the defendants’ repeated failure to comply in good faith with discovery requests and threatened to impose sanctions.</p><p>On September 7, 2016, the plaintiffs again filed a motion for summary judgement. On June 5, 2017, the Court denied that motion, finding that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding whether or not the California waiver program’s cost limits created a serious risk of institutionalization and whether California had an existing deinstitutionalization scheme in place that was effective. 385 F. Supp. 3d 1048. </p><p>The parties continued with discovery, and it appears they continued engaging in settlement talks as well. On March 14, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss their case without prejudice, and on March 19, 2018, the court granted this motion for voluntary dismissal of most of the case. There was some continued litigation over whether the plaintiffs were entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. </p><p>The dismissal seems to come from the fact that DHCS eventually changed the waiver application process so that decisions would be based on medical necessity without any mention of cost limits. In their motion opposing attorneys’ fees, the defendants asserted that this made the plaintiffs' claims moot, and that there was no basis for awarding attorneys’ fees or costs. The plaintiffs argued that the overall course of events demonstrated that this litigation was a significant factor prompting defendants to eliminate waiver cost limits, which created a presumption that plaintiffs were a catalyst and, because defendants could not rebut that presumption, plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys fees’ and costs under a state statute. </p><p>On May 30, 2019, Judge Olguin granted the plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys fees. The court found that the litigation led to the elimination of DHCS’s cost limits, conferring a significant benefit for potentially thousands of people. The elimination of cost limits would ensure that participants would not have to resort to litigation to secure needed services and that they would be able to remain in their homes and avoid segregation and isolation. The court ordered the plaintiffs to file their motion for attorneys’ fees and costs no later than July 31, 2019. 2019 WL 2590170. </p><p>After a brief delay, the parties agreed on how much the defendants should pay in attorneys’ fees. They notified the court that they had resolved all outstanding issues in this case on November 22, 2019. The notification did not state the size of the award, so the Clearinghouse is unaware of the amount. The case is now closed. </p>",

(the “ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 \n5  U.S.C. § 794(a).2  As the federal agency charged with enforcement and implementation of Title II of \n6  the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12133-12134, the Department of Justice has an interest in supporting the proper \n7  and uniform application of the ADA, in furthering Congress’ intent to create “clear, strong, consistent, \n8  enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities,” id. § 12101(b)(2), \n9  and in furthering Congress’ intent to reserve a “central role” for the federal Government in enforcing \n10  the standards established in the ADA.  Id. § 12101(b)(3). \n11    Plaintiffs, three individuals with significant physical disabilities requiring substantial medical \n12  care, allege that California maintains unnecessarily low limits on the cost of services authorized under \n13  California’s Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Transition and Diversion Home and Community-Based \n14  Services Waiver program (the “Waiver”).  According to Plaintiffs, Defendants have not implemented a \n15  formal process for granting exceptions to these limits when necessary to avoid institutionalization, \n16  leaving Plaintiffs and others like them subject to ad hoc determinations by an unguided bureaucracy.  \n17  Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment, arguing that this situation places them at serious risk of \n18  unnecessary institutionalization in violation of the ADA.  The United States submits this Statement of \n19  Interest to clarify Defendants’ obligations under the ADA.3 \n                                           \n20  1 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517, the Attorney General may send any officer of the Department of Justice \nto “attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States.”   \n21 \n2 Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 100 (Mar. 10, 2016) (“Mot.”) also addresses a \n22 \nclaim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The United States takes no position \n23  with respect to that claim and addresses only Plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, which are \nanalyzed identically for all relevant purposes.  M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 733 (9th Cir. 2011); U.S. \n24  Dep’t of Justice, Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C. n.4 (June 22, 2011), \n25 \nhttp://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm (the “DOJ Olmstead Statement”). \n26 \n3 In addition to opposing Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants filed a Motion to \n27  Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), ECF No. 99 (Mar. 8, 2016), arguing that this case has \nbecome moot by virtue of Defendants’ decision to authorize all medically necessary services for \n28  (footnote cont’d on next page) \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 3 of 10   Page ID #:7972\n \n1  I.

These waiver programs must be cost-neutral to the alternative of providing care in an \n8  institution.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D); 42 C.F.R. § 441.302(e).  In the Waiver at issue here, \n9  participants may receive services through the Waiver if they require a level of care otherwise available \n10  in an institution – e.g. a hospital or nursing facility; the cost of services available to an individual under \n11  the Waiver is then capped according to that individual’s designated level of care.  P52-53.5  Although \n12  the caps correspond to the type of institution in which the individual would otherwise receive services, \n13  the Waiver caps are lower than the average cost of providing care in the corresponding institution.  P53, \n14  P55-61.  Defendants have no written policy or process for authorizing exceptions to the cost ceilings.  \n15  P93-95.  Yet on an ad hoc basis the Defendants have administered treatment plans for individuals on \n16  the waiver with costs in excess of the applicable limit.  P106, 109.  Plaintiffs are three men with \n17  significant physical disabilities.  P116-128, 190-196, 236-242 (describing Plaintiffs’ undisputed \n                                           \n18  Plaintiffs, regardless of the cost limitations.  The United States takes no position with respect to the \nmootness of Plaintiffs’ claims.  \n19 \n4 CMS approval of a Medicaid waiver, as Defendants acknowledge, P28, does not address States’ \n20 \nindependent obligations under the ADA.  See, e.g., Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 601 (7th Cir. \n2004) (allowing the plaintiffs’ claims to proceed without regard to federal approval of the state’s \n21 \nMedicaid plan and waiver programs); Grooms v. Maram, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840, 844, 863 (N.D. Ill. \n22  2008) (same).  The two statutes impose independent legal obligations.  Davis v. Shah, No. 14-cv-543, \nslip op. at 74 (2d Cir. Mar. 24, 2016) (“A state’s duties under the ADA are wholly distinct from its \n23  obligations under the Medicaid Act”); Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 518 n.1 (9th Cir. 2003); \nFisher v. Okla. Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1182 (10th Cir. 2003) (“the failure to provide \n24 \nMedicaid services in a community-based setting may constitute a form of discrimination”); see also \nDOJ Olmstead Statement at Question 7 (“A state’s obligations under the ADA are independent from the \n25 \nrequirements of the Medicaid program”).  Thus, federal approval of a waiver application does not \n26  address the existence of a violation of the ADA. \n27  5 Cites to “PXX” or “DXX” refer to the Parties’ Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, ECF No. 102 (Mar. \n10, 2016), submitted in connection with Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment. \n28 \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 4 of 10   Page ID #:7973\n \n1  medical conditions).  The cost of the care each man requires in order to avoid unnecessary \n2  institutionalization exceeds the ceiling applicable to each man.  P173, 179, 220-221, 229, 291, 293, 298 \n3  (undisputed that October 2015 letters authorized services in excess of the applicable limit).   \n4  II. ARGUMENT \n5  A.  The ADA Prohibits Unjustified Institutionalization \n6    Public entities must provide services to individuals with disabilities in the most integrated \n7  setting appropriate to their needs.  Townsend, 328 F.3d at 517 (“Because DSHS does not allow Mr. \n8  Townsend to receive the services for which he is qualified in a community-based, rather than nursing \n9  home, setting, Mr. Townsend can prove that the Secretary has violated Title II of the ADA”); Joseph S. \n10  v. Hogan, 561 F. Supp. 2d 280, 285 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (the ADA prohibits “discrimination in the form of \n11  unnecessary segregation of those with disabilities in nursing homes and other institutions”).  Congress \n12  enacted the ADA in order to provide a “clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \n13  of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  Congress noted that \n14  society has “tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,” and that discrimination, \n15  including by institutionalization, “continue[s] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  Id. \n16  §§ 12101(a)(2), (3).  Congress therefore prohibited discrimination by public entities, including states \n17  and state instrumentalities, against individuals with disabilities, providing that “no qualified individual \n18  with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the \n19  benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by \n20  any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.   \n21    In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court confirmed that Title II requires \n22  states to provide community-based services for individuals with disabilities when “such placement is \n23  appropriate, the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be reasonably \n24  accommodated….”  Id. at 607.  That holding, the court explained, reflected “two evident judgments.”  \n25  Id. at 600.  “Institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings \n26  perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating \n27  in community life.”  Id.  Second, “confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life \n28 \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 5 of 10   Page ID #:7974\n \n1  activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic \n2  independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Id. at 601.   \n3    The Attorney General’s regulations implementing the ADA6 require public entities to \n4  “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \n5  qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  The “most integrated setting” is one \n6  which “enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent \n7  possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35 App. B (2011).  The regulations prohibit the use of “criteria or methods of \n8  administration” that have the “effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \n9  discrimination on the basis of disability.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i).  Finally, the regulations require \n10  public entities to “make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the \n11  modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.”7  Id. § 35.130(b)(7). \n12  B.  Defendants Cannot Administer the Medicaid Waiver Without Accounting \n13  for Individual Needs  \n14    When limitations on Waiver services place individuals at serious risk of unnecessary \n15  institutionalization, the State must make a reasonable modification to those limitations.  Cota v. \n16  Maxwell-Jolly, 688 F. Supp. 2d 980, 996 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (new law limiting availability of adult day \n17  care services likely violated ADA because “the new eligibility criteria likely will result in the \n18  termination of [adult day care] services for a large number of persons with disabilities, without regard \n19  to the individual’s particular need for such services”) (emphasis added); Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 609-\n                                           \n20  6 Congress directed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations implementing the anti-\ndiscrimination directive of § 12132.  42 U.S.C. § 12134.  Given this delegation, the Department of \n21 \nJustice’s interpretation of the ADA and of its own implementing regulations is entitled to deference.  \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 597-98. (“Because the Department is the agency directed by Congress to issue \n22 \nregulations implementing Title II, [internal citation omitted] its views warrant respect.”). \n23 \n7 Defendants have not raised, and the United States does not address, the affirmative defense available \n24  to public entities in an ADA case.   A public entity may be excused from making modifications to its \nservice system when it can prove that the change would be a “fundamental alteration.”  “A fundamental \n25 \nalteration requires the public entity to prove ‘that, in the allocation of available resources, immediate \nrelief for plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State [or local government] has \n26 \ntaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with [ ]  disabilities.’”  \n27  DOJ Olmstead Statement at Question 10 (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604) (alterations in original). \n28 \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 6 of 10   Page ID #:7975\n \n1  10.  Limitations on waiver services – for example waiting lists or cost caps – can violate the ADA if \n2  they do not accommodate an individual placed at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization \n3  because of those limitations.  See, e.g., Cruz v. Dudek, No. 10-cv-23048, 2010 WL 4284955, at *13 \n4  (S.D. Fla. Oct. 12, 2010) (Florida’s spinal cord injury waiver violated ADA where plaintiffs were \n5  “required to enter a nursing home for at least 60 days before they are eligible to receive these services \n6  because they are too far down on the waiting list”).   \n7    To be sure, limitations on services are not per se discrimination.  But when the state does \n8  impose limitations, the ADA may nonetheless require the state to modify those limitations to avoid \n9  serious risk of institutionalization, unless doing so would be a fundamental alteration.8  B.N. v. Murphy, \n10  No. 09-cv-199, 2011 WL 5838976, at *7 (N.D. Ind. Nov. 16, 2011) (cap on respite care services \n11  discriminated against 14 individuals who were unable to secure alternative services and were at risk of \n12  institutionalization without additional respite care); DOJ Olmstead Statement at Question 7 (“the fact \n13  that a state is permitted to ‘cap’ the number of individuals it serves in a particular waiver program under \n14  the Medicaid Act does not exempt the state from serving additional people in the community to comply \n15  with the ADA or other laws”).   \n16    For instance, the court in Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161 (N.D. Cal. 2009), \n17  observed that the challenged state-wide reductions in adult day care services could have been ADA-\n18  compliant if the state had “implement[ed] any means of ensuring that, if and when the cuts take effect, \n19  the necessary alternative services will be identified and in place for Plaintiffs.”  Id. at 1174 (emphasis \n20  added).  Because the state could not demonstrate the existence of any such means, the court rejected the \n21  state’s argument that “Plaintiffs [could] avoid the risk of institutionalization by availing themselves of \n22  other, largely unspecified Medi-Cal or other community services.”  Id.; see also V.L. v. Wagner, 669 F. \n23  Supp. 2d 1106, 1122 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (noting that the state could establish “individualized measures” \n24  to reduce In-Home Supportive Services (“IHSS”) where those services were provided for “convenience \n25  or improved quality of life rather than need”); Crabtree v. Goetz, No. 08-cv-0939, 2008 WL 5330506, \n26  at *25, (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 19, 2008) (noting plaintiffs’ evidence that the state was “forcing Plaintiffs \n                                           \n27  8 In this case, Defendants could reasonably modify the cost limitations by, for example, seeking \nauthorization from CMS to increase the limits.   \n28 \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 7 of 10   Page ID #:7976\n \n1  into nursing homes without any mechanisms to determine whether their medical needs can be met in the \n2  community or the nursing home” and rejecting a “categorical approach”) (emphasis added); DOJ \n3  Olmstead Statement at Question 9 (“In making…budget cuts, public entities have a duty to take all \n4  reasonable steps to avoid placing individuals at risk of institutionalization”). \n5  Here, Defendants admit that they have no written policies or procedures to meet the needs of \n6  individuals whose care costs exceed the applicable cost limitation.  P93 (Defendants’ response \n7  acknowledges “there is no written policy or criteria”).  Even assuming that individual supervisors do \n8  indeed have the discretion to authorize exceptional levels of care, id., without any demonstration of how \n9  the state exercises that discretion, Defendants have not “implement[ed] any means of ensuring” that \n10  individuals who need that exceptional care to avoid institututionalization actually receive it.  Brantley, \n11  656 F. Supp. 2d at 1174 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).  And because the funding \n12  source for these additional services is not clear in the record,9 it is also unclear whether these exceptions \n13  comply with the Waiver.  An opaque and unwritten policy, P93, implemented without an effort by \n14  Defendants to track its use, P102-103, and triggered for these Plaintiffs only after a year of litigation in \n15  federal court, P315, 321-322, does not “ensure” that individuals who require additional care to remain \n16  in the community will have the necessary alternative services identified and put in place to avoid \n17  unnecessary institutionalization.  Brantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1174. \n18  C.  The Integration Mandate Protects Individuals Currently Receiving \n19  Community-Based Services Who are at Serious Risk of Institutionalization \n20    Although Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs are not at risk of institutionalization because they \n21  are “doing well at home and have received the medically necessary care to remain safely in their \n22  homes,” Mot. at 3, the at-risk inquiry is not focused on a plaintiff’s past or immediate circumstances, in \n23  isolation, but rather on the ultimate question of the likelihood of a future institutionalization.  As the \n24  Department of Justice’s regulatory guidance makes clear, a state violates the integration mandate of the \n25                                             \n9 It is undisputed that Defendants “intend to use state-only dollars to fund Waiver costs over individual \n26  cost limits attributable to IHSS and [Waiver Personal Care Services] overtime rather than reduce \nservices to Waiver participants,” P45.  However the record does not specify the funding source for \n27  excess services other than overtime costs.   P109.   \n28 \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 8 of 10   Page ID #:7977\n \n1  ADA “if a public entity’s failure to provide community services or its cut to such services will likely \n2  cause a decline in health, safety, or welfare that would lead to the individual’s eventual placement in an \n3  institution.”  DOJ Olmstead Statement at Question 6 (emphasis added); see also Radaszewski, 383 F.3d \n4  at 609 (“A State may violate Title II when it refuses to provide an existing benefit to a disabled person \n5  that would enable that individual to live in a more community-integrated setting”).10   \n6  At times, the inquiry can focus on a plaintiff’s past or current stability in the community.  Those \n7  circumstances are not dispositive, however.  Instead, past circumstances are relevant to the extent they \n8  inform the assessment of whether an individual is at serious risk of entering an institution.  For instance, \n9  in determining that a plaintiff in Cruz was at risk of institutionalization, the Court noted that he had \n10  been hospitalized three times in 10 months “either directly or indirectly [as] a result of not receiving \n11  adequate in-home health care services.”  Cruz, 2010 WL 4284955, at *3.   \n12    Consistent with this settled law, and with the DOJ Olmstead Statement, courts have frequently \n13  intervened when a state’s Medicaid services are insufficient to ensure that individuals would continue \n14  to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate – even when those individuals were “doing \n15  well at home” as Defendants allege is the situation for Plaintiffs here.  Fisher addressed a decision by \n16  Oklahoma to impose a cap of five medically necessary prescriptions on participants receiving \n17  community-based care through Oklahoma’s waiver program “while continuing to provide unlimited \n18  prescriptions to patients in nursing facilities.”  335 F.3d at 1178-79.  Without discussing plaintiffs’ \n19  then-current medical situation, and agreeing that the new regulation would lead to unnecessary \n20                                             \n10 See also Davis v. Shah, No. 14-cv-543, slip op. at 70-74 (2d Cir. Mar. 24, 2016); Oster v. \n21  Lightbourne, No. 09-cv-4668, 2012 WL 691833, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2012) (granting preliminary \nrelief where “the evidence also shows that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the loss \n22  of IHSS hours will compromise the health and well-being of IHSS recipients such that they will be at \nserious risk of institutionalization”); Peter B. v. Sanford, No. 10-cv-767, 2010 WL 5912259, at *7-8 \n23  (D.S.C. Nov. 24, 2010) report and recommendation adopted 2011 WL 824584 (Mar. 7, 2011);  Cruz, \n2010 WL 4284955, at *12-13; G. v. Hawaii, No. 08-cv-551, 2010 WL 3489632, at *9 (D. Haw.  Sept. \n24  3, 2010) (“A state’s reduction in services may violate the integration mandate where it unjustifiably \nforces or will likely force beneficiaries from an integrated environment into institutional care”); \n25  Brantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1170-17 (“Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated for purposes of the \ninstant motion that the proposed reduction in [adult day care] services will place them at serious risk of \n26  institutionalization”); V.L., 669 F. Supp. 2d at 1119-20 (“Elderly and disabled individuals with unmet \nin-home care needs will likely suffer falls which will lead to hospitalization and subsequent \n27  institutionalization”); Grooms, 563 F. Supp. 2d at 850. \n28 \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 9 of 10   Page ID #:7978\n \n1  institutionalization,11 the Tenth Circuit reversed the grant of summary judgment in defendants’ favor, \n2  holding that the plaintiffs survived summary judgment by showing that the state did not allow them “to \n3  receive services for which they are qualified unless they agree to enter a nursing home.”  Id. at 1182.  In \n4  another case, plaintiffs in V.L. challenged a California law changing eligibility rules for in-home \n5  supportive services, passed in response to the state’s budget crisis.  Again engaging in a forward-\n6  looking inquiry, the court found that plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits of their ADA claim, \n7  because they would “face a severe risk of institutionalization as a result of losing the services that [the \n8  new law] would eliminate.”  669 F. Supp. 2d at 1119-20; see also Cota, 688 F. Supp. 2d at 994-995 \n9  (preliminarily enjoining implementation of new, more restrictive, eligibility criteria for adult day care \n10  services). \n11    Although the cases described above arose when the state took steps to reduce the medically \n12  necessary care it had been providing, a state can violate the ADA even when it maintains the status quo.  \n13  The plaintiff in Townsend challenged the state of Washington’s Medicaid system, which provided \n14  categorically needy12 residents the option of receiving long-term medical care and living assistance \n15  either in nursing home settings, their own homes, or adult family homes.  328 F.3d at 514.  Medically \n16  needy residents were given only one option: nursing homes.  Id.  The plaintiff had been receiving \n17  services in a family home, but when his income increased beyond the threshold established by the state \n18  and he became medically needy, he was faced with a choice: “move to a nursing home within 30 days \n19  or lose his Medicaid benefits.”  Id. at 514.  The court did not consider Townsend’s then-current medical \n20  situation, except to observe that his success in the community clearly demonstrated the propriety of \n21  continuing to receive community-based services.  Id. at 516.  Instead, the court considered whether \n                                           \n22  11 The Oklahoma defendants argued that, because the plaintiffs stated they would “rather die than be \nplaced in a nursing home” or would refuse to go to a nursing facility, the plaintiffs could not show any \n23  harm and were not entitled to injunctive relief.  Id. at 1184.  The court rejected this argument, noting \n“that they have emphatically stated their desire to remain in the community does not mean that they do \n24  not face a substantial risk of harm.”  Id.  Defendants’ reference in this case to Plaintiffs’ steadfast desire \nto remain in the community, D41-42, is similarly misplaced. \n25 \n12 States participating in Medicaid must provide Medicaid coverage to the categorically needy, those \n26  with incomes below a certain threshold, and have the option of providing coverage to individuals with \nslightly higher incomes: the medically needy.  See, e.g., Schweiker v. Hogan, 457 U.S. 569, 572-73 \n27  (1982); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10); 42 C.F.R. § 435.4. \n28 \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 112   Filed 03/29/16   Page 10 of 10   Page ID\n #:7979\n \n1  Townsend could remain in the community given the state’s policy of limiting community-based \n2  services to only the categorically needy – and answered in the negative.  Id. at 518.  Here, as in \n3  Townsend, the question is whether Plaintiffs are at risk of unnecessarily entering an institution by virtue \n4  of Defendants’ ad hoc practice regarding cost limitation exceptions.  \n5  III. CONCLUSION \n6    The United States respectfully encourages the Court to assess Plaintiffs’ motion in light of the \n7  principles set forth above.

INTRODUCTION \n \n2 1. This civil rights action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to stop \n3 Defendants Department of Health Care Services and its Director, Jennifer Kent \n4 (\"DHCS\" or \"Defendants\") from continuing their illegal practices which result in \n5 denial of critically needed Medi-Cal funded in-home services to individuals such as \n6 Plaintiffs Jerry Thomas, Sean Benison, and Juan Palomares, and the clients of \n7 organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT.  Failure to receive these services will result in \n8 severe harm and potential institutionalization of these individuals with disabilities.  \n9 Due to their fragile medical conditions, placement in an institution is likely to result \n10 in dire health consequences and even death.  Institutional care for Plaintiffs would \n11 also cost the State significantly more than it would to keep them safely in their own \n12 homes.  \n \n13 2. Individual Plaintiffs have severe disabilities and chronic medical \n14 conditions: Plaintiff Jerry Thomas is diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy \n15 and Post-Polio Syndrome.  Plaintiff Sean Benison has advanced hereditary \n16 progressive Muscular Dystrophy.  Plaintiff Juan Palomares has a complete spinal \n17 cord injury at the 4th vertebrae in the cervical area (C-4); the spinal cord injury also \n18 caused autonomic dysreflexia, which is instability in his nervous system that can \n19 cause unpredictable and potentially life-threatening blood pressure changes.  Due to \n20 their health conditions, Plaintiffs are quadriplegic and cannot move on their own.  \n21 Plaintiffs Thomas and Benison have tracheal tubes connected to ventilators to help \n22 them breathe.  Plaintiff Thomas receives nutrition and hydration via a Gastrostomy \n23 feeding tube.  \n \n24 3. Although Plaintiffs meet the criteria for placement in nursing \n25 institutions, Plaintiffs have been able to remain in their communities and close to \n26 their families because of in-home care available to them in their homes under the \n27 Medi-Cal Home and Community-Based Services Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital \n28 Waiver (“NF/AH Waiver”), administered by Defendants.  \n1 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 3 of 40   Page ID #:728\n \n \n \n1 4. All three Plaintiffs live in their own homes, with round-the-clock care \n2 provided by licensed nurses, and unlicensed paid and/or unpaid attendants.  \n3 However, Plaintiffs also have unmet care needs.  Pursuant to their doctors’ orders, \n4 Plaintiff Thomas needs 24 hour nursing care, and Plaintiff Benison needs additional \n5 nursing care, to assess and address their complex and unpredictable needs, including \n6 monitoring their ventilators and oxygen levels, preparing and administering \n7 medications, and clearing fluids from their lungs and tracheotomy tubes.  Plaintiff \n8 Palomares needs, among other things, nursing care to manage his complicated \n9 catheter care, and monitor and assess his unstable and unpredictable health \n10 conditions; additional attendant hours so that he can be repositioned and cared for \n11 more frequently to prevent health crises; and reinstatement of RN case management.  \n12 Plaintiff Benison, who lives alone, also requires Case Management and Habilitation \n13 services, which are available under the NF/AH Waiver.   \n \n14 5. Plaintiffs have all requested additional in-home care services from \n15 Defendants, so that they can continue living safely in their homes and communities.  \n16 Defendants have denied these requests.  The sole reason Plaintiffs are not able to get \n17 these critically needed services is because Defendants have placed arbitrary cost \n18 limitations on services available under the NF/AH Waiver.   \n \n19 6. For Waiver participants like Plaintiffs Thomas and Benison, who have \n20 been determined to meet the Subacute level of care, Medi-Cal would pay $271,697 \n21 per year for institutional placement in a Subacute facility; however, Defendants have \n22 capped the budget for comparable in-home services funded through the NF/AH \n23 Waiver at $180,219 per year, which is at least $90,000 below the actual cost of \n24 equivalent care in a Subacute facility.  The cost of the additional nursing and other \n25 NF/AH Waiver services requested by Plaintiffs Thomas and Benison would cost \n26 less than placement in a Subacute facility.   \n \n27 7. Similarly, for Waiver participants like Plaintiff Palomares, who have \n28 been determined to meet the Nursing Facility Level B (“NF-B”) Level of Care, \n2 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 4 of 40   Page ID #:729\n \n \n1 Medi-Cal would pay approximately $70,000 per year for institutional placement in a \n2 Nursing Facility; however, Defendants have capped the budget for in-home services \n3 funded through the NF/AH Waiver at $48,180.00 per year, which is more than \n4 $21,000 below the actual cost of equivalent care in a Nursing Facility.  The cost of \n5 the additional nursing and other NF/AH Waiver services requested by Plaintiff \n6 Palomares would cost less than placement in a Nursing Facility.  \n \n7 8. The NF/AH Waiver cost-caps at all levels of care are significantly \n8 below the rate Medi-Cal pays to institutions at the equivalent level of care.   \n \n9 9. Defendants have the discretion and the ability to modify the NF/AH \n10 Waiver to enable Plaintiffs to receive the skilled nursing care and other services they \n11 need to remain safely at home.  But, they have refused to provide these essential \n12 services on the grounds that it exceeds their arbitrary cost-caps.  \n \n13 10. Defendants’ actions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n14 1990 (“ADA”), (42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2008)), Section 504 of the \n15 Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”), (29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a (2014)), and \n16 California Government Code section 11135 (Cal. Gov’t. Code § 11135 (2011)). \n \n17 11. Under the ADA and Section 504, a public agency such as DHCS has a \n18 duty to provide services to people with disabilities in the “most integrated setting \n19 appropriate to their needs” and to prevent unnecessary institutionalization.  The \n20 most integrated setting for the individual Plaintiffs and clients of IN SPIRIT is to \n21 continue living in their homes in the community, with adequate NF/AH Waiver \n22 services to meet their significant needs.  Placing individuals with disabilities such as \n23 Plaintiffs at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in order to receive the care they \n24 need violates the ADA. \n \n25 12. Under the ADA, Defendants also have an obligation to use methods of \n26 administration that do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities such as \n27 Plaintiffs.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that individuals with disabilities like \n28 Plaintiffs are provided with adequate NF/AH Waiver services to continue living \n3 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 5 of 40   Page ID #:730\n \n \n1 safely in their homes, and their decision to set funding levels for services that are \n2 biased in favor of institutional care results in discrimination against Plaintiffs in the \n3 administration of the Medi-Cal program.  \n4 II.   JURISDICTION \n \n5 13. This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of \n6 Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2008) and \n7 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (2014).  \n \n8 14. Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (1980) and 1343 (1979).  \n9 Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized under \n10 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 (2010) and 2202 (1948).  At all times relevant to this action, \n11 Defendants have acted under color of state law.  \n \n12 15. The Court has Supplemental Jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state claim \n13 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (1990) and California Government Code section \n14 11139 (2001).    \n15 III.   VENUE \n \n16 16. Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to \n17 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) (2011), because the Defendants operate and perform their \n18 official duties therein and thus reside therein for purposes of venue, and because a \n19 substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in \n20 the Central District of California.  Plaintiff Jerry Thomas lives and receives Medi-\n21 Cal services in Orange County, which is in the Central District of California.  \n22 Plaintiff Juan Palomares lives and receives Medi-Cal services in Los Angeles \n23 County, which is in the Central District of California.  Plaintiff Sean Benison lives \n24 and receives Medi-Cal services in Ventura County, which is in the Central District \n25 of California.  Defendant DHCS operates the Medi-Cal program, conducts business \n26 and provides Medi-Cal services to Plaintiffs in Orange County, Los Angeles County \n27 and Ventura County, all in the Central District of California.   \n28\n4 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 6 of 40   Page ID #:731\n \n \n1 IV.   PARTIES \n2 Organizational Plaintiff \n \n3 17. Organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT is a non-profit organization which \n4 provides financial aid to people with disabilities to help them pay for personal care \n5 attendants to enable them to live in their own homes.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is to \n6 empower individuals with disabilities to sustain their health, continue their \n7 participation in their families and communities, and avoid nursing facility \n8 placement.  IN SPIRIT has been directly injured by Defendants’ actions, which \n9 impede its ability to carry out its mission to assist people with disabilities in \n10 accessing community support services.  IN SPIRIT has provided and currently \n11 provides financial assistance to individuals on the NF/AH Waiver, in order to \n12 supplement their limited at-home care services covered by the Waiver.  Because of \n13 its commitment to provide financial support for attendant care for needy, high-level \n14 quadriplegics, IN SPIRIT will serve clients on the NF/AH Waiver in the future.  IN \n15 SPIRIT has had to divert scarce resources from other potential clients to NF/AH \n16 Waiver recipients to pay for services that, but for the cost-caps, would be funded by \n17 the NF/AH waiver. \n18 Individual Plaintiffs \n \n19 18. Each individual Plaintiff is a “qualified person with a disability” within \n20 the meaning of all applicable statutes, including 42 U.S.C. §12131(2) (1990) and 29 \n21 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B) (2014).  Plaintiffs have been and continue to be Medi-Cal \n22 beneficiaries and are on the NF/AH Waiver.   \n \n23 19. Plaintiff Jerry Thomas is 73 years old and has Progressive Supranuclear \n24 Palsy (“PSP”), a degenerative brain disorder that causes serious and progressive \n25 problems with gait and balance, eye movement, cognitive difficulties, and muscle \n26 weakness.  His disease is progressive and thus symptoms will worsen over time.  In \n27 addition to PSP, Mr. Thomas has Post-Polio Syndrome, quadriplegia, chronic pain \n28 syndrome, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), chronic respiratory failure, recurrent \n5 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 7 of 40   Page ID #:732\n \n \n1 pneumonia and/or bronchitis, chronic constipation, chronic atelectasis (a complete \n2 or partial collapse of the lung), recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections \n3 (“UTIs”), and hypothyroidism, among other conditions.  After 14 years of \n4 institutional placement, Mr. Thomas now resides at home with his wife of over 30 \n5 years, Beverly Thomas, who brought him home from a Subacute facility in 2013.  \n6 She serves as his Guardian ad Litem in this litigation. \n \n7 20. Plaintiff Sean Benison is 43 years old and has advanced hereditary \n8 progressive Becker Muscular Dystrophy; is quadriplegic; and has chronic \n9 respiratory failure, chronic pain disorder, anxiety disorder, DVT \n10 (thromboembolism) prophylaxis and reflux esophagitis.  He lives on his own in his \n11 apartment, where he moved in October 2013 after living for two years in a Subacute \n12 facility. \n \n13 21. Plaintiff Juan Palomares is 38 years old and had a complete spinal cord \n14 injury at the 4th vertebrae in the cervical (neck) part of his spine in 2005.  He has \n15 quadriplegia and is dependent on others for all of his daily care needs.  He is \n16 susceptible to recurring urinary tract infections and has recurring difficulties with \n17 his suprapubic catheter tube clogging.  He has chronic pain, which must be managed \n18 with medications, including narcotics, on an as-needed basis.  Mr. Palomares is \n19 subject to frequent (currently 5-6 episodes a week) and life threatening autonomic \n20 dysreflexia, which is an episode of acute, uncontrolled hypertension for which he \n21 requires frequent and skilled preventative care.  Mr. Palomares lives with his father \n22 who is his primary caregiver.    \n \n23 22. Plaintiffs Thomas and Benison have a tracheal tube that is connected to \n24 a ventilator to help them breathe.  Due to their mucous secretions and their inability \n25 to swallow due to the tracheotomy and loss of muscle function, Plaintiffs Thomas \n26 and Benison must be suctioned as needed, sometimes as frequently as four to five \n27 times an hour, when saliva builds up in the mouth, nose, and throat to avoid pooling \n28 of mucous or any fluid in the lungs.  If fluid does go into the lungs, it could impair \n6 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 8 of 40   Page ID #:733\n \n \n1 oxygen exchange, resulting in lack of oxygen and permanent damage to organs \n2 (including brain injury), pneumonia, and infection.  Plaintiff Benison uses a cuffed \n3 tracheotomy which is uncuffed during the day and allows for the possibility of \n4 communication/speech, but also allows fluid to go into the lungs if not timely \n5 suctioned.  Plaintiff Thomas uses a cuffed trach at all times.  During the night, \n6 Plaintiff Benison also uses a cuffed tracheotomy so he is not able to speak – which \n7 can be more dangerous since he is not able to communicate if they are in distress.  \n8 Further, air leaks out of the cuff, and a nurse is required to keep adding air to the \n9 cuff and to monitor the ventilator settings to ensure Plaintiffs are properly \n10 ventilated:  too much air puts pressure on the lungs and too little air can make them \n11 unconscious.  Plaintiff Thomas has a Gastrostomy tube (“G-tube”) for feeding and \n12 medication administration. \n \n13 23. Plaintiffs are completely dependent on medical technologies for \n14 survival.  Plaintiffs use wheelchairs for mobility at all times.  Plaintiffs cannot \n15 move, turn, feed, dress, bathe or take care of themselves.  They need total care for \n16 every daily activity.   \n \n17 24. Plaintiffs Thomas and Benison's in-home nursing care is provided by \n18 licensed vocational nurses (“LVNs” or “nurses”).  LVNs are licensed to provide \n19 skilled nursing care in many settings including hospitals.  42 C.F.R. § 409.31(a) \n20 (2005); 22 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 70055(a)(16), 70055(a)(16) and 70217(a) (2013).  \n21 These one-on-one skilled nursing services have been ordered by Plaintiffs Thomas \n22 and Benison’s physicians because their care requires the exercise of judgment \n23 informed by experience and expertise in addressing the care needs of persons with \n24 severe disabilities and chronic illnesses.  The services Plaintiffs Thomas and \n25 Benison require cannot safely be provided by untrained or unskilled individuals and \n26 are medically necessary. \n \n27 25. Plaintiff Palomares’ in-home care includes In-Home Supportive \n28 Services and Waiver Personal Care Services.  Because of the severity of his \n7 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 9 of 40   Page ID #:734\n \n \n1 disability, his constant risk of autonomic dysreflexia and complications related to his \n2 catheter, Plaintiff Palomares requires, but does not receive, additional in-home \n3 attendant care, nursing care by licensed nurses, and nursing case management.    \n4 Defendant Department of Health Care Services \n \n5 26. Defendant California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) \n6 administers the California Medicaid program, called “Medi-Cal.”  DHCS is the \n7 single state agency responsible for the administration of the Medi-Cal program.   \n \n8 27. Defendant Jennifer Kent is DHCS’ current Director and is sued only in \n9 her official capacity.  Director Kent is responsible for directing, organizing, and \n10 administering the Medi-Cal program, including Medi-Cal Home and Community-\n11 Based Services Waivers, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.  As \n12 such, she is responsible for DHCS’ compliance with state and federal laws \n13 governing the Medi-Cal program.   \n14 V.   STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \n15 A.  THE MEDICAID PROGRAM   \n \n16 28. Medicaid is a joint federal and state medical assistance program for \n17 certain groups of low-income people, including children.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v \n18 (2014).  California has elected to participate in the Medicaid program, and so must \n19 comply with the requirements of the federal Medicaid Act and its implementing \n20 regulations.   \n \n21 29. The purpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as practicable, “medical \n22 assistance on behalf of . . . aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose income and \n23 resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services” and “to \n24 help such families and individuals to attain or retain capability for independence or \n25 self-care . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1396 (2014).  \n \n26 30. Participating States are reimbursed by the federal government for a \n27 portion of the cost of providing Medicaid benefits.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396b (2010).  \n28\n8 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 10 of 40   Page ID #:735\n \n \n1 The remaining funding for the Medi-Cal program comes from the State and from \n2 counties. \n \n3 31. States participating in Medicaid must designate a “single state agency” \n4 to administer or supervise the administration of the Medicaid program.  42 U.S.C. \n5 § 1396a(a)(5) (2014).  DHCS is the single state agency so designated in California. \n \n6 32. The California Medi-Cal program provides an array of medical \n7 services, treatments, and therapies that are authorized based on individuals’ meeting \n8 “medical necessity” criteria.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 14059 (1969), 14059.5 (1985), \n9 and 14133.3 (2004); 22 Cal. Code Regs. § 51303(a) (2013). \n10 Medi-Cal Home and Community-Based Services Waivers \n \n11 33. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) is the federal agency \n12 that oversees the administration of the Medicaid programs offered by each state.  \n13 CMS has the authority to waive certain provisions of federal Medicaid law to allow \n14 states to provide home and community-based services (“HCBS”) in lieu of \n15 institutional care, for targeted groups of individuals who otherwise would require \n16 care in a medical facility.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1) (2010).    \n \n17 34. DHCS has been mandated by the Legislature to “seek all necessary \n18 waivers . . . in order to provide in-home and community-based care.”  Welf. & Inst. \n19 Code §§ 14132(t) (2014), 14137 (1986).  DHCS routinely seeks and secures federal \n20 approval to renew and amend HCBS Waivers within permissible federal limitations.  \n \n21 35. HCBS Waivers in California include the Nursing Facility/Acute \n22 Hospital (“NF/AH”) Waiver.  The purpose of the NF/AH Waiver is to provide \n23 Medi-Cal beneficiaries with long-term medical conditions who meet one of the \n24 designated \"levels of care\" described below, the option of returning to and/or \n25 remaining in their  homes or home-like community settings in lieu of \n26 institutionalization.  The NF/AH Waiver application, which is submitted and \n27 approved by CMS, governs DHCS’ administration of NF/AH Waiver services.  The \n28 current version of the Waiver is State of California Department of Health Care \n9 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 11 of 40   Page ID #:736\n \n \n1 Services, Application for § 1915(c) HCBS Waiver Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital \n2 (NF/AH) Waiver, (12/1/2012 - 12/31/2016), \n3 http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ltc/Documents/NFAH%20Transition%20and%20D\n4 iversion%20Waiver%2012-1-2012.pdf  (\"NF/AH Waiver\") at 7-8.    \n \n5 36. In seeking federal approval for the NF/AH Waiver, DHCS gave \n6 assurances to CMS, including that: (a) Necessary safeguards have been taken to \n7 protect the health and welfare of participants receiving services under the NF/AH \n8 Waiver; and, (b) Plans of Care are responsive to NF/AH Waiver participants’ needs.  \n9 NF/AH Waiver at 9-10. \n \n10 37. Under the umbrella of the NF/AH HCBS Waiver, DHCS administers \n11 several HCBS waivers which each correspond to an institutional level of care.  The \n12 relevant levels of care for adults are: Nursing Facility Level A or B (“NF-A\" and\" \n13 NF-B”), Nursing Facility Subacute (“Subacute”), and Acute Hospital.  Each of the \n14 HCBS Waivers contained in the NF/AH Waiver offers an array of home and \n15 community-based services, discussed below.  \n \n16 38. The level of care criteria for the NF/AH Home and Community-Based \n17 Services Waivers explicitly describe the type and level (or severity) of functional \n18 limitations and/or skilled nursing needs an individual must have to be admitted to an \n19 institutional setting.  Upon meeting those eligibility criteria, or level of care, an \n20 individual may qualify for corresponding NF/AH HCBS Waiver services.  \n \n21 39. California offers various services under the NH/AH Waiver, including \n22 Private Duty Nursing, Waiver Personal Care Services, Case Management and \n23 Habilitation services that Plaintiffs are seeking.  NF/AH Waiver at 59.   \n \n24 40. “Private duty nursing” services means individual and continuous care \n25 (in contrast to part-time or intermittent care) provided by a licensed nurse or a \n26 certified home health aide employed by a home health agency within the scope of \n27 state law.  Private duty nursing services are provided in a recipient’s home, home-\n28\n10 \nThomas v.

Case Managers also assist in securing personal care \n8 providers, work with the participant and his/her physician in developing goals and \n9 identifying a course of action to respond to the assessed needs of the individual, as \n10 well as oversee the implementation of the services described in the Plan of \n11 Treatment.  Case Management responsibilities include assessing, care planning, \n12 locating, coordinating, and monitoring services for community-based participants on \n13 the waiver.

WPCS includes, inter alia, \n7 assistance with activities of daily living, adult companionship, housekeeping, food \n8 shopping, and other assistance to promote the participant’s highest level of \n9 independence in self-care.  NF/AH Waiver at 99-100. In order to meet federal cost-\n10 neutrality requirements, the NF/AH Waiver contains assurances that, in the \n11 aggregate for the entire NF/AH Waiver population, services provided in the \n12 community pursuant to the NF/AH Waiver will not exceed the cost of services in the \n13 institution designated for comparable care.  NF/AH Waiver at 10.  Defendants, \n14 however, have chosen to use an individual maximum benefit level, rather than an \n15 aggregate cost-cap.  Id. at 26-27.  Thus, each of  the Waivers within the NF/AH \n16 HCBS Waiver correspond to an institutional level of care and have individual “cost-\n17 caps” depending on the Medi-Cal rate for their corresponding facility.  These cost-\n18 caps allow a qualifying individual to choose from a menu of available home and \n19 community-based services but only up to the cost-cap for his or her level of care set \n20 by DHCS in the applicable HCBS Waiver.  NF/AH Waiver at 26-27.   \n \n21 44.

For individuals such as Mr. Thomas and Mr. Benison, who meet the \n12 institutional criteria and would otherwise be placed in a Subacute nursing facility, \n13 Defendants have arbitrarily set the cost-cap for NF/AH Waiver services at the adult \n14 Subacute level of care at $180,219, which is more than $90,000 below the rate for a \n15 Subacute facility.  NF/AH Waiver at 27.   \n \n16 46. For individuals such as Plaintiff Palomares, who meet the institutional \n17 criteria for and would otherwise be placed in a Nursing Facility Level B, Defendants \n18 have arbitrarily set the cost-cap for NF/AH Waiver services at the Nursing Facility-\n19 B level of care at $48,180, which is more than $21,000 below the current rate of \n20 $70,000 for a Nursing Facility-B facility.  NF/AH Waiver at 27.  Moreover, the \n21 NF/AH Waiver cost-cap at the Nursing Facility-B level of care has remained flat at \n22 the 2007 level, while Nursing Facility level B facilities have received substantial \n23 rate increases each year.   \n \n24 47.

CMS permits Defendants the option of authorizing NF/AH Waiver \n6 services to individual participants in excess of their individual cost limitation, but \n7 Defendants have not done so.  NF/AH Waiver at 29.  Defendants have declined to \n8 develop an exception process as a safeguard to enable participants to remain on the \n9 Waiver, but rather, have indicated to CMS that if a Waiver participant’s service \n10 costs exceed the cost-cap set by Defendants, they will instead:  1) refer the \n11 individual to another Waiver; 2) assist the participant to identify lower cost services \n12 within the cost-cap; or 3) refer the individual for institutional placement.  Id. \n13 In-Home Supportive Services \n \n14 49. The In-Home Supportive Services (“IHSS”) program is the State’s \n15 personal attendant care program pursuant to   California Welfare and Institutions \n16 Code sections 12300 et seq. (2004), 4132.95 (2004), 14132.951 (2009), and \n17 14132.952 (2009).  The IHSS program pays for certain services so eligible \n18 recipients can remain safely in their homes.  IHSS hourly wages are set county-wide \n19 throughout the State and vary by county.   \n \n20 50. To be eligible for IHSS, an individual must be over 65 years of age, or \n21 disabled, or blind.  IHSS services include:  housecleaning, meal preparation, \n22 laundry, grocery shopping, personal care services (such as bowel and bladder care, \n23 bathing, grooming and paramedical services), accompaniment to medical \n24 appointments, and protective supervision for the mentally impaired.  Recipients may \n25 choose their IHSS workers, who must meet minimal requirements for approval, such \n26 as a background check, but who are not required to be licensed or skilled medical \n27 practitioners.  The cost of IHSS services is factored into an individual’s NF/AH \n28\n14 \nThomas v.

ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS \n \n4 51. Qualifying individuals with disabilities are protected from disability \n5 discrimination, including segregation in institutions, by the ADA and Section 504.  \n \n6 52. In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “[i]ndividuals with \n7 disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, \n8 including…segregation…” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5) (2008).  Title II of the ADA \n9 provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, \n10 be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs, or \n11 activities of a public entity or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.”  \n12 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (1990). \n \n13 53. Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide:  “[a] public \n14 entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \n15 setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n16 § 35.130(d) (2010); see also Section 504, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a (2014); 28 C.F.R. \n17 § 41.51(d) (1982).  Further, “[t]he most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \n18 a qualified individual with a disability means a setting that enables individuals with \n19 disabilities to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  \n20 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, (2010).  \n21 54.  The United States Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, \n22 527 U.S. 581 (1999) held that the unnecessary institutionalization of individuals \n23 with disabilities is a form of discrimination under Title II of the ADA.  In doing so, \n24 the Court interpreted the ADA’s “integration mandate” as requiring persons with \n25 disabilities to be served in the community when: (1) the state determines that \n26 community-based treatment is appropriate; (2) the individual does not oppose \n27 community placement; and (3) community placement can be reasonably \n28 accommodated.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. \n15 \nThomas v.

Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA and Section 504 also \n2 provide: “A public entity may not, directly or through contractual or other \n3 arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of administration: (i) that have the \n4 effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the \n5 basis of disability; [or] (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or \n6 substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the entity’s program \n7 with respect to individuals with disabilities…” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3) (2010); \n8 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(I) (1982); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4) (2005). \n \n9 56. ADA regulations further provide: “[a] public entity shall not impose or \n10 apply eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a \n11 disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally \n12 enjoying any service, program, or activity, unless such criteria can be shown to be \n13 necessary for the provision of the service, program, or activity being offered.”  \n14 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8) (2010); see also parallel Section 504 regulations, 45 C.F.R. \n15 § 84.4(b)(1)(iv) (2005).   \n \n16 57. As set forth in federal regulations:  “[a] public entity shall make \n17 reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the \n18 modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless \n19 the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would \n20 fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. \n21 § 35.130(b)(7) (2010).   \n \n22 58. Similar to the ADA, California’s anti-discrimination statute prohibits \n23 discriminatory actions by the state and state-funded agencies or departments, and \n24 provides civil enforcement rights for violations.

FACTS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS  \n2 JERRY THOMAS \n \n3 59. Jerry Thomas was diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy in \n4 2007 at 66 years of age.  Progressive Supranuclear Palsy is a degenerative brain \n5 disorder that involves a loss of muscle control impacting gait and balance, eye \n6 movement, and thought processes. \n \n7 60. Mr. Thomas’ in-home nursing services have been funded entirely by \n8 Medi-Cal. \n \n9 61. Mr. Thomas lives at home with wife of over thirty years, Beverly \n10 Thomas.  Mr. Thomas’s wife is his primary care giver and his Guardian ad Litem.   \n \n11 62. Before Mr. Thomas became ill, he worked as a road manager for his \n12 brother, singer B.J. Thomas.  When he was not spending time with his wife or \n13 working, most weekends Mr. Thomas was hunting with his dogs and family \n14 members.   \n \n15 63. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas desire that he continue living at home with \n16 appropriate nursing services.  \n \n17 64. Mr. Thomas is medically fragile and technology dependent.  Mr. \n18 Thomas requires oxygen 24 hours a day and is connected to a ventilator at least 18 \n19 hours a day, and more when needed.  He receives nutrition, hydration and \n20 medication through his G-tube.  Mr. Thomas is non-ambulatory and cannot bear \n21 weight.  He uses a wheelchair and requires assistance with all activities of daily \n22 living (“ADLs”).  \n \n23 65. Mr. Thomas can no longer speak and is only able to communicate by \n24 blinking his eyes.  Individuals need training to understand his body language for \n25 signs and symptoms of changes in his condition, need, and medical emergencies.   \n \n26 66. At age 66, when Mr. Thomas could no longer breathe on his own due \n27 to muscle weakness, he had a tracheotomy.      \n28\n17 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 19 of 40   Page ID #:744\n \n \n \n1 67. In order to control his symptoms and severe pain, he takes over 40 \n2 medications, including several narcotics and seven medications that are provided \n3 pro re nata (“PRN” as needed). \n \n4 68. In addition to Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Mr. Thomas has been \n5 diagnosed with Post-Polio Syndrome, among other conditions.  \n \n6 69. Mr. Thomas lived in a nursing facility for 14 years, until his wife was \n7 able to bring him home with services under the NF/AH Waiver.  Since moving \n8 home on April 1, 2013, Mr. Thomas has been in the hospital or hospitalized several \n9 times including most recently in January 2015, as well as seen by his doctors on \n10 numerous occasions.  Mr. Thomas is regularly seen by his pulmonologist and \n11 primary care physician, as well as a neurologist. \n \n12 70. Since Mr. Thomas moved home, his condition has worsened due to the \n13 natural progression of his diseases.  He now requires more time connected to the \n14 ventilator and takes additional medications to assist with his digestive and \n15 tracheotomy suctioning needs.  In July 2014, Dr. Kayaleh, Mr. Thomas’s treating \n16 physician, ordered for him to be provided with 24 hour nursing care.  \n \n17 71. Mrs. Thomas is not a licensed vocational nurse and is not capable of \n18 providing the additional nursing care that Mr. Thomas requires.   \n19 Mr. Thomas’ Nursing Care Needs   \n \n20 72. As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n21 Thomas has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n22 addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include, e.g.,: monitoring Mr. Thomas’ \n23 oxygen saturation levels and providing skilled interventions when his oxygen levels \n24 drop below 92%, including breathing with ambu-bag, CPR, and calling 911; \n25 determining when Mr. Thomas must be placed on the ventilator during sprinting \n26 hours; monitoring and administering his medications including over 40 daily \n27 medications and seven medications to be taken PRN as needed for proper dosage, \n28 effectiveness, interactions, and side effects; monitoring the amount, sound, and color \n18 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 20 of 40   Page ID #:745\n \n \n1 of Mr. Thomas’ secretions for signs of infection; monitoring the sound of Mr. \n2 Thomas’ lungs to assess for a respiratory infection or blockage; monitoring and \n3 performing deep tracheal suctioning; monitoring the color, consistency, odor, and \n4 frequency of Mr. Thomas’ urine and bowels for signs and symptoms of infections; \n5 administering and checking all equipment to ensure proper functioning and replace \n6 equipment or intervene as needed; monitoring feeding tolerance and knowing when \n7 Mr. Thomas’ G-tube feeding should be stopped when he presents signs of \n8 abdominal pain and discomfort; monitoring, caring for, and replacing his trach \n9 stoma when necessary; taking and interpreting vital signs and knowing when they \n10 indicate a possible infection or when CPR is required; monitoring Mr. Thomas’ \n11 entire system for signs of infection, change, or emergency; assessing and monitoring \n12 Mr. Thomas’ skin for signs of infection, breakdown, or ulcers; and identifying and \n13 responding to emergencies.   \n14 In-Home Nursing Authorization  \n \n15 73. Before moving home from Chapman Subacute facility on April 1, \n16 2013, Mr. Thomas was approved to receive 450 LVN hours under the NF/AH \n17 waiver at the Subacute level of care, along with 240.04 hours of IHSS, and 2 hours \n18 of RN case management.  He and his wife accepted this combination of skilled and \n19 unskilled care because Mr. Thomas unquestionably required round-the-clock \n20 coverage, and they understood that, due to the Subacute Waiver cost-cap, he would \n21 not be able to receive the 24-hour nursing he needed. \n \n22 74. On October 16, 2013, DHCS conducted a home visit to reassess Mr. \n23 Thomas’ level of care.  Based on the assessment, DHCS determined that Mr. \n24 Thomas remained eligible for the NF/AH waiver at the Subacute level of care.  \n25 However, DHCS determined that the expenditures for the services he was receiving \n26 exceeded the NF/AH waiver cost-cap at the Subacute level of care, which is \n27 $180,219.00.   \n28\n19 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 21 of 40   Page ID #:746\n \n \n \n1 75. Even though Mr. Thomas’ needs had increased due to the progression \n2 of his disease since his move home in 2013, DHCS issued a Notice of Action \n3 (“NOA”) on January 9, 2014 reducing his in-home LVN nursing authorization to \n4 430 hours per month.  The NOA provided that the decrease in services was solely \n5 due to the cost-cap under the NF/AH waiver, not a change or improvement in Mr. \n6 Thomas’ condition.   \n \n7 76. On February 10, 2014, Mrs. Thomas, on behalf of her husband, timely \n8 appealed DHCS’ 20-hour per month nursing reduction by mail and requested aid-\n9 paid-pending.  At Plaintiffs' request, DHCS reassessed Mr. Thomas in August 2014 \n10 but refused to authorize increased nursing hours for him.   \n \n11 77. On September 23, 2014, a Medi-Cal fair hearing was held, where Mr. \n12 Thomas presented his medical need for 24 hour nursing care, consistent with his \n13 doctor’s July 2014 orders.  On February 4, 2015, the Administrative Law Judge \n14 ordered DHCS to reassess Mr. Thomas’ level of care in order to determine whether \n15 his health condition qualified him for the Acute Hospital level of care.  DHCS has \n16 not yet performed a reassessment of Mr. Thomas and thus Mr. Thomas has not \n17 experienced a reduction or increase in his nursing care.   \n \n18 78. Because DHCS has the ability to “alternate”, or overturn, the decision, \n19 or reassess him at a lower level of care at any time, even a favorable decision does \n20 not provide Mr. Thomas with permanent or adequate relief. \n21 SEAN BENISON  \n \n22 79. Mr. Benison was diagnosed with progressive hereditary Becker \n23 Muscular Dystrophy when he was nine years old.  Mr. Benison started using a \n24 manual wheelchair when he was 13 years old and a power wheel chair at age 21.  \n25 Mr. Benison is quadriplegic.  In addition to Muscular Dystrophy, Mr. Benison has \n26 chronic respiratory failure, chronic pain disorder, anxiety disorder, DVT \n27 (thromboembolism) prophylaxis and reflux esophagitis.  Mr. Benison takes 19 \n28 different medications.    \n20 \nThomas v.

Mr. Benison is working towards a Ph.D. in Geography at the University \n2 of California, Santa Barbara (“UCSB”).  He has a B.A. from California State \n3 University Northridge.  He has a Master’s degree in Geography from UCSB. \n \n4 81. Mr. Benison lives in an apartment in Ventura, California with a live-in \n5 IHSS personal care worker.  Mr. Benison’s father, Edward Benison, does not \n6 provide any daily care but is involved in planning for and providing his care.   \n \n7 82. Mr. Benison and his family desire that he continue living at home with \n8 appropriate nursing services.    \n \n9 83. Mr. Benison’s nursing care has been funded entirely by Medi-Cal. \n \n10 84. While a student at UCSB, Mr. Benison was living in campus housing \n11 and had an IHSS care worker assisting with his needs.  Mr. Benison also had close \n12 friends who helped with his care needs, which enabled Mr. Benison to enroll in and \n13 pursue graduate studies.  \n \n14 85. In November 2011, while a student at UCSB, Mr. Benison’s health \n15 took a turn for the worse.  Mr. Benison had a severe attack of pneumonia and was \n16 hospitalized at the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.  He remained in \n17 the Subacute unit of the acute care hospital for two years before he moved out to his \n18 current apartment.  While in the hospital, Mr. Benison could no longer breathe on \n19 his own.  Mr. Benison had to undergo a tracheostomy due to the pneumonia and \n20 neuromuscular and lung weakness caused by the Muscular Dystrophy.  Mr. Benison \n21 is now dependent on a ventilator 24 hours a day.   \n \n22 86. Mr. Benison is medically fragile and technology dependent.  Until a \n23 few months ago, he had a G-tube for feeding and medication.  Mr. Benison cannot \n24 walk, cannot move himself or even turn over in bed.  Mr. Benison is non-\n25 ambulatory and cannot bear weight.  He uses a wheelchair for mobility.  He cannot \n26 feed himself and has limited use of his hands.  He requires assistance with all \n27 activities of daily living.   \n28\n21 \nThomas v.

Mr. Benison has been on the NF/AH Waiver since October 2013 when \n2 he moved out of the Subacute facility and into his own apartment in the community.  \n3 At that time, DHCS authorized 416 hours per month of Medi-Cal funded one-to-one \n4 in-home, private duty nursing care through the NF/AH Waiver, based on its \n5 determination that Mr. Benison met the Subacute level of care.  In order to remain \n6 within the cost-cap limitation at the Subacute level of care, he is authorized for 16 \n7 hours nursing coverage daily from Monday through Friday, and 8 hours of nursing \n8 coverage each on Saturdays and Sundays.  Mr. Benison requires 24-hour care, and \n9 because he lives alone, Mr. Benison supplements his nursing care with 283 hours of \n10 unlicensed IHSS personal care aide hours per month.  However, on weekends he \n11 does not have any nursing coverage for 16 hours each day, which leaves him at risk.  \n12 Hence, a minimum of 8 hours more of private duty nursing each on Saturday and \n13 Sunday is necessary to keep Mr. Benison safely in his home. \n14 Mr. Benison’s Nursing Care Needs   \n \n15 88. As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n16 Benison has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n17 addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include:  monitoring Mr. Benison’s vital signs \n18 to ensure they remain within parameters listed in the physician’s orders, and \n19 instructing caregivers in proper vital sign monitoring; monitoring cardiac status and \n20 assessing for signs and symptoms of tachycardia (resting heart rate faster than \n21 normal); assessing Mr. Benison for signs and symptoms of pain; assessing for signs \n22 and symptoms of skin breakdown, rash and perfusion; instructing caregivers in \n23 measures to protect skin integrity; assessing for medication compliance, \n24 effectiveness and complications and instructing caregivers in medication dosages, \n25 schedules, effects and side effects, and any food and drug interactions; assessing  \n26 Mr. Benison’s level of consciousness, motor and sensory reflexes, and for \n27 progression of his muscular dystrophy; ensuring adequate respiratory function \n28 through trach care including mobilization of lung secretions; monitoring and \n22 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 24 of 40   Page ID #:749\n \n \n1 providing ventilator support and responding to signs and symptoms of respiratory \n2 distress; checking ventilator settings as per the physician orders; assessing Mr. \n3 Benison’s lung fields for clear, crackles, wheezing or the absence of these in his \n4 breathing patterns; monitoring Mr. Benison’s trach stoma for signs and symptoms of \n5 infection; monitoring Mr. Benison’s abdomen for signs and symptoms of abdomen \n6 distention and constipation; monitoring Mr. Benison for signs and symptoms of \n7 urinary tract infections; and reporting significant findings and changes in Mr. \n8 Benison’s condition as appropriate.  \n9 In-Home Nursing Authorization; Case Management and Habilitation Services  \n \n10 89. Currently, the cost to the Medi-Cal program for Mr. Benison’s home \n11 care, including 416 hours per month of private duty nursing, 283 hours of \n12 unlicensed IHSS aides and his medical equipment and supplies, was approximately \n13 $180,219.00 per year.  This is his maximum budget for NF/AH Waiver services \n14 because of the cost-cap imposed by DHCS. \n \n15 90. Since January 2014, Mr. Benison’s physician has ordered one-to-one \n16 private duty nursing care for him so that he can receive the 24-hour care that he \n17 needs to remain safely at home.  Mr. Benison requested 24-hour nursing from \n18 Defendants in February 2014.  Defendants deferred his request for 24-hour nursing \n19 and have not provided him with a written notice of action as to their decision.   \n20 However, because Mr. Benison lives on his own, he relies on an unlicensed live-in \n21 IHSS aide as a backup care provider.  In addition to the NF/AH Waiver cost-cap \n22 which would prevent Mr. Benison from receiving authorization for 24-hour nursing,  \n23 DHCS will also not authorize direct care services, or any combination of direct care \n24 services, exceeding 24 hours of care per day under the NF/AH Waiver.  NF/AH \n25 Waiver at 196.  Therefore, Plaintiff Benison needs 24 hours of nursing care per day, \n26 but he also cannot give up his live-in backup caregiver.  Thus, given the limitations \n27 of the existing NF/AH Waiver rules, he is requesting additional hours per month of \n28 nursing care to ensure that he can receive round-the-clock care.     \n23 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 25 of 40   Page ID #:750\n \n \n \n1 91. Additionally, Mr. Benison needs Case Management Services and \n2 Habilitation services to help him organize his nurses and IHSS workers’ schedules, \n3 enroll back in graduate studies, enable him to avail of social activities and \n4 community services, and gain an overall better quality of life.  These services are \n5 available through the NF/AH Waiver, but are not available to Mr. Benison because \n6 of the Subacute Waiver cost-cap.   \n7 JUAN PALOMARES  \n \n8 92. Juan Palomares had a complete C-4 spinal cord injury in 2005 at age 28 \n9 due to a motor vehicle accident in which he was a passenger.  As a result of the \n10 injury, he has quadriplegia and uses a power wheelchair.  He is in constant pain, \n11 uses a suprapubic catheter, and is prone to autonomic dysreflexia episodes which is \n12 imbalanced reflex sympathetic discharge and leads to potentially life-threatening \n13 hypertension.  Mr. Palomares experiences autonomic dysreflexia episodes \n14 approximately 5-6 times per week.  \n \n15 93. Mr. Palomares lives at home with his father, Manuel Palomares, who is \n16 also his primary caregiver. \n \n17 94. Mr. Palomares’ home care is provided through In-Home Supportive \n18 Services and Waiver Personal Care Services.  Mr. Palomares’ in-home services are \n19 funded entirely by Medi-Cal. \n \n20 95. Mr. Palomares and his father desire that he continue living at home \n21 with appropriate in-home services.   \n \n22 96. Prior to Mr. Palomares’ accident, Mr. Palomares had recently obtained \n23 his certification as a laboratory technician.  His injury occurred when he was \n24 returning from a family funeral in San Diego to interview for a job as a lab \n25 technician.   \n \n26 97. Following Mr. Palomares’ accident, he received care at the University \n27 of California San Diego hospital, where he was placed on a ventilator and had a \n28 tracheostomy.  After approximately two months, he was taken off the ventilator, his \n24 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 26 of 40   Page ID #:751\n \n \n1 tracheostomy was closed, and he was transferred to the Rancho Los Amigos \n2 Rehabilitation Center in Los Angeles for acute rehabilitation.   \n \n3 98. After his discharge from Rancho Los Amigos, Mr. Palomares moved in \n4 with his sister for approximately two and a half months, where he received support \n5 only from In-Home Supportive Services.  He then moved to the Palomares \n6 Rehabilitation and Nursing Center3 in Pomona.   \n \n7 99. At the Pomona nursing facility, Mr. Palomares was admitted into the \n8 Subacute unit but was soon discharged to the Nursing Facility unit.  During that \n9 time, he was experiencing episodes of autonomic dysreflexia 9-10 times per week.  \n10 While at the Nursing Facility unit, Mr. Palomares also experienced recurring urinary \n11 tract infections, requiring intravenous (“IV”) antibiotics.  However, due to the high \n12 ratio of patients to nurses, the nurses were not able to quickly attend to his needs, \n13 and he had no method or alarm to alert them when he was having an emergency.  As \n14 a result, Mr. Palomares was consistently in fear for his life while at the facility.  Mr. \n15 Palomares stayed at the nursing facility for approximately one year. \n \n16 100. In 2006, because of the difficulty the Pomona nursing facility had in \n17 meeting Mr. Palomares’ intensive care needs, Mr. Palomares’ father moved into an \n18 apartment that had room for Juan Palomares.  Although Mr. Palomares’ father had \n19 been in training to become a licensed contractor, he abandoned this career path in \n20 order to care for his son Juan around-the-clock.  Plaintiff Palomares was not offered \n21 NF/AH Waiver services when he first came home.  He applied for and began to \n22 receive NF/AH Waiver services in 2007.  \n \n23 101. Since moving home in 2006, Mr. Palomares has been hospitalized \n24 several times.  In 2014, he went to the emergency room approximately 9-10 times \n25 when he was experiencing side effects from his pain medications or autonomic \n26\n27\n                                                 \n28 3 Although the nursing facility’s name was the same as Mr. Palomares’ last name, there is no \nrelationship.  The nursing facility is now called the Inland Valley Care Rehabilitation Center. \n25 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 27 of 40   Page ID #:752\n \n \n1 dysreflexia episodes.  Mr. Palomares is regularly seen by a primary care physician, \n2 urologist, a podiatrist and a pulmonologist. \n3 Mr. Palomares’ In-Home Care Needs \n \n4 102. As a result of his C-4 spinal cord injury, Mr. Palomares is quadriplegic, \n5 incontinent of bowel and bladder, unable to feed himself, and dependent for all of \n6 his Activities of Daily Living.  He uses a power wheelchair for ambulation, which \n7 he operates by his chin and head and which has a recline feature that he uses every \n8 hour.  He requires assistance to administer his medications.  He also requires \n9 frequent repositioning due to his physical limitations, in order to assist with \n10 circulation and to prevent skin ulcers.  Because of his health conditions and severe \n11 pain, Mr. Palomares takes numerous medications, including narcotics administered \n12 as needed due to his constant pain in his neck and shoulder.   \n \n13 103. The spinal cord injury has resulted in impairment of Mr. Palomares’ \n14 sympathetic nervous system (autonomic dysreflexia), which has caused problems \n15 modulating body temperature and therefore hypothermia and hyperthermia episodes.   \n \n16 104. Mr. Palomares currently experiences about five to six autonomic \n17 dysreflexia episodes a week.  A majority of the episodes happen at night or in the \n18 early morning hours.  Such episodes may be triggered by, e.g., a need for \n19 repositioning, excessive heat or cold, having something tight on his body (e.g., shoe \n20 laces, a shirt), the position of his catheter tube, urinary or bowel obstruction, and \n21 inflammation of the stomach.  He is at constant risk of having an autonomic \n22 dysreflexia episode.  During an episode, his heart rate and blood pressure elevate to \n23 dangerous levels.   If not treated immediately, by removing the triggering stimuli \n24 and (when necessary) administering anti-hypertensive medication, autonomic \n25 dysreflexia can lead to death.    \n \n26 105. Mr. Palomares undergoes treatments through an oscillating vest twice a \n27 day to keep fluids and mucus from pooling in his lungs including mobilization of \n28\n26 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 28 of 40   Page ID #:753\n \n \n1 mucus.  This treatment helps to prevent lung infections such as pneumonia and \n2 prevent the need for a ventilator.  \n \n3 106. Mr. Palomares has a system in place where he can voice activate 911 so \n4 he can be brought to an emergency room.  He had approximately ten such \n5 emergency room visits last year, many because of difficult-to-control autonomic \n6 dysreflexia episodes. \n \n7 107. Mr. Palomares sleeps on a special mattress with air chambers that \n8 fluctuate to reduce the risk of decubiti ulcers.  His father wakes up every two hours \n9 at night to reposition him.  During the evening when he is in his wheelchair which \n10 he operates with his chin and head, he reclines with his legs brought up at least once \n11 an hour to prevent pressure sores and autonomic dysreflexia episodes.   \n \n12 108. Mr. Palomares needs to be repositioned and cared for more frequently \n13 than he is currently, in order to reduce the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia \n14 episodes and prevent decubitus ulcers, but that is not possible without an increase in \n15 his NF/AH Waiver budget. \n \n16 109. This past year Mr. Palomares was switched from a Foley catheter to a \n17 suprapubic catheter (which is inserted directly into his bladder) in order to reduce \n18 the incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and the incidence of autonomic \n19 dysreflexia episodes related to Foley catheter erosion and UTIs.  However, he has \n20 had chronic problems with the suprapubic catheter because the tubing clogs, \n21 triggering his autonomic dysreflexia episodes.  In addition, the suprapubic catheter \n22 must be changed monthly, by a trained provider with experience in order to avoid \n23 obstructing.   \n24 In-Home Services Authorization; IHSS and Waiver Personal Care Services \n \n25 110. As of January 1, 2015, the cost to the Medi-Cal program for Mr. \n26 Palomares’ home care, including In-Home Supportive Services and Waiver Personal \n27 Care Services per month, and his medical equipment and supplies, was \n28\n27 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 29 of 40   Page ID #:754\n \n \n1 approximately $48,180 per year.  This is his maximum budget for NF/AH Waiver \n2 services because of the cost-cap imposed by DHCS.   \n \n3 111. Mr. Palomares receives daytime care from a paid attendant six days per \n4 week. His father provides all of his nighttime care, seven nights per week, and all \n5 day on Sundays. \n \n6 112. Between 2007 and present, Mr. Palomares’ medically necessary \n7 NF/AH Waiver in-home care services have been reduced at least twice, including \n8 once in 2013.  This reduction was not because Mr. Palomares’ care needs decreased.  \n9 The Nursing Facility-B level of care cost-cap has remained at $48,180.00, but the \n10 hourly rate for attendant care services in his county has increased twice.  Therefore, \n11 to maintain cost neutrality, DHCS reduced the number of in-home care service \n12 hours authorized under the Waiver.  Mr. Palomares no longer receives any nursing \n13 services because of the last reduction in his Waiver budget, which forced him to \n14 accept only unlicensed attendant care in order to have as many hours of coverage \n15 each day that his Waiver budget would allow. \n \n16 113. To address one of the reductions in NF/AH Waiver services, Mr. \n17 Palomares appealed DHCS’ reduction of his Waiver Personal Care Services from \n18 207 hours to 143 hours, which was effective March 22, 2013.  The final \n19 administrative decision issued by DHCS concluded that DHCS correctly determined \n20 that Mr. Palomares’ skilled care needs are consistent with the HCBS NF/AH Waiver \n21 Nursing Facility-B level of care and that the reduction of hours was proper in order \n22 to adhere to the annual Nursing Facility-B cost-cap of $48,180. \n \n23 114. However, Mr. Palomares needs additional in-home care services in \n24 order to meet his round-the-clock needs, which include nursing care and nursing \n25 case management, and to enable him to hire additional care providers.  Mr. \n26 Palomares needs a care provider to monitor him throughout the night and reposition \n27 him more frequently in order to reduce his recurrent episodes of autonomic \n28 dysreflexia.  Additional attendant care would also enable him to bathe more \n28 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 30 of 40   Page ID #:755\n \n \n1 frequently, as this is a task that is very taxing to do as frequently as needed, given \n2 Mr. Palomares height of 6 feet and weight of 180 pounds.   \n \n3 115. With more attendant care hours, his father could have some additional \n4 relief, as he is providing paid and unpaid care and has difficulty managing both day \n5 and night care with the limited hours of in-home care covered under the Waiver.   \n \n6 116. In addition, Plaintiff Palomares requires reinstatement of case \n7 management by a Registered Nurse to supervise and assess his care.  Mr. Palomares \n8 also requires a Licensed Vocational Nurse with experience in urology to change his \n9 suprapubic catheter, flush his port, and assess and monitor any changes to his \n10 condition, among other things.   \n \n11 117. In-home care services, including IHSS, skilled nursing, and Waiver \n12 Personal Care Services are available through the NF/AH Waiver, but are not \n13 available to Mr. Palomares because of the Nursing Facility-B Waiver cost-cap. \n14 DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS PLACE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES \n15 LIKE PLAINTIFFS AT RISK OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND \n16 VIOLATE THE LAW \n \n17 118. Defendants have placed arbitrary cost-caps on home and community-\n18 based services provided under the NF/AH Waiver, which are far less than the actual \n19 rates for institutional facilities.   \n \n20 119. Defendants have great flexibility and discretion in their administration \n21 of the NF/AH waiver.  They have the authority to make modifications to ensure that \n22 Medi-Cal recipients such as individual Plaintiffs receive sufficient and medically \n23 necessary NF/AH Waiver services to avoid institutional placement and receive the \n24 necessary services as their medical conditions require.  \n \n25 120. According to Plaintiffs Thomas, Benison, and Palomares’ medical \n26 professionals, home is the safest place for them to maximize their health condition \n27 and prolong their lives.  Placement in an institution, however, will almost certainly \n28 cause health deterioration and possible death within a short period of time.  \n29 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 31 of 40   Page ID #:756\n \n \n \n1 121. Defendants are refusing to provide additional NF/AH Waiver services \n2 for individual Plaintiffs solely due to the fact that DHCS has imposed cost-caps on \n3 NF/AH Waiver services, which are lower than the equivalent institutional rates, and \n4 which are without medical justification, nor are they required by federal law.   \n \n5 122. Defendants’ administration and imposition of the NF/AH Waiver cost-\n6 caps directly injures organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT. As a result of Defendants’ \n7 illegal administration of the NF/AH waiver, IN SPIRIT’s mission to enable clients \n8 to live safely at home is frustrated and its limited resources are diverted from other \n9 clients in order to serve NF/AH Waiver recipients whose at-home care needs would \n10 be met, but for the NF/AH Waiver cost-caps. \n \n11 123. Without the appropriate level of NF/AH Waiver services to remain in \n12 their homes, qualified individuals with disabilities such as Plaintiffs will have no \n13 choice but institutional placement, which will separate them from their families and \n14 communities and also poses significant risks to their health.   \n15 VII.

Organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT represents the interests of \n2 individual Plaintiffs in that it provides assistance to individuals with disabilities to \n3 enable them to live in their own homes.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is thwarted by \n4 Defendant’s actions, which hinder its ability to provide assistance and divert its \n5 resources from serving clients who would otherwise be served by the organization. \n \n6 128. Defendant Jennifer Kent is the Director of Defendant DHCS, which has \n7 responsibility for providing Medi-Cal and state-funded home and community-based \n8 and institutional services, and is therefore a government entity subject to Title II of \n9 the ADA.  42 USC §§ 12131(1)(A) and (B) (1990). \n \n10 129. Defendant is obligated under the ADA to administer its programs in a \n11 manner that enables qualified individuals with disabilities to live in the most \n12 integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  Defendant’s denial and reduction of \n13 adequate and medically necessary in-home services, and failure to provide qualified \n14 individuals with disabilities such as Plaintiffs with medically necessary NF/AH \n15 Waiver services, has denied them the services they need to remain safely in the \n16 community, thereby placing them at risk of institutionalization in violation of the \n17 ADA’s integration mandate. \n \n18 130. Defendant has discriminated against qualified individuals with \n19 disabilities such as Plaintiffs in ways that include arbitrarily setting cost-caps for the \n20 NF/AH Waiver far below the actual rate paid for institutional services in equivalent \n21 facilities, thus denying  them funds for home and community-based services that \n22 would otherwise be available for institutional services. \n \n23 131. Defendant has discriminated against qualified individuals with \n24 disabilities such as Plaintiffs by failing to provide reasonable modifications to \n25 programs and services in ways that include: failing to increase or eliminate the \n26 individual NF/AH Waiver cost-caps within federal cost neutrality limitations to \n27 enable them to receive adequate and medically necessary NF/AH Waiver services; \n28 and failing to create and implement  an exception  process for the NF/AH Waiver \n31 \nThomas v.

By denying Plaintiffs and other qualified individuals with disabilities \n4 adequate and necessary NF/AH Waiver services commensurate with their actual \n5 need, as opposed to arbitrary service limitations, Defendant has imposed eligibility \n6 requirements which unlawfully screen Plaintiffs out from fully and equally enjoying \n7 NF/AH Waiver services, and from receiving adequate care to remain safely at home. \n \n8 133. Defendant has utilized criteria and methods of administration that \n9 subject Plaintiffs and other qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination \n10 on the basis of disability, including risk of unnecessary institutionalization, in ways \n11 that include:  (1) designing and implementing Home and Community-Based \n12 Services Waivers which set arbitrarily low cost-caps for NF/AH Waiver services, \n13 while paying significantly higher rates for the institutional alternative; and \n14 (2) imposing eligibility criteria, cost limitations and other criteria not required by \n15 federal limitations, which restrict in-home care in favor of institutional care.  \n \n16 134. Defendant’s actions are in violation of Title II of the ADA. \n \n17 135. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (1990), Plaintiffs are entitled to \n18 declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs \n19 incurred in bringing this action. \n20 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21 (Defendant DHCS) \n22 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n \n23 136.

Defendant’s denial and reduction of adequate and necessary in-home \n16 nursing and refusal to provide NF/AH Waiver services has barred individual \n17 Plaintiffs from receiving the services they need to continue to live in the community, \n18 thereby placing them at imminent risk of institutionalization in violation of Section \n19 504’s integration mandate. \n \n20 142.

Defendant has utilized criteria and methods of administration that \n4 subject qualified individuals with disabilities such as Plaintiffs to discrimination on \n5 the basis of disability, including risk of unnecessary institutionalization, by, \n6 including but not limited to the following:  (1) designing and implementing Home \n7 and Community-Based Services Waivers which set arbitrarily low cost-caps for \n8 NF/AH Waiver services, while paying significantly higher rates for the institutional \n9 alternative; and (2) imposing eligibility criteria, cost limitations and other criteria \n10 not required by federal limitations, which restrict in-home care in favor of \n11 institutional care.  \n \n12 145. Defendant’s actions violate Section 504.  \n13 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n14 (Defendants DHCS and Director Kent) \n15 Violation of Government Code Sections 11135 and 11139 \n \n16 146. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every \n17 allegation and paragraph set forth previously.   \n \n18 147. Individual Plaintiffs are persons with disabilities within the meaning of \n19 California Government Code section 11135(c) et seq. (2011) and its implementing \n20 regulations. \n \n21 148. Individual Plaintiffs meet the essential eligibility requirements for \n22 Medi-Cal services, including services necessary to maintain them in their homes in \n23 the community.  \n \n24 149. Organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT represents the interests of \n25 individual Plaintiffs in that it provides assistance to individuals with disabilities to \n26 enable them to live in their own homes.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is thwarted by \n27 Defendants’ actions, which hinder its ability to provide assistance and divert its \n28 resources from serving clients who would otherwise be served by the organization. \n34 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 36 of 40   Page ID #:761\n \n \n \n1 150. Defendants DHCS and Director Kent conduct, operate or administer \n2 the state Medicaid program, entitled Medi-Cal, which is directly funded, in part, by \n3 state financial assistance within the meaning of California Government Code section \n4 11135(a) and implementing regulations.  \n \n5 151. Defendants are obligated to administer their programs in a manner that \n6 enables qualified individuals with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting \n7 appropriate to their needs.  Defendants’ denial and reduction of adequate and \n8 medically necessary in-home nursing, and failure to provide qualified individuals \n9 with disabilities such as Plaintiffs with medically necessary NF/AH Waiver \n10 services, has denied them the services they need to remain safely in the community, \n11 thereby placing them at risk of institutionalization in violation of the integration \n12 mandate of California Government Code section 11135. \n \n13 152. By administering its programs in ways that deny qualified individuals \n14 with disabilities such as Plaintiffs NF/AH Waiver services commensurate with their \n15 actual need, and instead imposing arbitrary cost limitations on the services they may \n16 receive, Defendants have discriminated against them , thereby excluding them from \n17 participation in, denying them the benefits of, and otherwise subjecting them to \n18 discrimination in violation of California Government Code section 11135 et seq. and \n19 implementing regulations.   \n \n20 153. Plaintiffs further allege that violations of their rights under the \n21 Americans with Disabilities Act and implementing regulations contained in the First \n22 Claim for Relief are incorporated herein and constitute a violation of California \n23 Government Code section 11135 et seq. as well, as set forth in section 11135(b). \n24 VIII.  ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY \n25 RELIEF \n \n26 154. Defendants’ actions, as alleged herein, have resulted in and will \n27 continue to result in irreparable injury to Plaintiffs and other qualified individuals \n28 with disabilities caused by the refusal to cover medically necessary services under \n35 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 37 of 40   Page ID #:762\n \n \n1 the NF/AH waiver, which they need to remain in their homes and avoid unnecessary \n2 institutional placement.  Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law. \n \n3 155.  IN SPIRIT is also subject to irreparable injury as a result of the NF/AH \n4 Waiver cost-caps, for it provides financial aid to NF/AH Waiver recipients to \n5 supplement at-home care which would otherwise be covered by the NF/AH Waiver, \n6 but for imposition of the cost-caps.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is thereby impeded, where \n7 funds are put toward assisting NF/AH Waiver recipients with home care needs, \n8 rather than funding non-Waiver recipients. \n \n9 156. An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants, in that \n10 Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have failed to provide services in the most \n11 integrated setting appropriate to meet the needs of qualified individuals with \n12 disabilities such as Plaintiffs in violation of federal and state law and Defendants \n13 deny all such contentions.  \n \n14 157. Defendant Kent can either adopt or “alternate” (reject in whole or part) \n15 any administrative decision arising out of claims against DHCS.  California Manual \n16 of Policies and Procedures, Sections 22-061 and 22-062.  Therefore, the \n17 administrative appeal process offers no remedy or protection to Plaintiffs, as the \n18 Defendants in this action are the very entity which will make a determination of \n19 what NF/AH Waiver services will be provided to Plaintiffs.  \n \n20 158. The needs of qualified individuals with disabilities such as Plaintiffs \n21 can be reasonably accommodated by Defendants in a number of ways such as: \n22 increasing the individual NF/AH Waiver cost-caps commensurate with institutional \n23 costs; replacing individual NF/AH Waiver cost-caps with an aggregate cost-cap; \n24 establishing an exception process for requesting additional services and/or \n25 preventing reductions in service; and/or modifying any of their Home and \n26 Community-Based Services Waivers to permit these individuals to receive the \n27 services that they require and that their physicians have ordered.   \n28\n36 \nThomas v. Kent; No. 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 70   Filed 07/07/15   Page 38 of 40   Page ID #:763\n \n \n \n1 159. Defendants have the option to administer the NF/AH Waiver so as not \n2 to create a bias towards institutional placement.  Instead, Defendants have chosen to \n3 administer the NF/AH Waiver in such a way as to discriminate against qualified \n4 individuals with disabilities such as Plaintiffs, and to place them at risk of \n5 institutional placement, with life threatening consequences. \n6 IX.   REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n7 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court order the following relief and \n8 remedies on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated: \n \n9 A. Assume jurisdiction over this action and maintain continuing \n10 jurisdiction until Defendants are in full compliance with every order of this Court; \n \n11 B. Declare that Defendants’ imposition of arbitrary NF/AH Waiver cost-\n12 caps, which deny qualified individuals with disabilities such as Plaintiffs sufficient \n13 NF/AH Waiver services to meet their undisputed needs, and Defendants’ policies, \n14 practices, acts and omissions as set forth above violate: \n15 i.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), (42 U.S.C. \n16 §§ 12101-12213 (2008)) and implementing regulations. \n17 ii.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), \n18 (29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a (2014)) and implementing regulations; \n19 and,  \n20 iii.  California Government Code section 11135.  (Cal. Gov’t. Code \n21 § 11135 (2011)) and implementing regulations.   \n \n22 C. Grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \n23 enjoining Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, successors, and \n24 all persons who are in active concert or participation with them from reducing \n25 medically necessary Medi-Cal funded in-home care below Mr. Thomas’ current \n26 level of 450 hours per month of licensed vocational nursing care, two hours per \n27 month of RN care and 240.04 hours per month of IHSS personal care services until \n28 such time as the matter before this Court may be finally decided. \n37 \nThomas v.

Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants, their officers, \n2 agents, employees, attorneys, successors, and all persons who are in active concert \n3 or participation with them from discriminating against qualified individuals with \n4 disabilities such as Plaintiffs including placing them at risk of unnecessary \n5 institutionalization, by: \n \n6 i. Failing to offer reasonable modifications to their programs and \n7 policies to enable them to receive medically necessary in-home \n8 nursing as ordered by their physicians; \n \n9 ii. Failing to offer reasonable modifications to their programs and \n10 policies to enable them to receive other NF/AH Waiver services \n11 like Case Management, Habilitation services, and Waiver \n12 Personal Care Services;  \n \n13 iii. Imposing eligibility requirements which unlawfully screen them  \n14 out of the NF/AH Waiver program and prevent them from fully \n15 and equally enjoying NF/AH Waiver services, and from \n16 receiving adequate care to remain safely at home; \n \n17 iv. Utilizing criteria and methods of administration that subject them \n18 to discrimination on the basis of disability, including placing \n19 them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n \n20 E.  Issue an order requiring Defendants to: \n \n21 i. Authorize Medi-Cal funded services for Plaintiffs through the \n22 Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver or other appropriate \n23 Home and Community-Based Services Waivers, subject to \n24 federal cost neutrality requirements, to enable them to receive \n25 medically necessary services commensurate with their needs; \n \n26 ii. Amend their policies and procedures consistent with the \n27 injunction above, and to require that Nursing Facility/Acute \n28 Hospital Waiver participants be provided with medically \n38 \nThomas v.

Retain jurisdiction over the Defendants until such time as the Court is \n5 satisfied that Defendants’ unlawful policies, practices, and acts complained of herein \n6 cannot recur. \n \n7 G. Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees \n8 pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 794a (2014); 42 U.S.C. §§ 12133 (1990), 12205 (1990); \n9 California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 (1993); and as otherwise may be \n10 allowed by law. \n \n11 H.

ECF No. 112 (“SOI”).  Although the \n6 State has since submitted a Waiver amendment for CMS approval, see generally Jt. \n7 Mem. Mot. Summ. J. 9:12-10:13, ECF No. 152, the legal analysis the Court must \n8 undertake is unchanged: has the State “ensure[d]” that individuals subject to a cost \n9 limitation “who require additional care to remain in the community will have the \n10 necessary alternative services identified and put in place to avoid unnecessary \n11 institutionalization[?]”  SOI at 6:15-17 (citing Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. \n12 2d 1161, 1174 (N.D. Cal. 2009)).  \n13 As the United States noted in its SOI, a State’s compliance with its Medicaid \n14 obligations and its compliance with the ADA are “independent legal obligations.”  SOI \n15 at 2, n.4 (“Federal approval of a waiver application does not address the existence of a \n16 violation of the ADA.”).  Thus, while a State may cap the services it provides through a \n17 Medicaid waiver, as California has done in the operative Waiver, it is not exempt from \n18 providing services in excess of that cap in order “to comply with the ADA or other \n19 laws.”  SOI at 5:7-15 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Statement of the Department of \n20 Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the Americans with \n21 Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C. n.4 (June 22, 2011), \n22 http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm).  Defendants’ arguments in opposition \n23 to summary judgment appear to blur that distinction, by implying that the State has \n24 complied with its ADA obligations simply by submitting to CMS a Waiver amendment \n25 which purports to remove the individual cost limitations.  See, e.g., Defs’. Suppl. Br. \n26 Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 5:5-6, ECF No. 157 (“[T]here is nothing more the Department can \n27 do at the present time to remove the individual cost limits from the current Waiver.”).  \n28\n1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 171   Filed 08/04/16   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:20033\n \n1 Defendants’ narrow focus on the steps the State can take to remove the individual cost \n2 limits from the current Waiver ignores the steps it could take to otherwise comply with \n3 the ADA, including by example using state-only dollars to fund services in excess of the \n4 currently applicable cost limits.  See, e.g., SOI at 6, n. 9 (noting that the State intended \n5 “to use state-only dollars to fund Waiver costs over individual cost limits attributable to \n6 [In-Home Supportive Services] and [Waiver Personal Care Services] overtime rather \n7 than reduce services to Waiver participants.”) (second alteration in original).  Moreover, \n8 Defendants’ narrow focus on the steps the state can take to remove the individual cost \n9 limits from the current Waiver ignores the legal reality that federal approval of the \n10 proposed amendment will not necessarily bring the State into compliance with the ADA.  \n11 SOI at 2, n.4.  Absent establishing a fundamental alteration defense, see SOI at 4, n.7, \n12 with or without an amended Waiver the State must operate its service system in a \n13 manner which ensures that, on an individual level, “services will be identified and in \n14 place for Plaintiffs” to avoid needless institutionalization.  SOI at 5:16-6:4 (citing \n15 Brantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1174 and V.L. v. Wagner, 669 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1122 (N.D. \n16 Cal. 2009)).   \n17 The United States encourages the Court to assess Plaintiffs’ motion in light of the \n18 principles set forth in its SOI, as supplemented above. \n   \n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 171   Filed 08/04/16   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:20034\n \n \n1 Dated: August 4, 2016      Respectfully submitted,  \n             \n2\nEILEEN M.

(See Dkt. 4, Complaint). \n26 Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on January 29, 2015, (see Dkt. 26, “FAC”), and the\n27 operative Second Amended Complaint on July 7, 2015.  (See Dkt. 70, “SAC”).  In the SAC,\n28 plaintiffs assert three claims against DHCS and the current DHCS Director, Jennifer Kent\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 2 of 11   Page ID\n #:32374\n1 (collectively, “defendants”) for violations of: (1) the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42\n2 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq.; (2) the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq.; and (3) California\n3 Government Code §§ 11135 & 11139.  (See id. at ¶¶ 124-153).\n4 BACKGROUND\n5 Plaintiffs are California residents who “all have significant physical disabilities and were\n6 institutionalized but now live in their own homes with Medicaid-funded nursing and attendant\n7 care[.]”  (See Dkt. 194, Parties’ Joint Memorandum of Points and Authorities Re: Plaintiffs’ Motion\n8 for Summary Judgment [] (“Joint Br.”) at 1).  “Medicaid, called Medi-Cal in California, is a joint\n9 federal and state medical assistance program for eligible low-income people.”  (Id. at 4).  Plaintiffs\n10 receive home care pursuant to the Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Home and Community-Based\n11 Services Waiver program (“NF/AH Waiver” or “Waiver”), which “is intended to provide in-home\n12 services for Medicaid recipients with disabilities who qualify for placement in nursing facilities and\n13 other institutions.”  (Id. at 1).  The NF/AH Waiver program is operated by the DHCS, (see id. at 6),\n14 but its administration is overseen by a federal agency called the Centers for Medicare and\n15 Medicaid (“CMS”).  (See id. at 5).  In general, the DHCS cannot modify the Waiver program\n16 without first submitting a proposal to, and obtaining approval from, the CMS.  (See id. at 5-7).\n17 When the instant Motion was filed, the NF/AH Waiver program provided that eligible\n18 patients “may receive services . . . if they require a level of care otherwise available in an\n19 institution” such as a hospital or nursing facility.  (See Dkt. 112, Statement of Interest of the United\n20 States of America (“SOI”) at 2).  In that circumstance, the “cost of services available to” the patient\n21 is “capped according to that individual’s designated level of care.”  (Id.).  “Although the caps\n22 correspond to the type of institution in which the individual would otherwise receive services, the\n23 Waiver caps are lower than the average cost of providing care in the corresponding institution.” \n24 (Id.).  Despite the Waiver’s cost limits, defendants “have administered treatment plans for\n25 individuals on the [W]aiver with costs in excess of the applicable limit.”  (Id.).  Here, the DHCS sent\n26 letters to all three plaintiffs on December 2, 2015, stating that if the costs of plaintiffs’ medically\n27 necessary services exceed the Waiver’s current individual cost limit, the DHCS will nonetheless\n28 continue to pay for those services.  (See Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 20, 22 & 25).\n2\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 3 of 11   Page ID\n #:32375\n1 After the instant Motion was filed, the CMS approved an amendment to the Waiver\n2 program.  (See Dkt. 305, Defendants’ Ex Parte Application to: Notify the Court of New Authority\n3 [] (“Defs.’ Application”) at 4-5).  The amendment “purports to remove the individual cost limitations”\n4 from the Waiver program.  (See Dkt. 171, Supplemental Statement of Interest of the United States\n5 of America (“Supp. SOI”) at 1).  However, plaintiffs contend that  the  amendment “simply\n6 embedded the cost limits into a different section of the Waiver document . . . and now calls them\n7 ‘cost amounts’” instead of “cost limits.”  (See Dkt. 306, Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendants’ Ex\n8 Parte Application to: Notify the Court of New Authority [] (“Pls.’ Opp. to Defs.’ Application”) at 10). \n9 Indeed, the amended Waiver program sets forth the same cost limit figures as it did before the\n10 amendment took effect.  (Compare Dkt. 305-2, Defs.’ Application, Exh. A, Application for a 1915(c)\n11 Home and Community-Based Services Waiver at ECF 31939 (amended Waiver program)\n12 with Dkt. 197-22, Declaration of Elissa Gershon [] (“Gershon Decl.”), Attachment (“Att.”) 66,\n13 Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital (NF/AH) Transition and Diversion Waiver at ECF 25149 (Waiver\n14 program before amendment)).\n15 According to plaintiffs, the amended NF/AH Waiver program will continue to encourage a\n16 “practice of imposing individual cost limits far below institutional rates[,]” (see Dkt. 306, Pls.’ Opp.\n17 to Defs.’ Application at 12), which forces participants “to utilize lower cost Waiver services (i.e.,\n18 unlicensed attendant care instead of nurses) or reduce the amount of services the participant\n19 receives.”  (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 7).  In addition, plaintiffs state that “participants with service\n20 needs in excess of the individual cost limits may also be disenrolled from the Waiver and ‘will have\n21 no other option but be admitted to nursing facilities to ensure their health and safety.’”  (Id.). \n22 Plaintiffs therefore “seek injunctive and declaratory relief . . . requiring Defendants to take steps\n23 to ensure that Plaintiffs . . . can get the services they need to remain safely at home[.]”  (Id. at 1).\n24 Further, although the DHCS “has stated that Plaintiffs can receive all medically necessary\n25 waiver services without regard to the cost limits[,]” (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 3), plaintiffs contend that\n26 the DHCS “has still refused to approve all of the services recommended by their doctors.”  (Id. at\n27 1).  In late 2015, all three plaintiffs submitted updated requests for Waiver services to the DHCS. \n28 (See id. at 26).  The requests were signed by each of plaintiffs’ treating physicians.  (See id.).  The\n3\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 4 of 11   Page ID\n #:32376\n1 DHCS responded by sending letters to each plaintiff stating that it would continue paying for all\n2 medically necessary Waiver services above the Waiver’s cost limits, but that it also would\n3 “continue to conduct utilization management to determine whether requested services [we]re\n4 medically necessary and consistent with applicable law.”  (Id.).  To date, the DHCS has not\n5 provided plaintiffs with all the services identified in their 2015 requests.  (See id. at 26-27). \n6 According to plaintiffs, “Benison remains without 46 hours per month of services to fulfill his need\n7 for 24-hour ‘direct care’ services per day.”  (Id. at 27).  Further, neither Thomas nor Palomares\n8 have received any further communication regarding the outcome of the DHCS’s review.  (See id.\n9 at 26 & 27).\n10 LEGAL STANDARD\n11 Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the granting of summary\n12 judgment “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\n13 movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  The standard for granting a motion for\n14 summary judgment is essentially the same as for granting a directed verdict.  See Anderson v.\n15 Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511 (1986).  Judgment must be entered\n16 “if, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.”  Id.\n17 The moving party has the initial burden of identifying relevant portions of the record that\n18 demonstrate the absence of a fact or facts necessary for one or more essential elements of each\n19 cause of action upon which the moving party seeks judgment.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\n20 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553 (1986).  If the moving party fails to carry its initial burden of\n21 production, “the nonmoving party has no obligation to produce anything.”  Nissan Fire & Marine\n22 Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000).\n23 If the moving party has sustained its burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to\n24 identify specific facts, drawn from materials in the file, that demonstrate that there is a dispute as\n25 to material facts on the elements that the moving party has contested.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at\n26 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 2514 (a party opposing a properly\n27 supported motion for summary judgment “must set forth specific facts showing that there is a\n28\n4\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 5 of 11   Page ID\n #:32377\n1 genuine issue for trial.”).1  A factual dispute is material only if it affects the outcome of the litigation\n2 and requires a trial to resolve the parties’ differing versions of the truth.  SEC v. Seaboard Corp.,\n3 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982).  Summary judgment must be granted for the moving party\n4 if the nonmoving party “fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\n5 essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” \n6 Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552; see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512\n7 (parties bear the same substantive burden of proof as would apply at a trial on the merits).\n8 In determining whether a triable issue of material fact exists, the evidence must be\n9 considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d\n10 1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1206, 112 S.Ct. 2995 (1992).  However,\n11 summary judgment cannot be avoided by relying solely on “conclusory allegations [in] an affidavit.” \n12 Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3188 (1990); see also Matsushita\n13 Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356 (1986) (more\n14 than a “metaphysical doubt” is required to establish a genuine issue of material fact).  “The mere\n15 existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff’s position” is insufficient to survive\n16 summary judgment; “there must be evidence on which the [fact finder] could reasonably find for\n17 the plaintiff.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.\n18 DISCUSSION\n19 Plaintiffs contend that the NF/AH Waiver program violates the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act,\n20 and California Government Code §§ 11135 & 11139 because its cost limits create a “serious risk\n21 of institutionalization[.]”  (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 32 & 43).  The ADA provides that “no qualified\n22 individual with a disability2 shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or\n23\n24      1  “In determining any motion for summary judgment or partial summary judgment, the Court\nmay assume that the material facts as claimed and adequately supported by the moving party are\n25\nadmitted to exist without controversy except to the extent that such material facts are (a) included\n26 in the “Statement of Genuine Disputes” and (b) controverted by declaration or other written\nevidence filed in opposition to the motion.”  Local Rule 56-3.\n27\n     2  The ADA defines a “qualified individual with a disability” as “an individual with a disability\n28\nwho, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of\n5\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 6 of 11   Page ID\n #:32378\n1 be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected\n2 to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  “A public entity shall make reasonable\n3 modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid\n4 discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the\n5 modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”3  28 C.F.R.\n6 § 35.130(b)(7)(i).  “Because the applicable provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are\n7 ‘co-extensive,’ [the court] discuss[es] both claims together, focusing on the ADA.”  M.R. v. Dreyfus,\n8 697 F.3d 706, 733 (9th Cir. 2012).  Similarly, California Government Code § 11135(b) affords the\n9 same level of protections as the ADA.  See Cal. Gov’t Code § 11135(b) (“With respect to\n10 discrimination on the basis of disability, [state] programs and activities . . . shall meet the\n11 protections and prohibitions contained in . . . the federal Americans with Disabilities Act[.]”).\n12 In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “historically, society has tended to isolate and\n13 segregate  individuals  with  disabilities,  and,  despite  some  improvements,  such  forms  of\n14 discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social\n15 problem.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).  “Moreover, Congress found that discrimination against\n16 individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as institutionalization, and that individuals\n17 with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional\n18 exclusion, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, and segregation[.]”\n19 Dreyfus, 697 F.3d at 733 (internal citation, quotation marks, and alteration marks omitted).\n20\n21\n22\narchitectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and\n23 services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation\nin programs or activities provided by a public entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). It is undisputed that\n24\nplaintiffs are all qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA.  (See,\ngenerally, Dkt. 194, Joint Br.).\n25\n     3  Defendants have not raised a fundamental alteration defense in opposition to plaintiffs’\n26\nMotion.  (See, generally, Dkt. 194, Joint Br.; see also Dkt. 200, Defendants’ Response to Second\n27 Supplemental Statement of Interest [of the United States of America] at 1 (“Defendants did not\nintend to raise that defense in their opposition to Plaintiffs’ third MSJ, and have not asserted it at\n28\nany other time during this case.”)).\n6\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 7 of 11   Page ID\n #:32379\n1 The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has promulgated regulations implementing the ADA,4\n2 see 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a) (providing that “the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations . . .\n3 that implement this part”), including “the so-called ‘integration mandate,’ providing that ‘a public\n4 entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate\n5 to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  Dreyfus, 697 F.3d at 733 (quoting 28 C.F.R.\n6 § 35.130(d)) (internal alteration marks omitted).  To comply with the integration mandate, the\n7 states must serve persons with disabilities in their community – rather than in institutions – when\n8 “such placement is appropriate, the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the\n9 placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the\n10 State and the needs of others with . . . disabilities.”  Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S.\n11 581, 607, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 2190 (1999).\n12 To prevail on a claim for a violation of the ADA’s integration mandate, “a plaintiff need only\n13 show that the challenged state action creates a serious risk of institutionalization.”  Dreyfus, 697\n14 F.3d at 734 (“An ADA plaintiff need not show that institutionalization is ‘inevitable’ or that she has\n15 ‘no choice’ but to submit to institutional care in order to state a violation of the integration\n16 mandate.”).  In other words, a state violates the ADA’s integration mandate when “a public entity’s\n17 failure to provide community services or its cut to such services will likely cause a decline in\n18 health, safety, or welfare that would lead to the individual’s eventual placement in an institution.” \n19 (Dkt. 112, SOI at 6-7); see, e.g., Oster v. Lightbourne, 2012 WL 691833, *16 (N.D. Cal. 2012)\n20 (granting preliminary relief where “the evidence also show[ed] that Plaintiffs [we]re likely to\n21 succeed in demonstrating that the loss of [in-home supportive services] hours [would] compromise\n22 the health and well-being of [in-home supportive services] recipients such that they [would] be at\n23 serious risk of institutionalization”).\n24 Cost limitations may violate the ADA if a state does not otherwise “‘ensure’ that individuals\n25 who require additional care to remain in the community will have the necessary alternative\n26\n27      4  The court “afford[s] DOJ’s view considerable respect.”  Dreyfus, 697 F.3d at 734 (“Because\nthe Department is the agency directed by Congress to issue regulations implementing Title II of\n28\nthe ADA, its views warrant respect.”) (internal alteration marks omitted).\n7\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 8 of 11   Page ID\n #:32380\n1 services identified and put in place to avoid unnecessary institutionalization.”  (Dkt. 112, SOI at\n2 6); see Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F.Supp.2d 1161, 1174 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (holding that\n3 challenged state-wide reductions in adult day care services could have been ADA-complaint if the\n4 state had “implement[ed] any means of ensuring that, if and when the cuts take effect, the\n5 necessary alternative services [would] be identified and in place for Plaintiffs”).  “Consistent with\n6 this settled law, . . . courts have frequently intervened when a state’s Medicaid services are\n7 insufficient to ensure that individuals would continue to receive services in the most integrated\n8 setting appropriate[.]”  (Dkt. 112, SOI at 7); see, e.g., Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Authority,\n9 335 F.3d 1175, 1178-79 & 1182 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding that plaintiffs asserted valid ADA\n10 challenge to Oklahoma waiver program’s cap on five medically necessary prescriptions for\n11 patients receiving community-based care “while continuing to provide unlimited prescriptions to\n12 patients in nursing facilities” because the state did not allow waiver patients “to receive services\n13 for which they [we]re qualified unless they agree[d] to enter a nursing home”). \n14 On the other hand, “[t]he State’s responsibility, once it provides community-based treatment\n15 to qualified persons with disabilities, is not boundless.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603, 119 S.Ct. at\n16 2188.  “[W]hen there is evidence that a State has in place a comprehensive deinstitutionalization\n17 scheme, which, in light of existing budgetary constraints and the competing demands of other\n18 services that the State provides, including the maintenance of institutional care facilities, is\n19 ‘effectively working,’ the courts will not tinker with that scheme.”  Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d\n20 1051, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2005) (internal citations omitted).  “The Supreme Court has instructed\n21 courts to . . . give states ‘leeway’ in administering services for the disabled.”  Arc of Washington\n22 State Inc. v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, 618 (9th Cir. 2005) (“Despite the integration mandate,\n23 therefore, we have held that we normally ‘will not tinker with’ comprehensive, effective state\n24 programs for providing care to the disabled.”).\n25 Here, there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the Waiver program’s cost\n26 limits create a “serious risk of institutionalization” for plaintiffs, see Dreyfus, 697 F.3d at 734, and\n27 whether the DHCS “has in place a comprehensive deinstitutionalization scheme” that is “effectively\n28 working[.]”  See Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1067-68.  It is undisputed that, for the time being, the DHCS\n8\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 9 of 11   Page ID\n #:32381\n1 “has authorized all medically necessary Waiver services to allow Plaintiffs to remain safely in their\n2 homes, even if those services exceed the individual cost limits.”  (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 35; see id.\n3 at 20, 22 & 25 (describing letters sent to plaintiffs by the DHCS stating that the DHCS will pay for\n4 medically necessary Waiver services that exceed the Waiver’s current individual cost limit)). \n5 However, the parties vigorously dispute the long-term implications of the DHCS’s ad hoc decision\n6 to suspend the Waiver’s cost limits with respect to plaintiffs.  The DHCS contends that plaintiffs\n7 “face no risk of institutionalization” because it “has authorized all three Plaintiffs to receive at least\n8 24 hours of care per day.”  (Id. at 35).  Plaintiffs respond that the DHCS’s “opaque and unwritten\n9 ad hoc exceptions policy . . . does not ensure that individuals who require additional care to remain\n10 in the community will have the necessary alternative services identified and put in place to avoid\n11 unnecessary institutionalization.”  (Id. at 32).\n12 The court is troubled by the fact that the DHCS could, at any time, rescind its letters to\n13 plaintiffs authorizing medically necessary services above the Waiver’s cost limits, and that the\n14 DHCS is essentially “refus[ing] to commit to provide Plaintiffs with ongoing services[.]”  (Dkt. 194,\n15 Joint Br. at 33).  Importantly, “Defendants have no written policy or process for authorizing\n16 exceptions to the cost ceilings.”  (Dkt. 112, SOI at 2).  These facts tend to show that plaintiffs are\n17 at risk of institutionalization as a result of the cost limits imposed by the Waiver program. \n18 However, there are material factual disputes regarding whether that risk is “serious” for purposes\n19 of the ADA’s integration mandate.  See Dreyfus, 697 F.3d at 734.  For example, defendants have\n20 offered evidence showing that plaintiffs “have been well cared for and have remained safely in\n21 their homes” at all times while receiving their currently authorized services.  (See Dkt. 194, Joint\n22 Br. at 36) (“Plaintiffs’ contention that they are fighting to remain in their homes is vehemently\n23 disputed and contradicted by the evidence.”).  Defendants have also offered evidence showing\n24 that their ad hoc decisions to except plaintiffs and other patients from the Waiver program’s cost\n25 limits  –  although  based  on  unwritten  policy  –  add  up  to  an  “effectively  working”\n26 deinstitutionalization scheme.5  (See id. at 12) (noting “the large Waiver population and the\n27\n28      5  For example, defendants assert that although the DHCS “has no written policy or written\ncriteria to approve services above the individual cost limit for beneficiaries in the currently\n9\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 322   Filed 06/05/17   Page 10 of 11   Page ID\n #:32382\n1 competing budgetary restraints”); Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1067-68 (holding that the court must\n2 consider “existing budgetary constraints and the competing demands of other services that the\n3 State provides” in determining whether a state’s deinstitutionalization scheme is “effectively\n4 working”).  Thus, while the court has serious concerns about whether the Waiver program\n5 comports with the ADA’s integration mandate, the court finds that summary judgment is not\n6 appropriate at this time.  See Barlow, 943 F.2d at 1134 (holding that, at the summary judgment\n7 stage, the court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party).\n8 Similarly, there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether plaintiffs are\n9 “without medically necessary direct care” because the DHCS has not authorized “all the services\n10 that Plaintiffs’ doctors have recommended.”  (See Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 32-33).  Specifically,\n11 defendants have presented the opinion of Dr. Rajiv Dhamija, who evaluated all three plaintiffs and\n12 concluded that their currently-authorized services are sufficient to ensure that they remain safely\n13 in their homes.  (See id. at 19, 22 & 24).  While the DHCS maintains the right to determine –\n14 through the appropriate administrative process – what services are medically necessary for Waiver\n15 program participants in the first instance, (see Dkt, 194, Joint Br. at 37); Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code\n16 § 14059.5 (defining a “medically necessary” service), it is unclear to what extent the DHCS is\n17 obligated to consider or otherwise take into account the opinions of plaintiffs’ medical providers. \n18 In light of that uncertainty and given the factual disputes regarding what services are medically\n19 necessary for plaintiffs, the court is persuaded that summary judgment is not appropriate at this\n20 time.  \n21 CONCLUSION\n22 Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n23 1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 193) is denied.\n24 2.

INTRODUCTION \n2  1.  This civil rights action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to stop \n3  Defendants Department of Health Care Services and its Director, Jennifer Kent \n4  (\"DHCS\" or \"Defendants\") from continuing their illegal practices which result in \n5  denial of  critically needed Medi-Cal funded in-home services to individuals such as \n6  Plaintiffs Jerry Thomas, Arthur Congdon and Sean Benison.  Failure to receive these \n7  services will result in severe harm and potential institutionalization of these \n8  individuals with disabilities.  Due to their fragile medical conditions, placement in \n9  an institution is likely to result in dire health consequences and even death.  \n10  Institutional care for Plaintiffs would also cost the State significantly more than it \n11  would to keep them safely in their own homes.  \n12  2.  Plaintiffs have severe disabilities and chronic medical conditions: \n13  Plaintiff Jerry Thomas is diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Post-\n14  Polio Syndrome.  Plaintiffs Arthur Congdon and Sean Benison have advanced \n15  hereditary progressive Muscular Dystrophy.  Due to their illnesses, Plaintiffs are \n16  quadriplegic and cannot breathe or move on their own.  They have tracheal tubes \n17  connected to ventilators to help them breathe.  Plaintiffs Thomas and Congdon \n18  receive nutrition and hydration via Gastrostomy feeding tubes.   \n19  3.  All three Plaintiffs live in their own homes, with round-the-clock care \n20  provided by a combination of licensed nurses, and unlicensed paid and unpaid \n21  attendants.  However, pursuant to their doctors’ orders, Plaintiffs Thomas and \n22  Congdon need 24 hour nursing care, and Plaintiff Benison needs additional nursing \n23  care, to assess and address their complex and unpredictable needs, including \n24  monitoring their ventilators and oxygen levels, preparing and administering \n25  medications, and clearing fluids from their lungs and tracheotomy tubes. \n26  4.  While this kind of intensive nursing care is often provided in a hospital \n27  or Subacute medical care facility, Plaintiffs have been able to remain in their \n28  communities and close to their families because of nursing care available to them in \n  1 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 3 of 35   Page ID #:251\n \n \n1  their homes under the Medi-Cal Home and Community-Based Services Nursing \n2  Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver (“NF/AH Waiver”), administered by Defendants.  \n3  5.  Plaintiffs have all requested additional licensed nursing care services \n4  from Defendants, so that they can continue living safely in their homes and \n5  communities.  Defendants have denied these requests.   \n6  6.  Plaintiff Benison, who lives alone, also requires Case Management and \n7  Habilitation services, which are available under the NF/AH Waiver.  However, Mr. \n8  Benison is not able to access these needed NF/AH Waiver services that would help \n9  him live more independently and successfully in his home and community.  \n10  7.  The sole reason Plaintiffs are not able to get these critically needed \n11  services is because Defendants have placed arbitrary cost limitations on services \n12  available under the NF/AH Waiver.  For individuals like Plaintiffs who have been \n13  determined to meet the Subacute level of care, Medi-Cal would pay $271,697 per \n14  year for institutional placement in a Subacute facility; however, Defendants have \n15  capped the budget for comparable in-home services funded through the NF/AH \n16  Waiver at $180,219 per year, which is at least $90,000 below the actual cost of \n17  equivalent care in a Subacute facility.  The cost of the additional nursing and other \n18  NF/AH Waiver services requested by Plaintiffs would still cost less than placement \n19  in a Subacute facility.   \n20  8.  The NF/AH Waiver cost-caps at all levels of care are significantly \n21  below the rate Medi-Cal pays to institutions at the equivalent level of care.   \n22  9.  Defendants have the discretion and the ability to modify the NF/AH \n23  Waiver to enable Plaintiffs to receive the skilled nursing care and other services they \n24  need to remain safely at home.  But, they have refused to provide these essential \n25  services on the grounds that it exceeds their arbitrary cost-cap.  \n26  10.  Defendants’ actions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n27  1990 (“ADA”), (42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2008)), Section 504 of the \n28  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”), (29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a (2014)), and \n  2 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 4 of 35   Page ID #:252\n \n \n1  California Government Code section 11135 (Cal. Gov’t. Code § 11135 (2011)). \n2  11.  Under the ADA and Section 504, a public agency such as DHCS has a \n3  duty to provide services to people with disabilities in the “most integrated setting \n4  appropriate to their needs” and to prevent unnecessary institutionalization.  The \n5  most integrated setting for the individual Plaintiffs is to continue living in their \n6  homes in the community, with adequate NF/AH Waiver services to meet their \n7  significant needs.  Placing Plaintiffs at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in \n8  order to receive the care they need violates the ADA. \n9  12.  Under the ADA, Defendants also have an obligation to use methods of \n10  administration that do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities such as \n11  Plaintiffs.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that Plaintiffs are provided with adequate \n12  NF/AH Waiver services to continue living safely in their homes, and their decision \n13  to set funding levels for services that are biased in favor of institutional care results \n14  in discrimination against Plaintiffs in the administration of the Medi-Cal program.  \n15  II.   JURISDICTION \n16  13.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of \n17  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2008) and \n18  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (2014).  \n19  14.  Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (1980) and 1343 (1979).  \n20  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized under 28 \n21  U.S.C. §§ 2201 (2010) and 2202 (1948).  At all times relevant to this action, \n22  Defendants have acted under color of state law.  \n23  15.   The Court has Supplemental Jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state claim \n24  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (1990) and California Government Code section \n25  11139  (2001).    \n26  III.   VENUE \n27  16.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to 28 \n28  U.S.C. § 1391(b) (2011), because the Defendants operate and perform their official \n  3 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 5 of 35   Page ID #:253\n \n \n1  duties therein and thus reside therein for purposes of venue, and because a \n2  substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred \n3  in the Central District of California.  Plaintiff Jerry Thomas lives and receives Medi-\n4  Cal services in Orange County, which is in the Central District of California.  \n5  Plaintiff Arthur Congdon lives and receives Medi-Cal services in Los Angeles \n6  County, which is in the Central District of California.  Plaintiff Sean Benison lives \n7  and receives Medi-Cal services in Ventura County, which is in the Central District \n8  of California.  Defendant DHCS operates the Medi-Cal program, conducts business \n9  and provides Medi-Cal services to Plaintiffs in Orange County, Los County and \n10  Ventura County, all in the Central District of California.   \n11  IV.   PARTIES \n12  Organizational Plaintiff \n13  17.  Organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT is a non-profit organization which \n14  provides financial aid to people with disabilities to help them pay for personal care \n15  attendants to enable them to live in their own homes.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is to \n16  empower individuals with disabilities to sustain their health, continue their \n17  participation in their families and communities, and avoid nursing facility \n18  placement.  IN SPIRIT has been directly injured by Defendants’ actions, which \n19  impede its ability to carry out its mission to assist people with disabilities in \n20  accessing community support services.  IN SPIRIT has provided and currently \n21  provides financial assistance to individuals on the NF/AH Waiver, in order to \n22  supplement their limited at-home care services covered by the Waiver.  Because of \n23  its commitment to provide financial support for attendant care for needy, high-level \n24  quadriplegics, IN SPIRIT will serve clients on the NF/AH Waiver in the future.  IN \n25  SPIRIT has had to divert scarce resources from other potential clients to NF/AH \n26  Waiver recipients to pay for services that, but for the cost-cap, would be funded by \n27  the NF/AH waiver. \n28  // \n  4 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 6 of 35   Page ID #:254\n \n \n1  Individual Plaintiffs \n2  18.  Each individual Plaintiff is a “qualified person with a disability” within \n3  the meaning of all applicable statutes, including 42 U.S.C. §12131(2) (1990) and 29 \n4  U.S.C. §705(20)(B) (2014).  Plaintiffs have been and continue to be Medi-Cal \n5  beneficiaries and are on the NF/AH Waiver.   \n6  19.  Plaintiff Jerry Thomas is 73 years old and has Progressive Supranuclear \n7  Palsy (“PSP”), a degenerative brain disorder that causes serious and progressive \n8  problems with gait and balance, eye movement, cognitive difficulties, and muscle \n9  weakness.  His disease is progressive and thus symptoms will worsen over time.  In \n10  addition to PSP, Mr. Thomas has Post-Polio Syndrome, quadriplegia, chronic pain \n11  syndrome, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), chronic respiratory failure, recurrent \n12  pneumonia and/or bronchitis, chronic constipation, chronic atelectasis (a complete \n13  or partial collapse of the lung), recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections \n14  (“UTIs”), and hypothyroidism, among other conditions.  After 14 years of \n15  institutional placement, Mr. Thomas now resides at home with his wife of over 30 \n16  years, Beverly Thomas, who brought him home from a Subacute facility in 2013.  \n17  She serves as his Guardian ad Litem in this litigation. \n18  20.  Plaintiff Arthur Congdon is 36 years old and has advanced hereditary \n19  progressive Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, chronic respiratory failure, congestive \n20  heart failure, cardiomyopathy, is quadriplegic and legally blind.  Mr. Congdon also \n21  suffers from insomnia, chronic back pain, gastric problems and severe contracture of \n22  his joints.  He resides at home with his mother, who is his primary caregiver. \n23  21.  Plaintiff Sean Benison is 43 years old and has advanced hereditary \n24  progressive Becker Muscular Dystrophy; is quadriplegic; and has chronic \n25  respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pain disorder, \n26  anxiety disorder, DVT (thromboembolism) prophylaxis and reflux esophagitis.  He \n27  lives on his own in his apartment, where he moved in October 2013 after living for \n28  two years in a Subacute facility. \n  5 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 7 of 35   Page ID #:255\n \n \n1  22.  All three individual Plaintiffs have a tracheal tube that is connected to \n2  a ventilator to help them breathe.  Due to Plaintiffs’ mucous secretions and their \n3  inability to swallow due to the tracheotomy and loss of muscle function, Plaintiffs \n4  must be suctioned as needed, sometimes as frequently as four to five times an hour, \n5  when saliva builds up in the mouth, nose, and throat to avoid pooling of mucous or \n6  any fluid in the lungs.  If fluid does go into the lungs, it could impair oxygen \n7  exchange, resulting in lack of oxygen and permanent damage to organs (including \n8  brain injury), pneumonia, and infection.  Plaintiffs Congdon and Benison use a \n9  cuffed tracheotomy which is uncuffed during the day and allows for the possibility \n10  of communication/speech, but also allows fluid to go into the lungs if not timely \n11  suctioned.  Plaintiff Thomas uses a cuffed trach at all times.  During the night, \n12  Plaintiffs Congdon and Benison also use a cuffed tracheotomy so they are not able \n13  to speak – which can be more dangerous since they are not able to communicate if \n14  they are in distress.  Further, air leaks out of the cuff, and a nurse is required to keep \n15  adding air to the cuff and to monitor the ventilator settings to ensure Plaintiffs are \n16  properly ventilated: too much air puts pressure on the lungs and too little air can \n17  make them unconscious.   \n18  23.  Plaintiffs are completely dependent on medical technologies for \n19  survival.  Plaintiffs Thomas and Congdon have Gastrostomy tubes (“G-tubes”) for \n20  feeding and medication administration.  Plaintiffs are dependent on wheelchairs for \n21  mobility at all times.  Plaintiffs cannot move, turn, feed, dress, bathe or take care of \n22  themselves.  They need total care for every daily activity.   \n23  24.  Plaintiffs' in-home nursing care is provided by licensed vocational \n24  nurses (“LVNs” or “nurses”).  LVNs are licensed to provide skilled nursing care in \n25  many settings including hospitals.  42 C.F.R. § 409.31 (a) (2005); 22 Cal. Code \n26  Regs. §§ 70055(a)(16), §70055(a)(16) & 70217 (a) (2013).  These one-on-one \n27  skilled nursing services have been ordered by Plaintiffs’ physicians because their \n28  care requires the exercise of judgment informed by experience and expertise in \n  6 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 8 of 35   Page ID #:256\n \n \n1  addressing the care needs of persons with severe disabilities and chronic illnesses.  \n2  The services Plaintiffs require cannot safely be provided by untrained or unskilled \n3  individuals and are medically necessary. \n4  Defendant Department of Health Care Services \n5  25.  Defendant California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) \n6  administers the California Medicaid program, called “Medi-Cal.”  DHCS is the \n7  single state agency responsible for the administration of the Medi-Cal program.   \n8  26.  Defendant Jennifer Kent is DHCS’ current Director and is sued only in \n9  her official capacity.  Director Kent is responsible for directing, organizing, and \n10  administering the Medi-Cal program, including Medi-Cal Home and Community-\n11  Based Services Waivers, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.  As \n12  such, she is responsible for DHCS’ compliance with state and federal laws \n13  governing the Medi-Cal program.   \n14  V.   STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \n15  A.  THE MEDICAID PROGRAM   \n16  27.  Medicaid is a joint federal and state medical assistance program for \n17  certain groups of low-income people, including children.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v \n18  (2014).  California has elected to participate in the Medicaid program, and so must \n19  comply with the requirements of the federal Medicaid Act and its implementing \n20  regulations.   \n21  28.  The purpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as practicable, “medical \n22  assistance on behalf of . . . aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose income and \n23  resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services” and “to \n24  help such families and individuals to attain or retain capability for independence or \n25  self-care . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1396 (2014).  \n26  29.  Participating States are reimbursed by the federal government for a \n27  portion of the cost of providing Medicaid benefits.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396b (2010).  \n28  The remaining funding for the Medi-Cal program comes from the State and from \n  7 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 9 of 35   Page ID #:257\n \n \n1  counties. \n2  30.  States participating in Medicaid must designate a “single state agency” \n3  to administer or supervise the administration of the Medicaid program.  42 U.S.C. § \n4  1396a(a)(5) (2014).  DHCS is the single state agency so designated in California. \n5  31.  The California Medi-Cal program provides an array of medical \n6  services, treatments, and therapies that are authorized based on individuals’ meeting \n7  “medical necessity” criteria.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 14059 (1969), 14059.5 (1985), \n8  14133.3 (2004); 22 Cal. Code Regs. § 51303(a) (2013). \n9  Medi-Cal Home and Community-Based Services Waivers \n10  32.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) is the federal agency \n11  that oversees the administration of the Medicaid programs offered by each state.  \n12  CMS has the authority to waive certain provisions of federal Medicaid law to allow \n13  states to provide home and community-based services (“HCBS”) in lieu of \n14  institutional care, for targeted groups of individuals who otherwise would require \n15  care in a medical facility.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1) (2010).    \n16  33.  DHCS has been mandated by the Legislature to “seek all necessary \n17  waivers . . . in order to provide in-home and community-based care.”  Welf. & Inst. \n18  Code §§ 14132(t) (2014), 14137 (1986).   DHCS routinely seeks and secures federal \n19  approval to renew and amend HCBS Waivers within permissible federal limitations.  \n20  34.  HCBS Waivers in California include the Nursing Facility/Acute \n21  Hospital (“NF/AH”) Waiver.  The purpose of the NF/AH Waiver is to provide \n22  Medi-Cal beneficiaries with long-term medical conditions who meet one of the \n23  designated \"levels of care\" described below, the option of returning to and/or \n24  remaining in their  homes or home-like community settings in lieu of \n25  institutionalization.  State of California Dep’t of Health Care Servs., Application for \n26  § 1915(c) HCBS Waiver Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital (NF/AH) Waiver, \n27  (12/1/2012-12/31/2016) \n28  http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ltc/Documents/NFAH%20Transition%20and%20D\n  8 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 10 of 35   Page ID #:258\n \n \n1  iversion%20Waiver%2012-1-2012.pdf (\"NF/AH Waiver\") at 7-8.    \n2  35.  In seeking federal approval for the NF/AH Waiver, DHCS gave \n3  assurances to CMS, including that: (a) Necessary safeguards have been taken to \n4  protect the health and welfare of participants receiving services under the NF/AH \n5  Waiver; and, (b) Plans of Care are responsive to NF/AH Waiver participants’ needs.  \n6  NF/AH Waiver at 9-10. \n7  36.  Under the umbrella of the NF/AH HCBS Waiver, DHCS administers \n8  several HCBS waivers which each correspond to an institutional level of care.  The \n9  relevant levels of care are: Nursing Facility Level A or B (“NF-A/B”), Nursing \n10  Facility Subacute (“Subacute”), and Acute Hospital.  Each of the three HCBS \n11  Waivers contained in the NF/AH Waiver offers an array of home and community-\n12  based services, discussed below.  \n13  37.   The level of care criteria for the NF/AH Home and Community-Based \n14  Services Waivers explicitly describe the type and level (or severity) of functional \n15  limitations and/or skilled nursing needs an individual must have to be admitted to an \n16  institutional setting.  Upon meeting those eligibility criteria, or level of care, an \n17  individual may qualify for corresponding NF/AH HCBS Waiver services.  \n18  38.  California offers various services under the NH/AH Waiver, including \n19  Private Duty Nursing, Case Management and Habilitation services, that Plaintiffs \n20  are seeking.  NF/AH Waiver at 59.   \n21  39.  “Private duty nursing” services means individual and continuous care \n22  (in contrast to part-time or intermittent care) provided by a licensed nurse or a \n23  certified home health aide employed by a home health agency within the scope of \n24  state law.  Private duty nursing services are provided in a recipient’s home, home-\n25  like environment or an approved out-of-home setting.  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(9) \n26  (2012); 42 C.F.R. § 440.80 (1987); NF/AH Waiver at 196.    \n27  40.  “Case Management” services are designed to assess the participant and \n28  determine the need for medical, psycho-social, social and other services and to assist \n  9 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Case Managers also assist in securing personal care \n4  providers, work with the participant and his/her physician in developing goals and \n5  identifying a course of action to respond to the assessed needs of the individual, as \n6  well as oversee the implementation of the services described in the Plan of \n7  Treatment.  Case Management responsibilities include assessing, care planning, \n8  locating, coordinating, and monitoring services for community-based participants on \n9  the waiver.  Case Management may be provided by an array of provider types.  \n10  NF/AH Waiver at 59-72.   \n11  41.  “Habilitation Services” are provided in a participant’s home or an out-\n12  of-home non-facility setting and are designed to assist the participant in acquiring, \n13  retaining, and improving self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills necessary to \n14  reside successfully in the person’s natural environment.  Habilitation services \n15  include training on: the use of public transportation; personal skills development in \n16  conflict resolution; community participation; developing and maintaining \n17  interpersonal relationships; personal habits; daily living skills (cooking, cleaning, \n18  shopping, money management) and community resource awareness to support \n19  independence in the community.  It also includes assistance with: selecting and \n20  moving into a home; locating and choosing suitable housemates; locating household \n21  furnishings; settling disputes with landlords; managing personal financial affairs; \n22  recruiting, screening, hiring, training, supervising, and dismissing personal \n23  attendants; dealing with and responding appropriately to governmental agencies and \n24  personnel; asserting civil and statutory rights through self-advocacy, and building \n25  and maintaining interpersonal relationships.  NF/AH Waiver at 72-84.   \n26  42.  In order to meet federal cost-neutrality requirements, the NF/AH \n27  Waiver contains assurances that, in the aggregate for the entire NF/AH Waiver \n28  population, services provided in the community pursuant to the NF/AH Waiver will \n  10 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Defendants, however, have chosen to use an individual \n3  maximum benefit level, rather than an aggregate cost-cap.  Id. at 26-27.  Thus, the \n4  three Waivers within the NF/AH HCBS Waiver correspond to an institutional level \n5  of care and have individual “cost-caps” depending on the Medi-Cal rate for their \n6  corresponding facility.  These cost-caps allow a qualifying individual to choose \n7  from a menu of available home and community-based services but only up to the \n8  cost-cap for his or her level of care set by DHCS in the applicable HCBS Waiver.  \n9  NF/AH Waiver at 26-27.   \n10  43.  Defendants have set NF/AH Waiver cost-caps at all levels of care \n11  significantly below the annual rate Medi-Cal pays to institutions of the same level of \n12  care, as set forth below1:   \n \n13 \nInstitutional Level of Care  Annual Institutional Rate  Annual Waiver Cost-Cap \n(Based on 2007 NF/AH  (Current in 2012 NF/AH \n14 \nWaiver)  Waiver) \n15  Nursing Facility (NF)-A  $34,388  $29,548 \n \n16 \nNursing Facility (NF)-B  $56,074  $48,180 \n \n17 \nNF-B Pediatric  $110,280  $101,882 \n18   \nNF-Distinct Part  $124,342  $77,600 \n19   \nNF-Subacute, Adult  $271,697  $180,219 \n20 \n \nNF-Subacute, Pediatric  $282,574  $240,211 \n21 \n \n22  Acute Hospital  $437,757  $305,283 \n \n23 \n44.

NF/AH Waiver at 27. \n4  45.  Defendants will not authorize a level of HCBS waiver funding for \n5  home-based services which is comparable to the level of funding Medi-Cal would \n6  otherwise pay for institutional care.   However, federal cost-neutrality requirements \n7  do not prohibit Defendants from using an aggregate cost-cap, setting the Waiver \n8  cost-caps at or just below the rate paid to equivalent level of care facilities, or even \n9  exceeding the amount paid to those  facilities so long as in the aggregate, the State’s \n10  overall Medi-Cal spending remains cost-neutral. \n11  In-Home Supportive Services \n12  46.  The In-Home Supportive Services (“IHSS”) program is the State’s \n13  personal attendant care program pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 12300 et \n14  seq. (2004) and Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 14132.95 (2004), 14132.951 (2009), \n15  14132.952 (2009).  The IHSS program pays for certain services so eligible \n16  recipients can remain safely in their homes.  To be eligible, an individual must be \n17  over 65 years of age, or disabled, or blind.  IHSS services include:  housecleaning, \n18  meal preparation, laundry, grocery shopping, personal care services (such as bowel \n19  and bladder care, bathing, grooming and paramedical services), accompaniment to \n20  medical appointments, and protective supervision for the mentally impaired.  \n21  Recipients may choose their IHSS workers, who must meet minimal requirements \n22  for approval, such as a background check, but who are not required to be licensed or \n23  skilled medical practitioners. \n24  B.  ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS \n25  47.  Qualifying individuals with disabilities are protected from disability \n26  discrimination, including segregation in institutions, by the ADA and Section 504.  \n27  48.  In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “[i]ndividuals with \n28  disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, \n  12 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 14 of 35   Page ID #:262\n \n \n1  including…segregation…” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a) (5) (2008).  Title II of the ADA \n2  provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, \n3  be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs, or \n4  activities of a public entity or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.”  42 \n5  U.S.C. § 12132 (1990). \n6  49.  Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide:  “[a] public \n7  entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \n8  setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n9  § 35.130(d) (2010); see also Section 504, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a (2014); 28 C.F.R. \n10  § 41.51(d) (1982).  Further, “[t]he most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \n11  a qualified individual with a disability means a setting that enables individuals with \n12  disabilities to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 \n13  C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, (2010).  \n14  50.  The United States Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, \n15  527 U.S. 581 (1999) held that the unnecessary institutionalization of individuals \n16  with disabilities is a form of discrimination under Title II of the ADA.  In doing so, \n17  the Court interpreted the ADA’s “integration mandate” as requiring persons with \n18  disabilities to be served in the community when: (1) the state determines that \n19  community-based treatment is appropriate; (2) the individual does not oppose \n20  community placement; and (3) community placement can be reasonably \n21  accommodated.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. \n22  51.  Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA and Section 504 also \n23  provide: “A public entity may not, directly or through contractual or other \n24  arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of administration: (i) that have the \n25  effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the \n26  basis of disability; [or] (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or \n27  substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the entity’s program \n28  with respect to individuals with disabilities…” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3) (2010); 28 \n  13 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

ADA regulations further provide: “[a] public entity shall not impose or \n3  apply eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a \n4  disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally \n5  enjoying any service, program, or activity, unless such criteria can be shown to be \n6  necessary for the provision of the service, program, or activity being offered.”  28 \n7  C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8) (2010); see also parallel Section 504 regulations, 45 C.F.R. \n8  § 84.4(b)(1)(iv) (2005).   \n9  53.  As set forth in federal regulations:  “[a] public entity shall make \n10  reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the \n11  modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless \n12  the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would \n13  fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. \n14  § 35.130(b)(7) (2010).   \n15  54.  Similar to the ADA, California’s anti-discrimination statute prohibits \n16  discriminatory actions by the state and state-funded agencies or departments, and \n17  provides civil enforcement rights for violations.  Cal. Gov’t. Code §§ 11135-11139 \n18  (2011). \n19  VI.   FACTS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS  \n20  JERRY THOMAS \n21  55.  Jerry Thomas was diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy in \n22  2007 at 66 years of age.  Progressive Supranuclear Palsy is a degenerative brain \n23  disorder that involves a loss of muscle control impacting gait and balance, eye \n24  movement, and thought processes. \n25  56.  Mr. Thomas’s  in-home nursing services have been funded entirely by \n26  Medi-Cal. \n27  57.  Mr. Thomas lives at home with wife of over thirty years, Beverly \n28  Thomas.  Mr. Thomas’s wife is his primary care giver and his Guardian ad Litem.   \n  14 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 16 of 35   Page ID #:264\n \n \n1  58.  Before Mr. Thomas became ill, he worked as a road manager for his \n2  brother, singer B.J. Thomas.  When he was not spending time with his wife or \n3  working, most weekends Mr. Thomas was hunting with his dogs and family \n4  members.   \n5  59.  Mr. and Mrs. Thomas desire that he continue living at home with \n6  appropriate nursing services.  \n7  60.  Mr. Thomas is medically fragile and technology dependent.  Mr. \n8  Thomas requires oxygen 24 hours a day and is connected to a ventilator at least 18 \n9  hours a day, and more when needed.  He receives nutrition, hydration and \n10  medication through his G-tube.  Mr. Thomas is non-ambulatory and cannot bear \n11  weight.  He uses a wheelchair and requires assistance with all activities of daily \n12  living (“ADLs”).  \n13  61.   Mr. Thomas can no longer speak and is only able to communicate by \n14  blinking his eyes.  Individuals need training to understand his body language for \n15  signs and symptoms of changes in his condition, need, and medical emergencies.   \n16  62.  At age 66, when Mr. Thomas could no longer breathe on his own due \n17  to muscle weakness, he had a tracheotomy.      \n18  63.  In order to control his symptoms and severe pain, he takes over 40 \n19  medications, including several narcotics and 7 medications that are provided pro re \n20  nata (“PRN” as needed). \n21  64.  In addition to PSP, Mr. Thomas has been diagnosed with Post Polio \n22  Syndrome, among other conditions.  \n23  65.  Mr. Thomas lived in a nursing facility for fourteen years, until his wife \n24  was able to bring him home with services under the NF/AH Waiver.  Since moving \n25  home on April 1, 2013, Mr. Thomas has been in the hospital or hospitalized several \n26  times including most recently in January 2015, as well as seen by his doctors on \n27  numerous occasions.  Mr. Thomas is regularly seen by his pulmonologist and \n28  primary care physician, as well as a neurologist. \n  15 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 17 of 35   Page ID #:265\n \n \n1  66.  Since Mr. Thomas moved home, his condition has worsened due to the \n2  natural progression of his diseases.  He now requires more time connected to the \n3  ventilator and takes additional medications to assist with his digestive and \n4  tracheotomy suctioning needs.  In July 2014, Dr. Kayaleh, Mr. Thomas’s treating \n5  physician, ordered for him to be provided with 24 hour nursing care.  \n6  67.  Mrs. Thomas is not a licensed vocational nurse and is not capable of \n7  providing the additional nursing care that Mr. Thomas requires.   \n8  Mr. Thomas’ Nursing Care Needs   \n9  68.  As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n10  Thomas has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n11  addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include, e.g.,: monitoring Mr. Thomas’ \n12  oxygen saturation levels and providing skilled interventions when his oxygen levels \n13  drop below 92%, including breathing with ambu-bag, CPR, and calling 911; \n14  determining when Mr. Thomas must be placed on the ventilator during sprinting \n15  hours; monitoring and administering his medications including over 40 daily \n16  medications and 7 medications to be taken PRN as needed for proper dosage, \n17  effectiveness, interactions, and side effects; monitoring the amount, sound, and color \n18  of Mr. Thomas’ secretions for signs of infection; monitoring the sound of Mr. \n19  Thomas’ lungs to assess for a respiratory infection or blockage; monitoring and \n20  performing deep tracheal suctioning; monitoring the color, consistency, odor, and \n21  frequency of Mr. Thomas’ urine and bowels for signs and symptoms of infections; \n22  administering and checking all equipment to ensure proper functioning and replace \n23  equipment or intervene as needed; monitoring feeding tolerance and knowing when \n24  Mr. Thomas’ G-tube  feeding should be stopped when he presents signs of \n25  abdominal pain and discomfort; monitoring, caring for, and replacing his trach \n26  stoma when necessary; taking and interpreting vital signs and knowing when they \n27  indicate a possible infection or when CPR is required; monitoring Mr. Thomas’ \n28  entire system for signs of infection, change, or emergency; assessing and monitoring \n  16 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 18 of 35   Page ID #:266\n \n \n1  Mr. Thomas’ skin for signs of infection, breakdown, or ulcers; and identifying and \n2  responding to emergencies.   \n3  In-Home Nursing Authorization  \n4  69.  Before moving home from Chapman Subacute facility on April 1, \n5  2013, Mr. Thomas was approved to receive 450 LVN hours under the NF/AH \n6  waiver at the Subacute level of care, along with 240.04 hours of IHSS, and 2 hours \n7  of RN case management.  He and his wife accepted this combination of skilled and \n8  unskilled care because Mr. Thomas unquestionably required round-the-clock \n9  coverage, and they understood that, due to the Subacute Waiver cost-cap, he would \n10  not be able to receive the 24-hour nursing he needed. \n11  70.  On October 16, 2013, DHCS conducted a home visit to reassess Mr. \n12  Thomas’ level of care.  Based on the assessment, DHCS determined that Mr. \n13  Thomas remained eligible for the NF/AH waiver at the Subacute level of care.  \n14  However, DHCS determined that the expenditures for the services he was receiving \n15  exceeded the NF/AH waiver cost-cap at the Subacute level of care, which is \n16  $180,219.00.   \n17  71.  Even though Mr. Thomas’ needs had increased due to the progression \n18  of his disease since his move home in 2013, DHCS issued a Notice of Action \n19  (“NOA”) on January 9, 2014 reducing his in-home LVN nursing authorization to \n20  430 hours per month.  The NOA provided that the decrease in services was solely \n21  due to the cost-cap under the NF/AH waiver, not a change or improvement in Mr. \n22  Thomas’ condition.   \n23  72.   On February 10, 2014, Mrs. Thomas, on behalf of her husband, timely \n24  appealed DHCS’ 20-hour per month nursing reduction by mail and requested aid-\n25  paid-pending.  At Plaintiffs' request, DHCS reassessed Mr. Thomas in August 2014 \n26  but refused to authorize increased nursing hours for him.   \n27  73.  On September 23, 2014, a Medi-Cal fair hearing was held, where Mr. \n28  Thomas presented his medical need for 24 hour nursing care, consistent with his \n  17 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 19 of 35   Page ID #:267\n \n \n1  doctor’s July 2014 orders.  The administrative law judge has not yet issued a ruling; \n2  thus Mr. Thomas has not yet experienced a reduction in his nursing care.  However, \n3  because DHCS has the ability to “alternate”, or overturn, the decision, even a \n4  favorable ruling does not offer Mr. Thomas protection from this cut.  Moreover, at \n5  the hearing, Defendants argued that the hearing issues should be limited to the 20-\n6  hour per month reduction, and not whether Mr. Thomas was entitled to receive 24-\n7  hour per day nursing care.  Thus, even a favorable decision may not provide Mr. \n8  Thomas with permanent or adequate relief. \n9  ARTHUR CONGDON \n10  74.  Arthur Congdon is 36 years old.  He was diagnosed with Duchenne \n11  Muscular Dystrophy as a child.  Muscular Dystrophy is a degenerative disease \n12  involving advancing muscle weakness, loss of muscle tissue, and atrophy.  As a \n13  result of Muscular Dystrophy, Mr. Congdon is quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair.  \n14  Mr. Congdon also has congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, chronic respiratory \n15  failure and is legally blind.  In addition, Mr. Congdon suffers from chronic \n16  insomnia, chronic back pain, gastric problems, urinary incontinence and severe \n17  contracture of his joints.     \n18  75.  Mr. Congdon lives at home with his mother, Jennifer Knight.  Ms. \n19  Knight is also legally blind.  Ms. Knight is Mr. Congdon’s primary caregiver, and is \n20  involved in planning for and providing his care.  Mr. Congdon’s father lives in \n21  Pennsylvania.   \n22  76.  Mr. Congdon has a Ph.D. in Astrophysics.  In October 2008, he began \n23  an assignment at the prestigious Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California \n24  Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.  He was a participant in NASA’s \n25  Postdoctoral Program administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities.  \n26  However, due to his advancing Muscular Dystrophy, Mr. Congdon is no longer able \n27  to work at JPL.  Mr. Congdon now remains exclusively at home and is working on \n28  an astrophysics textbook. \n  18 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

In March 2002, Mr. Congdon was named one of five winners nationally \n2  of the Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic academic awards.  To recognize his \n3  accomplishment, Mr. Congdon was invited to the White House in Washington, DC, \n4  where he met with then First Lady Laura Bush. \n5  78.  Mr. Congdon and his mother desire that he continue living at home \n6  with appropriate nursing services.  \n7  79.  Mr. Congdon’s in-home nursing care has been funded entirely by \n8  Medi-Cal.   \n9  80.  Mr. Congdon is medically fragile and technology dependent.  Eleven \n10  years ago, Mr. Congdon could no longer breathe on his own due to muscle \n11  weakness, and he had a tracheotomy.  Since that time, Mr. Congdon has been \n12  dependent on a ventilator 24 hours a day. \n13  81.  Mr. Congdon receives nutrition, hydration and medication through his \n14  G-tube.  He is given water three times a day, and medicines four times a day, via his \n15  G-tube.  His G-tube needs to be cleaned every day and flushed every time he gets \n16  hydration. \n17  82.  Mr. Congdon needs total care for every daily activity.  Mr. Congdon is \n18  non-ambulatory and cannot bear weight.  He uses a wheelchair.  He cannot walk, \n19  cannot move himself or even turn over in bed.  He cannot feed himself and has \n20  limited use of his hands.    \n21  83.  Mr. Congdon had spinal fusion surgery in 1993.  He was hospitalized at \n22  Cedars Sinai for aspiration pneumonia in May 2013. \n23  Mr. Congdon’s Nursing Care Needs \n24  84.  As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n25  Congdon has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n26  addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include:  monitoring vital signs for signs or \n27  symptoms of a change in condition and ensuring his vital signs remain within \n28  parameters listed in the physician’s orders, with more frequent checks if he is \n  19 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Mr. Congdon has been receiving NF/AH Waiver services since October \n18  2008.  He is authorized for up to 500 hours per month of licensed vocational \n19  nursing, and two hours per month of RN case management.  This provides him with \n20  16 hours nursing coverage daily.  He does not receive any IHSS attendant care.   \n21  86.  Mr. Congdon’s mother, Ms. Knight, has been trained in his care needs \n22  and provides the remainder of his care each day.  She also provides backup care \n23  during times when Mr. Congdon’s needs are so intense that two caregivers are \n24  required or when the home health agency fails to staff a shift and a nurse is not \n25  available.   \n26  87.  However, Ms. Knight is unable to provide additional care for Mr. \n27  Congdon.  Mr. Congdon’s father lives on the East Coast and is unavailable to \n28  provide any caregiver duties.  Moreover, since Mr. Congdon is over the age of 18, \n  20 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 22 of 35   Page ID #:270\n \n \n1  neither parent has a legal obligation to provide for his care.  \n2  88.  In June 2013, Mr. Congdon’s physician ordered one-to-one nursing \n3  care for him for twenty four hours per day.  Accordingly, Mr. Congdon asked \n4  Defendants for an additional 240 hours per month of private duty nursing to be \n5  provided by a licensed vocational nurse.  Defendants denied the request and, in lieu \n6  of the 240 hours per month, only authorized Mr. Congdon an additional 20 hours per \n7  month of nursing care, up to the Subacute Waiver cost-cap.  Mr. Congdon did not \n8  appeal the denial because he believed that doing so would be futile.   \n9  SEAN BENISON  \n10  89.  Mr. Benison was diagnosed with progressive hereditary Becker \n11  Muscular Dystrophy when he was 9 years old.  Mr. Benison started using a manual \n12  wheelchair when he was 13 year old and a power wheel chair at age 21.  Mr. \n13  Benison is quadriplegic.  In addition to Muscular Dystrophy, Mr. Benison has \n14  chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pain \n15  disorder, anxiety disorder, DVT (thromboembolism) prophylaxis and reflux \n16  esophagitis.  Mr. Benison takes 19 different medications.    \n17  90.  Mr. Benison is working towards a Ph.D. in Geography at the University \n18  of California, Santa Barbara (“UCSB”).  He has a B.A. from California State \n19  University Northridge.  He has a Master’s degree in Geography from UCSB. \n20  91.  Mr. Benison lives in an apartment in Ventura, California with a live-in \n21  IHSS personal care worker.  Mr. Benison’s father, Edward Benison, does not \n22  provide any daily care but is involved in planning for and providing his care.   \n23  92.  Mr. Benison and his family desire that he continue living at home with \n24  appropriate nursing services.    \n25  93.  Mr. Benison’s nursing care has been funded entirely by Medi-Cal.     \n26  94.  While a student at UCSB, Mr. Benison was living in campus housing \n27  and had an IHSS care worker assisting with his needs.  Mr. Benison also had close \n28  friends who helped with his care needs, which enabled Mr. Benison to enroll in and \n  21 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

In November 2011, while a student at UCSB, Mr. Benison’s health \n3  took a turn for the worse.  Mr. Benison had a severe attack of pneumonia and was \n4  hospitalized at the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.  He remained in \n5  the Subacute unit of the acute care hospital for two years before he moved out to his \n6  current apartment.  While in the hospital, Mr. Benison could no longer breathe on \n7  his own.  Mr. Benison had to undergo a tracheostomy due to the pneumonia and \n8  neuromuscular and lung weakness caused by the Muscular Dystrophy.  Mr. Benison \n9  is now dependent on a ventilator 24 hours a day.   \n10  96.  Mr. Benison is medically fragile and technology dependent.  Until a \n11  few months ago, he had a G-tube for feeding and medication.  Mr. Benison cannot \n12  walk, cannot move himself or even turn over in bed.  Mr. Benison is non-\n13  ambulatory and cannot bear weight.  He uses a wheelchair for mobility.  He cannot \n14  feed himself and has limited use of his hands.  He requires assistance with all \n15  activities of daily living.   \n16  97.  Mr. Benison has been on the NF/AH Waiver since October 2013 when \n17  he moved out of the Subacute facility and into his own apartment in the community.  \n18  At that time, DHCS authorized 416 hours per month of Medi-Cal funded one-to-one \n19  in-home, private duty nursing care through the NF/AH Waiver, based on its \n20  determination that Mr. Benison met the Subacute level of care.  In order to remain \n21  within the cost-cap limitation at the Subacute level of care, he is authorized for 16 \n22  hours nursing coverage daily from Monday through Friday, and 8 hours of nursing \n23  coverage each on Saturdays and Sundays.  Mr. Benison requires 24-hour care, and \n24  because he lives alone, Mr. Benison supplements his nursing care with 260 hours of \n25  unlicensed IHSS personal care aide hours per month.  However, on weekends he \n26  does not have any nursing coverage for 16 hours each day, which leaves him at risk.  \n27  Hence, a minimum of 8 hours more of private duty nursing each on Saturday and \n28  Sunday is necessary to keep Mr. Benison safely in his home. \n  22 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n3  Benison has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n4  addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include:  monitoring Mr. Benison’s vital signs \n5  to ensure they remain within parameters listed in the physician’s orders, and \n6  instructing caregivers in proper vital sign monitoring; monitoring cardiac status and \n7  assessing for signs and symptoms of tachycardia (resting heart rate faster than \n8  normal); assessing Mr. Benison for signs and symptoms of pain; assessing for signs \n9  and symptoms of skin breakdown, rash and perfusion; instructing caregivers in \n10  measures to protect skin integrity; assessing for medication compliance, \n11  effectiveness and complications and instructing caregivers in medication dosages, \n12  schedules, effects and side effects, and any food and drug interactions; assessing  \n13  Mr. Benison’s level of consciousness, motor and sensory reflexes, and for \n14  progression of his muscular dystrophy; ensuring adequate respiratory function \n15  through trach care including mobilization of lung secretions; monitoring and \n16  providing ventilator support and responding to signs and symptoms of respiratory \n17  distress; checking ventilator settings as per the physician orders;  assessing Mr. \n18  Benison’s lung fields for clear, crackles, wheezing or the absence of these in his \n19  breathing patterns; monitoring Mr. Benison’s trach stoma for signs and symptoms of \n20  infection; monitoring Mr. Benison’s abdomen for signs and symptoms of abdomen \n21  distention and constipation; monitoring Mr. Benison for signs and symptoms of \n22  urinary tract infections; and reporting significant findings and changes in Mr. \n23  Benison’s condition as appropriate.  \n24  In-Home Nursing Authorization; Case Management and Habilitation Services  \n25  99.  As of September 2014, the cost to the Medi-Cal program for Mr. \n26  Benison’s home care, including 416 hours per month of private duty nursing, 260 \n27  hours of unlicensed IHSS aides and his medical equipment and supplies, was \n28  approximately $180,219.00 per year.  This is his maximum budget for NF/AH \n  23 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 25 of 35   Page ID #:273\n \n \n1  Waiver services because of the cost-cap imposed by DHCS. \n2  100.  Since January 2014, Mr. Benison’s physician has ordered one-to-one \n3  private duty nursing care for him so that he can receive the 24-hour care that he \n4  needs to remain safely at home.  Mr. Benison requested 24-hour nursing from \n5  Defendants in February 2014.  Defendants deferred his request for 24-hour nursing \n6  and have not provided him with a written notice of action as to their decision.   \n7  However, because Mr. Benison lives on his own, he relies on an unlicensed live-in \n8  IHSS aide as a backup care provider.  In addition to the NF/AH Waiver cost-cap \n9  which would prevent Mr. Benison from receiving authorization for 24-hour nursing,  \n10  DHCS will also not authorize direct care services, or any combination of direct care \n11  services, exceeding 24 hours of care per day under the NF/AH Waiver.  NF/AH \n12  Waiver at 196.  Therefore, Plaintiff Benison needs 24 hours of nursing care per day, \n13  but he also cannot give up his live-in backup caregiver.  Thus, given the limitations \n14  of the existing NF/AH Waiver rules, he is requesting additional hours per month of \n15  nursing care to ensure that he can receive round-the-clock care.     \n16  101.  Additionally, Mr. Benison needs Case Management Services and \n17  Habilitation services to help him organize his nurses and IHSS workers’ schedules, \n18  enroll back in graduate studies, enable him to avail of social activities and \n19  community services, and gain an overall better quality of life.  These services are \n20  available through the NF/AH Waiver, but are not available to Mr. Benison because \n21  of the Subacute Waiver cost-cap.   \n22  DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS PLACE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS AT RISK \n23  OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND VIOLATE THE LAW \n24  102.  Defendants have placed an arbitrary cost-cap on home and community-\n25  based services provided under the NF/AH Waiver, which is far less than the actual \n26  rate for institutional facilities.   \n27  103.  Defendants have great flexibility and discretion in their administration \n28  of the NF/AH waiver.  They have the authority to make modifications to ensure that \n  24 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 26 of 35   Page ID #:274\n \n \n1  Medi-Cal recipients such as individual Plaintiffs receive sufficient and medically \n2  necessary NF/AH Waiver services to avoid institutional placement and receive the \n3  necessary services as their medical conditions require.  \n4  104.  According to Plaintiffs Thomas, Congdon, and Benison’s medical \n5  professionals, home is the safest place for them to maximize their health condition \n6  and prolong their lives.  Placement in an institution, however, will almost certainly \n7  cause health deterioration and possible death within a short period of time.  \n8  105.  Defendants are refusing to provide additional NF/AH Waiver services \n9  for individual Plaintiffs solely due to the fact that DHCS has imposed a cost-cap on \n10  NF/AH Waiver services, which is lower than the equivalent institutional rate, and \n11  which is without medical justification, nor is it required by federal law.   \n12  106.  Defendants’ administration and imposition of the NF/AH Waiver cost-\n13  cap directly injures organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT. As a result of Defendants’ \n14  illegal administration of the NF/AH waiver, IN SPIRIT’s mission to enable clients \n15  to live safely at home is frustrated and its limited resources are diverted from other \n16  clients in order to serve NF/AH Waiver recipients whose at-home care needs would \n17  be met, but for the NF/AH Waiver cost-cap. \n18  107.  Plaintiffs’ needs can be reasonably accommodated by Defendants \n19  providing NF/AH Waiver services up to the rate that Defendants would actually pay \n20  if Plaintiffs were to be admitted to an institutional facility; and/or modifying any of \n21  their Home and Community-Based Services Waivers to permit Plaintiffs to receive \n22  the NF/AH Waiver services that they require and that their physicians have ordered.   \n23  108.  Defendants have the option to administer the NF/AH waiver so as not \n24  to create a bias towards institutional placement.  Defendants could increase the \n25  NF/AH Waiver cost-caps to levels that are equal to the amount actually paid to \n26  institutional facilities, or utilize an aggregate cost-cap.  Instead, Defendants have \n27  chosen to administer the NF/AH Waiver in such a way as to discriminate against \n28  Plaintiffs and to place them at risk of institutional placement, with life threatening \n  25 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Without the appropriate level of NF/AH Waiver services to remain in \n3  their homes, individual Plaintiffs will have no choice but institutional placement, \n4  which will separate them from their families and communities and also poses \n5  significant risks to their health.   \n6  VII.   LEGAL CLAIMS \n7  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8  (Defendant Director Jennifer Kent) \n9  Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. \n10  110.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every \n11  allegation and paragraph set forth previously.  \n12  111.  Individual Plaintiffs are “qualified individuals with a disability” \n13  within the meaning of the ADA in that they have physical and/or mental \n14  impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities, including their \n15  ability to live independently without support. \n16  112.  Individual Plaintiffs meet the essential eligibility requirements for \n17  Medi-Cal services, including services necessary to maintain them in their homes in \n18  the community.  \n19  113.  Organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT represents the interests of \n20  individual Plaintiffs in that it provides assistance to individuals with disabilities to \n21  enable them to live in their own homes.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is thwarted by \n22  Defendant’s actions, which hinder its ability to provide assistance and divert its \n23  resources from serving clients who would otherwise be served by the organization. \n24  114.  Defendant Jennifer Kent is the Director of Defendant DHCS, which \n25  has responsibility for providing Medi-Cal and state-funded home and community-\n26  based and institutional services, and is therefore a government entity subject to Title \n27  II of the ADA. 42 USC §12131(1)(A) and (B) (1990). \n28  115.  Defendant is obligated under the ADA to administer its programs in a \n  26 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Defendant’s denial and reduction of \n3  adequate and medically necessary in-home nursing, and failure to provide Plaintiffs \n4  with medically necessary NF/AH Waiver services, has denied Plaintiffs the services \n5  they need to remain safely in the community, thereby placing them at risk of \n6  institutionalization in violation of the ADA’s integration mandate. \n7  116.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs in ways that include \n8  arbitrarily setting cost-caps for the NF/AH Waiver far below the actual rate paid for \n9  institutional services in equivalent facilities, thus denying Plaintiffs funds for home \n10  and community-based services that would otherwise be available for institutional \n11  services. \n12  117.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs by failing to provide \n13  reasonable modifications to programs and services in ways that include: failing to \n14  increase the NF/AH Waiver cost-caps within federal cost neutrality limitations to \n15  enable Plaintiffs to receive adequate and medically necessary NF/AH Waiver \n16  services; and failing to offer an exception to the NF/AH Waiver cost-cap that would \n17  enable Plaintiffs to receive NF/AH Waiver services at a level adequate to meet their \n18  needs. \n19  118.  By denying Plaintiffs adequate and necessary NF/AH Waiver services \n20  commensurate with their actual need, as opposed to arbitrary service limitations, \n21  Defendant has imposed eligibility requirements which unlawfully screen Plaintiffs \n22  out from fully and equally enjoying NF/AH Waiver services, and from receiving \n23  adequate care to remain safely at home. \n24  119.  Defendant has utilized criteria and methods of administration that \n25  subject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of \n26  unnecessary institutionalization, in ways that include:  (1) designing and \n27  implementing Home and Community-Based Services Waivers which set arbitrarily \n28  low cost-caps for NF/AH Waiver services, while paying significantly higher rates \n  27 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Defendant’s actions are in violation of Title II of the ADA. \n5  121.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (1990), Plaintiffs are entitled to \n6  declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs \n7  incurred in bringing this action. \n8  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n9  (Defendant DHCS) \n10  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n11  122.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every \n12  allegation and paragraph set forth previously.   \n13  123.  Individual Plaintiffs are “qualified individuals with a disability” under \n14  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended – 29 U.S.C. § 794 and \n15  implementing regulations –  in that they have physical and/or mental impairments \n16  that substantially limit one or more major life activities, including their ability to \n17  live independently without support. \n18  124.  Individual Plaintiffs meet the essential eligibility requirements for \n19  Medi-Cal services, including services necessary to maintain them in their homes in \n20  the community.  \n21  125.  Organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT represents the interests of \n22  individual Plaintiffs in that it provides assistance to individuals with disabilities to \n23  enable them to live in their own homes.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is thwarted by \n24  Defendant’s actions, which hinder its ability to provide assistance and divert its \n25  resources from serving clients who would otherwise be served by the organization. \n26  126.  Defendant DHCS is a recipient of federal monies that provides Medi-\n27  Cal home and community-based and institutional services and other Medi-Cal \n28  services and is therefore a government entity subject to Section 504.  29 U.S.C. § \n  28 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Defendant’s denial and reduction of adequate and necessary in-home \n3  nursing and refusal to provide NF/AH Waiver services has barred individual \n4  Plaintiffs from receiving the services they need to continue to live in the community, \n5  thereby placing them at imminent risk of institutionalization in violation of Section \n6  504’s integration mandate. \n7  128.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs in ways that include \n8  arbitrarily setting cost-caps for the NF/AH Waiver far below the actual rate paid for \n9  institutional services in equivalent nursing facilities, thus denying Plaintiffs funds \n10  for home and community-based services that would otherwise be available for \n11  institutional services. \n12  129.  By denying Plaintiffs adequate and necessary NF/AH Waiver services \n13  commensurate with their actual need, as opposed to arbitrary service limitations, \n14  Defendant has imposed eligibility requirements which unlawfully screen Plaintiffs \n15  out from fully and equally enjoying NF/AH Waiver services, and from receiving \n16  adequate care to remain safely at home. \n17  130.  Defendant  has utilized criteria and methods of administration that \n18  subject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of \n19  unnecessary institutionalization, by, including but not limited to the following: (1) \n20  designing and implementing Home and Community-Based Services Waivers which \n21  set arbitrarily low cost-caps for NF/AH Waiver services, while paying significantly \n22  higher rates for the institutional alternative; and (2) imposing eligibility criteria, cost \n23  limitations and other criteria not required by federal limitations, which restrict in-\n24  home care in favor of institutional care.  \n25  131.  Defendant’s actions violate Section 504.  \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n  29 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every \n5  allegation and paragraph set forth previously.   \n6  133.  Individual Plaintiffs are persons with disabilities within the meaning \n7  of California Government Code section 11135(c) et seq. (2011) and its \n8  implementing regulations. \n9  134.  Individual Plaintiffs meet the essential eligibility requirements for \n10  Medi-Cal services, including services necessary to maintain them in their homes in \n11  the community.  \n12  135.  Organizational Plaintiff IN SPIRIT represents the interests of \n13  individual Plaintiffs in that it provides assistance to individuals with disabilities to \n14  enable them to live in their own homes.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is thwarted by \n15  Defendants’ actions, which hinder its ability to provide assistance and divert its \n16  resources from serving clients who would otherwise be served by the organization. \n17  136.  Defendants DHCS and Director Kent conduct, operate or administer \n18  the state Medicaid program, entitled Medi-Cal, which is directly funded, in part, by \n19  state financial assistance within the meaning of California Government Code section \n20  11135(a) and implementing regulations.  \n21  137.  Defendants are obligated to administer their programs in a manner \n22  that enables qualified individuals with disabilities to live in the most integrated \n23  setting appropriate to their needs.  Defendants’ denial and reduction of adequate and \n24  medically necessary in-home nursing, and failure to provide Plaintiffs with \n25  medically necessary NF/AH Waiver services, has denied Plaintiffs the services they \n26  need to remain safely in the community, thereby placing them at risk of \n27  institutionalization in violation of the integration mandate of Government Code \n28  section 11135. \n  30 \nJerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS; 2:14-cv-08013 FMO (AGRx) \nFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 26   Filed 01/29/15   Page 32 of 35   Page ID #:280\n \n \n1  138.  By administering its programs in ways that deny Plaintiffs NF/AH \n2  Waiver services commensurate with their actual need, and instead imposing \n3  arbitrary cost limitations on the services they may receive, Defendants have \n4  discriminated against Plaintiffs, thereby excluding them from participation in, \n5  denying them the benefits of, and otherwise subjecting them to discrimination in \n6  violation of California Government Code section 11135 et seq. and implementing \n7  regulations.   \n8  139.  Plaintiffs further allege that violations of their rights under the \n9  Americans with Disabilities Act and implementing regulations contained in the First \n10  Claim for Relief are incorporated herein and constitute a violation of California \n11  Government Code section 11135 et seq. as well, as set forth in section 11135(b). \n12  VIII.  ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY \n13  RELIEF \n14  140.  Defendants’ actions, as alleged herein, have resulted in and will \n15  continue to result in irreparable injury to Plaintiffs caused by the refusal to cover \n16  medically necessary services under the NF/AH waiver, which they need to remain in \n17  their homes and avoid unnecessary institutional placement.  Plaintiffs have no plain, \n18  speedy or adequate remedy at law. \n19  141.   IN SPIRIT is also subject to irreparable injury as a result of the \n20  NF/AH Waiver cost-cap, for it provides financial aid to NF/AH Waiver recipients to \n21  supplement at-home care which would otherwise be covered by the NF/AH Waiver, \n22  but for imposition of the cost-cap.  IN SPIRIT’s mission is thereby impeded, where \n23  funds are put toward assisting NF/AH Waiver recipients with home care needs, \n24  rather than funding non-Waiver recipients. \n25  142.  An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants, in \n26  that Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have failed to provide services in the most \n27  integrated setting appropriate to meet Plaintiffs’ needs, in violation of federal and \n28  state law and Defendants deny all such contentions.  \n  31 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Defendant Kent can either adopt or “alternate” (reject in whole or \n2  part) any administrative decision arising out of claims against DHCS.  California \n3  Manual of Policies and Procedures, Sections 22-061 and 22-062.  Therefore, the \n4  administrative appeal process offers no remedy or protection to Plaintiffs, as the \n5  Defendants in this action are the very entity which will make a determination of \n6  what NF/AH Waiver services will be provided to Plaintiffs.   \n7  IX.   REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n8  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court order the following relief and \n9  remedies on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated: \n10  A.  Assume jurisdiction over this action and maintain continuing \n11  jurisdiction until Defendants are in full compliance with every order of this Court; \n12  B.  Declare that Defendants’ imposition of arbitrary NF/AH Waiver cost-\n13  caps, which deny Plaintiffs sufficient NF/AH Waiver services to meet their \n14  undisputed needs, and Defendants’ policies, practices, acts and omissions as set \n15  forth above violate: \n16  i.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), (42 U.S.C. §§ \n17  12101-12213 (2008)) and implementing regulations. \n18  ii.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), (29 \n19  U.S.C. §§ 794-794a (2014)) and implementing regulations; and  \n20  iii.  California Government Code section 11135.  (Cal. Gov’t. Code \n21  § 11135 (2011)) and implementing regulations.   \n22  C.  Grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \n23  enjoining Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, successors, and \n24  all persons who are in active concert or participation with them from reducing \n25  medically necessary Medi-Cal funded in-home care below Mr. Thomas’ current \n26  level of 450 hours per month of licensed vocational nursing care, 2 hours per month \n27  of RN care and 240.04 hours per month of IHSS personal care services until such \n28  time as the matter before this Court may be finally decided. \n  32 \nJerry Thomas et al. v.

Failing to offer reasonable modifications to their programs and \n9  policies to enable Plaintiffs to receive other NF/AH Waiver \n10  services like Case Management and Habilitation services;  \n11  iii.  Imposing eligibility requirements which unlawfully screen \n12  Plaintiffs out of the NF/AH Waiver program and prevent them \n13  from fully and equally enjoying NF/AH Waiver services, and \n14  from receiving adequate care to remain safely at home; \n15  iv.  Utilizing criteria and methods of administration that subject \n16  Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including \n17  placing them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n18  145.  Issue an order requiring Defendants to: \n19  i.  Authorize Medi-Cal funded services for Plaintiffs through the \n20  Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver or other appropriate \n21  Home and Community-Based Services Waivers, subject to \n22  federal cost neutrality requirements, to enable them to receive \n23  services commensurate with their needs, and as authorized by \n24  their treating physicians; \n25  ii.

ECF No. 171 \n7  (“Supplemental SOI”).   \n8  In this case, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have imposed cost limits on the \n9  operative Waiver “significantly below what [Defendants] pay[] for comparable \n10  institutional care,” have only an “arbitrar[y]” policy for making exceptions to those \n11  limits, and consequently violate Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \n12  U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.  Jt. Mem. Mot. Summ. J. 1:21-2:1, ECF No. 194.  In its SOI, the \n13  United States observed that California’s operation of these limits and exceptions \n14  processes would not meet the State’s obligations under the ADA if the State did not \n15  otherwise “ensure that individuals who require additional care to remain in the \n16  community will have the necessary alternative services identified and put in place to \n17  avoid unnecessary institutionalization.”  SOI at 6 (internal quotations omitted).   \n18  In the months since Plaintiffs first moved for summary judgment and the \n19  United States filed its SOI, Defendants have taken some steps to modify the applicable \n20  cost limits.  The United States noted in its Supplemental SOI that such steps in and of \n21  themselves might not bring the Defendants into ADA compliance.  Supplemental SOI at \n22  2.  Defendants now contend, among other arguments, that this Court should not examine \n23  the waiver at issue because where “there is evidence that [the] state has in place a \n24  comprehensive deinstitutionalization scheme, which, in light of existing budgetary \n25  constraints and competing demands of other services that the State provides, is \n26  ‘effectively working,’ courts should not tinker with that scheme.” Jt. Mem. Mot. Summ. \n27  J. 12:12-25 (citing Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2015)).  But \n28 \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 198   Filed 09/16/16   Page 3 of 9   Page ID #:29415\n \n1  Defendants have proffered little evidence of an effectively working plan that addresses \n2  the risk of institutionalization in this case and have misinterpreted the relevant law.  To \n3  be sure, Sanchez did affirm that a court should not impose a judicial remedy against an \n4  ADA violation if doing so would inappropriately interrupt a comprehensive, effectively \n5  working, plan for deinstitutionalization – i.e. a fundamental alteration defense.  \n6  However, neither Sanchez nor other case law insulates a defendant from judicial scrutiny \n7  of the Waiver identified as the basis for that defense. To the contrary, courts frequently \n8  examine states’ Medicaid programs, including waiver programs, to determine whether \n9  the state’s administration of its programs unnecessarily institutionalizes individuals or \n10  places individuals at risk of unnecessary institutionalization.  See, e.g., Steimel v. \n11  Wernert, 823 F.3d 902 (7th Cir. 2016) (examining Title II ADA claim related to waiver \n12  eligibility requirements); Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511 (9th Cir. 2003) (examining \n13  financial eligibility for waiver services); Fisher v. Okla. Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d \n14  1175 (10th Cir. 2003) (examining availability of certain services through a waiver).  \n15  Accordingly, in this Second Supplemental Statement of Interest the United States \n16  clarifies the scope of the fundamental alteration defense and the burden a state must meet \n17  in order to successfully assert that defense. \n18  The Supreme Court has articulated the fundamental alteration defense to mean \n19  that a public entity need not make an otherwise reasonable modification to its service \n20  system if it establishes that to do so would be “inequitable, given the responsibility the \n21  State has taken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons \n22  with [] disabilities.”  Olmstead v L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 604 (1999); see also 28 C.F.R. § \n23  35.130(b)(7) (“A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, \n24  or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis \n25  of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \n26  would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”).   \n27  However, the defense’s availability is limited.  For instance, it cannot be used by \n28 \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 198   Filed 09/16/16   Page 4 of 9   Page ID #:29416\n \n1  public entities generally seeking to avoid making changes which foster integration.  See, \n2  e.g., Pa Protection & Advocacy Inc. v. Pa Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 380-381 \n3  (3d Cir. 2005) (“a state cannot meet an allegation of noncompliance simply by replying \n4  that compliance would be too costly or would otherwise fundamentally alter its \n5  noncomplying programs”); Townsend, 328 F.3d at 518-19 (“policy choices that isolate \n6  the disabled cannot be upheld solely because offering integrated services would change \n7  the segregated way in which existing services are provided”).  Nor is the defense \n8  available to public entities pointing solely to increased expenditures or general budget \n9  concerns.  Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1182-83 (“the fact that Oklahoma has a fiscal problem, by \n10  itself, does not lead to an automatic conclusion that preservation of unlimited medically \n11  necessary prescription benefits for participants in the Advantage program will result in a \n12  fundamental alteration”).     \n13  Further, a public entity asserting the affirmative defense1 must demonstrate that it \n14  has a “comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with [] \n15  disabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that move[s] at a reasonable pace \n16  not controlled by the State’s endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated.”  \n17  Frederick L. I, 364 F.3d at 498 (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605-06).  The Third \n18  Circuit has stressed the importance of a State’s demonstration that it has a “plan for the \n19  future.”  Id. at 500.  This plan must do more than reflect past progress but rather must \n20  clearly demonstrate a commitment to future action.  Id.  Furthermore, this commitment \n21  must not be “a vague assurance of the individual patient’s future deinstitutionalization” \n22  and should instead contain “measurable goals for community integration for which [the \n23  defendant] may be held accountable.”  Frederick L. v. Pa Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 422 \n24  F.3d 151, 156 (3d Cir. 2005) (Frederick L. II); see also Day v. Dist. of Columbia, 894 F. \n25  Supp. 2d 1, 28 (D.D.C. 2012) (“one essential component of an ‘effectively working’ plan \n26 \n                                           \n27  1 Defendants bear the burden of proving a fundamental alteration defense.  \nFrederick L. v. Pa Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 364 F.3d 487, 492, n.4 (3d Cir. 2004) \n28  (Frederick L. I).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 198   Filed 09/16/16   Page 5 of 9   Page ID #:29417\n \n1  is a measurable commitment to deinstitutionalization”) (citing U.S. Dep’t of Justice, \n2  Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of \n3  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C. n.4 (June 22, 2011), \n4  http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm (the “DOJ Olmstead Statement”)); \n5  Jensen v. Minn. Dep’t of Human Servs., No. 09-1775, 2014 WL 4670898, at *2 (D. \n6  Minn. Sept. 18, 2014) (Olmstead plan “must contain concrete, reliable and realistic \n7  commitments, accompanied by specific and reasonable timetables, for which the public \n8  agencies will be held accountable.”).  If there is an effectively working plan with the \n9  requisite components, the court should examine whether the proposed remedy “would so \n10  disrupt the implementation of the plan as to cause a fundamental alteration.”  DOJ \n11  Olmstead Statement at Question 13; Benjamin v. Pa Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 768 F. Supp. \n12  2d 747, 755 (M.D. Pa. 2011) (“the existence of the Plan does not, however, \n13  automatically defeat liability”).    \n14  In determining whether an effectively working plan exists, courts have regularly \n15  rejected purported plans which did not meet these rigorous criteria.  Cruz v. Dudek, No. \n16  10-23048, 2010 WL 4284955 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 12, 2010) challenged Florida’s waiver for \n17  individuals with spinal cord injuries.  The plaintiffs there were on the waiting list for that \n18  waiver and could only gain admission to the waiver off of the lengthy and slow-moving \n19  wait list by entering a nursing facility for at least two months.  Id. at *13.  The court \n20  rejected the argument that the state had an effectively working plan.  The court noted \n21  that defendants in that case had not shown that the waiver at issue had “been expanded \n22  or adjusted to reduce the lengthy waiting list, or that there [was] a basis for not seeking \n23  such an expansion.”  Id. at *14.  In addition, the waiver was not operating at authorized \n24  capacity, and the State had not proffered information about “the average amount of time \n25  on the waiting list, the rate of turnover, or when, if ever Plaintiffs can expect to move off \n26  the waiting list.”  Id. at *15.  Given this stagnation, the court held the state had not \n27  shown they had a “plan or commitment to avoid unnecessary” institutionalization.  Id.  \n28 \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 198   Filed 09/16/16   Page 6 of 9   Page ID #:29418\n \n1  In Haddad v. Arnold, 784 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1305-06 (M.D. Fla. 2010), another \n2  challenge to the spinal cord waiver, Florida pointed to the fact that some of its waivers, \n3  though not the spinal cord waiver, had “increased in size and expenditure.”  Id.  But \n4  evidence related to other waivers did not demonstrate the “effectiveness” of the spinal \n5  cord waiver.  Id.  The court found the state’s effectively working plan arguments \n6  particularly weak because the state did not proffer evidence that its institutionalized \n7  population had declined, and because the state’s own representation to the plaintiffs was \n8  that “moving individuals off the waiting list into these programs does not occur \n9  frequently.”  Id.; see also Benjamin, 768 F. Supp. 2d at 756 (“Considering the absence of \n10  concrete benchmarks for deinstitutionalization in the contingency-ridden Plan, no record \n11  of actual implementation of the Plan, and a history of unnecessary segregation of and \n12  discrimination against institutionalized persons, we cannot conclude that [defendant] has \n13  complied with or will comply with the integration mandates of the ADA and \n14  [Rehabilitation Act].”). \n15  The Ninth Circuit similarly demands a measurable commitment to \n16  deinstitutionalization.  In Sanchez the court affirmed the District Court’s finding that \n17  California’s “commitment to [] deinstitutionalization…[was] genuine, comprehensive, \n18  and reasonable.”  416 F.3d at 1067.  This finding had been based on a number of factors, \n19  which included: increased expenditures on community-based services, an increased \n20  caseload of individuals served in community-based settings, a decrease in institutional \n21  populations, and budget allocations for additional community-based settings.  Id.; see \n22  also Arc of Washington State Inc. v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, 620 (9th Cir. 2005) (“the \n23  state had repeatedly applied for an increase in the size of the waiver program, state \n24  expenditures for integrated community-based treatment had consistently increased over \n25  the prior decade, and the state’s institutionalized population had decreased by twenty \n26  percent over the prior four years.”). \n27  Relying on Sanchez, the court in Arc of Washington held that compelling the state \n28 \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 198   Filed 09/16/16   Page 7 of 9   Page ID #:29419\n \n1  to increase the number of individuals served on a particular waiver would be a \n2  fundamental alteration under the facts of that case: the waiver was “sizeable, with a cap \n3  that ha[d] increased substantially over the past two decades;” was “full;” was “available \n4  to all Medicaid-eligible disabled persons as slots bec[a]me available, based only on their \n5  mental-health needs and position on the waiting list;” had “already significantly reduced \n6  the size of the state’s institutionalized population;” and had “experienced budget growth \n7  in line with, or exceeding, other state agencies.”  427 F.3d at 621-22.    \n8  Defendants assert they have an effectively working plan to deinstitutionalize \n9  Californians with disabilities, but do not explain how the existence of such a plan is \n10  relevant here, where the Plaintiffs claim they are placed at risk of institutionalization by \n11  the very operation of that plan.  Assuming that the existence of such a plan is relevant, it \n12  is Defendants’ burden to demonstrate the existence of a comprehensive, effectively \n13  working plan that reflects a genuine and reasonable commitment to community \n14  integration of individuals with disabilities.  In support of this burden, the Defendants \n15  have pointed to a single fact: that the NF/AH Waiver at issue serves 3,084 beneficiaries, \n16  with 439 in intake status.2  Jt. Mem. Mot. Summ. J. 12:20-23.  This fact, alone,3 cannot \n17  demonstrate a “genuine, comprehensive, and reasonable” commitment to \n18 \n                                           \n19  2 Defendants also vaguely allude to “competing budgetary restraints.”  Jt. Mem. \nMot. Summ. J. 12:21.  As discussed supra, budgetary constraints alone are not sufficient \n20  evidence that requested relief is a fundamental alteration.  DOJ Olmstead Statement at \nQuestion 14; see also Frederick L. I, 364 F.3d at 495 (“a singular focus upon a state’s \n21  short-term fiscal constraints will not suffice to establish a fundamental-alteration \ndefense” (citing Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1177-78)).  Although budgetary constraints may be \n22  one of many relevant factors, specific cost concerns must be brought to the Court’s \nattention in order for that factor to have meaning.  Cf., Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1063 (noting \n23  district court’s finding that relief “would represent a forty percent increase in the State’s \nbudget for developmentally disabled services.”). \n24 \n3 For context, as of 2012 there were more than 200 1915(c) waivers serving more \n25  than 1 million individuals around the country.  The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and \nthe Uninsured, Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Programs: 2012 Update \n26  7-8 (November 2015), http://files.kff.org/attachment/report-medicaid-home-and-\ncommunity-based-services-programs-2012-data-update.  However, the existence of those \n27  waivers and the number of individuals receiving services through those waivers does not, \nwithout more, shed light on whether states have effectively deinstitutionalized \n28  individuals with disabilities.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 198   Filed 09/16/16   Page 8 of 9   Page ID #:29420\n \n1  deinstitutionalization, and the record is virtually silent on any plans for the future.  See \n2  Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1067; Frederick L. I, 364 F.3d at 500.  The NF/AH Waiver is an \n3  aspect of California’s broader plan to promote deinstitutionalization and integration, to \n4  be sure.  Jt. Statement of Uncontroverted Facts P27, ECF No. 195 (undisputed that “the \n5  NF/AH waiver is one of the things in California’s Olmstead plan”).  But, in pointing \n6  only to the number of individuals served on that Waiver, Defendants have not \n7  demonstrated how the existence of the Waiver is part of an effectively working plan to \n8  reduce Plaintiffs’ risk of institutionalization.  Defendants’ showing is particularly \n9  insufficient here, where Plaintiffs argue that the cost limitations contained within this \n10  purportedly effective plan are the very mechanism placing them at risk of \n11  institutionalization. Cf. Steimel, 823 F.3d at 917 (state could not assert fundamental \n12  alteration defense because “instead of moving people with disabilities to more integrated \n13  settings, the state’s plan is making their living arrangements less integrated”) (emphasis \n14  in original).  \n15  The United States encourages the Court to assess Plaintiffs’ motion in light of the \n16  principles set forth above and those set forth in its SOI and Supplemental SOI. \n17   \n   \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 198   Filed 09/16/16   Page 9 of 9   Page ID #:29421\n \n1  Dated: September 16, 2016    Respectfully submitted,  \n             \n2 \nEILEEN M.

R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15;\n21 Willis v. Pac. Mar. Ass’n, 244 F.3d 675, 684 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2001), and concludes as follows.\n22 BACKGROUND1\n23 On October 23, 2014, plaintiffs filed this action against DHCS and then-DHCS Director\n24 Douglas.  (See Dkt. 4, Complaint).  Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on January 29, 2015\n25 (Dkt. 26, “FAC”) and the operative Second Amended Complaint on July 7, 2015.  (Dkt. 70, “SAC”).\n26\n27\n     1    Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, the court recounts only the facts\n28 relevant to the instant Motions.\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 2 of 19   Page ID\n #:35090\n1 In the SAC, plaintiffs assert three claims against defendants for violations of: (1) the Americans\n2 with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.; (2) the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §§\n3 701, et seq.; and (3) California Government Code §§ 11135 and 11139.  (See id. at ¶¶ 124-153). \n4 Among other things, the SAC seeks a permanent injunction, and a court order “requiring\n5 Defendants to . . . [a]uthorize Medi-Cal funded services for Plaintiffs through the Nursing\n6 Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver [“NF/AH Waiver”] or other appropriate Home and Community-Based\n7 Services Waivers . . . to enable them to receive medically necessary services commensurate with\n8 their needs [and to] [a]mend their policies and procedures consistent with the injunction above,\n9 and to require that Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver participants be provided with medically\n10 necessary Medi-Cal in-home services, commensurate with their assessed needs, and as identified\n11 by their treating physicians, consistent with federal cost neutrality requirements[;]” along with costs\n12 and attorney’s fees.  (Dkt. 70, SAC at § IX).\n13 On January 12, 2017, defendants filed an Ex Parte Application [to] Dismiss[] the SAC as\n14 Moot (Dkt. 343, “Ex Parte Application”), asserting that “[t]he NF/AH Waiver was amended in\n15 November 2016 to delete the complained of cost limitations and to allow approval of waiver\n16 services based on medical necessity[,]” (Dkt. 343-1, Memorandum of Points and Authorities in\n17 Support of Ex Parte Application (“Ex Parte Memo”) at 1).  According to defendants, “because\n18 Plaintiffs have already received all of the requested relief[,]” the case should be dismissed.  (Dkt.\n19 343, Ex Parte Application at 2).  The court denied the Ex Parte Application, (see Dkt. 345, Court’s\n20 Order of January 16, 2018), and the parties filed a stipulation to dismiss the case on February 7,\n21 2018.  (See Dkt. 346, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal).  The court held a status conference on\n22 February 22, 2018, and ordered the parties to revise the stipulation or submit supplemental\n23 briefing in light of the fact that Thomas has a guardian ad litem.  (See Dkt. 350, Court’s Order of\n24 February 22, 2019).  The parties were unable to agree on a revised stipulation.  As a result,\n25 plaintiffs filed a request for voluntary dismissal without prejudice on March 14, 2018.  (See Dkt.\n26 352, Petition for Dismissal without Prejudice []).\n27 / / /\n28\n2\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 3 of 19   Page ID\n #:35091\n1 DISCUSSION\n2 State law applies to the right to recover attorney’s fees for state law claims in a federal court\n3 action, even when there is a federal corollary.  See Indep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal. v. Kent, 909 F.3d\n4 272, 282-83 (9th Cir. 2018) (“Because the § 1085 Write is a state law cause of action, we look to\n5 California law to determine whether attorneys’ fees are available to Appellants under § 1021.5 of\n6 the California Code of Civil Procedure\"); Bass v. First Pac. Networks, Inc., 219 F.3d 1052, 1055\n7 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[A] federal court exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims\n8 is bound to apply the law of the forum state to the same extent as if it were exercising its diversity\n9 jurisdiction.”); Egelhoff v. Pac. Lightwave, 2013 WL 12125913, *1 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (“When\n10 exercising  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  state  law  claims,  federal  courts  must  determine\n11 attorneys’ fees by applying state law.”) (footnote omitted); see, e.g., Parks v. Eastwood Ins.\n12 Servs., Inc., 2005 WL 6007834,*2-3 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (awarding  fees where the plaintiffs’ state\n13 unfair competition claims derived from their federal Fair Labor Standards Act claim), aff’d in\n14 relevant part, 240 F.Appx. 172, 175 (9th Cir. 2007).  Under California law, the “general rule” is that\n15 “parties in litigation pay their own attorney’s fees.”  Friends of Spring St. v. Nevada City, 33\n16 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1107 (2019); see Kirby v. Immoos Fire Prot., Inc., 53 Cal.4th 1244, 1248 (2012)\n17 (“In general, [California law allows] a prevailing party [to] recover attorney’s fees when a statute\n18 or an agreement of the parties provides for fee shifting.”).  However, California Code of Civil\n19 Procedure § 1021.5 (“§ 1021.5”) “is an exception to that rule.  Derived from the judicially crafted\n20 private attorney general doctrine, section 1021.5 is aimed at encouraging litigants to pursue\n21 meritorious public interest litigation vindicating important rights and benefitting a broad swath of\n22 citizens, and it achieves this aim by compensating successful litigants with an award of attorney’s\n23 fees.”  Friends of Spring St., 33 Cal.App.5th at 1107 (internal quotation marks and internal\n24 brackets omitted).\n25 Section 1021.5 “can be divided in the following separate elements.  A . . . court may award\n26 attorney fees to (1) a successful party in any action (2) that has resulted in the enforcement of an\n27 important right affecting the public interest if (3) a significant benefit has been conferred on the\n28 general public or a large class of persons, (4) private enforcement is necessary because no public\n3\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 4 of 19   Page ID\n #:35092\n1 entity or official pursued enforcement or litigation, (5) the financial burden of private enforcement\n2 is such as to make a fee award appropriate, and (6) in the interests of justice the fees should not\n3 be paid out of the recovery.”  People v. Investco Mgmt. & Dev. LLC, 22 Cal.App.5th 443, 456\n4 (2018) (“Investco”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see In re Conservatorship of Whitley, 50\n5 Cal.4th 1206, 1214 (2010) (“Whitley”).  \n6 Here, defendants do not dispute the factors relating to the necessity and financial burden\n7 of private enforcement.  (See, generally, Dkt. 360, Defendants’ Opposition[] (“Defs’ Opp.”)).  Also,\n8 whether the fees should “be paid out of the recovery, if any[,]” Cal Code Civ. P. § 1021.5, is not\n9 at issue here, as plaintiffs did not seek monetary recovery in this lawsuit.  (See, generally, Dkt. 70,\n10 SAC); Charlebois v. Angels Baseball LP, 993 F.Supp.2d 1109, 1114 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (“[B]ecause\n11 this action was for injunctive relief alone, no fees can be paid out of the recovery.”).  Thus, only\n12 the first three factors are at issue. \n13 I. SUCCESSFUL PARTY.\n14 The “critical fact” in determining whether a party was “successful” under § 1021.5 “is the\n15 impact of the action, not the manner of its resolution.”  Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 34\n16 Cal.4th 553, 566 (2005); see Henderson v. J.M. Smucker Co., 2013 WL 3146774, *4 (C.D. Cal.\n17 2013).  “Under this broad, pragmatic view[,] . . . a plaintiff need not obtain a judgment in its favor\n18 to be a successful party. . . .  Rather, a plaintiff is a successful party whenever it obtains the relief\n19 sought in its lawsuit, regardless of whether that relief is obtained through a voluntary change in\n20 the defendant’s conduct, through a settlement, or otherwise.”  Hogar v. Cmty. Dev. Comm. of the\n21 City of Escondido, 157 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1365 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted);\n22 Investco, 22 Cal.App.5th at 458 (“To determine whether a party is ‘successful,’ courts look at the\n23 outcome the parties sought in commencing the action, the situation before the party commenced\n24 the suit, and the situation today.”).  To “obtain attorney fees without . . . a judicially recognized\n25 change in the legal relationship between the parties, a plaintiff must establish that (1) the lawsuit\n26 was a catalyst motivating the defendants to provide the primary relief sought; (2) that the lawsuit\n27 had merit and achieved its catalytic effect by threat of victory, not by dint of nuisance and threat\n28 of expense . . . and, (3) that the plaintiffs reasonably attempted to settle the litigation prior to filing\n4\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 5 of 19   Page ID\n #:35093\n1 the lawsuit.”  Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los Angeles, 34 Cal.4th 604, 608 (2004).  The catalyst\n2 theory exists to deter defendants from “litigat[ing] tenaciously, then avoid[ing] paying [plaintiffs’\n3 counsel’s] fees by voluntarily providing relief before a court order is entered.”  Graham, 34 Cal.4th\n4 at 574.\n5 A. Whether Suit Was a Catalyst.\n6 “To be a catalyst, the lawsuit must have been ‘a substantial causal factor’ contributing to\n7 Defendant’s conduct, though the lawsuit need not be the only cause of Defendant’s conduct.”\n8 Henderson, 2013 WL 3146774, at *4 (quoting Graham, 34 Cal.4th at 573).  “A causal connection\n9 between the lawsuit and the result will be found if the defendant’s voluntary action was induced\n10 by the plaintiff’s legal action . . . or when the plaintiff’s action was a material factor or contributed\n11 in a significant way to the result achieved.”  Cal. Common Cause v. Duffy, 200 Cal.App.3d 730,\n12 743 (1987) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  “[T]he chronology of events may raise an\n13 inference that the litigation was the catalyst for the relief[.]”  Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1366; see\n14 Sablan v. Dep’t of Fin., 856 F.2d 1317, 1326 (9th Cir. 1988) (“Clues to the provocative effects of\n15 the plaintiffs’ legal efforts are often best gleaned from the chronology of events[.]”) (internal\n16 quotation marks omitted).\n17 Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ lawsuit was not the catalyst because “plaintiffs failed to\n18 obtain the actual relief requested in the operative SAC[,]” (Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 15;  id. at 17),\n19 and because defendants “had already decided to amend the NF/AH Waiver to remove individual\n20 cost  limits  prior  to  the  lawsuit  being  filed[,]”  (id.  at  4),  “based  on  input  received  from  all\n21 stakeholders[.]”  (Id. at 1).  According to defendants, “[t]he lawsuit was not a consideration, let\n22 alone a substantial  factor, for removing individual cost limits” in 2017. (Id. at 1).  The court is not\n23 persuaded.\n24 As a preliminary matter, defendants’ argument that plaintiffs failed to achieve their primary\n25 goals is not well-taken.  Defendants previously asserted in a filing before this court that “Plaintiffs\n26 have already received all of the requested relief.”  (Dkt. 343, Ex Parte Application at 2).  Given\n27 defendants’ previous assertion that plaintiffs received all of their requested relief, defendants\n28 cannot now directly contradict their own position.  See, e.g., Hamilton v. State Farm Fire & Cas.\n5\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 6 of 19   Page ID\n #:35094\n1 Co., 270 F.3d 778, 782 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that precludes\n2 a party from gaining an advantage by asserting one position, and then later seeking an advantage\n3 by taking a clearly inconsistent position.”).  In any event, as defendants acknowledge, plaintiffs\n4 obtained the relief they sought in the instant action when defendants eliminated the individual cost\n5 limits in the renewed Waiver program, shifted to authorizing Waiver services based on medical\n6 necessity, and formalized their policies and procedures regarding these changes.  (See Dkt. 343-\n7 1, Ex Parte Memo at 1, 3, 8-10 (“Plaintiffs may request and receive all medically necessary waiver\n8 services as covered under the terms of the Waiver, without any application of cost limits.”); Dkt.\n9 360, Defs’ Opp. at 15-17 (acknowledging that plaintiffs’ SAC sought an end to “arbitrary NF/AH\n10 Waiver cost caps” and the provision of “medically necessary Medi-Cal in home services” for\n11 Waiver participants “commensurate with their assessed needs, and as identified by their treating\n12 physicians, consistent with federal cost neutrality requirements”)).\n13 Defendants admitted in their July 2015 Answer to plaintiffs’ SAC that the NF/AH Waiver was\n14 subject to cost limitations, (Dkt. 71, Answer at ¶ 6) (“admit[ting] that the allowable Medi-Cal costs\n15 for in-home services for an individual are subject to a limitation for each available level of care, as\n16 specified in the applicable NF/AH Waiver”), and two and a half years later – in January 2018 –\n17 conceded that plaintiffs obtained all of the primary relief they were seeking in this action, i.e., “the\n18 individual cost limits [were] removed from the NF/AH Waiver.”  (Dkt. 343-1, Ex Parte Memo at 3;\n19 Dkt. 343, Ex Parte Application at 2).  Under the circumstances, the chronology of events\n20 establishes a rebuttable presumption that plaintiffs’ action was the catalyst for the changes in the\n21 waiver program made by defendants.2  See Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1366-67 (“When, after\n22 litigation is initiated, a defendant has voluntarily provided the relief a plaintiff is seeking, the\n23 chronology of events may raise an inference that the litigation was the catalyst for the relief.”); In\n24\n     2  The fact that plaintiffs achieved their primary goals – even assuming they did not achieve all\n25\nof their requested relief – is sufficient to render plaintiffs a successful party under § 1021.5.  See,\ne.g., Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1363 (affirming fee award where trial court found that “although\n26\n[plaintiff] did not achieve all of its goals, it was successful in attaining its primary goals”);\n27 Tipton-Whittingham, 34 Cal.4th at 608 (noting that catalyst theory “does not require a judicially\nrecognized change in the legal relationship between the parties as a prerequisite for obtaining\n28\nattorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n6\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 7 of 19   Page ID\n #:35095\n1 re Taco Bell Wage & Hour Actions, 222 F.Supp.3d 813, 825 (E.D. Cal. 2016) (“[W]ithin several\n2 months of this lawsuit being filed [defendant] changed its . . . policy . . . to comply with California\n3 law.  The timing of the change . . . is circumstantial evidence from which the Court finds that this\n4 lawsuit was the reason that [defendant] changed its . . . policy.”); (see also Dkt. 355, Pls’ Motion\n5 at 12-16) (outlining chronology of events in detail).\n6 Because defendants implemented plaintiffs’ primary goals after litigation commenced, the\n7 burden shifts to defendants to rebut the inference of causation by introducing “convincing\n8 contemporaneous evidence[,]”   MacDonald v. Ford Motor Co., 142 F.Supp.3d 884, 894 (N.D. Cal.\n9 2015), that they had a pre-existing “concrete project or plan” to implement the changes to the\n10 Waiver  program  before  this  litigation  began.    See  Henderson,  2013  WL  3146774  at  *6. \n11 Defendants contend that “the Department had already decided to amend the NF/AH Waiver to\n12 remove individual cost limits prior to the lawsuit being filed,” (Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 4; see Dkt.\n13 354, Defs’ Motion at 4-10), citing the following evidence: (1) a September 2014 email exchange\n14 between Deborah Doctor (“Doctor”) and DHCS; (2) a September 2014 email exchange between\n15 John Shen, then-Division Chief for DHCS’s Long Term Care Division, and the Centers for\n16 Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”); and (3) statements from Jennifer Chmura (“Chmura”),\n17 DHCS’s in-house attorney, and Sarah Brooks (“Brooks”), DHCS’s Deputy Director, Health Care\n18 Delivery Systems.  (See Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 6-7).  Putting aside the fact that defendants\n19 previously conceded that plaintiffs obtained all the relief they requested through this lawsuit,\n20 defendants’ contentions are unpersuasive.\n21 With regard to the 2014 email exchanges, they are irrelevant to the issues in this litigation. \n22 Plaintiffs’ claims in this action challenged the denial of and/or reduction in medically necessary\n23 Waiver services based on the cost limits for individuals receiving services.  (See Dkt. 70, SAC at\n24 ¶¶ 130-133, 142-144, 150-152, 158-19; see also Dkt. 355-2, Exhibit (“Exh.”) D, DHCS Decision\n25 on Thomas’s claim; id., Exh. G, DHCS Notice of Action re: Benison; id., Exh. K, IHO Summary for\n26 Palomares).  The 2014 email exchanges, on the other hand, relate to problems with the cost cap\n27 raised by the FLSA, which affected hourly compensation for home care providers due to payment\n28 of overtime, without any corresponding increase in the hours of authorized services for Waiver\n7\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 8 of 19   Page ID\n #:35096\n1 recipients. (See Dkt. 355-3, Declaration of Elissa Gershon in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion []\n2 (“Gershon Decl.”), Exh. P, Deposition of Rebecca Schupp (“Schupp Depo.”), volume (“v.”) 1 at\n3 P155-P157; Dkt. 359-1, Declaration of Elissa Gershon in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion []\n4 (“Gershon Opp. Decl.”) at ¶ 14; Dkt. 361, Declaration of Jennifer Chmura (“Chmura Decl.”), Exh.\n5 A, September 17, 2014, Email from John Shen to Deborah Doctor (stating that DHCS had\n6 scheduled a conference call to “(1) assure [stakeholders] that overtime cost (or change in local\n7 IHSS wages) would not be a basis to change [NF/AH Waiver participants’] care plan and services,\n8 even if the cost of their services is beyond the cost cap; and (2) to propose DHCS working with\n9 waiver participants and their families on managing the overtime so that they would not trigger\n10 provisions in SB855 that would disrupt their . . . provider network”)).  Moreover, the changes to\n11 FLSA had no effect on licensed nursing services, which are the primary Waiver services plaintiffs\n12 Thomas  and  Benison  receive.    (See  Dkt.  355-3,  Exh.  P,  Schupp  Depo.  v.1  at  P-166  &\n13 P-155-P-157).  Thus, defendants’ proposal to address FLSA cost cap issues, and the 2014 emails\n14 discussing those issues, had nothing to do with this case.  But even if those discussions were\n15 relevant to plaintiffs’ claims, they still would not rebut the presumption that plaintiffs’ suit was a\n16 material factor leading to the removal of the cost limits because, as DHCS’s Rule 30(b)(6)\n17 designee  and  then-Chief  of  the  Long-Term  Care  Division  Rebecca  Schupp  noted,  DHCS\n18 abandoned these discussions with CMS on January 20, 2015, before plaintiffs even filed the FAC. \n19 (See Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Decl. at ¶¶ 21-22; Dkt. 355-3, Exh. O, Schupp Depo. v.2 at O-101-\n20 O-102, O-112-O-114, O-117-O-118, O-120, O-121-O-122; Dkt. 26, FAC; Dkt. 360-3, Declaration\n21 of Sarah Brooks (“Brooks Decl.”) at ¶¶ 5-7).\n22 Further, Chmura’s statement that “[t]he Waiver amendment process that the Department\n23 started in 2014 continued into 2016[,]” (Dkt. 361, Chmura Decl. at ¶ 4), and Brooks’s statement\n24 that “the Department already had begun the process of converting from individual cost limits” prior\n25 to the litigation, (see Dkt. 360-3, Brooks Decl. at ¶ 13), are insufficient to overcome the extensive\n26 evidence that plaintiffs’ action was the catalyst for the Waiver changes.  As an initial matter,\n27 defendants offer no evidence to support the self-serving, conclusory statements in the two\n28 declarations.  (See, generally, Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp.).   With respect to Brooks, she testified during\n8\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 9 of 19   Page ID\n #:35097\n1 her deposition that she did not assume responsibility for any aspect of the Waiver program until\n2 June 2015.  (See Dkt. 364-1, Declaration of Elissa Gershon in Support of Plaintiffs’ Reply []\n3 (“Gershon Reply Decl.”), Exh. C, Deposition of Sarah Brooks (“Brooks Depo.”) at C-35-C-36).  In\n4 other words, there is little, if any, foundation for Brooks’s assertions, (Dkt. 360-3, Brooks Decl. at\n5 ¶¶ 4 & 9), regarding the DHCS’s motivations.  Under these circumstances,  particularly in light of\n6 the  extensive  contrary  evidence,  the  court  “[is]  not  required  to  believe  a  staff  member’s\n7 second-hand report” about the reason for the change.  See Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1367;\n8 MacDonald, 142 F.Supp.3d at 893 (Defendant “has not offered declarations from the final decision\n9 makers who actually recommended and approved the 2014 recall.  What role this lawsuit played\n10 in their decisions is unknown.”). \n11 Finally,  defendants’  argument  ignores  evidence  –  including  statements  made  and\n12 documents produced by defendants themselves – that undermines their position and the credibility\n13 of the evidence they rely upon.  For example, defendants admitted to CMS in writing that “[t]here\n14 were no changes to the waiver application as a result of the public input” it had received.  (See\n15 Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Decl. at ¶ 37; Dkt. 355-4, Exh. V, HCBA Waiver at V-343).  Also, despite the\n16 ongoing Waiver Renewal process, defendants did not publicly raise the topic of cost limits until\n17 April 20, 20163 – nearly a year and a half after this lawsuit was filed – and even then they made\n18 no commitments about whether or how they would address the cost limits in the Waiver Renewal. \n19 (See Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Decl. at ¶¶ 26-33; Dkt. 355-3, Exh. R, NF/AH Waiver Renewal Technical\n20 Workgroup Meeting #3 [] Minutes, April 20, 2016, at R-226 & R-232; id., Exh. S, NF/AH Waiver\n21 Renewal Technical Workgroup Meeting #3 Powerpoint Presentation, April 20, 2016, at S-286,\n22 S-292,  S-300,  S-302  (suggesting  that  comprehensive  care  management  can  ensure  cost\n23 neutrality);  id.,  Exh.  T,  NF/AH  Waiver  Renewal  Technical  Workgroup  Feedback  vs.\n24 Recommendations at T-317-T-318).  Finally, and very telling of defendants’ true motives in this\n25 case, is DHCS’s refusal to support proposed legislation in 2015 that would have eliminated the\n26\n     3    Defendants first revealed their intention to seek an amendment to the Waiver to the court\n27\non March 30, 2016, in their Reply in support of their Motion to Dismiss and in their supplemental\n28 memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment.  (See Dkt. 117, Reply in\nSupport of Motion to Dismiss [] at 1-3; Dkt. 118, Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss).\n9\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 10 of 19   Page ID\n #:35098\n1 individual cost limits.  (See Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Dec. ¶ 50; Dkt. 355-6, Exhibit BB, California State\n2 Assembly Bill 1518 Documents).  Defendants’ claim that they intended to remove the cost limits\n3 as early 2014, (see Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 4-8), is belied by their refusal to support the 2015\n4 legislation.\n5 Even assuming defendants had not conceded that plaintiffs obtained all of the primary relief\n6 they sought, and notwithstanding defendants’ contentions that they intended to remove the cost\n7 limits as early as 2014, the fact remains that defendants did not eliminate the cost limits until this\n8 litigation was well underway.  Defendants’ first unqualified statement that they were modifying the\n9 cost neutrality approach was on June 10, 2016, shortly after this court denied their first Motion to\n10 Dismiss.  (See Dkt. 355-3, Exh. U, DHCS NF/AH Waiver Renewal Proposal, June 10, 2016, at U-\n11 329) (“The State is proposing to change from an individual cost limit to an individual cost limit that\n12 calculates cost neutrality in the aggregate across all Waiver participants.”); Dkt. 139, Court’s Order\n13 of April 27, 2016 (“Order Re: MTD”)).  Indeed, DHCS’s own budget documents do not reference\n14 a removal of cost limits until November 2016; the cost estimates in November 2015 and May 2016\n15 simply describe the fiscal impact of the impending Waiver Renewal as “indeterminate.”  (Dkt. 355-\n16 1, Gershon Decl. at ¶¶ 51-55; Dkt. 355-6, Exhibits CC-FF); see Henderson, 2013 WL 3146774 at\n17 *5. (“Evidence of a general goal [to improve behavior] does not rebut” the inference that the\n18 litigation was a catalyst.).\n19 In short, the evidence proffered by defendants is insufficient to “rebut the inference from\n20 the chronology of events and show that Plaintiffs’ lawsuit did not catalyze” DHCS’s decision to\n21 eliminate the Waiver cost limits. See MacDonald, 142 F.Supp.3d at 894; Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th\n22 at 1367 (“Given this chronology of events, the trial court could reasonably conclude that overall\n23 [plaintiff’s] litigation was successful.”).\n24 B. Whether Plaintiffs’ Lawsuit Was “Frivolous, Unreasonable, or Groundless.”\n25 Under California’s catalyst doctrine, the court must determine “that the lawsuit is not\n26 frivolous, unreasonable or groundless[.]”  Graham, 34 Cal.4th at 575 (internal quotation marks\n27 omitted).  A plaintiff must also show “that the lawsuit had merit and achieved its catalytic effect by\n28 threat of victory, not by dint of nuisance and threat of expense[.]”  Tipton-Whittingham, 34 Cal.4th\n10\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 11 of 19   Page ID\n #:35099\n1 at 608.  While the court should review the factual record, the determination is “not a final decision\n2 on the merits but a determination at a minimum that the questions of fact and law are grave and\n3 difficult.”  Graham, 34 Cal.4th at 575-76 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n4 Defendants contend that plaintiffs’ suit “had no merit” because plaintiffs “have not been” at\n5 serious risk of institutionalization, (Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 18-21), and because the Waiver\n6 program was “operating effectively” prior to the litigation.  (Id. at 22-23).  Defendants’ contentions\n7 are utterly meritless and border on the frivolous.\n8 As an initial matter, defendants never filed a motion for summary judgment in this case. \n9 (See, generally, Dkt.).  If plaintiffs’ case truly had no merit, then defendants should have done so. \n10 What’s more, if the Waiver program was “operating effectively” prior to the litigation, (Dkt. 360,\n11 Defs’ Opp. at 22-23), then it was incumbent upon defendants to explain why they ultimately\n12 changed the Waiver program to remove the cost limits.  See Graham, 34 Cal.4th at 573 (“[T]he\n13 defendant in such cases knows better than anyone why it made the decision that granted the\n14 plaintiff the relief sought, and the defendant is in the best position to either concede that the\n15 plaintiff was a catalyst or to document why the plaintiff was not[.]”).  This they did not do.  (See,\n16 generally, Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp.).\n17 In addition, defendants’ argument that plaintiffs were not at serious risk of institutionalization\n18 misses the mark as it does not directly address the gravamen of plaintiffs’ lawsuit, which is that\n19 defendants arbitrarily set individual cost limits for medically necessary services available through\n20 the Waiver program and that those cost limits were significantly lower than the average cost for\n21 providing comparable care in an institution.  (See Dkt. 70, SAC at ¶¶ 5-9 & 43-48).  Rather than\n22 addressing the merits of the individual cost limits, defendants attempt to re-frame the issue as\n23 whether plaintiffs were ever at a serious risk of institutionalization.  (See Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at\n24 18-21).  But defendants’ re-framing of the issue simply begs the question with respect to the\n25 legality of the individual cost limits. \n26 In any event, even assuming defendants’ argument directly addressed what is at issue in\n27 this case, the argument is without merit.  To support their argument, defendants cite a number of\n28 their own facts from the parties’ Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (Dkt. 195, “SUF”) relating to\n11\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 12 of 19   Page ID\n #:35100\n1 plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.  (See Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. 18-21).  However, many of the\n2 facts were disputed by plaintiffs during the summary judgment proceedings, (see, e.g., Dkt. 195,\n3 SUF at D43, D47, D48, D61, D66, D67, D68, D74), and defendants mishcharacterize many of the\n4 facts and underlying evidence.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 18) (citing Dkt. 195, SUF at D43\n5 as evidence that “Mr. Thomas had been well cared for and had not been at any serious risk of\n6 institutionalization during the time that he had been enrolled in the NF/AH Waiver” whereas D43,\n7 which was disputed by plaintiffs, actually states, “Since returning home, Mr. Thomas has been well\n8 cared for.”).  In addition, defendants mischaracterize this Court’s Order Re: Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n9 Summary Judgment, (see Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 21), when they assert that the court “concluded\n10 that the Defendants had offered evidence showing that plaintiffs have been well cared for and\n11 have remained safely in their homes at all times while receiving their currently authorized\n12 services.”  (Id. (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted); see Dkt. 322, Court’s Order of\n13 June 5, 2017 (“MSJ Order”) at 9).  Contrary to defendants’ assertion, the court did not accept\n14 defendants’ claim that plaintiffs “face no risk of institutionalization” based on the services DHCS\n15 authorized a year after this litigation commenced.  (See Dkt. 322, MSJ Order at 9) (quoting\n16 defendants’ argument).  Rather, the court noted that the facts in the record – including that DHCS\n17 could rescind its authorization of services over the cost limits, that it had refused to commit to\n18 providing ongoing services, and that it lacked written policies or procedures for authorizing\n19 exceptions – “tend to show that plaintiffs are at risk of institutionalization as a result of the cost\n20 limits imposed by the Waiver program.”4  (Id. at 9).  Moreover, it’s worth noting that defendants’\n21 own expert stated that plaintiffs would be at “serious” or “high risk of institutionalization without the\n22 services they were authorized that exceeded the cost limits.”  (Dkt. 195, SUF at P186 & P189).\n23 Finally, defendants’ argument that the Waiver was “operating effectively[,]” (Dkt. 360, Defs’\n24 Opp. at 18-23), is irrelevant given that the basis of plaintiffs’ request for fees is the change in the\n25\n     4  Defendants also misrepresented the MSJ Order in connection with their argument that they\n26\ndid not violate the ADA’s integration mandate.  (See Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 23).  In making their\nargument, defendants quote from the MSJ Order, (see id.), but conspicuously omit the court’s\n27\nconcluding sentence, which expresses the court’s “serious concerns about whether the Waiver\n28 program comports with the ADA’s integration mandate[.]” (Dkt. 322, MSJ Order at 10).  In other\nwords, the court did not find or otherwise agree with defendants that plaintiffs’ case had no merit.\n12\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 13 of 19   Page ID\n #:35101\n1 Waiver program that eliminated the cost limits.  Again, if the Waiver program had been operating\n2 effectively, then defendants should have filed a motion for summary judgment.  Instead, plaintiffs\n3 filed a motion for a summary judgment because they “believed so strongly in the merits of their\n4 legal claims[.]”  (Dkt. 364, Reply at 11).  In denying plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, the\n5 court expressed “serious concerns about whether the Waiver program comports with the ADA’s\n6 integration mandate,” and concluded that there were “genuine disputes of material fact” such that\n7 summary judgment was not appropriate at that time. (See Dkt. 322, Court’s MSJ Order at 10). \n8 In short, the court finds that “the questions of law or fact [in this case] are grave and difficult[,]” and\n9 that plaintiffs’ lawsuit was “not frivolous, unreasonable or groundless[.]”5  Graham, 34 Cal.4th at\n10 575 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n11 C. Attempted Pre-litigation Settlement.\n12 The final prong of the catalyst analysis requires plaintiffs to show that they “reasonably\n13 attempted to settle the litigation prior to filing the lawsuit.”  Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1365\n14 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The bar is not high: “[l]engthy prelitigation negotiations are not\n15 required, nor is it necessary that the settlement demand be made by counsel, but a plaintiff must\n16 at least notify the defendant of its grievances and proposed remedies and give the defendant the\n17 opportunity to meet its demands within a reasonable time.”  Graham, 34 Cal.4th at 577.\n18 Defendants assert that plaintiffs did not reasonably attempt to settle, contending that\n19 plaintiffs sent only one letter prior to filing suit, and that neither the letter nor two subsequent\n20 emails to DHCS “contain[ed] sufficient information to support a claim for attorneys’ fees.”  (Dkt.\n21 360, Defs’ Opp. at 23).  \n22\n     5    Indeed, it appears that defendants’ motion to recover fees and costs may be sanctionable\n23\non the grounds that it is frivolous and unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings. \n24 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11; 28 U.S.C. § 1927 (“Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct\ncases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings\n25 in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the\nexcess costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.”); Fink\n26\nv. Gomez, 239 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Sanctions are available for a variety of types of\nwillful  actions,  including  recklessness  when  combined  with  an  additional  factor  such  as\n27\nfrivolousness, harassment, or an improper purpose.”).  However, the court need not address this\n28 issue at this time because plaintiffs will be entitled to fees for opposing defendants’ motion for\nattorney’s fees. \n13\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 14 of 19   Page ID\n #:35102\n1 Defendants’ assertions are unpersuasive and ignore the historical context preceding the\n2 filing of the instant action.  See Investco, 22 Cal.App.5th at 458 (“To determine whether a party\n3 is ‘successful,’ courts look at the outcomes the parties sought in commencing the action, the\n4 situation before the party commenced the suit, and the situation today.”).  Public interest and\n5 community organizations such as those representing plaintiffs in this matter usually attempt to\n6 address legal, social and economic concerns in a comprehensive manner that entails, at a\n7 minimum, both policy and legal advocacy.  Given the costs and resources required to litigate a\n8 case and the uncertainty of litigation, these organizations often attempt to resolve the problem\n9 informally or via the policy route by seeking to have the organization or governmental entity modify\n10 and/or change its policies and practices, either through the entity’s internal administrative\n11 procedures and/or through legislation.  The organizations representing plaintiffs in this case\n12 attempted to resolve the issues in this lawsuit informally and via the policy route for at least eight\n13 years prior to filing this lawsuit.  (See Dkt. 355, Pls’ Motion at 13-14).  In spite of stakeholder\n14 advocacy  for  at  least  eight  years,  and  despite  the  fact  that  it  apparently  recognized  the\n15 seriousness of the problem, DHCS did not increase or eliminate the cost limits.  (See Dkt. 355-1,\n16 Gershon Decl. at ¶¶ 56-57; Dkt. 355-6, Exh. GG, Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s June 29, 2006 and\n17 November 14, 2006 Letters to DHCS Re: Waiver Renewal Application; id., Exh. HH, Summary of\n18 Public Comments Re: [] Draft Waiver Application - August 2, 2006; id., Exh. II, Plaintiffs’ Counsel\n19 Waiver Renewal Process Recommendations, May 10, 2011; id., Exh. JJ, Long-Term Care\n20 Coordinating Council Position Statement Re: Waiver Renewal Process - January 8, 2007; id., Exh.\n21 KK, Plaintiffs’ Counsel NF/AH Waiver Problems and Solutions - May 12, 2014; id., Exh. EE, May\n22 2016 Estimate at EE-836).  That it took so many years for DHCS to change the Waiver program\n23 simply reflects that the organizations representing plaintiffs have the patience of Job, not that\n24 defendants were considering modifying the Waiver program.6  It was not until three years into this\n25\n26\n     6  Defendants’ argument that plaintiffs did not “provide the Department with reasonable time\nto resolve the issues” because“[a] change to the NF/AH Waiver such as removal of individual cost\n27\nlimits can only occur through the California legislature appropriating funds to cover the state\n28 funded portion of those costs[,]” (Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 24-25), is disingenuous.  If eight years\nof advocacy with DHCS for removal of cost limits on the Waivers – through two waiver renewal\n14\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 15 of 19   Page ID\n #:35103\n1 litigation that defendants eliminated the individual cost limits, authorized services based on\n2 medical necessity, and formalized their policies.  (See Dkt. 343-1, Ex Parte Memo at 1) (stating\n3 that “NF/AH Waiver was amended in November 2016” to remove “cost limitations and to allow\n4 approval of waiver services based on medical necessity”). \n5 In Cates v. Chiang, 213 Cal.App.4th 791 (2013), the California court of appeal held that the\n6 “rule [on prelitigation settlement efforts] should not be applied blindly without any consideration\n7 of whether the demand would have made any difference in the need for the lawsuit and whether \n8 the plaintiff’s motivations were directed toward seeking the relief demanded, as opposed to the\n9 recovery of attorney fees.”  Id. at 817.  Where, as here, plaintiffs have attempted over the course\n10 of several years via various policy and advocacy efforts to obtain the relief they seek in the\n11 subsequent lawsuit, (see Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Decl. at ¶¶ 56-57), a court can presume that\n12 sufficient prelitigation efforts have been made which excuse plaintiffs’ counsel from making any\n13 further prelitigation efforts on the ground that any further attempts to settle would be futile.  See\n14 Cates, 213 Cal.App.4th at 814-17; Henderson, 2013 WL 3146774, at *10 (holding that insufficient\n15 prelitigation attempt at settlement may not preclude attorney’s fees under § 1021.5 if such demand\n16 would have been futile).\n17 In any event, the record contains more than sufficient evidence that plaintiffs “reasonably\n18 attempted to settle the litigation prior to filing the lawsuit.”  Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1365\n19 (internal quotation marks omitted).  On September 22, 2014, plaintiffs’ counsel sent a demand\n20 letter to DHCS that expressed “grave concern” about the effects of the Waiver cost caps on\n21 plaintiffs, and threatened to file suit.  (See Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Decl. at ¶ 2; Dkt. 355-2, Exh. A,\n22 DRC Letter to Douglas, September 22, 2014, at A-2-A-4).  On October 20, 2014, plaintiffs’ counsel\n23\n24\ncycles – was not a “reasonable” amount of time according to defendants, see supra at § I.B., the\n25 court questions whether any amount of time would be “reasonable” by defendants’ standards.  See\nGraham, 34 Cal.4th at 577 (defendants need only be put on notice of “[plaintiffs’] grievances and\n26\nproposed remedies” and provided with “the opportunity to meet [plaintiffs’] demands within a\nreasonable time”).  Moreover, as stated earlier, if DHCS had intended to remove cost limits, and\n27\nlegislative approval was required to fund the removal of the those limits, then DHCS would have\n28 supported a 2015 bill that would have removed individual cost limits.  (See Dkt. 355-1, Gershon\nDecl. at ¶ 50; id., Exh. BB, California State Assembly Bill 1518 Documents, 2015).\n15\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 16 of 19   Page ID\n #:35104\n1 followed up with an email to DHCS’s then-director Douglas that “welcom[ed] the opportunity to\n2 meet with [Douglas] to resolve the issues in the case[.]”  (Dkt. 355-2, Exh. B, DRC Email to\n3 Douglas, October 20, 2014, at B-5).  Plaintiffs’ counsel also sent a courtesy copy of the Complaint\n4 to Douglas on October 20, 2014, but did not serve it, so that the parties could engage in\n5 settlement discussions.  (See Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Decl. at ¶ 3).  For nearly two months, from\n6 October 20, 2014, through December 17, 2014, the parties discussed “possible resolution to the\n7 matter[,]” but defendants stopped responding to plaintiffs’ counsel, and never responded to their\n8 emails dated December 1, 11, or 14, 2014.  (See Dkt. 355-1, Gershon Decl. at ¶ 4; Dkt. 364-1,\n9 Gershon Reply Decl. at ¶ 2).  In light of the foregoing, the court finds that plaintiffs “reasonably\n10 attempted to settle the case before litigation[,]” Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1365 (internal quotation\n11 marks omitted), and/or that any further attempts to settle would have been futile.  See Cates, 213\n12 Cal.App.4th at 814-17 (affirming conclusions that “a prelitigation demand would have been futile”\n13 and  accordingly,  plaintiff  “was  not  barred  from  recovering  section  1021.5  attorney  fees”); \n14 Henderson, 2013 WL 3146774, at *10 (holding that insufficient prelitigation attempt at settlement\n15 may not preclude attorney’s fees under § 1021.5 if such demand would have been futile).\n16 II. ENFORCEMENT OF AN IMPORTANT RIGHT AFFECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND\n17 WHETHER A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT WAS CONFERRED ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC\n18 OR A LARGE CLASS OF PERSONS.\n19 With respect to the remaining two § 1021.5 factors, defendants respond to plaintiffs’\n20 contentions in one paragraph, (see Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 17), asserting that “[t]here is no\n21 evidence that this lawsuit forced any removal of individual cost limits”; “[p]rior to the removal of\n22 individual cost limits, the Department had authorized medically necessary Waiver services for\n23 approximately four hundred Waiver participants, even though their Waiver services exceeded\n24 individual cost limits”; and “[t]his case was not a class action[.]”  (Id.).  Defendants’ assertions are\n25 unpersuasive.\n26 First, with respect to the “important right” element, the court, “in its discretion must\n27 realistically assess the litigation and determine, from a practical perspective, whether or not the\n28 action served to vindicate an important right so as to justify an attorney fee award under section\n16\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 17 of 19   Page ID\n #:35105\n1 1021.5.”  Maria P. v. Riles, 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1291 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In\n2 determining what constitutes an important right, courts should “ascertain the strength or social\n3 importance of the right involved . . . in terms of its relationship to the achievement of fundamental\n4 legislative goals.”  Cty. of Colusa v. Cal. Wildlife Conservation Bd., 145 Cal.App.4th 637, 652\n5 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, there is no question that plaintiffs’ action enforced\n6 important rights such as the right to be free from disability discrimination and the right to medical\n7 benefits.  See, e.g., id. (“[T]he private attorney doctrine may find proper application in litigation\n8 involving,  for  example,  racial  discrimination,  the  rights  of  mental  patients,  legislative\n9 reapportionment and, most significantly for the instant case, environmental protection.”); Green\n10 v. Obledo, 29 Cal.3d 126, 145 (1981) (“There can be no question that the proper calculation of\n11 [welfare] benefits is a matter of public right[.]”); Martinez v. City of Maywood, 2009 WL 10670099,\n12 *5 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (“Plaintiffs bring the present case to seek enforcement of their right to equal\n13 access and protection from discrimination based on disability, which is an important right affecting\n14 the public interest, from which the general public will benefit.”); Samantha C. v. State Dep’t of Dev.\n15 Servs., 207 Cal.App.4th 71, 80-81 (2012) (successful litigation correcting erroneous statutory\n16 interpretation of eligibility criteria for regional centers serving thousands of Californians with\n17 developmental disabilities “resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public\n18 interest”).  Thus, plaintiffs have easily met their burden to prove that an important right affecting\n19 the public interest was at stake. \n20 Second, the significant benefit “that will justify an attorney fee award need not represent\n21 a tangible asset or a concrete gain but, in some cases, may be recognized simply from the\n22 effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy.”  Investco, 22 Cal.App.5th at 465\n23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, “the extent of the public benefit need not be great\n24 to justify an attorney fee award.”  RiverWatch v. Cty. of San Diego Dep’t of Envtl. Health, 175\n25 Cal.App.4th 768, 781 (2009).  In assessing this factor, the court should “determine the significance\n26 of the benefit, as well as the size of the class receiving benefit, from a realistic assessment, in light\n27 of all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a particular case.”  Investco,\n28 22 Cal.App.5th at 465 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n17\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 18 of 19   Page ID\n #:35106\n1 Defendants assert that no significant benefit has been conferred on the general public or\n2 a large class, because this case was not a class action.  (See Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 17).\n3 However, defendants cite no authority that a certified class is a prerequisite to an award of\n4 attorney’s fees under § 1021.5.  (See, generally, Dkt. 360, Defs’ Opp. at 17).  In any event, “[a]\n5 class or representative action is not necessary to establish a significant benefit.”  Richard M. Pearl,\n6 California Attorney Fee Awards § 3.58 (CEB March 2018) (emphasis in original).  “Code of Civil\n7 Procedure section 1021.5 requires that the action result in a significant benefit to the general\n8 public or a large class of persons.  Thus, there need not be a significant benefit to many plaintiffs,\n9 but a significant benefit to many persons, whether plaintiffs or not.”  Nw. Energetic Servs., LLC v.\n10 Cal. Franchise Tax Bd., 159 Cal.App.4th 841, 876 (2008).  Here, according to defendants’ own\n11 estimates, the removal of the individual cost limits will potentially affect thousands of Waiver\n12 participants.  (See Dkt. 355-4, Exh. V at V-376) (Waiver serves over 7,000 individuals and by 2021\n13 will serve almost 10,000).  Thus, the requirement of a “large” number affected persons is satisfied. \n14 See Press v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 34 Cal.3d 311, 321 (1983) (indicating that 3,000 affected\n15 signatories to petitions would satisfy “large class” requirement of § 1021.5).\n16 Finally, defendants’ contention that “[p]rior to the removal of individual cost limits, the\n17 Department had authorized medically necessary Waiver services for approximately four hundred\n18 participants, even though their Waiver services exceeded individual cost limits[,]” (Dkt. 360, Defs’\n19 Opp. at 17), does not undermine the significant benefit obtained by plaintiffs.  The court has\n20 previously rejected defendants’ ad hoc exception process as being inadequate.  (See Dkt. 322,\n21 MSJ Order at 9 (the facts that DHCS “could, at any time, rescind its letters to plaintiffs authorizing\n22 medically necessary services above the Waiver’s cost limits,” and that “Defendants have no\n23 written policy or process for authorizing exceptions to the cost ceilings” “tend to show that plaintiffs\n24 are at risk of institutionalization” in spite of the Waiver exception program) (internal quotation\n25 marks omitted); see also Dkt. 112, Department of Justice Statement of Interest at 6 (indicating\n26 that, despite their ad hoc exception process, “Defendants have not implement[ed] any means of\n27 ensuring that individuals who need that exceptional care to avoid institutionalization actually\n28 receive it”) (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis in original); Dkt. 359-1, Gershon Opp.\n18\n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 368   Filed 05/30/19   Page 19 of 19   Page ID\n #:35107\n1 Decl. at ¶¶ 17-19 & Exh. C, Decision in Pearl Helmuth v. Jennifer Kent, March 23, 2018, at C-16-\n2 C26 (despite daughter’s repeated requests for an exception, 94-year-old Waiver participant denied\n3 sufficient Waiver services based on the cost limits as late as December 2016)). \n4 In short, having conducted a realistic assessment of all the pertinent circumstances in this\n5 case, the court readily concludes that the elimination of the cost limits conferred a significant\n6 benefit for potentially thousands of people.  The elimination of cost limits will ensure that Waiver\n7 participants will not have to resort to litigation to secure needed services and that they will be able\n8 to remain in their homes, and avoid the segregation and isolation that California Government Code\n9 § 11135 seeks to avoid.\n10 CONCLUSION\n11 Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n12 1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees (Document No. 355) is granted.  Plaintiffs have\n13 satisfied all the criteria under § 1021.5 to justify an award of attorney’s fees.\n14 2.  Defendants’ Motion to Recover Fees and Costs (Document No. 354) is denied.\n15 3.  Plaintiffs shall file their motion for attorney’s fees and costs no later than July 31, 2019. \n16 The parties shall meet and confer pursuant to the Local Rules and the motion shall be noticed\n17 pursuant to the Local Rules and the court’s initial Standing Order on the Central District’s website.\n18 Dated this 30th day of May, 2019.\n19\n                              /s/   \n20          Fernando M.

This civil rights action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to \n3 authorize critically needed Medi-Cal funded in-home services to Plaintiffs Jerry \n4 Thomas, Arthur Congdon and Sean Benison.  Failure to receive these services will \n5 result in severe harm and potential institutionalization of these individuals with \n6 disabilities.  Due to their fragile medical conditions, placement in an institution is \n7 likely to result in dire health consequences and even death.  Institutional care for \n8 Plaintiffs would also cost the State significantly more than it would to keep them \n9 safely in their own homes.  \n10 2.  Plaintiffs have severe disabilities and chronic medical conditions: \n11 Plaintiff Jerry Thomas is diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Post-\n12 Polio Syndrome.  Plaintiffs Arthur Congdon and Sean Benison have advanced \n13 hereditary progressive Muscular Dystrophy.  Due to their illnesses, Plaintiffs are \n14 quadriplegic and cannot breathe or move on their own.  They have tracheal tubes \n15 connected to ventilators to help them breathe.  Plaintiffs Thomas and Congdon \n16 receive nutrition and hydration via Gastrostomy feeding tubes.   \n17 3.  All three Plaintiffs live in their own homes, with round the clock care \n18 provided by a combination of licensed nurses, and unskilled paid and unpaid \n19 attendants.  However, pursuant to their doctors’ orders, Plaintiffs Thomas and \n20 Congdon need 24 hour nursing care, and Plaintiff Benison needs additional nursing \n21 care, to assess and address their complex and unpredictable needs, including \n22 monitoring their ventilators and oxygen levels, preparing and administering \n23 medications, and clearing fluids from their lungs and tracheotomy tubes. \n24 4.  While this kind of intensive nursing care is often provided in a hospital \n25 or Subacute medical care facility, Plaintiffs have been able to remain in their \n26 communities and close to their families because of nursing care available to them in \n27 their homes under the Medi-Cal Home and Community Based Nursing \n28 Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver (“NF/AH Waiver”), administered by Defendants \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  1 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 4 of 35   Page ID #:59\n \n \n1 Department of Health Care Services and its Director, Toby Douglas (\"DHCS\" or \n2 \"Defendants\").   \n3 5.  Plaintiffs have all requested additional licensed nursing care services \n4 from Defendants, so that they can continue living safely in their homes and \n5 communities.  Defendants have denied these requests.   \n6 6.  Plaintiff Benison, who lives alone, also requires Case Management and \n7 Habilitation services, which are available under the NF/AH Waiver.  However, Mr. \n8 Benison is not able to access these needed NF/AH Waiver services that would help \n9 him live more independently and successfully in his home and community.  \n10 7.  The sole reason Plaintiffs are not able to get these critically needed \n11 services is because Defendants have placed arbitrary cost limitations on services \n12 available under the NF/AH Waiver.  Specifically, for individuals like Plaintiffs who \n13 have been determined to meet the Subacute level of care, Medi-Cal would pay \n14 $271,697 per year for institutional placement in a Subacute facility; however, \n15 Defendants have capped the budget for comparable in-home services funded \n16 through the NF/AH Waiver at $180,219 per year, which is at least $90,000 below \n17 the actual cost of equivalent care in a Subacute facility.  The cost of the additional \n18 nursing and other NF/AH Waiver services requested by Plaintiffs would still cost \n19 less than placement in a Subacute facility.  Defendants have the discretion and the \n20 ability to modify the NF/AH Waiver to enable Plaintiffs to receive the skilled \n21 nursing care and other services they need to remain safely at home.  But, they have \n22 refused to provide critically needed services on grounds it exceeds their arbitrary \n23 cost-cap.  \n24 8.  Defendants’ actions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n25 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12312 (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n26 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”).  Under the ADA and Section 504, a public \n27 agency such as DHCS has a duty to provide services to people with disabilities in \n28 the “most integrated setting appropriate to their needs” and to prevent unnecessary \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  2 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 5 of 35   Page ID #:60\n \n \n1 institutionalization.  The most integrated setting for Plaintiffs is to continue living in \n2 their homes in the community, with adequate NF/AH Waiver services to meet their \n3 significant needs.  Placing Plaintiffs at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in \n4 order to receive the care they need violates the ADA. \n5 9.  Under the ADA, Defendants also have an obligation to use methods of \n6 administration that do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities such as \n7 Plaintiffs.  Defendants’ failure to ensure that Plaintiffs are provided with adequate \n8 NF/AH Waiver services to continue living safely in their homes, and their decision \n9 to set funding levels for services that are biased in favor of institutional care results \n10 in discrimination against Plaintiffs in the administration of the Medi-Cal program.  \n11 II.   JURISDICTION \n12 10.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of \n13 Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and Section 504 \n14 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  \n15 11.  Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  Plaintiffs’ claims \n16 for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and \n17 2202.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendants have acted under color of state \n18 law.  \n19 III.   VENUE \n20 12.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to 28 \n21 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because the Defendants operate and perform their official duties \n22 therein and thus reside therein for purposes of venue, and because a substantial part \n23 of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in the Central \n24 District of California.  Plaintiff Jerry Thomas lives and receives Medi-Cal services \n25 in Orange County, which is in the Central District of California.  Plaintiff Arthur \n26 Congdon lives and receives Medi-Cal services in Los Angeles County, which is in \n27 the Central District of California.  Plaintiff Sean Benison lives and receives Medi-\n28 Cal services in Ventura County, which is in the Central District of California.  \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  3 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 6 of 35   Page ID #:61\n \n \n1 Defendant DHCS operates the Medi-Cal program, conducts business and provides \n2 Medi-Cal services to Plaintiffs in Orange County, Los County and Ventura County, \n3 all in the Central District of California.   \n4 IV.   PARTIES \n5 Plaintiffs \n6 13.  Each Plaintiff is a “qualified person with a disability” within the \n7 meaning of all applicable statutes, including 42 U.S.C. §12131(2) and 29 U.S.C. \n8 §705(20)(B).  Plaintiffs have been and continue to be Medi-Cal beneficiaries.   \n9 14.  Plaintiff Jerry Thomas is 73 years old and has Progressive Supranuclear \n10 Palsy (“PSP”), a degenerative brain disorder that causes serious and progressive \n11 problems with gait and balance, eye movement, cognitive difficulties, and muscle \n12 weakness, and which will worsen over time.  In addition to PSP, Mr.  Thomas has \n13 Post-Polio Syndrome, quadriplegia, chronic pain syndrome, dysphagia (difficulty \n14 swallowing), chronic respiratory failure, chronic constipation, chronic atelectasis (a \n15 complete or partial collapse of the lung), recurrent episodes of urinary tract \n16 infections (“UTIs”), recurrent pneumonia and/or bronchitis, and hypothyroidism, \n17 among other conditions.  After 14 years of institutional placement, Mr. Thomas now \n18 resides at home with his wife of over 30 years, Beverly Thomas, who brought him \n19 home from a Subacute facility in 2013.  She serves as his Guardian ad Litem in this \n20 litigation. \n21 15.  Plaintiff Arthur Congdon is 36 years old and has advanced hereditary \n22 progressive Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, chronic respiratory failure, congestive \n23 heart failure, cardiomyopathy, is quadriplegic and legally blind.  Mr. Congdon also \n24 suffers from insomnia, chronic back pain, gastric problems and severe contracture of \n25 his joints.  He resides at home with his mother, who is his primary caregiver. \n26 16.  Plaintiff Sean Benison is 43 years old and has advanced hereditary \n27 progressive Becker Muscular Dystrophy, is quadriplegic, has chronic respiratory \n28 failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pain disorder, anxiety \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  4 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 7 of 35   Page ID #:62\n \n \n1 disorder, DVT (thromboembolism) prophylaxis and reflux esophagitis.  He lives on \n2 his own in his apartment, after leaving two years of institutional care in a Subacute \n3 facility in October 2013. \n4 17.  All three Plaintiffs have a tracheal tube that is connected to a \n5 ventilator to help them breathe.  Due to Plaintiffs’ mucous secretions and their \n6 inability to swallow due to the tracheotomy and loss of muscle function, Plaintiffs \n7 must be suctioned as needed, sometimes as frequently as four to five times an hour, \n8 when saliva builds up in the mouth, nose, and throat to avoid pooling of mucous or \n9 any fluid in the lungs.  If fluid does go into the lungs, it could impair oxygen \n10 exchange, resulting in lack of oxygen and permanent damage to organs (including \n11 brain injury), pneumonia, and infection.  Plaintiffs Congdon and Benison use a \n12 cuffed tracheotomy which is uncuffed during the day and allows for the possibility \n13 of communication/speech, but also allows fluid to go into the lungs if not timely \n14 suctioned.  During the night, the tracheotomy is cuffed and Plaintiffs are not able to \n15 speak – which can be more dangerous since they are not able to communicate if they \n16 are in distress.  Further, air leaks out of the cuff and a nurse is required to keep \n17 adding air to the cuff and to monitor the ventilator settings to ensure Plaintiffs are \n18 properly ventilated: too much air puts pressure on the lungs and too little air can \n19 make them unconscious.  All this is done through the night while Plaintiffs are \n20 asleep.   \n21 18.  Plaintiffs are dependent on a wheelchair for mobility at all times.  \n22 Plaintiffs Thomas and Congdon also have Gastrostomy tubes (“G-tube”) for feeding \n23 and medication administration.  Plaintiffs are completely dependent on medical \n24 technologies for survival.  Plaintiffs cannot move, turn, feed, dress, bathe or take \n25 care of themselves.  They need total care for every daily activity.   \n26 19.  Plaintiffs' in-home nursing care is provided by licensed vocational \n27 nurses (“LVNs” or “nurses”).  LVNs are licensed to provide skilled nursing care in \n28 many settings including hospitals.  42 C.F.R. Sec. 409.31 (a); 22 C.C.R. §§ \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  5 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 8 of 35   Page ID #:63\n \n \n1 70055(a)(16), §70055(a)(16) & 70217 (a).  These one-on-one skilled nursing \n2 services have been ordered by Plaintiffs’ physicians because their care requires the \n3 exercise of judgment informed by experience and expertise in addressing the care \n4 needs of persons with severe disabilities and chronic illnesses.  The services \n5 Plaintiffs require cannot safely be provided by untrained or unskilled individuals \n6 and are medically necessary. \n7 Defendant Department of Health Care Services \n8 20.  Defendant California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) \n9 administers the California Medicaid program, called “Medi-Cal.”  DHCS is the \n10 single state agency responsible for the administration of the Medi-Cal program.   \n11 21.  Defendant Toby Douglas is DHCS’ current Director and is sued only in \n12 his official capacity.  Director Douglas is responsible for directing, organizing, and \n13 administering the Medi-Cal program, including Medi-Cal Home and Community \n14 Based Services Waivers, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.  As \n15 such, he is responsible for DHCS’ compliance with state and federal laws governing \n16 the Medi-Cal program.   \n17 V.   STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \n18 A.  THE MEDICAID PROGRAM   \n19 22.  Medicaid is a joint federal and state medical assistance program for \n20 certain groups of low-income people, including children.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v.  \n21 California has elected to participate in the Medicaid program, and so must comply \n22 with the requirements of the federal Medicaid Act and its implementing regulations.  \n23 California’s Medicaid program is known as “Medi-Cal.”  \n24 23.  The purpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as practicable, “medical \n25 assistance on behalf of . . . aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose income and \n26 resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services” and “to \n27 help such families and individuals to attain or retain capability for independence or \n28 self-care . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1396.  \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  6 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 9 of 35   Page ID #:64\n \n \n1 24.  Participating States are reimbursed by the federal government for a \n2 portion of the cost of providing Medicaid benefits.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396b.  The \n3 remaining funding for the Medi-Cal program comes from the State and from \n4 counties. \n5 25.  States participating in Medicaid must designate a “single state agency” \n6 to administer or supervise the administration of the Medicaid program.  42 U.S.C. § \n7 1396a(a)(5).  DHCS is the single state agency so designated in California. \n8 26.  The California Medi-Cal program provides an array of medical \n9 services, treatments, and therapies that are authorized based on individuals’ meeting \n10 “medical necessity” criteria.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 14059, 14059.5, 14133.3; 22 \n11 California Code of Regulations (“C.C.R.”) § 51303(a). \n12 Medi-Cal Home and Community-Based Services Waivers \n13 27.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) is the federal agency \n14 that oversees the administration of the Medicaid programs offered by each state.  \n15 CMS has the authority to waive certain provisions of federal Medicaid law to allow \n16 states to provide home and community-based services (“HCBS”) in lieu of \n17 institutional care, for targeted groups of individuals who otherwise would require \n18 care in a medical facility.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1).    \n19 28.  States may receive federal financial participation for such HCBS \n20 “waiver” services to the same extent as provided to other Medicaid services offered \n21 by the State.  CMS approves or denies a state’s HCBS waiver application and must \n22 approve any amendments to an approved waiver application.  Id. \n23 29.  DHCS has been mandated by the Legislature to “seek all necessary \n24 waivers . . . in order to provide in-home and community-based care.”  Welf. & Inst. \n25 Code §§ 14132(t), 14137.   DHCS routinely seeks and secures approval to renew \n26 and amend HCBS Waivers within permissible federal limitations.  \n27 30.  HCBS Waivers in California include the Nursing Facility/Acute \n28 Hospital (“NF/AH”) Waiver.  The purpose of the NF/AH Waiver is to provide \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  7 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 10 of 35   Page ID #:65\n \n \n1 Medi-Cal beneficiaries with long-term medical conditions who meet one of the \n2 designated \"levels of care\" described below, the option of returning to and/or \n3 remaining in their  homes or home-like community settings in lieu of \n4 institutionalization.  \n5 http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ltc/Documents/NFAH%20Transition%20and%20D\n6 iversion%20Waiver%2012-1-2012.pdf (\"NF/AH Waiver\") at 7-8.    \n7 31.  In seeking federal approval for the NF/AH Waiver, DHCS gave \n8 assurances to CMS, including that: (a) Necessary safeguards have been taken to \n9 protect the health and welfare of participants receiving services under the NF/AH \n10 Waiver; and, (b) Plans of Care are responsive to NF/AH Waiver participants’ needs.  \n11 NF/AH Waiver at 9-10. \n12 32.  Under the umbrella of the NF/AH HCBS Waiver, DHCS administers \n13 three HCBS waivers which each correspond to an institutional level of care.  These \n14 levels of care are: Nursing Facility Level A or B (“NF-A/B”), Nursing Facility \n15 Subacute (“Subacute”), and Acute Hospital.  Each of the three HCBS Waivers \n16 contained in the NF/AH Waiver offers an array of home and community-based \n17 services, discussed below.  \n18 33.   The level of care criteria for the NF/AH Home and Community Based \n19 Services Waivers explicitly describe the type and level (or severity) of functional \n20 limitations and/or skilled nursing needs an individual must have to be admitted to an \n21 institutional setting.  Upon meeting those eligibility criteria, or level of care, an \n22 individual may qualify for corresponding NF/AH HCBS Waiver services.  \n23 34.  California offers various services under the NH/AH Waiver, including \n24 Private Duty Nursing, Case Management and Habilitation services that Plaintiffs are \n25 seeking.  NF/AH Waiver at 59.   \n26 35.  “Private duty nursing” services means individual and continuous care \n27 (in contrast to part-time or intermittent care) provided by a licensed nurse or a \n28 certified home health aide employed by a home health agency within the scope of \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  8 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 11 of 35   Page ID #:66\n \n \n1 state law.  Private duty nursing services are provided in a recipient’s home, home-\n2 like environment or an approved out-of-home setting.  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(9); 42 \n3 C.F.R. § 440.90; NF/AH Waiver at 196.    \n4 36.  “Case Management” services are designed to assess the participant and \n5 determine the need for medical, psycho-social, social and other services and to assist \n6 participants in gaining access to those needed services, regardless of the funding \n7 source, to ensure the participant’s health and safety and support of his/her home and \n8 community-based program.  Case Managers also assist in securing personal care \n9 providers, work with the participant and his/her physician in developing goals and \n10 identifying a course of action to respond to the assessed needs of the individual, as \n11 well as oversee the implementation of the services described in the Plan of \n12 Treatment (“POT”).  Case Management responsibilities include assessing, care \n13 planning, locating, coordinating, and monitoring services for community-based \n14 participants on the waiver.  Case Management may be provided by an array of \n15 provider types.  NF/AH Waiver at 59-72.   \n16 37.  “Habilitation Services” are provided in a participant’s home or an out-\n17 of-home non-facility setting and are designed to assist the participant in acquiring, \n18 retaining, and improving self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills necessary to \n19 reside successfully in the person’s natural environment.  Habilitation services \n20 include training on: the use of public transportation; personal skills development in \n21 conflict resolution; community participation; developing and maintaining \n22 interpersonal relationships; personal habits; daily living skills (cooking, cleaning, \n23 shopping, money management) and community resource awareness to support \n24 independence in the community.  It also includes assistance with: selecting and \n25 moving into a home; locating and choosing suitable housemates; locating household \n26 furnishings; settling disputes with landlords; managing personal financial affairs; \n27 recruiting, screening, hiring, training, supervising, and dismissing personal \n28 attendants; dealing with and responding appropriately to governmental agencies and \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  9 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 12 of 35   Page ID #:67\n \n \n1 personnel; asserting civil and statutory rights through self-advocacy, and building \n2 and maintaining interpersonal relationships.  NF/AH Waiver at 72-84.   \n3 38.  In order to meet the federal cost-neutrality requirements, the NF/AH \n4 Waiver contains assurances that, in the aggregate for the entire NF/AH Waiver \n5 population, services provided in the community pursuant to the NF/AH Waiver will \n6 not exceed the cost of services in the institution designated for comparable care.  \n7 NF/AH Waiver at 10.  Defendants, however, have chosen to use an individual \n8 maximum benefit level, rather than an aggregate cost-cap.  Id. at 26.  Thus, the three \n9 Waivers within the NF/AH HCBS Waiver correspond to an institutional level of \n10 care and have individual “cost-caps” depending on the Medi-Cal rate for their \n11 corresponding facility.  These cost-caps allow a qualifying individual to choose \n12 from a menu of available home and community-based services but only up to the \n13 cost-cap for his or her level of care set by DHCS in the applicable HCBS Waiver.  \n14 NF/AH Waiver at 26-27.  Defendants have set these Waiver cost caps at a level far \n15 below the institutional cost. \n16 39.  Upon information and belief, the Medi-Cal program pays $271,697 per \n17 year to Subacute facilities for adults who are placed in those institutions.  \n18 40.  However, Defendants will not authorize a comparable level of HCBS \n19 waiver funding for home-based services for individuals such as Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n20 Congdon and Mr. Benison who meet the Subacute criteria and would otherwise be \n21 placed in a Subacute facility.  This is because Defendants have arbitrarily set the \n22 cost-cap for NF/AH Waiver services at the adult Subacute level of care at $180,219, \n23 which is more than $90,000 below the actual cost of the comparable institutional \n24 placement.  NF/AH Waiver at 27.   \n25 41.  Federal cost-neutrality requirements do not prohibit Defendants from \n26 setting the Waiver cost-cap at or just below the rate paid to Subacute facilities, or \n27 even exceeding the amount paid to Subacute facilities so long as in the aggregate, \n28 the State’s Medi-Cal spending remains cost-neutral. \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  10 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 13 of 35   Page ID #:68\n \n \n1 In-Home Supportive Services \n2 42.  The In-Home Supportive Services (“IHSS”) program is the State’s \n3 personal attendant care program pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst Code §§ 12300 et seq. \n4 and Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 14132.95, 14132.951, 14132.952.  The IHSS program \n5 pays for certain services so eligible recipients can remain safely in their homes.  To \n6 be eligible, an individual must be over 65 years of age, or disabled, or blind.  IHSS \n7 services include:  housecleaning, meal preparation, laundry, grocery shopping, \n8 personal care services (such as bowel and bladder care, bathing, grooming and \n9 paramedical services), accompaniment to medical appointments, and protective \n10 supervision for the mentally impaired.  Recipients may choose their IHSS workers, \n11 who must meet minimal requirements for approval, such as a background check, but \n12 who are not required to be licensed or skilled medical practitioners. \n13 B.  FEDERAL ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS \n14 43.  Qualifying individuals with disabilities are protected from disability \n15 discrimination, including segregation in institutions, by the ADA and Section 504.  \n16 44.  In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “[i]ndividuals with \n17 disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, \n18 including…segregation…” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a) (5).  Title II of the ADA provides \n19 that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, be \n20 excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs, or \n21 activities of a public entity or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.”  42 \n22 U.S.C. § 12132. \n23 45.  Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide:  “[a] public \n24 entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \n25 setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n26 § 35.130(d) (1991); see also Section 504, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a; 28 C.F.R. § \n27 41.51(d).  Further, “[t]he most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of a \n28 qualified individual with a disability means a setting that enables individuals with \n \nThomas v.

The United States Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, \n4 527 U.S. 581 (1999) held that the unnecessary institutionalization of individuals \n5 with disabilities is a form of discrimination under Title II of the ADA.  In doing so, \n6 the Court interpreted the ADA’s “integration mandate” as requiring persons with \n7 disabilities to be served in the community when: (1) the state determines that \n8 community-based treatment is appropriate; (2) the individual does not oppose \n9 community placement; and (3) community placement can be reasonably \n10 accommodated.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. \n11 47.  Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA and Section 504 also \n12 provide: “A public entity may not, directly or through contractual or other \n13 arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of administration: (i) that have the \n14 effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the \n15 basis of disability; [or] (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or \n16 substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the entity’s program \n17 with respect to individuals with disabilities…” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3); 28 C.F.R. \n18 § 41.51(b)(3)(I); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \n19 48.  ADA regulations further provide: “[a] public entity shall not impose or \n20 apply eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a \n21 disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally \n22 enjoying any service, program, or activity, unless such criteria can be shown to be \n23 necessary for the provision of the service, program, or activity being offered.”  28 \n24 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8); see also parallel Section 504 regulations, 45 C.F.R. \n25 § 84.4(b)(1)(iv).   \n26 49.  As set forth in federal regulations:  “[a] public entity shall make \n27 reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the \n28 modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless \n \nThomas v.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n5 JERRY THOMAS \n6 50.  Jerry Thomas was diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy in \n7 2007 at 66 years of age.  Progressive Supranuclear Palsy is a degenerative brain \n8 disorder that involves a loss of muscle control impacting gait and balance, eye \n9 movement, and thought processes. \n10 51.  Mr. Thomas’s  in-home nursing services have been funded entirely by \n11 Medi-Cal. \n12 52.  Mr. Thomas lives at home with wife of over thirty years, Beverly \n13 Thomas.  Mr. Thomas’s wife is his primary care giver and his Guardian ad Litem.   \n14 53.  Before Mr. Thomas became ill, he worked as a road manager for his \n15 brother, singer BJ Thomas.  When he was not spending time with his wife or \n16 working, most weekends Mr. Thomas was hunting with his dogs and family \n17 members.   \n18 54.  Mr. and Mrs. Thomas desire that he continue living at home with \n19 appropriate nursing services.  \n20 55.  Mr. Thomas is medically fragile and technology dependent.  Mr. \n21 Thomas requires oxygen 24 hours a day and is connected to a ventilator at least 18 \n22 hours a day, and more when needed.  He receives nutrition, hydration and \n23 medication through his G-tube.  Mr. Thomas is non-ambulatory and cannot bear \n24 weight.  He uses a wheelchair and requires assistance with all activities of daily \n25 living (“ADLs”).  \n26 56.   Mr. Thomas can no longer speak and is only able to communicate by \n27 blinking his eyes.  Individuals need training to understand his body language for \n28 signs and symptoms of changes in his condition, need, and medical emergencies.   \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  13 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 16 of 35   Page ID #:71\n \n \n1 57.  At age 66, when Mr. Thomas could no longer breathe on his own due \n2 to muscle weakness, he had a tracheotomy.      \n3 58.  In order to control his symptoms and severe pain, he takes over 40 \n4 medications, including several narcotics and 7 medications that are provided pre re \n5 nata (“PRN” as needed). \n6 59.  In addition to PSP, Mr. Thomas has been diagnosed with Post Polio \n7 Syndrome, among other conditions.  \n8 60.  Mr. Thomas lived in a nursing facility for fourteen years, until his wife \n9 was able to bring him home with services under the NF/AH Waiver.  Since moving \n10 home on April 1, 2013, Mr. Thomas has been in the hospital or hospitalized several \n11 times, as well as seen by his doctors on numerous occasions.  Mr. Thomas is \n12 regularly seen by his pulmonologist and primary care physician, as well as a \n13 neurologist. \n14 61.  Since Mr. Thomas moved home, his condition has worsened due to the \n15 natural progression of his diseases.  He now requires more time connected to the \n16 ventilator and takes additional medications to assist with his digestive and \n17 tracheotomy suctioning needs.  In July 2014, Dr. Kayaleh, Mr. Thomas’s treating \n18 physician, ordered for him to be provided with 24 hour nursing care.  \n19 62.  Mrs. Thomas is not a licensed vocational nurse and is not capable of \n20 providing the additional nursing care that Mr. Thomas requires.   \n21 Mr. Thomas’ Nursing Care Needs   \n22 63.  As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n23 Thomas has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n24 addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include, e.g.,: monitoring Mr. Thomas’ \n25 oxygen saturation levels and providing skilled interventions when his oxygen levels \n26 drop below 92%, including breathing with ambu-bag, CPR, and calling 911; \n27 determining when Mr. Thomas must be placed on the ventilator during sprinting \n28 hours; monitoring and administering his medications including over 40 daily \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  14 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 17 of 35   Page ID #:72\n \n \n1 medications and 7 medications to be taken PRN as needed for proper dosage, \n2 effectiveness, interactions, and side effects; monitoring the amount, sound, and color \n3 of Mr. Thomas’ secretions for signs of infection; monitoring the sound of Mr. \n4 Thomas’ lungs to assess for a respiratory infection or blockage; monitoring and \n5 performing deep tracheal suctioning;  monitoring the color, consistency, odor, and \n6 frequency of Mr. Thomas’ urine and bowels for signs and symptoms of infections; \n7 administering and checking all equipment to ensure proper functioning and replace \n8 equipment or intervene as needed; monitoring feeding tolerance and knowing when \n9 Mr. Thomas’ G-tube  feeding should be stopped when he presents signs of \n10 abdominal pain and discomfort; monitoring, caring for, and replacing his trach \n11 stoma when necessary; taking and interpreting vital signs and knowing when they \n12 indicate a possible infection or when CPR is required; monitoring Mr. Thomas’ \n13 entire system for signs of infection, change, or emergency; assessing and monitoring \n14 Mr. Thomas’ skin for signs of infection, breakdown, or ulcers; and identifying and \n15 responding to emergencies.   \n16 In-Home Nursing Authorization  \n17 64.  Before moving home from Chapman Subacute facility on April 1, \n18 2013, Mr. Thomas was approved to receive 450 LVN hours under the NF/AH \n19 waiver at the Subacute level of care, along with 240.04 hours of IHSS, and 2 hours \n20 of RN case management.  He and his wife accepted this combination of skilled and \n21 unskilled care because Mr. Thomas unquestionably required round-the-clock \n22 coverage and they understood that due to the Subacute Waiver cost-cap, he would \n23 not be able to receive the 24-hour nursing he needed. \n24 65.  On October 16, 2013, DHCS conducted a home visit to reassess Mr. \n25 Thomas’ level of care.  Based on the assessment, DHCS determined that Mr. \n26 Thomas remained eligible for the NF/AH waiver at the Subacute level of care.  \n27 However, DHCS determined that the expenditures for the services he was receiving \n28 exceeded the NF/AH waiver cost-cap at the Subacute level of care, which is $ \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  15 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 18 of 35   Page ID #:73\n \n \n1 180,219.00.   \n2 66.  Even though Mr. Thomas’ needs had increased since his move home, \n3 DHCS issued a Notice of Action (“NOA”) on January 9, 2014 reducing his in-home \n4 LVN nursing authorization to 430 hours per month.  The NOA provided that the \n5 decrease in services was solely due to the cost-cap under the NF/AH waiver, not a \n6 change or improvement in Mr. Thomas’ condition.   \n7 67.   On February 10, 2014, Mrs. Thomas, on behalf of her husband, timely \n8 appealed DHCS’ 20-hour per month nursing reduction by mail and requested aid-\n9 paid-pending.  At Plaintiffs' request, DHCS reassessed Mr. Thomas in August 2014, \n10 but refused to authorize increased nursing hours for him.  On September 23, 2014, a \n11 Medi-Cal fair hearing was held, where Mr. Thomas presented his medical need for \n12 24 hour nursing care, consistent with his doctor’s July 2014 orders.  The \n13 administrative law judge has not yet issued a ruling; thus Mr. Thomas has not yet \n14 experienced a reduction in his nursing care.  However, because DHCS has the \n15 ability to “alternate”, or overturn, the decision, even a favorable ruling does not \n16 offer Mr. Thomas protection from this cut.  Moreover, at the hearing, Defendants \n17 argued that the hearing issues should be limited to the 20-hour per month reduction, \n18 and not whether Mr. Thomas was entitled to receive 24-hour per day nursing care.  \n19 Thus, even a favorable decision may not provide Mr. Thomas with permanent or \n20 adequate relief. \n21 ARTHUR CONGDON \n22 68.  Arthur Congdon is 36 years old.  He was diagnosed with Duchenne \n23 Muscular Dystrophy as a child.  Muscular Dystrophy is a degenerative disease \n24 involving advancing muscle weakness, loss of muscle tissue, and atrophy.  As a \n25 result of Muscular Dystrophy, Mr. Congdon is quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair.  \n26 Mr. Congdon also has congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, chronic respiratory \n27 failure and is legally blind.  In addition, Mr. Congdon suffers from chronic \n28 insomnia, chronic back pain, gastric problems, urinary incontinence and severe \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  16 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 19 of 35   Page ID #:74\n \n \n1 contracture of his joints.     \n2 69.  Mr. Congdon lives at home with his mother, Jennifer Knight.  Ms. \n3 Knight is also legally blind.  Ms. Knight is Plaintiff’s primary caregiver, and is \n4 involved in planning for and providing his care.  Mr. Congdon’s father lives in \n5 Pennsylvania.   \n6 70.  Mr. Congdon has a Ph.D. in Astrophysics.  In October 2008, he began \n7 an assignment at the prestigious Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California \n8 Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.  He was a participant in NASA’s \n9 Postdoctoral Program administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities.  \n10 However, due to his advancing Muscular Dystrophy, Mr. Congdon is no longer able \n11 to work at JPL.  Mr. Congdon now remains exclusively at home and is working on \n12 an astrophysics textbook. \n13 71.  In March 2002, Mr. Congdon was named one of five winners nationally \n14 of the Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic academic awards.  To recognize his \n15 accomplishment, Mr. Congdon was invited to the White House in Washington, DC, \n16 where he met with then First Lady Laura Bush. \n17 72.  Mr. Congdon and his mother desire that he continue living at home \n18 with appropriate nursing services.  \n19 73.  Mr. Congdon’s in-home nursing care has been funded entirely by \n20 Medi-Cal.   \n21 74.  Mr. Congdon is medically fragile and technology dependent.  He had a \n22 G-tube inserted eleven years ago.  At the same time, since Mr. Congdon could no \n23 longer breathe on his own due to muscle weakness, he had a tracheotomy.  Mr. \n24 Congdon is non-ambulatory and cannot bear weight.  He uses a wheelchair.  \n25 75.  Since that time, Mr. Congdon has been dependent on a ventilator 24 \n26 hours a day. \n27 76.  Mr. Congdon receives nutrition, hydration and medication through his \n28 G-tube.  He is given water three times a day, and medicines four times a day, via his \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  17 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 20 of 35   Page ID #:75\n \n \n1 G-tube.  His G-tube needs to be cleaned every day and flushed every time he gets \n2 hydration. \n3 77.  Mr. Congdon needs total care for every daily activity.  He cannot walk, \n4 cannot move himself or even turn over in bed.  He cannot feed himself and has \n5 limited use of his hands.     \n6 78.  Mr. Congdon had spinal fusion surgery in 1993.  He was hospitalized at \n7 Cedars Sinai for aspiration pneumonia in May 2013. \n8 79.  Mr. Congdon’s cardiologist is at the Cedars Sinai Medical Center.  His \n9 primary care doctor, who also handles his pulmonary care, is with the Family \n10 Medicine Center in Glendale and treats Mr. Congdon in his home.  Mr. Congdon is \n11 not able to travel easily and so he is unable to receive treatment from a \n12 pulmonologist and a neurologist.  \n13 Mr. Congdon’s Nursing Care Needs \n14 80.  As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n15 Congdon has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n16 addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include:   monitoring and ensuring his vital \n17 signs remain within parameters listed in the physician’s orders, and more frequent \n18 checks if he is running a fever, or for signs or symptoms of a change in condition;  \n19 monitoring Mr. Congdon’s respiratory function through regular interventions of \n20 deep and oral suctioning, effective trach care including mobilization of lung \n21 secretions, and ventilator support, and responding to signs and symptoms of \n22 respiratory distress; ensuring adequate nutrition, hydration and medication is \n23 provided for Mr. Congdon via his G-tube, through close monitoring; assessing the \n24 G-tube site for any problems or infection;  monitoring for signs and symptoms of \n25 weight change, altered bowel function and dehydration; tracheotomy assessment, \n26 changing, addressing problems or infections; preparing medications as prescribed;  \n27 monitoring Mr. Congdon’s pain level and re-positioning him and administering \n28 analgesics as needed; ensuring Mr. Congdon remains infection free at his trach and \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  18 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 21 of 35   Page ID #:76\n \n \n1 G-tube sites and keep sites clean and dry at all times; ensuring no skin impairment \n2 develops by repositioning Mr. Congdon frequently and by providing skin care every \n3 shift to ensure no skin breakdown; reporting any change in Mr. Congdon’s condition \n4 to the physician, the RN, or others as appropriate.   \n5 In-Home Nursing Authorization  \n6 81.  Mr. Congdon has been receiving NF/AH Waiver services since October \n7 2008.  He is authorized for up to 500 hours per month of licensed vocational \n8 nursing, and two hours per month of RN case management.  This provides him with \n9 16 hours nursing coverage daily.  He does not receive any IHSS attendant care.   \n10 82.  Mr. Congdon’s mother, Ms. Knight, has been trained in his care needs \n11 and provides the remainder of his care each day.  She also provides backup care \n12 during times when Mr. Congdon’s needs are so intense that two caregivers are \n13 required or when the home health agency fails to staff a shift and a nurse is not \n14 available.   \n15 83.  However, Ms. Knight is unable to provide additional care for Mr. \n16 Congdon.  Mr. Congdon’s father lives on the East Coast and is unavailable to \n17 provide any caregiver duties.  Moreover, since Mr. Congdon is over the age of 18, \n18 neither parent has a legal obligation to provide for his care.  \n19 84.  In June 2013, Mr. Congdon’s physician ordered one-to-one nursing \n20 care for him for twenty four hours per day.  Accordingly, Mr. Congdon asked \n21 Defendants for an additional 240 hours per month of licensed vocational nurse \n22 private duty nursing.  Defendants denied the request and, in lieu of the 240 hours per \n23 month, only authorized Mr. Congdon an additional 20 hours per month of nursing \n24 care, up to the Subacute Waiver cost-cap.  Mr. Congdon did not appeal the denial \n25 because he believed that doing so would be futile.   \n26 SEAN BENISON  \n27 85.  Mr. Benison was diagnosed with progressive hereditary Becker \n28 Muscular Dystrophy when he was 9 years old.  Mr. Benison started using a manual \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  19 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 22 of 35   Page ID #:77\n \n \n1 wheelchair when he was 13 year old and a power wheel chair at age 21.  Mr. \n2 Benison is quadriplegic.  In addition to Muscular Dystrophy, Mr. Benison has \n3 chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pain \n4 disorder, anxiety disorder, DVT (thromboembolism) prophylaxis and reflux \n5 esophagitis.  Mr. Benison takes 19 different medications.    \n6 86.  Mr. Benison is working towards a Ph.D. in Geography at the University \n7 of California, Santa Barbara (“UCSB”).  He has a B.A. from California State \n8 University Northridge.  He has a Master’s degree in Geography from UCSB. \n9 87.  Mr. Benison lives in an apartment in Ventura, California with a live-in \n10 IHSS personal care worker.  Mr. Benison’s father, Edward Benison, does not \n11 provide any daily care but involved in planning for and providing his care.   \n12 88.  Mr. Benison and his family desire that he continue living at home with \n13 appropriate nursing services.    \n14 89.  Mr. Benison’s nursing care has been funded entirely by Medi-Cal.     \n15 90.  While a student at UCSB, Mr. Benison was living in campus housing \n16 and had an IHSS care worker assisting with his needs.  Mr. Benison also had close \n17 friends who helped with his care needs, which enabled Mr. Benison to enroll in and \n18 pursue graduate studies.  \n19 91.  In November 2011, while a student at UCSB, Mr. Benison’s health \n20 took a turn for the worse.  Mr. Benison had a severe attack of pneumonia and was \n21 hospitalized at the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.  He remained in \n22 the Subacute unit of the acute care hospital for two years before he moved out to his \n23 current apartment.  While in the hospital, Mr. Benison had to undergo a \n24 tracheostomy due to the pneumonia and neuromuscular and lung weakness caused \n25 by the Muscular Dystrophy.  Mr. Benison could no longer breathe on his own.  Mr. \n26 Benison is now dependent on a ventilator 24 hours a day.   \n27 92.  Mr. Benison is medically fragile and technology dependent.  Mr. \n28 Benison is non-ambulatory and cannot bear weight.  He uses a wheelchair for \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  20 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 23 of 35   Page ID #:78\n \n \n1 mobility.  Until a few months ago, he had a G-tube for feeding and medication.  Mr. \n2 Benison cannot walk, cannot move himself or even turn over in bed.  He cannot feed \n3 himself and has limited use of his hands.  He requires assistance with all activities of \n4 daily living.   \n5 93.  Mr. Benison has been on the NF/AH Waiver since October 2013 when \n6 he moved out of the Subacute facility and into his own apartment in the community.  \n7 At that time, DHCS authorized 416 hours per month of Medi-Cal funded one-to-one \n8 in-home, or “private duty” nursing care through the NF/AH Waiver, based on its \n9 determination that Mr. Benison met the Subacute level of care.  In order to remain \n10 within the cost-cap limitation at the Subacute level of care, he is authorized for 16 \n11 hours nursing coverage daily from Monday through Friday, and 8 hours of nursing \n12 coverage each on Saturdays and Sundays.  Mr. Benison requires 24-hour care, and \n13 because he lives alone, Mr. Benison supplements his nursing care with 260 hours of \n14 unlicensed IHSS personal care aide hours per month.  However, on weekends he \n15 does not have any nursing coverage for 16 hours each day, which leaves him at risk.  \n16 Hence, a minimum of 8 hours more of private duty nursing each on Saturday and \n17 Sunday is necessary to keep Mr. Benison safely in his home. \n18 Mr. Benison’s Nursing Care Needs   \n19 94.  As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr. \n20 Benison has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be \n21 addressed by a licensed nurse.  These include:  monitoring Mr. Benison’s vital signs, \n22 cardiac status and assessing for signs and symptoms of tachycardia (resting heart \n23 rate faster than normal), ensuring Mr. Benison’s vital signs remain within \n24 parameters listed in the physician’s orders, and instructing caregivers in proper vital \n25 sign monitoring; assessing for signs and symptoms of pain; assessing for signs and \n26 symptoms of skin breakdown, rash and perfusion; instructing caregivers in measures \n27 to protect skin integrity; assessing for medication compliance, effectiveness and \n28 complications and instructing caregivers in medication dosages, schedules, effects \n \nThomas v.

As of September 2014, the cost to the Medi-Cal program for Mr. \n14 Benison’s home care, including 416 hours per month of private duty nursing, 260 \n15 hours of unlicensed IHSS aides and his medical equipment and supplies, was \n16 approximately $180,219.00 per year.  This is his maximum budget for NF/AH \n17 Waiver services because of the cost-cap imposed by DHCS. \n18 96.  Since January 2014, Mr. Benison’s physician has ordered one-to-one \n19 private duty nursing care for him so that he can receive the 24-hour care that he \n20 needs to remain safely at home.  Mr. Benison requested 24-hour nursing from \n21 Defendants in February 2014.  Defendants deferred his request for 24-hour nursing \n22 and have not provided him with a written notice of action as to their decision.   \n23 However, because Mr. Benison lives on his own, he relies on an unlicensed live-in \n24 IHSS aide as a backup care provider.  In addition to the NF/AH Waiver cost cap \n25 which would prevent Mr. Benison from receiving authorization for 24-hour nursing,  \n26 DHCS will also not authorize direct care services, or any combination of direct care \n27 services, exceeding 24 hours of care per day under the NF/AH Waiver.  NF/AH \n28 Waiver at 196.  Therefore, Plaintiff Benison needs 24 hours of nursing care per day, \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  22 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 25 of 35   Page ID #:80\n \n \n1 but he also cannot give up his live-in backup caregiver.  Thus, given the limitations \n2 of the existing NF/AH Waiver rules, he is requesting additional hours per month of \n3 nursing care to ensure that he can receive round-the-clock care.     \n4 97.  Additionally, Mr. Benison needs Case Management Services and \n5 Habilitation services to help him organize his nurses and IHSS workers’ schedules, \n6 enroll back in graduate studies, enable him to avail of social activities and \n7 community services, and overall access a better quality of life.  These services are \n8 available through the NF/AH Waiver, but not available to Mr. Benison because of \n9 the Subacute Waiver cost-cap.   \n10 DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS PLACE PLAINTIFFS AT RISK OF \n11 INSTITUTIONALIZATION \n12 98.  According to Plaintiffs’ medical professionals, home is the safest place \n13 for them to maximize their health condition and prolong their lives.  Placement in an \n14 institution, however, will almost certainly cause health deterioration and possible \n15 death within a short period of time.  \n16 99.  Defendants are refusing to provide additional NF/AH Waiver services \n17 for Plaintiffs solely due to the fact that DHCS has imposed a cost cap for the \n18 Subacute level of care, which is without medical justification.  Nor is it required by \n19 federal law.   \n20 100.  Defendants have placed an arbitrary cost-cap on home and community \n21 based services at the Subacute level of care under the NF/AH Waiver, which is far \n22 less than the actual institutional rate for a Subacute facility.   \n23 101.  Defendants have great flexibility and discretion in their administration \n24 of the NF/AH waiver.  They have the authority to make modifications to ensure that \n25 Medi-Cal recipients such as Plaintiffs receive sufficient and medically necessary \n26 NF/AH Waiver services to avoid institutional placement and receive the necessary \n27 services as their medical conditions require.  \n28 102.  Plaintiffs’ needs can be reasonably accommodated by Defendants \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  23 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 26 of 35   Page ID #:81\n \n \n1 continuing to provide Plaintiffs with NF/AH Waiver services up to the rate that \n2 Defendants would actually pay if Plaintiffs were to be admitted to a Subacute \n3 facility; and/or modifying any of its Home and Community Based Waivers to permit \n4 Plaintiffs to receive the NF/AH Waiver services that they require and that their \n5 physicians ordered.   \n6 103.  Defendants have the option to administer the NF/AH waiver so as not \n7 to create a bias towards institutional placement.  One option would be to increase \n8 the cost-cap for the Subacute level of care of the NF/AH Waiver to a level that is \n9 equal to the amount actually paid to Subacute facilities or utilize an aggregate cost \n10 cap.  Instead, Defendants have chosen to administer the waiver in such a way as to \n11 discriminate against Plaintiffs and to place them at risk of institutional placement, \n12 with life threatening consequences.   \n13 104.  Without the appropriate level of NF/AH Waiver services to remain in \n14 their homes, Plaintiffs will have no choice but institutional placement, which will \n15 separate them from their family and community and also poses significant risks to \n16 their health.   \n17 VII.   LEGAL CLAIMS \n18 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n19 (Defendant Director Toby Douglas) \n20 Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12134-35 et seq. \n21 105.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every \n22 allegation and paragraph set forth previously.  \n23 106.  Plaintiffs are “qualified individuals with a disability” within the \n24 meaning of the ADA in that they (1) have a physical impairment that substantially \n25 limits one or more major life activities; and (2) meet the essential eligibility \n26 requirements for community-based long-term care under California’s Medicaid \n27 program. \n28 107.  Defendant Toby Douglas is the Director of Defendant DHCS, which \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  24 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 27 of 35   Page ID #:82\n \n \n1 has responsibility for providing Medi-Cal and state-funded home and community \n2 based and institutional services, and is therefore a government entity subject to Title \n3 II of the ADA. 42 USC §12131(1)(A) and (B). \n4 108.  Defendant’s denial and reduction of adequate and medically necessary \n5 in-home nursing, and failure to provide Plaintiffs with medically necessary NF/AH \n6 Waiver services, has denied Plaintiffs the services they need to remain safely in the \n7 community, thereby placing them at risk of institutionalization in violation of the \n8 ADA’s integration mandate. \n9 109.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs in ways that include \n10 arbitrarily setting a cost-cap for the Subacute level of care of the NF/AH Waiver far \n11 below the actual rate paid for institutional services in a Subacute facility, thus \n12 denying Plaintiffs funds for home and community-based services that would \n13 otherwise be available for institutional services. \n14 110.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs by failing to provide \n15 reasonable modifications to programs and services in ways that include: failing to \n16 increase the Subacute level of care cost-cap, within federal cost neutrality \n17 limitations, to enable Plaintiffs to fund NF/AH Waiver services; and failing to offer \n18 an exception to the Subacute level of care cost-cap that would enable Plaintiffs to \n19 receive NF/AH Waiver services at a level adequate to meet their undisputed need. \n20 111.  By denying Plaintiffs adequate and necessary NF/AH Waiver services \n21 commensurate with their actual need, as opposed to arbitrary service limitations, \n22 Defendant has imposed eligibility requirements which unlawfully screens Plaintiffs \n23 out from fully and equally enjoying NF/AH Waiver services, and from receiving \n24 adequate care to remain safely at home. \n25 112.  Defendant has utilized criteria and methods of administration that \n26 subject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of \n27 unnecessary institutionalization, in ways that include:  (1) designing and \n28 implementing Home and Community Based Waivers which set arbitrarily low cost-\n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  25 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 28 of 35   Page ID #:83\n \n \n1 caps for NF/AH Waiver services, while paying significantly higher rates for the \n2 institutional alternative; and (2) imposing eligibility criteria, cost limitations and \n3 other criteria not required by federal limitations, which restrict in-home care in favor \n4 of institutional care.  \n5 113.  Defendant’s actions are in violation of Title II of the ADA. \n6 114.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12133, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and \n7 injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing \n8 this action. \n9 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n10 (Defendant DHCS) \n11 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n12 115.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every \n13 allegation and paragraph set forth previously.   \n14 116.  Plaintiffs are “qualified individuals with a disability” within the \n15 meaning of Section 504 in that their physical impairments substantially limits one or \n16 more major life activities; and they meet the essential eligibility requirements in that \n17 they are capable of living independently in their family home and/or in the most \n18 integrated community setting possible, with assistance.  \n19 117.  Defendant DHCS is a recipient of federal monies that provides Medi-\n20 Cal home and community-based and institutional services and other Medi-Cal \n21 services and is therefore a government entity subject to Section 504.  29 USC \n22 794(b).  \n23 118.  Defendant’s denial and reduction of adequate and necessary in-home \n24 nursing and refusal to provide NF/AH Waiver services has barred Plaintiffs from \n25 receiving the services they need to continue to live in the community, thereby \n26 placing them at imminent risk of institutionalization in violation of Section 504’s \n27 integration mandate. \n28 119.  Defendant DHCS discriminates against Plaintiffs in ways that include \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  26 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 29 of 35   Page ID #:84\n \n \n1 setting a cost-cap for the Subacute level of care of the NF/AH Waiver far below the \n2 actual rate paid for institutional services in a Subacute facility, thus denying \n3 Plaintiffs funds for home and community-based services that would otherwise be \n4 available for institutional services. \n5 120.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs by failing to provide \n6 reasonable modifications to programs and services in ways that include: failing to \n7 increase the Subacute level of care cost-cap, within federal cost neutrality \n8 limitations, to enable Plaintiffs to receive medically necessary NF/AH Waiver \n9 services; and failing to offer an exception to the Subacute level of care cost-cap that \n10 would enable Plaintiffs to receive NF/AH Waiver services at a level adequate to \n11 meet their undisputed needs. \n12 121.  By denying Plaintiffs adequate and necessary NF/AH Waiver services \n13 commensurate with their actual need, as opposed to arbitrary service limitations, \n14 Defendant has imposed eligibility requirements which unlawfully screen them out \n15 from fully and equally enjoying in-home nursing services, and from receiving the \n16 care they need to remain safely at home. \n17 122.  Defendant  has utilized criteria and methods of administration that \n18 subject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of \n19 unnecessary institutionalization, by, including but not limited to the following: (1) \n20 designing and implementing Home and Community Based Waivers which set \n21 arbitrarily low cost-caps for NF/AH Waiver services, while paying significantly \n22 higher rates for the institutional alternative; and (2) imposing eligibility criteria, cost \n23 limitations and other criteria not required by federal limitations, which restrict in-\n24 home care in favor of institutional care.  \n25 123.  Defendant’s actions violate Section 504.  \n26 VIII.  ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY \n27 RELIEF \n28 124.  Defendants’ actions, as alleged herein, have resulted in, and will \n \nThomas v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief  27 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-08013-FMO-AGR   Document 4   Filed 10/23/14   Page 30 of 35   Page ID #:85\n \n \n1 continue to result in irreparable injury to Plaintiffs caused by the refusal to cover \n2 medically necessary services under the NF/AH waiver as a result of the arbitrary \n3 cost cap and which they need to remain at home with his family and avoid \n4 unnecessary institutional placement.  Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate \n5 remedy at law. \n6 125.  An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants, in that \n7 Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have violated their rights under the ADA, other \n8 federal anti-discrimination laws, and Defendants deny all such contentions. \n9 126.  Defendant Douglas can either adopt or “alternate” (reject in whole or \n10 part) any administrative decision arising out of claims against DHCS.  California \n11 Manual of Policies and Procedures, Sections 22-061 and 22-062.  Therefore, the \n12 administrative appeal process offers no remedy or protection to Plaintiffs, as the \n13 Defendants in this action are the very entity which will make a determination of \n14 what NF/AH Waiver services will be provided to Plaintiffs.   \n15 IX.   REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n16 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs prays that the Court order the following relief and \n17 remedies on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated: \n18 A.  Assume jurisdiction over this action and maintain continuing \n19 jurisdiction until Defendants are in full compliance with every order of this Court; \n20 B.  Declare that Defendants’ failure to authorize Plaintiffs with sufficient \n21 NF/AH Waiver services to meet their undisputed needs, and Defendants’ policies, \n22 practices, acts and omissions as set forth above, violate the American with \n23 Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n24 C.  Grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \n25 enjoining Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and all persons \n26 who are in active concert or participation with them from reducing medically \n27 necessary Medi-Cal funded in-home care below Mr. Thomas’ current level of 450 \n28 hours per month of licensed vocational nursing care, 2 hours per month of RN care \n \nThomas v.

Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants, their officers, \n4 agents, employees, attorneys, and all persons who are in active concert or \n5 participation with them from discriminating against Plaintiffs and thereby placing \n6 them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization by: \n7 i.  Failing to offer reasonable modifications to their programs and \n8 policies to enable Plaintiffs to receive medically necessary in-\n9 home nursing as ordered by their physicians; \n10 ii.  Failing to offer reasonable modifications to their programs and \n11 policies to enable Plaintiffs to receive other NF/AH Waiver \n12 services like Case Management and Habilitation services;  \n13 iii.  Imposing eligibility requirements which unlawfully screen \n14 Plaintiffs out of the NF/AH Waiver program and prevent them \n15 from fully and equally enjoying NF/AH Waiver services, and \n16 from receiving adequate care to remain safely at home; \n17 iv.  Utilizing criteria and methods of administration that subject \n18 Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including \n19 placing them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n20 E.  Issue an order requiring Defendants to authorize Plaintiffs with Medi-\n21 Cal funded services through the Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver or other \n22 appropriate Home and Community Based Waivers, subject to federal cost neutrality \n23 requirements, to enable them to receive services commensurate with their needs, and \n24 as identified by their treating physicians, and as medically necessary. \n25 F.  Retain jurisdiction over the Defendants until such time as the Court is \n26 satisfied that Defendants’ unlawful policies, practices, and acts complained of herein \n27 cannot recur. \n28 G.
