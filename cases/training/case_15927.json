    "summary": "<p>On August 29, 2014 Ada County and the Ada County Coroner filed a complaint in the Fourth Judicial District of Idaho. They sued Disability Rights Idaho (“DRI”) under Idaho Code § 10-1201 et seq., (Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act), and Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 57. At the request of the defendant, Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. (DRI), the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Idaho on September 8, 2014. On September 18, 2014 DRI filed a counterclaim under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. DRI sought injunctive and declaratory relief to challenge the refusal of the Coroner to provide timely access to the records sought. Ada County filed a motion to remand the case, but the motion was denied by Judge Edward J. Lodge on April 29, 2015. 2015 WL 1944003.</p><p>Disability Rights Idaho (DRI) is a non-profit corporation that has been designated by Idaho to protect and advocate on behalf of people with mental illness, as defined in the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et. seq. (“PAIMI”). (PAIMI is a federal mandate that gives authority to investigate complaints of abuse, neglect, due process and rights violations in public and private facilities that provide overnight mental health treatment.) The dispute arose when the Ada County Coroner refused to provide its investigatory records relating to a suicide death of an individual, who had been residing in an inpatient behavioral health unit of an Ada County hospital. The Coroner denied DRI’s request for non-public records and initiated this declaratory judgment action in State court in response to DRI’s letter that stated they would initiate a federal lawsuit if necessary.  DRI submitted an answer to the Coroner’s complaint and a counterclaim. </p><p>On June 15, 2015 both parties submitted Motions for Summary Judgment. In addition, DRI submitted a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Ada County Coroner argued that regardless of PAIMI, DRI did not have the right to access the Coroner’s records of its death investigation, because the Coroner was not an “agency” as defined by PAIMI. The Coroner had also cited federal and state privacy concerns and questioned DRI’s probable cause to investigate the death. On July 20, 2015, the Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest stating that federal law was clear that P&A’s had broad access to investigatory records relating to mental health treatment facilities. The DOJ also stated that the Coroner’s office was an “agency charged with investigating,” as stated in PAIMI, because it was a division of the Ada County government that was responsible for investigating deaths.</p><p>On March 7, 2016, Judge Edward J. Lodge entered a judgment in favor of DRI. The court held that the Coroner was an “agency charged with investigating” reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury under PAIMI and that the Coroner needed to release the records to DRI. 168 F.Supp.3d 1282. The case is now closed.</p>",

Accordingly, in the interest of \navoiding further delay, and because the Court conclusively finds that the decisional process \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 1 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 2 of 32 \nwould not be significantly aided by oral argument, the motions shall be decided on the record \nbefore this Court without a hearing.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  This case arises from DisAbility Rights Idaho, Inc.’s (“DRI”) request for various reports \nprepared  by  Ada  County  Coroner  Erwin  Sonnenberg  (hereinafter  “Coroner”)  during  his \ninvestigation of the death of a patient at a local hospital.1  DRI is a non-profit corporation which \nhas been designated by the State of Idaho to protect and advocate on behalf of people with \nmental illness, as defined in the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act \nof 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et. seq. (“PAIMI”).   \nIn March 2014, D.T. was involuntarily committed at an inpatient psychiatric hospital \nlocated in Boise, Idaho.  (Dkt. 31-2, ¶ 9.)  Shortly thereafter, D.T. died.  In the performance of \nhis  statutory  duties  under  Idaho  law,  the  Coroner  investigated  D.T.’s  death,  conducted  an \nautopsy, prepared reports, and ruled D.T.’s death a suicide. (Dkt. 32-2, p. 2.)   \nAt DRI’s request, the psychiatric hospital provided DRI with the confidential patient \nrecords related to D.T.’s psychiatric care and treatment and the circumstances of D.T.’s death.  \n(Dkt. 31-2, ¶ 13.)  DRI alleges a review of such records led it to determine there was probable \ncause to believe that D.T.’s death may have resulted from abuse or neglect, and that it thereafter \ncommenced its PAIMI investigation.  (Id., ¶ 14.) \nIn furtherance of this investigation, DRI sent the Coroner a letter on May 29, 2014 \n                                                 \n1 Dotti Owens became the duly elected coroner for Ada County as of January 1, \n2015.  Because Erwin Sonnenberg was named as a party to this case in his official \ncapacity, Dotti Owens, as his successor, is automatically substituted as a party pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d). \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 2  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 3 of 32 \nidentifying itself as Idaho’s Protection and Advocacy System (“P&A”), and requesting copies of \nany “autopsy reports, coroners’ reports, inquest transcripts, investigative reports, medical and \ntoxicology reports, and other records or documents that were reviewed or relied upon in reaching \nthe conclusions and finding concerning [D.T.’s] death.”  (Id., ¶ 15.)  After several rounds of \ndiscussion between the parties, the Coroner refused to provide D.T.’s records, and, together with \nAda County, ultimately filed an action against DRI in Idaho State Court (“state court action”).  \nThe state court action sought a declaratory judgment holding the Coroner was not required by \nstate or federal law to provide DRI with the records it requested related to D.T.’s suicide, and \nthat providing such records to DRI would violate the privacy rights of D.T., D.T.’s family, \nand/or individuals who interacted with D.T.  (Dkt. 1-3.)    \nDRI removed the state court action to this Court and filed a counterclaim against the \nCoroner.  (Dkt. 1; Dkt. 5.)  DRI’s counterclaim seeks injunctive and declaratory relief under \nPAIMI and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as attorney fees and costs under § 1983.  After the \nCoroner and Ada County unsuccessfully moved to remand this action to state court,2 the parties \nfiled the pending motions.  The Department of  Justice subsequently submitted a Statement of  \nInterest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517 because this case involves the proper interpretation and \napplication of federal law.  (Dkt. 40.)    \nSTATUTORY BACKROUND \n  Congress enacted PAIMI in 1986 after finding individuals with mental illness “are \nsubject to neglect, including lack of treatment, adequate nutrition, clothing, health care, and \nadequate discharge planning.”  42 U.S.C. § 10801(a)(3).  PAIMI helps protect and advance the \n                                                 \n2 See Dkt. 24. \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 3 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 4 of 32 \ninterests of those with mental illness by requiring, as a condition of federal funding, that states \nestablish P&A systems with authority to investigate and remedy suspected abuse or neglect.  42 \nU.S.C. § 10803.  Under PAIMI, states may designate either an independent state agency or a \nprivate entity as their P&A.  42 U.S.C. § 10802(2).  DRI, a private entity, is Idaho’s designated \nP&A system.  (Dkt. 31-2, ¶ 8.)   \nUnder PAIMI, DRI has the power to “pursue administrative, legal, and other appropriate \nremedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are receiving care or \ntreatment in the state.”  42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(B).  To further these objectives, DRI has \nextensive authority to access individuals, patient records, and public and private facilities.3  42 \nU.S.C. 10805(a)(3); see also Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program v. J.S. Tarwater \nDevelopmental Ctr., 97 F.3d 492, 497 (11th Cir. 1996) (hereinafter “Tarwater”)(“It is clear that \n[PAIMI] provides express authority for P&As to gain broad access to records, facilities, and \nresidents to ensure that [PAIMI’s] mandates can be effectively pursued.”). \n  When incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness are either reported \nto a P&A, or where the P&A has probable cause4 to believe such incidents have occurred, a \n                                                 \n3 The P&A mandate under PAIMI extends to “individuals with mental illness” \nwho are an inpatient or resident in a facility rendering care and treatment.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 10802(4)(B)(i).  Such “facilities” include, but are not limited to, “hospitals” and \n“community facilities for individuals with mental illness.”  42 U.S.C. § 10802(3).   \n4 For purposes of PAIMI, “probable cause” is defined as:  \n[R]easonable grounds for belief that an individual with mental illness has been, or \nmay be at significant risk of being subject to abuse or neglect.  The individual \nmaking such determination may base the decision on reasonable inferences drawn \nfrom his or her experience or training regarding similar incidents, conditions or \nproblems that are usually associated with abuse or neglect. \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 4 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 5 of 32 \nP&A such as DRI shall, “in accordance with section 10806 … have access to all records of … \nany individual who is a client of the system if such individual, or the legal guardian, conservator, \nor other legal representative of such individual, has authorized the system to have such access.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 10805(A)(4).  PAIMI further provides the P&A shall have access to all records of: \nany individual (including an individual who has died or whose whereabouts are \nunknown) \n(i)\t   who by reason of the mental or physical condition of such individual is \nunable to authorize the system to have such access; \n(ii)\t   who does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal \nrepresentative, or for whom the legal guardian is the State; and  \n(iii)\t   with respect to whom a complaint has been received by the system or with \nrespect to whom as a result of monitoring or other activities (either of which \nresult from a complaint or other evidence) there is probable cause to believe \nthat such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect. \n42 U.S.C. § 10805(B). \n  Although § 10805 does not define the term “records,” several courts have concluded the \ndefinition of “records” in § 10806 is applicable to the term as used in § 10805.  See \nPennsylvania Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Houstoun, 228 F.3d 423, 426 (3d Cir. 2000); \nConnecticut Office of Prot. and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Hartford Bd. of Educ., \n355 F.Supp.2d 649, 660 (D. Conn. 2005); Iowa Prot. and Advocacy Services, Inc. v. Gerard \nTreatment Programs, L.L.C., 152 F.Supp.2d 1150, 1160 (N.D. Iowa 2001); Ctr. for Legal \nAdvocacy v. Hammons, 323 F.3d 1262, 1272 n. 7 (10th Cir. 2003) (“We agree with the Third \nCircuit that §§ 10805 and 10806 should not be read in isolation.  Section 10806 amplifies and \ndescribes what kind of records are included in those records to which a P&A System has access \nunder § 10805[.]”).  Therefore, for purposes of the relevant provisions of PAIMI, the term  \n                                                                                                                                                             \n42 C.F.R. § 51.2. \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 5  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 6 of 32 \n“records” includes: \nReports prepared by any staff of a facility rendering care and treatment or reports \nprepared by an agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, \nand injury occurring at such facility that describe incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury \noccurring at such facility and the steps taken to investigate such incidents, and discharge \nplanning records. \n42 U.S.C. § 10806(b)(3)(A). \n  In this case, it is undisputed that D.T. was a patient involuntarily committed at an \ninpatient psychiatric hospital located in Boise in or about March, 2014.  (Dkt. 5, ¶ 32; Dkt. 8, p. \n3.)  As such, D.T. meets the definition of an “individual with mental illness” who was an \ninpatient or resident in a “facility” rendering care and treatment pursuant to PAIMI.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 10802(4)(B)(i)(I), § 10802(3).  It is also undisputed that D.T. committed suicide while \nreceiving psychiatric care and treatment at the hospital.  (Dkt. 5, ¶ 33; Dkt. 8, pp. 3-4.)  The \nprimary issue in this case is thus whether the Coroner can be considered “an agency charged \nwith investigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury” occurring at a facility for \npatients with mental illness.  DRI contends the records the Coroner compiled in the course of  \nthe investigation of D.T.’s death fall within the “records” definition enumerated within PAIMI.  \nAda County and the Coroner counter the Coroner is not an “agency” as used in the definition of \n“records” under PAIMI, and that DRI is accordingly not entitled to the Coroner’s records. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  The Court should grant summary judgment if there are no genuine issues of material fact \nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(c).  If the \nmoving party shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact, the nonmoving party must \ngo beyond the pleadings and designate facts showing an issue for trial.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 6 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 7 of 32 \n477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  A mere scintilla of evidence, or evidence that is merely colorable \nor not significantly probative, does not present a genuine issue of material fact.  United \nSteelworkers of Am. v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 865 F.2d 1539, 1542 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986).  \n  The substantive law governing a claim determines whether a fact is material.  T.W. Elec. \nServ. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass’n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).  The court should \nresolve reasonable doubts about the existence of a material fact issue against the moving party, \nand should view inferences drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty.  Id. at 631.  Where, as here, the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, \nmany of the facts are not contested.  When no genuine issue of material fact exists, the sole \nquestion is whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. \nProc. 56(c). \n  As an alternative to summary judgment, DRI seeks dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(h)(3) of the Coroner and Ada County’s Complaint for lack of standing and \nsubject matter jurisdiction, and judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(c) and17(a) because the Coroner and County have failed to allege the existence of \na “substantial controversy” between the parties which would entitle them to declaratory relief.   \n(Dkt. 31-1, pp. 8-16.)  The Court finds both requests misplaced.  The Court has federal question \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 as it pertains to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and PAIMI, 42 U.S.C. § \n10801, et. seq.  See also Dkt. 24.  This suit involves the Coroner’s purported legal obligation to \nprovide records to DRI under PAIMI, and thus provides the Coroner with standing to assert its \nclaims.  Further, the judgment in this case will serve a useful purpose in clarifying the Coroner’s \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 7 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 8 of 32 \nduty to provide DRI with requested records and will terminate and afford relief from the \nuncertainty, insecurity and controversy giving rise to this proceeding.  A declaratory judgment \nis accordingly justiciable and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) provides \nadditional basis for federal jurisdiction.  See Bilbrey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462, 1470 (9th Cir. \n1984).  The Court will not further address DRI’s requests for dismissal and judgment on the \npleadings, and instead proceeds solely to the issue of whether or not DRI is entitled to the \nrecords it seeks as a matter of law.5 \nANALYSIS \n  The crux of this dispute is DRI’s right to access the records from the Coroner’s \ninvestigation of D.T.’s death.  DRI contends it has authority under PAIMI to access the \nCoroner’s investigatory records pertaining to the death of D.T.  The Coroner responds that \nDRI’s reading of PAIMI is overbroad and that DRI’s right of access to records under PAIMI \ndoes not extend to records of a death investigation undertaken by a county coroner.  The \nCoroner further suggests that release of D.T.’s records to DRI would violate the privacy rights of \n                                                 \n5 The Court will, however, grant DRI’s request that Ada County be dismissed \nfrom this case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) and 17(a) because it is \nnot a real party in interest.  As DRI notes, the County has not had any involvement, \ninterest, or stake in the events alleged in this matter or in the controversy alleged in the \nComplaint.  Instead, only the Coroner has any involvement in the matters alleged, and \nonly the Coroner will be required to release records if the Court so orders.  Ada County \nfailed to respond to this argument in its response to DRI’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  The Court accordingly finds the issue waived and dismisses Ada County \nfrom this action. Image Technical Serv., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 903 F.2d 612, 615 n. \n1 (9th Cir. 1990); Reliance Ins. Co. v. Doctors Co., 299 F.Supp.2d 1131, 1154 (D. Haw. \n2003) (“Failure to raise issues in opposition to summary judgment functions as a waiver” \nof the argument); Samica Enters. LLC v. MailBoxes Etc., Inc., 460 Fed. App’x 665, 666 \n(9th Cir. 2011) (arguments not raised in opposition to summary judgment are waived.).    \n  \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 8 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 9 of 32 \nthe decedent and various third parties, and that releasing such records would subject the Coroner \nto liability.  The Coroner also challenges certain aspects of DRI’s request for records in this \ncase, including DRI’s probable cause determination with respect to D.T. and the absence of \nconsent from D.T.’s legal guardian(s).  Finally, the Coroner challenges DRI’s right to relief \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The Court will address each of these issues in turn. \n1.   Access to the Coroner’s Records under PAIMI \nDRI contends any records created by the Coroner as a result of his investigation into the \ndeath of D.T. qualify as “records” to which DRI is entitled access pursuant to PAIMI.  \nSpecifically, DRI argues the Coroner’s records constitute “reports prepared by an agency \ncharged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect or injury occurring at [a mental \nhealth] facility.”  42 U.S.C. § 10806(b)(3)(A).  The Coroner maintains a “plain reading” of \nPAIMI clearly shows that it does not apply to the Coroner’s records.  (Dkt. 32-1, p. 8.)  First, \nthe Coroner argues its records do not meet the definition of “records” found in § 10806 because \nthe Coroner is not a “facility” as used in the definition of “records.”  In support of this \nargument, the Coroner notes it is “not a hospital, nursing home, community facility for \nindividuals with mental illness, a board and care home, homeless shelter, or a jail or a prison, nor \ndoes it render care and treatment.”  (Dkt. 32-1, pp. 8-9).  The fact that the Coroner is not a \n“facility” is immaterial; the potential abuse or neglect took place at a local hospital, and the \nhospital clearly meets the definition of a facility.  42 U.S.C. § 10802(3) (defining “facility” to \ninclude “hospitals, nursing homes, community facilities for individuals with mental illness, \nboard and care homes, homeless shelters, and jails and prisons.”).  Moreover, DRI does not \nclaim it is entitled to the Coroner’s records under the first portion of § 10806(b)(3)(A), “reports \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 9 \n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 10 of 32 \nprepared by any staff of a facility rendering care and treatment,”  and nowhere suggests the \nCoroner is a “facility” under PAIMI.  Instead, DRI contends it is entitled to the Coroner’s \nrecords under the second, disjunctive portion of § 10806(b)(3)(A), because the Coroner is an \n“agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect and injury occurring at \nsuch facility.” \nSecond, the Coroner argues it is not an “agency” as used in the definition of “records,” \nfound in § 10806(b)(3) because: \nThe term ‘agency’ in its common usage is defined as the office or function of an agent; \nan establishment engaged in doing business for another; an administrative division (as of \na government)….  The Ada County Coroner is none of these.  The Coroner is not an \nadministrative division of the government, it does not engage in doing business for \nanother, nor does it have the function of an agent.  The Coroner is an independent, \nelected office pursuant to the laws and constitution of the state of Idaho, and determines \nthe cause and manner of death.   \n \n(Dkt. 32-1, p. 9).6  \n \nWhen interpreting the language of a statute, the starting point is always the language of \nthe statute itself.  Yocupicio v. PAE Group, LLC, 795 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir. 2015) (citation \nomitted).  If the language is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute controls.  \nId.  In ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must look not only to the specific \nprovision at issue, but also to “the structure of the statute as a whole, including its object and \npolicy.”  Id.  If a court finds ambiguity, it should “examine the statute in the context of the \nentire statutory scheme, reason, and public policy to effect a construction that reflects the \nLegislature’s intent.”  Fifty-Six Hope Road Music, Ltd. v. A.V.E.L.A., Inc., 778 F.3d 1059, 1081 \n                                                 \n6 Citing Merriam-Webster.com; http://www.merriam  \nwebster.com/dictionary/agency. \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 10  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 11 of 32 \n(9th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted); see also United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, \n241 (1989) (when “the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds \nwith the intention of its drafters … the intention of the drafters, rather than the strict language, \ncontrols.”); In re HP Inkjet Printer Litig., 716 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir. 2013) (a statute’s \nmeaning was clear when “interpreted collectively and in context, and read together with the \nstatute’s purpose and legislative history.”).   \nThe parties do not dispute that the Coroner is charged by applicable Idaho statute with \ninvestigating reports of certain deaths, such as D.T.’s death by suicide.  Compare Dkt. 32-1, p. \n10 (noting pursuant to I.C. § 19-4301, the Coroner is charged with investigating deaths which \noccur as a result of violence, whether by homicide, suicide or accident) with Dkt. 31-1, p. 23 \n(“According to Idaho code, a county coroner is charged with the investigation of deaths, \nincluding those resulting from suicide or accident.”)  What this Court must determine is whether \na rational and logical reading of PAIMI permits the conclusion that the Coroner’s records \nconstitute “reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of \nabuse, neglect and injury[.]”  42 U.S.C. § 10806(b)(3)(A).   \n  Neither the PAIMI Act nor the implementing regulations define the term “agency.”  Nor \nhave courts interpreted “agency” within the context of § 10806 in any published decision.  In \napparently the only case to consider the issue of whether PAIMI extends to the records of a \ncounty coroner, the Eastern District Court for the District of Wisconsin found Wisconsin’s P&A \nwas entitled to such records under the clear meaning of the statute in an unpublished decision.  \nWisconsin Coal. for Advocacy, Inc. v. Barry Busby, Case No. 02-C-871 (E.D. Wis. September \n24, 2003) (Dkt. 1-12).  In so holding, the court explained: \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 11  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 12 of 32 \nA coroner’s office is an agency charged with investigating deaths (certainly a form of \ninjury), including deaths of individuals with mental illnesses that are the result of abuse \nand neglect.  The definition of the word ‘agency’ includes ‘a person or thing through \nwhich power is exerted or an end is achieved,’ as well as ‘an administrative division (as \nof a government)’.… The duty to investigate reports of incidents of abuse, neglect and \ninjury occurring at facilities covered by [PAIMI] is implicit in the broader duty of a \ncoroner to investigate suspicious deaths within his or her jurisdiction. \n \nId. at 12 (citing Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 22 (10th ed. 1999)).   \n \n  The Coroner suggests the absence of published cases regarding this issue supports the \nposition that PAIMI and its regulations were not meant to apply to coroners’ offices.  (Dkt. \n32-1, p. 10 n. 13.)  However, as DRI notes, the dearth of cases to address the issue could also \nmean that other county coroners “simply comply with the provisions of the PAIMI Act and \nprovide a P&A with their records when requested, thereby negating the need for federal \nlitigation.”  (Dkt. 39, p. 2, n. 1.)  In any event, the Court finds the rational offered by the Busby  \ndecision persuasive, as both the plain meaning of § 10806 and the legislative intent of PAIMI \nsuggest DRI is entitled to the Coroner’s records.  \nThe Coroner can be considered an “agency” under the plain meaning of § 10806 because \nthe definition of the word “agency” includes an administrative division of government.    Idaho \ncoroners are granted authority from both Idaho statute and the Idaho constitution.  See Idaho \nConst. art. 18, § 6; I.C. § 31-2801 et. seq.; I.C. § 19-4301.  The Ada County government decides \nthe pay of the Coroner’s office deputies and pathologist, and pays them from county funds.  I.C. \n§ 31-2809.    The Ada County commissioners have the power to remove the Coroner or confirm  \na coroner appointed by the executive.  I.C. § 31-5213.  The Coroner’s budget is paid from Ada \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 12  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 13 of 32 \nCounty’s general fund.7  The Coroner is also a governmental entity charged with investigating \nsuspicious deaths.  I.C. § 19-4301(1).  Each of these facts suggest the Coroner administers \ncertain business of the county.   \n  An Idaho Supreme Court decision also supports the finding that the Ada County Coroner \nis an administrative division of government.  In Dep’t of Emp’t v. Ada Cnty. Fair Bd., 532 P.2d \n933 (Idaho 1974), the court considered whether the Ada County Fair Board could be considered \n“an administrative division of county government.”  Id. at 593-95.  Like the Coroner’s officer, \nthe Fair Board was statutorily authorized, was funded in Ada County’s budget, the county \ncommissioners had the power to select the Board’s members, and the Board’s funds ultimately \nbelonged to the general fund of Ada County.  The Idaho Supreme Court noted that Ada County \nheld ultimate control over the Fair Board’s existence and thus, the Fair Board was an \nadministrative division of Ada County.  Further “[a]s an inseparable part of Ada County, \nservices performed by the Fair Board ipso facto are performed in the county’s employ.”  Id. at \n594.  The Coroner is similarly a division of Ada County responsible for investigating deaths. \n  Further, that the Coroner is elected rather than appointed or hired is not dispositive.  The \nCoroner has not cited any cases or other authority to suggest whether an entity is a division of \ngovernment turns on whether the head of the office was elected.  Indeed, if this were the case, \nadministrative entities such as the Ada County Highway District would not be considered an \nadministrative division of government simply because its commissioners are elected.  What is \n                                                 \n7 See Ada County State of Idaho, 2014-2015 Ada County Final Budget (“Ada \nCounty Budget”), \nhttps://adacounty.id.gov/Portals/o/CAR/Financia/Ada%20County%20FY15%20Adopted \n%20Budget.pdf. \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 13  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 14 of 32 \nsignificant is not whether an entity’s director is elected, but is instead the role an entity \nfulfills—in this case, an official role to administer certain business of the county.  See, e.g., Dkt. \n32-1, pp. 9-11 (listing various responsibilities of the Coroner).  The Coroner’s office is properly \nviewed under the clear terms of PAIMI as an “agency charged with investigating” because \n“investigating” is what it exists to do, regardless of how the Coroner acquired the position. \nIn addition to the plain meaning of § 10806, the legislative intent behind the statute \nillustrates DRI is entitled to the Coroner’s records in this case.  The PAIMI legislative history \nindicates that the term “agency” refers to “any State, county, or municipal agency charged with \nthe responsibility of investigating incidents of abuse and neglect in public residential facilities \nfor the treatment of mentally ill individuals.”  S.2393, 100th Cong., 134 Cong. Rec. S14450-03, \n1988 WL 180662; S.2393, 100th Cong., 134 Cong. Rec. H9648-01 (1988), 1988 WL 177000 \n(emphasis added).  The Coroner is a county entity charged with the responsibility of \ninvestigating suspicious deaths, wherever they may occur.  Moreover, the P&A system was \ndesigned to ensure that individuals with disabilities are protected from abuse and neglect \nwherever they receive treatment.  See S. Rep. No. 99-109 at 10 (1985), reprinted in 1986 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1361, 1370 (“The Committee recognizes the need for full access to facilities and \nclients and to their records in order to ensure the protection of mentally ill persons.  It is the \nintent of the Committee that the [P&A] system  have the fullest possible access to client \nrecords….”) (emphasis added).  Denying DRI access to the Coroner’s records would undermine \nthis intent. \nInterpreting “agency charged with investigating” to include a coroner’s office is also \nconsistent with the purpose of PAIMI.  Congress enacted PAIMI as an “independent check” on \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 14  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 15 of 32 \nexisting state systems designed to investigate abuse and neglect of the mentally ill.  Iowa Prot. \nand Advocacy Services, Inc. v. Rasmussen, 206 F.R.D. 630, 639 (S.D. Iowa 2001); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 10801(a)(4).  Under PAIMI, P&A’s are given broad authority to investigate incidents of abuse \nand neglect of individuals with mental illness and to pursue administrative, legal, and other \nremedies on behalf of those individuals.  42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1).  To achieve those objectives, \nPAIMI requires that the P&A have access to “all records” of any individual who meets the \ncriteria of § 10805(a)(4)(A) or, as in this case, of § 10805(a)(4)(B).  Access to autopsy and other \ndeath investigation reports is essential to this task, as these reports contain the best, and \nsometimes only, evidence as to the precise cause of death.  Without such information, the ability \nof DRI to conduct a full investigation into the death of D.T. would be severely limited.  See \nBusby, at 13. \nOther courts to interpret various aspects of the “records” a P&A is entitled to under \nPAIMI have also interpreted the provision broadly.  For example, the Seventh Circuit rejected \nthe Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction’s (“DPI”) similar attempt to deny it was an \n“agency charged with investigating” in order to avoid producing records under PAIMI in \nDisability Rights Wisconsin, Inc. v. Wisconsin Dep’t of Public Instruc., 463 F.3d 719, 726-27 \n(7th Cir. 2006).   In so holding, the Court explained: \nThe argument that DPI itself is not an agency charged with investigating reports of abuse \nor neglect is … beside the point.  For starters, DPI did in fact investigate complaints of \npotential abuse or neglect at [a facility].  And in the end, it is up to [the P&A] to \ndetermine whether abuse did in fact occur; preventing [the P&A] from obtaining the \ninformation it needs to investigate on the basis that DPI did something it was not required \nto do frustrates the goals of the federal P&A system.     \n \nId. \nThe Third Circuit interpreted § 10805 expansively in Pennsylvania Prot. & Advocacy, \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 15  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 16 of 32 \nInc. v. Houstoun, 228 F.3d 423, 427 (3d Cir. 2000), and determined a state P&A was entitled to \npeer review reports prepared by a hospital despite the hospital’s contention that such reports \nwere not “records of any individual” under § 10805 because peer review reports belong to the \nhospital, and not to an individual patient. The Court rejected the hospital’s contention, and \ndetermined the preposition “of” in § 10805 “may be used to show connection or association as \nwell as ownership, and it seems clear that the term is used in the former sense here.”  (citation \nomitted). The Third Circuit determined the state P&A was entitled to peer review reports \nprepared by a hospital, despite the hospital’s contention that such reports were not records “of \nany individual,” because peer review reports pertain to a patient, regardless of whether they were \nprepared by a hospital.  Id. at 427.   \nIn Ctr. for Legal Advocacy v. Hammons, 323 F.3d 1262 (10th Cir. 2003), a facility \nsimilarly denied a P&A access to peer review and quality assurance records.  The facility in \nHammons argued § 10805 of PAIMI grants access to all records of patients, which do not \ninclude peer review or quality assurance records, and § 10806 grants access only to certain \nrecords of hospitals and agencies, so that § 10805’s arguably expansive language (providing \naccess to “all records of … any individual”) is inapplicable to § 10806, and does not compel the \nconclusion that peer review and quality assurance records are hospital records under § 10806.  \nId. at 1267.  The Tenth Circuit rejected this interpretation of the statute, finding Colorado’s \nP&A should have access to peer review and quality assurance records.  In so holding, the Court \nexplained: \nWe begin by noting that the statutory phrase ‘all records of…any individual’ is quite \nbroad.  While defendants urge us to follow the district court and find that this addresses \nonly ‘patient records,’ and not ‘hospital records,’ and peer review and quality assurance \nrecords are not ‘patient records’ because they do not ‘belong’ to the patient, we agree \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 16  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 17 of 32 \nwith the Third Circuit’s observation that ‘of’ in this context need not be read so narrowly. \n Thus, a rational reading is that it refers to records pertaining to or relating to an \nindividual…  Peer review or quality assurance records involving the care of an \nindividual could easily fit within that definition of records, along with myriad other \nrecords relating to an individual and/or his or her care. \n \nId. at 1270 (citing Houstoun, 228 F.3d at 427) (emphasis added). \n \nCorrespondingly, the term “agency” should not be interpreted as narrowly as the Coroner \nsuggests.  As the Department of Justice argues in its Statement of Interest: \nInterpreting ‘agency charged with investigating’ to include a coroner’s office is \nconsistent with the purpose of PAIMI.  One tool at the P&A’s disposal is the ability to \nobtain records to aid in its investigation.  Coroner’s offices are in a unique position to \nprovide indispensable evidence in an investigation and may be the only entities that \nperform a detailed examination of the decedent’s body.  If coroners can withhold their \nrecords, an important investigatory tool will be lost to the P&As, and their ability to \ninvestigate will be compromised.  That is not what Congress intended. \n \n(Dkt. 40, pp. 12-13.) \n \nIn sum, the records the Coroner compiled in its investigation of D.T.’s death fall within \nthe definition of “records” found in 42 U.S.C. § 10806(b)(3)(A).  The Coroner can be \nconsidered an “agency charged with investigating” under the plain meaning of the statute, and \nthis interpretation is consistent with the congressional purpose underlying PAIMI.   \n2.   Privacy Issues \nThe Coroner contends it may be liable for disclosing private facts about an individual \nunder Idaho and federal law, and that the personal privacy rights of D.T. and D.T.’s family \nmembers, as well as the personal privacy rights of hospital employees and family members \nmentioned in the Coroner’s records, preclude the Coroner from providing its investigative \nrecords to DRI.  (Dkt. 32-1, pp. 11-14.)  Although the Court appreciates the Coroner’s \nconcerns, federal cases interpreting PAIMI establish such fears are unfounded.   \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 17  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 18 of 32 \nUnder its express terms, PAIMI preempts any state law, including any state privacy laws, \nwhich would give the Coroner the right to withhold D.T.’s records from DRI.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 10806(b)(2)(C).   Federal courts interpreting PAIMI have consistently concluded that the \naccess to records provided by PAIMI preempts state law providing greater restrictions on access. \n See Houstoun, 228 F.3d at 427 (“PAIMI preempts any state law that gives a healthcare facility \nthe right to withhold such records); Coal. for Advocacy, Inc. v. Czaplewski, 131 F.Supp.2d 1039, \n1048 (E.D. Wis. 2001) (“[I]f there is a conflict between the federal statutes and the state statute \nwith respect to the agency/system’s authority to have access to the records of an individual with \ndevelopmental disabilities or mental illness, it is the federal statutes which control.  To hold \notherwise would fly in the face of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.”); Rasmussen, 206 \nF.R.D. at 639 (“Protection and advocacy systems are established as independent checks on state \ncare and regulation of care for dependent adults.  That independent check would become  \nmeaningless if a state was allowed to simply legislate away a protection and advocacy system’s \npower to investigate by enacting restrictions.”); Advocacy Ctr. v. Stalder, 128 F.Supp.2d 358, \n367 (M.D. La. 1999) (The authority to investigate “would mean nothing and advocacy in the \nform of investigation would be ineffective” if federal law did not preempt state law denying \naccess); Mo. Protection and Advocacy Services v. Mo. Dep’t of Health, 447 F.3d 1021, 1024 (8th \nCir. 2006) (PAIMI preempts conflicting state law).  To the extent Idaho privacy law prevents \nthe release of the Coroner’s records, PAIMI preempts such law and mandates that the Coroner \nrelease such records to DRI.    \n  The Coroner’s concerns about federal privacy rights are also addressed by PAIMI.  \nSpecifically, PAIMI requires the P&A to maintain records in a confidential manner: \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 18  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 19 of 32 \nAn eligible [P&A] system which, pursuant to section 10805(a)(4) of this title, has access \nto records which, under Federal or State law, are required to be maintained in a \nconfidential manner by a provider of mental health services, shall, except as provided in \nsubsection (b) of this section, maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same  \nextent as is required of the provider of such services. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 10806(a).8   \nCourts interpreting PAIMI have repeatedly determined that privacy concerns should not \nact as a bar to disclosure to a protection and advocacy system because PAIMI provides sufficient \nconfidentiality protection.  Czaplewski, 131 F.Supp.2d at 1052 (allowing the P&A access to \nrecords of nursing home patients would not unduly intrude on their privacy rights because \nPAIMI requires the P&A to keep such records confidential); Stalder, 128 F.Supp.2d at 366 \n(concluding the confidentiality of records would not be affected because the P&A is required to \nmaintain the confidentiality of the records under PAIMI and “there is no reason to suspect that \nthe confidentiality of the records will be breached.”); Iowa Prot. and Advocacy Services, Inc. v. \nGerard Treatment Programs, 152 F.Supp.2d 1150, 1175 (N.D. Iowa 2001) (“Nor can [the \nfacility] realistically argue that an interest in maintaining confidentiality of the records \noutweighs permitting [the P&A] to have the access it seeks…because [the P&A] must maintain \nthe confidentiality of any records to the same extent [the facility] itself must.”); Tarwater, 97 \nF.3d at 499 (no liberty interest of the developmentally disabled person is threatened by \ndisclosure of records to the P&A because it is precisely that interest that the P&A seeks to \nprotect); Disability Rights Wisconsin, 463 F.3d at 729-30 (“The point of the federal P&A statutes \nis to establish and equip a specialized agency to look out for individuals with mental illness.  \nConfounding the agency in the name of an illusory concern for privacy defeats that very \n                                                 \n8 P&A’s are also required to maintain confidentiality under 42 C.F.R. § 51.45.  \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 19  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 20 of 32 \nimportant goal.”).   \nThis analysis not only extends to the privacy rights of the individual with mental illness, \nbut also to the privacy rights of their family members.  See, e.g., Connecticut Office of Prot. and \nAdvocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 355 F.Supp.2d 649, 664 (D. \nConn. 2005) (allowing P&A systems access to records in the limited circumstances provided for \nin PAIMI does not contravene Congress’ intent to maintain parents’ confidentiality); Tarwater, \n97 F.3d at 497-99 (neither students with disabilities nor their parents are harmed when a P&A \nagency is permitted access to students’ records); Disability Rights Wisconsin, 463 F.3d at 730 \n(privacy interests are outweighed by a P&A’s broad mandate to investigate and remedy \nsuspected abuse and neglect).  The aforementioned cases illustrate the Coroner’s concern with \nviolating federal privacy rights is unfounded.  The strict statutory requirement that DRI keep \nany records confidential defeats any alleged privacy concerns raised by the Coroner. \nDespite both the express mandate of PAIMI that P&As keep records confidential and the \nwealth of cases holding disclosure to a P&A does not violate privacy rights, the Coroner \nmaintains “there is a concern over the initial release to DRI—simply releasing the Records to \nanyone, DRI or otherwise, raises privacy concerns.”  (Dkt. 35, p. 8) (emphasis in original). The \nSeventh Circuit addressed a similar argument in Disability Rights Wisconsin, 463 F.3d at 728, \nand held that because both the P&A and the agency charged with investigating must observe \nsimilar confidentiality requirements, the case “at bottom” involved the “confidential exchange of \ninformation between two agencies” and “[g]iven the duty of confidentiality common to both \norganizations, [the P&A’s] possession of the information seems no more troubling as a privacy \nmatter than [the agency’s] possession.”  Id. at 729.   Similarly, the confidential exchange of \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 20  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 21 of 32 \ninformation between the Coroner and DRI fails to raise any additional privacy concerns. \nFinally, the Coroner argues the outcome of this case will affect the Coroner’s duty to \ndisclose records in future cases and could significantly impact the effective administration of \nIdaho’s state criminal justice system.  (Dkt. 32-1, p. 14.)  The Coroner fails to articulate exactly \nhow being required to provide records pursuant to PAIMI would negatively impact either the \nCoroner or Idaho’s criminal justice system.  Nor does the Coroner identify any statutory or case \nlaw authority to support the claim that providing D.T.’s records to DRI would have such an \nunidentified negative impact.  Further, as the Department of Justice notes in its Statement of \nInterest: \nThe Coroner’s speculation that disclosing its records will somehow compromise \ncriminal investigations statewide misunderstands the effect of PAIMI access.  The \nP&A does not confiscate the coroner’s records, make them unavailable to the criminal \njustice system, or in any way interfere with the coroner’s ability to do her job.  Access \nmeans only that, and nothing precludes an Idaho coroner’s office from continuing to \nfulfill its statutory duties while also complying with PAIMI.   \n \n(Dkt. 40, p. 17.)  \n \n  The Court is not persuaded that the Coroner or the Idaho criminal justice system would \nbe negatively impacted by requiring disclosure of records to DRI when PAIMI applies. \n3.    Conditions to DRI’s Right to Access D.T.’s Records \na.   Legal Representative \nThe Coroner suggests DRI is not entitled to D.T.’s records because the conditions of 42 \nU.S.C. § 10805 have not been met.  Specifically, § 10805(a)(4)(B) of PAIMI provides that a \nstate’s P&A system shall have access to the records of: \nAny individual (including an individual who has died or whose whereabouts are \nunknown) \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 21  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 22 of 32 \n(i) \t     who by reason of the mental or physical condition of such individual is \nunable to authorize the system to have such access; \n(ii) \t     who does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal \nrepresentative, or for whom the legal guardian is the State; and  \n(iii) \t     with respect to whom a complaint has been received by the system or \nwith respect to whom as a result of monitoring or other activities (either \nof which result from a complaint or other evidence) there is probable \ncause to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse or \nneglect. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4)(B). \n \n  The Coroner submits these conditions must exist prior to a P&A being allowed to access \ncertain records, and that there is no evidence that D.T. did not have a legal guardian, conservator \nor other legal representative.  (Dkt. 38, p. 4.)  As DRI notes, however, cases have placed the \nburden of establishing the presence of a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative \non the entity blocking a P&A’s access.  (Dkt. 36, p. 11.)  As the court explained in Hartford \nBd. of Educ., 355 F.Supp.2d at 662, “[w]ithout the disclosure of the facility of the parents’ names \nand addresses, it may be impossible for the P&A to contact those parents; at the very least, it \nmight significantly delay the process.”  As such, courts have ordered a facility blocking access \nto records to provide the P&A with the names of an individual’s guardians, conservators or \nrepresentatives, if any.  Office of Prot. and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Armstrong, \n266 F.Supp.2d 303, 318 (D. Conn. 2003).   Placing the burden of identifying representatives on \nthe facility is consistent with the PAIMI regulations, particularly 42 C.F.R. § 51.43, which \nprovides: \n  Denial or delay of access. \nIf a P&A System’s access to facilities, programs, residents or records covered by the Act \nor this part is delayed or denied, the P&A system shall be provided promptly with a \nwritten statement of reasons, including, in the case of a denial for alleged lack of \nauthorization, the name, address and telephone number of the legal guardian, \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 22  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 23 of 32 \nconservator, or other legal representative of an individual with mental illness.  Access \nto facilities, records or residents shall not be delayed or denied without the prompt \nprovision of written statements of the reasons for the denial. \n42 C.F.R. § 51.43 (emphasis added). \n  The Court appreciates that the Coroner, unlike a healthcare facility, is unlikely to have \ninformation regarding D.T.’s legal representative or family members.  (Dkt. 38, p. 5, n. 5.)  \nHowever, that the Coroner lacks such information does not place an affirmative duty on DRI to \ndetermine whether D.T. has family members or representatives before it can access D.T.’s \nrecords.  Indeed, courts have determined PAIMI grants the P&A “overriding” authority to \nobtain access to patients and their records, even where a guardian is identified and refuses to \npermit the P&A access.  Gerard Treatment Programs, 152 F.Supp.2d at 1167-68 (“Reading the \nplain language of § 10805(a)(4) of the PAIMI Act in the context of the statute and its legislative \nhistory, the court concludes that this provision … provides that a P&A … is entitled to obtain \naccess to the records and patients necessary for its investigation, so long as other statutory \nprerequisites are met, regardless of the wishes of the guardian.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis \nadded).  It follows that DRI should have access here where there is no evidence to suggest D.T. \nhas a legal guardian, much less a guardian who objects to such access.  Moreover, under Idaho \nlaw, even if D.T. had a guardian appointed on her behalf, the guardian’s authority terminated \nupon D.T.’s death, rendering any alleged guardian’s consent ineffective and unnecessary.  I.C. \n§ 15-5-306 (“[T]he authority and responsibility of a guardian for an incapacitated person \nterminates upon the death of the guardian or ward.”).   \nb.  Probable Cause  \n  The Coroner also objects to providing investigatory records on the grounds that DRI has \nnot proved it had probable cause to believe that D.T. was subject to abuse or neglect.  (Dkt. \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 23  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 24 of 32 \n32-1, p. 7, n. 9.)  As mentioned, P&A’s have the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and \nneglect of individuals with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is \nprobable cause to believe that such incidents occurred.  42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(a); \n§ 10801(b)(2)(B).   \nFederal cases are clear that the P&A is the final arbiter of probable cause, and that an \nentity may not second-guess the P&A’s probable cause determination in order to withhold \nrecords.  In Arizona Ctr. for Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689, 692 (D. Ariz. 2000), a \nstate behavioral health agency refused to allow a P&A access to records under PAIMI.   The \nhealth agency withheld some files because it disagreed that there was probable cause to believe \nabuse or neglect had occurred.  Id. at 691.  The court instead held that the P&A “is the final \narbiter of probable cause for the purpose of triggering its authority to access all records for an \nindividual that may have been subject to abuse or neglect.”  Id. at 693.  In so holding, the court \nnoted, “[t]o conclude otherwise would frustrate the purpose of the P & A laws to establish an \neffective system to protect and advocate for the rights of individuals with disabilities.”  Id.  The \ncourt further held: “Neither the P&A laws nor the regulations promulgated thereunder \ncontemplate that the state or a service provider will reevaluate the P&A’s determination of  \nprobable cause and deny access to the P&A because the state or service provider disagrees that \nprobable cause exists.”  Id.  This position has been overwhelmingly agreed with by other \ncourts.  See, e.g., Rasmussen, 206 F.R.D. at 638 (“the statute is clear that it is the protection and \nadvocacy systems that shall make the relevant probable cause determination, as a result of its \n‘monitoring and other activities,’ and not a state agency.”) (emphasis in original); Gerard \nTreatment Programs, 152 F.Supp.2d at 1159; Tarwater, 97 F.3d at 494-95; Armstrong, 266 \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 24  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 25 of 32 \nF.Supp.2d at 321; Prot. & Advocacy System, Inc. v.

In short, DRI has determined probable cause exists to investigate D.T.’s death and \nthe Coroner is not permitted to challenge this conclusion.   \nc.  Judicial review of probable cause determination \nThe Coroner also suggests this Court is ultimately the final decision-maker regarding \nwhether probable cause exists, and offers the Court the opportunity to review the investigatory \nrecords of D.T.’s death in camera to assist with this determination.  (Dkt. 32-1, p. 4, n. 5; p. 7, \nn. 9.)  The Coroner does not provide any authority to support its contention that the Court is the \nfinal decision-maker regarding probable cause.  Moreover, cases interpreting PAIMI have \nrepeatedly held that a P&A’s probable cause determination does not require judicial review.  \nArmstrong, 266 F. Supp.2d at 321 (“[C]ourts have rejected attempts to require judicial review of \nthe P&A’s probable cause determination”) (citations omitted); Stalder, 128 F.Supp.2d at 367 \n(state policy of requiring in camera inspection by a court before releasing records to the state \nP&A clearly conflicted with PAIMI, would undermine P&A’s ability to investigate a claim and \neffectively advocate, and was preempted); Maryland Disability Law Ctr., Inc. v. Mt. Washington \nPediatric Hosp., Inc., 664 A.2d 16, 24 (Md. Ct. App. 1995) (finding it would be overly \nburdensome and unnecessary to require a P&A to convince the court that probable cause exists \nprior to having access to patients, personnel and records).  The Court accordingly declines the \nCoroner’s invitation to review DRI’s probable cause determination.  \n4.   DRI’s right to relief under § 1983  \nIn addition to declaratory and injunctive relief under PAIMI, DRI seeks attorney fees, \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 25  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 26 of 32 \ncosts and expenses, and declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Section 1983 \nprovides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of \nany State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other \nperson within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivations of any rights, privileges or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured[.]  \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.     \n  DRI claims that in failing to promptly grant it access to the records of his investigation of \nD.T.’s death, the Coroner, while acting under color of state law, deprived DRI of a right \nguaranteed by federal law.  The Coroner and DRI offer a number of arguments for and against \nDRI’s right to recover under § 1983. 9 However, even assuming DRI could establish a claim  \nunder § 1983, the Seventh Circuit has held: \nSection 1983 fits awkwardly with the PAIMI Act because a protection and advocacy \nsystem has rights against both public and private care providers.  The latter would not \nact under color of state law and could not be reached under section 1983…. Because the \nPAIMI Act itself provides a cause of action for equitable relief, we decline to address \n[the P & A’s] ability to pursue relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nIndiana Prot. and Advocacy Services v. Indiana Family and Social Services  \nAdmin., 603 F.3d 365, 380 (7th Cir. 2010).   \n  Just as PAIMI provides P&A’s with rights against both public and private care providers, \na P&A may itself be either private or public.  As DRI notes, it is a private, non-profit \ncorporation.  (Dkt. 39, pp. 7-8.)  DRI highlights this distinction in order to defeat the Coroner’s \n                                                 \n9 Most significant of these arguments is the Coroner’s position that DRI, as an \narm of the state, is not a “person” who may bring suit under § 1983. This position is \nsupported by Will v. Michigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58 (1989), wherein the \nSupreme Court held that Congress did not intend for “person” in § 1983 to include the \nsovereign for purposes of determining who may sue.  See also Illinois v. City of Chicago, \n137 F.3d 474, 477 (7th Cir. 1998) (stating, based on Will, that the state cannot be a \nplaintiff in a § 1983 suit).  \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 26  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 27 of 32 \nargument that DRI is not entitled to relief under § 1983 because a state actor cannot sue another \nunder § 1983.  (Dkt. 35, p. 7) (citing Virginia Office for Prot. and Advocacy v. Reinhard, 405 \nF.3d 185, 189 (4th Cir. 2005) (… “[W]e nevertheless conclude that an arm of the state cannot \nbring suit under that statute [§ 1983].”).  DRI suggests it is not a state agency because it is a \nprivate nonprofit, charitable 501(c)(3) corporation, and thus meets the definition of “person” \nentitled to relief under § 1983.  (Dkt. 39, p. 9.)  This argument further illustrates the problem  \nwith allowing DRI to recover under § 1983.  Under DRI’s reasoning, private P&A’s would be \nentitled to relief against state entities under § 1983, while state P&A’s would not, even though \nboth allege a violation of PAIMI for failure to provide records.  Although various federal courts \nhave allowed P&A’s to sue under § 1983, neither the Ninth Circuit nor the Supreme Court have \napparently addressed the issue.  In the absence of controlling authority, and because DRI is \nalready entitled to relief under PAIMI, the Court here, like the Seventh Circuit, declines to \nfurther address DRI’s ability to pursue relief under § 1983.  \n5.   Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \nFinally, DRI seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Coroner.  DRI requests \nthe Court enter a declaratory judgment holding that DRI has the right to access the Coroner’s \ninvestigatory records of D.T.’s death; that the Coroner’s actions and inactions violated PAIMI, \nand that the Coroner must immediately give DRI access to the requested records.  (Dkt. 31-1, p. \n28).  Although they seek opposite declarations, both parties agree declaratory relief is \nappropriate in this case, as declaratory relief is proper when a judgment will serve a useful \npurpose in clarifying and settling legal relations and when it will terminate and afford relief from  \nuncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceedings.  Bilbrey v. Brown, 738 \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 27  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 28 of 32 \nF.2d 1462, 1470 (9th Cir. 1984).  Given the Court’s analysis with respect to DRI’s right to \naccess the Coroner’s records under PAIMI, DRI is entitled to the declaratory relief it seeks.  \nThus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), the Court will enter the following Declaration: \nDRI is entitled to the Coroner’s investigatory records of D.T.’s death under PAIMI, and \nthe Coroner has violated PAIMI by withholding such records.  The Coroner must \nimmediately give DRI access to the requested records. \n  \nDRI also asks the Court to permanently enjoin the Coroner and her successors from  \nfailing to provide to DRI any report, document, or other record relating to D.T., including those \nrecords related to D.T.’s death and any investigation thereof, or relating to any other person who \nis a client of DRI or whose records DRI is authorized to have access to under PAIMI or other \nfederal law; and otherwise interfering with any investigation of abuse and neglect authorized \nunder the PAIMI Act or other federal law.  (Id., pp. 29-30.)  The Coroner denies an injunction \nis appropriate and contends the Coroner’s duty to disclose records under PAIMI must be \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis.  (Dkt. 35, p. 9.) \nA plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court \nmay grant such relief.  A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable \ninjury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to \ncompensate for that injury; (3) that the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and the \ndefendant warrants an equitable remedy; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved \nby a permanent injunction.10  Monsanto Co. v. Geerston Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 156-57 \n                                                 \n10 These are also the relevant factors in determining whether to grant a \npreliminary injunction, except a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish \nlikelihood of success on the merits, while the movant seeking a permanent injunction \nmust actually attain success on the merits.  Rasmussen, 206 F.R.D. at 634 (citations \nomitted); Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12 (1987). Given the \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 28  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 29 of 32 \n(2010) (quoting eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006)). The decision to \ngrant or deny permanent injunctive relief is within the district court’s broad discretion.  \nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 311-313 (1982).  \nNumerous courts have concluded that a P&A’s inability to meet its federal statutory \nmandate to protect and advocate on behalf of those with mental illness constitutes irreparable \nharm.  See, e.g., Hartford Bd. of Educ., 355 F.Supp.2d at 653; Alabama Disabilities Advocacy \nProgram v. SafetyNet YouthCare, Inc., 65 F.Supp.3d 1312, 1326 (S.D. Alabama 2014) (finding \nP&A suffered an irreparable injury by being denied access to fulfill its statutorily authorized \nlegal duty); Gerard Treatment Programs, 152 F.Supp.2d at 1173 (holding P&A was irreparably \nharmed by being prevented from pursuing fully its right to access records in pursuit of its duty to \ninvestigate); Rasmussen, 206 F.R.D. at 635; Stalder, 128 F.Supp.2d at 367; Czaplewski, 131 \nF.Supp.2d at 1051; Buckeye Ranch, Inc., 365 F.Supp.2d at 883 (“There is no dispute that a \nprotection and advocacy agency’s inability to meets its federal statutory mandate to protect and \nadvocate the rights of disabled people constitutes irreparable harm.”).  Having determined DRI \nis entitled to the Coroner’s records under PAIMI, it follows that DRI has suffered immediate and \nirreparable harm through the Coroner’s refusal to turn over the requested records. \nDRI has also demonstrated that there is no adequate legal remedy available other than \ninjunctive relief.   The Coroner’s refusal to provide DRI with the records that it is charged to \nreview poses a threat to DRI being able to discharge its obligations, and no amount of damages \nwill remedy such sustained harm.  Czaplewski, 131 F.Supp.2d at 1051.  The danger of future \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCourt’s finding that DRI is entitled under PAIMI to the records it here seeks, DRI has \nattained success on the merits. \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 29  \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 30 of 32 \nviolation is also certainly cognizable, as the Coroner maintains the disclosure of any private \nrecords must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  To require DRI to re-litigate each time it \nseeks to obtain access to the Coroner’s records would impede DRI’s ability to effectively \ninvestigate and would defeat the purpose of PAIMI.   \nThe balance of hardships also favors DRI, as no harm will come to the Coroner’s office \nby forcing them to comply with the provisions of PAIMI.  Stalder, 128 F.Supp.2d at 368 (“the \ncourt sees no harm that would come to the defendant by forcing them to comply with provisions \nof the PAIMI Act, a law adopted by the national legislature).  As the court held in Stalder, \n“[i]ssuance of a permanent injunction in this case does not subject the defendants to a penalty or \na hardship since it requires them to do exactly what [PAIMI] requires, i.e., to comply with the \nlaw.” Id.  Moreover, as at least one court has noted, a permanent injunction will actually benefit \nthe Coroner’s office because it will serve to protect them from legal action, as “defendants [can] \nhardly be punished for complying with federal court order.”  Czaplewski, 131 F.Supp.2d at \n1052. \nThe public interest also weighs in favor in permitting DRI to access the Coroner’s \nrecords.  PAIMI sets forth a clear federal legislative mandate for P&A systems to investigate \npotential instances of abuse or neglect of individuals with mental illness.  42 U.S.C. § 10801(b). \n It would undermine congressionally mandated independent review if P&A’s were unable to \nreview records such as those requested here in the name of illusory privacy concerns.   \nIn light of the findings above, the Court hereby permanently enjoins the Ada County \nCoroner and her successors from failing to provide to DRI any report, document, or other record \nrelating to D.T., including those records related to D.T.’s death and any investigation thereof, or \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 30  \n\n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 42   Filed 03/07/16   Page 31 of 32 \nrelating to any other person who is a client of DRI or whose records DRI is authorized to have \naccess to under PAIMI. \nORDER \nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n1.   DRI’s Motion to Dismiss, Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, and Motion for \nSummary Judgment (Dkt. 31) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \nDRI’s motion is DENIED to the extent it seeks judgment on the pleadings \npursuant to Fed.

DRI’s motion is GRANTED to \nthe extent it seeks dismissal of the County, and the County is hereby \nDISMISSED.  DRI’s motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 31) is also \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  DRI is entitled to summary \njudgment as a matter of law with respect to its right to access D.T.’s records under \nPAIMI.  DRI is also entitled to the declaratory and injunctive relief it seeks.  \nDRI’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED with respect to its right to \nrecover under § 1983. \n2.   Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), the Court hereby declares DRI is entitled to the \nCoroner’s investigatory records of D.T.’s death under PAIMI, and the Coroner has \nviolated PAIMI by withholding such records.

(“Disability Rights”) have broad access to records \nto investigate suspected abuse or neglect occurring at mental health treatment facilities.  See \nProtection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (“PAIMI”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801­\n10851 (1991). Congress granted those expansive investigatory powers to P&As because people \nwith mental illness are “vulnerable to abuse and serious injury” and are “subject to neglect.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 10801(a) (1)-(3). In fulfillment of this important mission, PAIMI grants to P&As \naccess to “records,” which includes “reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating \nreports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury occurring at such [a] facility [rendering care and \ntreatment].”  42 U.S.C. § 10806 (b)(3)(A). \nIn March 2014, D.T. died at an inpatient psychiatric hospital in Boise.  In the \nperformance of its statutory duties under Idaho law, counterdefendant Ada County Coroner \n(“Coroner”) investigated the death, conducted an autopsy, ruled D.T.’s death a suicide, and \nprepared reports.  When Disability Rights requested the Coroner’s records to investigate the \ndeath pursuant to PAIMI, however, the Coroner refused.  The Coroner does not dispute that it is \n“charged with investigating,” but argues that its investigation of the suicide did not fall within \nPAIMI’s definition of “records” because the Coroner is not an “agency.”  \nThe plain meaning of the word “agency” includes governmental agencies and Congress \nclearly intended that P&As have access to records of governmental entities such as coroners.  \nThe Coroner incorrectly argues that because the Coroner herself is elected, the Coroner’s office \nis not an agency. There is no logic to support why Congress would exempt offices headed by \nelected officials from within the purview of PAIMI.  To the contrary, coroners’ investigations \nmay include direct evidence such as autopsy results that may be otherwise unavailable to a P&A. \n2 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 4 of 23 \nDenying a P&A access to coroners’ records would undermine the P&A’s ability to \nconduct complete and accurate investigations pursuant to PAIMI.  It would also lead to the \nabsurd result that entities such as police, hospitals, mental health facilities, and medical review \nboards are compelled to comply with PAIMI while the government entity that gathers some of \nthe most crucial information – a coroner’s office – could shield its investigatory records from the \nP&A solely because the leader of the office once appeared on a ballet.  PAIMI should not be \ninterpreted in a manner to undermine Congressional intent, and the Court should rule instead that \nentities that conduct investigations under authority of state law must comply with PAIMI.   \nThe Coroner’s remaining arguments to avoid PAIMI compliance also lack merit.  The \nCoroner cannot resist access to its records based on Idaho privacy laws because PAIMI expressly \npreempts conflicting state law.  Nor can the Coroner second-guess the P&A’s determination that \nthere is probable cause to investigate – federal law reserves that determination to the P&A.  \nP&As have a crucial role in investigating neglect and abuse in mental health facilities, and \ncoroners charged with investigating such tragic incidents cannot block P&A access to \ninvestigatory records. \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES  \nThe United States submits this Statement of Interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517 (1966),1  \nbecause this litigation involves the proper interpretation and application of federal law.  As the \n                                                 \n1  Section 517 provides that the “Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, may be \nsent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the interests of the \nUnited States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court of a State, or to attend to any \nother interest of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 517.   A submission by the United States pursuant to this \nprovision does not constitute intervention under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n3 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 5 of 23 \nUnited States has made clear in litigation across the country,2 it has a strong interest in the \ninterpretation of the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801–10851.  The Department of Justice has \nauthority to enforce Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12133, 12134 \n(1990), and enforces federal law and the Constitution as it applies to institutional and community \nsettings.  See,  e.g., 42 U.S.C. §1997a (1996). The national network of P&As plays a significant \nrole in ensuring compliance with these laws.  See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Statement of the \nDepartment of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and  Olmstead v. L.C., ADA.gov (June 22, 2011), \nhttp://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm (last visited July 10, 2015) (providing guidance \nfor ADA and Olmstead enforcement). \nThe Congressional authority afforded to P&As is imperative for the monitoring and \ninvestigation of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illnesses within these settings.  For \nnearly three decades, federal law has made clear that with the appropriation of federal funds to \nP&As, they shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to facilities that provide care and \ntreatment to individuals with mental illness.  42 U.S.C. §§ 10801–10851; 42 C.F.R. § 51.42 \n(1997). Supplementing the authority to access facilities is the right of P&As to access records of \nan individual with mental illness from either the facility itself or an “agency charged with \ninvestigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury occurring at such [a] facility.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 10806 (b)(3)(A); 42 C.F.R. §51.41 (1997). \n                                                 \n2   See, e.g., Statement of Interest of the United States, Ala. Disabilities Advocacy Program v. SafetyNet \nYouthcare, 13-0519-CG-B, (S.D. Ala. Oct. 14, 2014);  Statement of Interest of the United States, \nDisability Rights Miss. v. Miss. Children’s Home Servs., 3:13-CV-547-HTW-LRA, (S.D. Miss. Feb. 5, \n2014); Statement of Interest of the United States, Ga. Advocacy Office, Inc., v. Shelp, 1:09-CV-2880-CAP \n(N.D. Ga. June 10, 2010); Statement of Interest of the United States, Ind. Prot. & Advocacy Servs. v. Ind. \nFamily & Soc. Servs. Admin., No. 1:06-cv-1816 (S.D. Ind.

Tanager, Inc., 427 F.3d 541 (2005), No. 04-4074 (8th Cir. \nMay 11, 2005).   \n4 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 6 of 23 \nFACTS  \nFor purposes of this Statement of Interest, the United States will summarize the facts \nbased on the allegations of the parties in their pleadings, statements of material facts, and \nsummary judgment briefs.  Aside from the legal issues raised in this Statement of Interest, the \nUnited States does not take a position on the relative merits of the parties’ claims. \nI.   DISABILITY RIGHTS’ PAIMI INVESTIGATION OF D.T.’S DEATH. \nOn or about March 2014, Disability Rights received a report that an individual with \nmental illness had died at a psychiatric hospital.  Disability Rights’ Answer and Counterclaim  \n(“Counterclaim”) ¶¶ 32, 34 (Dkt. # 5).  Disability Rights contacted the hospital, which provided \nto Disability Rights the confidential patient records related to D.T.’s psychiatric care and \ntreatment and the circumstances of D.T.’s death.  Id. ¶ 35. Disability Rights alleges that it \ndetermined there was probable cause to believe that D.T.’s death may have resulted from abuse \nor neglect, and it commenced a PAIMI investigation.  Id. ¶ 36. \nAs part of its investigation, Disability Rights sought investigatory records from several \nsources. Disability Rights requested records and information from the Boise Police Department, \nwhich complied with the request.  Id. ¶ 45. Disability Rights also sought records and \ninformation from the hospital, which complied with the request.  Id. ¶¶ 35, 45. \nWhen Disability Rights requested investigatory records from the Ada County Coroner, \nhowever, the Coroner refused. On May 29, 2014, Disability  Rights sent a letter to the Coroner \nrequesting copies of any “autopsy reports, coroners’ reports, inquest transcripts, investigative \nreports, medical and toxicology reports, and other records or documents that were reviewed or \nrelied upon in reaching the conclusions and findings concerning [D.T’s] death.”  Disability \nRights Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“Disability Rights’ Statement”), ¶ 15 (Dkt. # 31­\n5 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 7 of 23 \n2). On July 21, 2014, the Coroner sent to Disability Rights a copy of the Coroner’s Public \nInformation Report but refused to provide its investigatory records.  Id. ¶¶ 18, 20, 21. The \nCoroner made three arguments:  (1) The Coroner’s investigatory records were not subject to \ndisclosure under PAIMI, (2) disclosing the records would violate privacy concerns of D.T., \nD.T.’s family, and individuals who interacted with D.T., and (3) disclosure would require a court \norder or permission from persons whose privacy rights are at risk.  Disability Rights’ Statement \n¶ 23. \nII. \t  THE OPERATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ADA COUNTY \nCORONER’S OFFICE. \nIdaho coroners are charged by statute with “investigat[ing] . . . death [that] occurred as a \nresult of violence, whether by homicide, suicide, or by accident;”  Idaho Code Ann. §19-4301 (1) \n(a) (2005); Coroner’s Statement of Material Facts (“Coroner’s Statement”) at 2 (Dkt. # 32-2).   \nThe Ada County Coroner is elected to that office (Coroner’s Statement at 2) and runs the \nCoroner’s office.  To perform the work of the Coroner’s office, the Coroner “has appointed \ndeputies and oversees those deputies.” Answer to Counterclaim of Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. \nAgainst Erwin Sonnenberg (“Coroner’s Answer”) at 3 (Dkt. # 8); see Idaho Code Ann. § 31­\n2809 (1970) (“A coroner may appoint a deputy or deputies as he deems necessary”).  In addition, \nthe Coroner employs a pathologist who performs autopsies.  Coroner’s Answer at 3.  The \nCoroner’s 18-person staff includes forensic technicians, an anthropologist, medicolegal \ninvestigators, administrators and consultants.

The Coroner’s budget \n($1,634,454 in 2013) is paid from Ada County’s general fund.3  Deputy coroners are “paid at a \nrate fixed by the county commissioners.”  Idaho Code Ann. § 31-2809. Under some  \ncircumstances, the Ada County commissioners have the power to remove the Coroner or confirm  \na coroner appointed by the executive. Idaho Code Ann. § 31-5213 (coroner may be “appointed \nby the executive with the advice and consent of the board of county commissioners,” or the \ncommissioners may eliminate the coroner’s office in favor of an elected or appointed \nreplacement).  The 2013 Ada County budget lists the Coroner as a “department” under the \ncategory “Governmental,” and the Coroner has a webpage on the County’s website.4  And as the \npleadings in this case demonstrate, both Ada County and the Coroner filed this declaratory relief \naction and are represented by the Ada County prosecuting attorney, even though Disability \nRights directed its records access request to the Coroner.  Disability Rights Statement ¶ 15; \nCoroner’s Statement at 2-3. \nARGUMENT  \nCongress created a system of independent protection and advocacy organizations in \nresponse to a history of widespread abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities by the \nfacilities charged with their care.  Following the creation of the nationwide P&A system through \npassage of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act in 1975, Pub. L. No. \n94-103, 89 Stat. 486 (1975) (originally codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 6041-6043 and currently at 42 \n                                                 \n3   See Ada County State of Idaho, 2014-2015 Ada County Final Budget, (“Ada County Budget”), \nhttps://adacounty.id.gov/Portals/0/CAR/Financial/Ada%20County%20FY15%20Adopted%20Budget.pdf \n(last visited July 13, 2015).  This Court may take judicial notice of the Ada County budget under Fed. R. \nEvid. 201.  See Coleman v. Schwarzenegger, No. C01-1351 TEH, 2009 WL 2407404, at *2 (E.D.

The PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-10851, extended the P&As’ \nrole to include protection of persons with mental illness.  Amendments to the PAIMI Act in 2000 \nfurther ensured that P&As protect individuals with mental illness who reside in the community, \nincluding their own homes.  Children’s Health Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-310, Div. B, Title \nXXXII, § 3206(b)(1)(B), 114 Stat. 1101, 1194 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 10802(4)(B)(ii)).  Thus, \nthe P&A system was designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities, who are some of the \nmost vulnerable members of society, have access to independent advocates and are protected \nfrom abuse and neglect wherever they receive care or treatment.  \nTo ensure that P&As can carry out their federal mandate to protect and advocate for \nindividuals with disabilities, the PAIMI Act and implementing regulations define certain key \naspects of the P&As’ authority. P&As have the right to access facilities, records, and individuals \nto investigate possible abuse and neglect, to conduct monitoring activities, and to educate \nindividuals about their rights.  42 U.S.C. §§ 10801(b)(2), 10805; 42 C.F.R §51.42.  Central to the \nP&As’ ability to fulfill their function, the PAIMI statute authorizes P&As to exercise their \nauthority independently. 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(2).  Congress also vested P&As with \ncomprehensive authority to investigate abuse and neglect whenever the P&A receives a \ncomplaint or determines probable cause.  42 U.S.C. § 10801(b)(2)(B).  To ensure a swift and \nadequate investigation, P&As have the sole discretion to determine probable cause.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 51.41(b)(2)-(3).   \n8 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 10 of 23 \nI. \t  THE CORONER’S OFFICE IS AN “AGENCY CHARGED WITH  \nINVESTIGATING” UNDER PAIMI AND MUST PRODUCE ITS RECORDS.  \nThe PAIMI Act and implementing regulations allow P&As to access “records” in \nconducting their investigations. 42 U.S.C.A. § 10806 (b)(3)(A).  The term “records” is defined \nas including: \n[R]eports . . . prepared by an agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of \nabuse, neglect, and injury occurring at such facility that describe incidents of abuse, \nneglect, and injury occurring at such facility and the steps taken to investigate such \nincidents, and discharge planning records. \n42 U.S.C. § 10806 (b)(3)(A) (emphasis added).  See also 42 C.F.R. § 51.41 (c)(2)(defining \n“[i]nformation and individual records” as including “[r]eports prepared by an agency charged \nwith investigating abuse, neglect, or injury occurring at a facility rendering care or treatment”).  \nNeither the PAIMI Act nor the implementing regulations further define the phrase “agency \ncharged with investigating.” \nThe starting point for interpreting statutory language is the language itself.  Satterfield v. \nSimon & Schuster, Inc., 569 F.3d 946, 951 (9th Cir. 2009) (in construing a statute, the court “first \nlooks[s] to the language of the statute to determine whether it has a plain meaning”).  If the \nstatutory text is ambiguous, courts may “look to other interpretive tools” to determine the \nstatute’s best meaning.  In re HP Inkjet Printer Litig., 716 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(although a statute was “poorly drafted,” its meaning was clear when “interpreted collectively \nand in context, and read together with the statute's purpose and legislative history”).  See also  \nUnited States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 242 (1989) (when “the literal application \nof a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters . . . the \nintention of the drafters, rather than the strict language, controls.”); Jonah R. v. Carmona, 446 \nF.3d 1000, 1005 (9th Cir. 2006)  (courts may use “canons of construction” to discern \nCongressional intent). \n9 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 11 of 23 \nA. \t  The Phrase “Agency Charged with Investigating” Includes the Coroner’s \nOffice Because It Is a Division of Government. \nThe Coroner’s office is an “agency charged with investigating” because it is a division of \nthe Ada County government that is responsible for investigating deaths.  As the Coroner cites, \nthe Merriam Webster dictionary defines “agency” as “an administrative division (as of a \ngovernment).”  Coroner’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n(“Coroner’s Mem.”) at 9.   Even though the plain meaning of the word “agency” includes a \ngovernmental entity, the Coroner denies that it is an agency because the Coroner “is an \nindependent, elected office pursuant to the laws and constitution of the state of Idaho, and \ndetermines the cause and manner of death.”  Coroner’s Mem. at 9.5  The Coroner’s office is an \n“agency” within the meaning of PAIMI because it is a governmental entity.  That the Corner is \nelected and the office performs its work independently is irrelevant.  \nThere can be no question that the Ada County Coroner’s office is part of the County and \nfunctions as an administrative division of government.  The Ada County government decides the \npay of the Coroner’s office deputies and pathologist and pays them from county funds.  The Ada \nCounty commissioners have the power to remove  the Coroner or confirm a coroner appointed by \nthe executive. The Ada County prosecutor is representing the Coroner presumably at Ada \nCounty taxpayer expense in this litigation – a representation that is improper if the Coroner is not \nan arm of county government.6  The Coroner’s office cannot remove itself from County \ngovernment solely for the purposes of litigation.  \n                                                 \n5  Instead of explaining why it believes it is not an administrative division of government, the Coroner \nlists its many  official duties pursuant to the Idaho constitution and statutes.  See Coroner’s Mem.  at 9-11.  \nThat the Coroner acts under authority  of state law further supports the interpretation that the Coroner is an \nadministrative division of government.   \n6   See Idaho Code Ann. § 31-2604 (“It is the duty of the prosecuting attorney. . . [t]o prosecute or defend \nall actions, applications or motions, civil or criminal, in the district court of his county in which the \npeople, or the state, or the county, are interested, or are a party”).  \n10 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 12 of 23 \nThat the Coroner is elected rather than appointed or hired is not dispositive.  See  \nCoroner’s Mem. at 9.  Whether an entity is a division of government does not turn on whether \nthe head of the office was elected.  What matters is the role the entity fulfills – in this case, an \nofficial role to administer certain business of the county.7  The Coroner’s argument would lead to \nthe illogical result that PAIMI compliance could turn on whether an agency head was elected – a \nresult Congress never intended. The Coroner’s office is properly viewed under PAIMI as an \n“agency charged with investigating” because that is what it exists to do -- regardless of how the \nCoroner acquired the position. \nOne federal court has confirmed that a coroner’s office should be viewed as an “agency \ncharged with investigating” under PAIMI.  In Wisconsin Coal. For Advocacy, Inc. v. Busby, \nCase No. 02-C-871 *12 (E.D. Wis. September 24, 2003), the Winnebago County coroner refused \nfor three months to comply with the P&A’s request for records, claiming the documents were not \n“records” under PAIMI.  Id. The district court disagreed, holding that “A coroner’s office is an \nagency charged with investigating deaths (certainly a form of injury), . . . .” so its investigatory \nrecords “fall within the P&A system access authority.”   Id. at 12-13.8     \nThe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals  rejected an agency’s similar attempt to split hairs \nwith the meaning of “agency charged with investigating” in order to avoid producing records \n                                                 \n7  The Coroner’s office performs numerous governmental tasks as parens patriae where no one steps \nforward to take charge of the decedent. The Coroner buries or cremates unclaimed bodies, disposes of \nproperty found on a corpse, and issues statements to the county commissioners regarding the property of a \ndeceased in the Coroner’s possession.  Coroner’s Mem.  at 9.   \n8  An Idaho Supreme Court decision also supports a finding that the Ada County  Coroner is an \nadministrative division of government.  Dep’t. of Emp’t v. Ada County Fair Bd., 96 Idaho 591, 593-95 \n(1974), turned on the issue of whether the Ada County Fair Board was an “administrative division of \ncounty government.”  Id. The Fair Board was statutorily authorized, it was funded in Ada County’s \nbudget, the county commissioners had the power to select the Fair Board’s members, and the Fair Board’s \nfunds ultimately  belonged to the general fund of Ada County.  The Idaho Supreme Court noted that Ada \nCounty  held ultimate control over the Fair Board’s existence and thus, the Fair Board was an \nadministrative division of Ada County and “services performed by the Fair Board ipso facto are \nperformed by the county’s employ.”  Id. at 594.  \n11 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 13 of 23 \nunder PAIMI. Disability Rights Wisconsin, Inc. v. Wisconsin, 463 F.3d 719, 726-27 (7th Cir. \n2006).  In Disability Rights Wisconsin, the court found that it was “beside the point” that the \nagency at issue was not “charged” with investigating reports of abuse or neglect because the \nagency “did in fact investigate complaints of potential abuse or neglect.”  Id. The court found \nthat preventing the P&A from obtaining information it needed to investigate “on the basis that \nDPI did something it was not required to do” would frustrate the goals of the P&A system.  Id. \nB. \t  Congress Intended that the PAIMI Act Apply to Administrative Divisions of \nGovernment Such as the Coroner.  \nCongress clearly intended that PAIMI apply to state and local governmental entities.  The \nPAIMI legislative history indicates that the term “agency” refers to “any State, county, or \nmunicipal agency charged with the responsibility of investigating incidents of abuse and neglect \nin public residential facilities for the treatment of mentally ill individuals.”  S.  2393,  100th  Cong., \n134 Cong. Rec.  S14450-03,  1988  WL  180662;  S.2393,  100th Cong., 134 Cong. Rec.  H9648-01  \n(1988),  1988  WL  177000 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the P&A system was designed to ensure \nthat individuals with disabilities have access to independent advocates and are protected from  \nabuse and neglect wherever they receive care or treatment.  See S.  Rep. No. 99-109, at 10 (1985), \nreprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1361, 1370 (“The Committee recognizes the need for full access \nto facilities and clients and to their records in order to ensure the protection of mentally ill \npersons. It is the intent of the Committee that the [P&A system] have the fullest possible access \nto client records . . . .”).    \nInterpreting “agency charged with investigating” to include a coroner’s office is \nconsistent with the purpose of PAIMI.  One tool at the P&A’s disposal is the ability to obtain \nrecords to aid in its investigation.  Coroner’s offices are in a unique position to provide \nindispensible evidence in an investigation and may be the only entities that perform a detailed \n12 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 14 of 23 \nexamination of the decedent’s body.  If coroners can withhold their records, an important \ninvestigatory tool will be lost to P&As, and their ability to investigate will be compromised.  \nThat is not what Congress intended. \nIndeed, including coroners within “agency charged with investigating” is a sensible \ninterpretation that gives meaning to every word.  The inclusion of the word “agency” can \ndistinguish official state actors like coroners from those who might conduct an investigation for \nother reasons. For instance, a journalist might be said to “investigate” a death, but the journalist \nis not performing governmental duties and so is not an “agency charged with investigating.”  \nThat understanding of “agency” makes sense in the PAIMI regulatory scheme, and a state, \ncounty or municipality’s legally authorized investigators such as coroners fall within it.9  \nII. \t  THE CORONER’S CONFIDENTIALITY ARGUMENT DOES NOT JUSTIFY \nDENIAL OF ACCESS TO ITS INVESTIGATORY RECORDS UNDER PAIMI. \nThe Coroner argues that allowing Disability Rights to access its investigatory records \nunder PAIMI “would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy for D.T. and D.T.’s family \nmembers, as well as an invasion of the personal privacy rights of hospital employees and family \nmembers mentioned in those records”  Coroner’s Mem. at 14.  The Coroner also raises the \npossibility of facing a lawsuit under state or federal law for breach of privacy if it were to allow \nDisability Rights to access the records.  Id. at 14. \nPAIMI expressly preempts conflicting state laws.  PAIMI’s “statutory language provides \nthat state laws that prohibit access to records otherwise allowed under the PAIMI Act ‘shall not \napply’. . . . ”  See  Disability Rights North Carolina v. Frye Regional Medical Center, Inc., No. \n                                                 \n9  Construing “agency” to mean an “administrative division of government” in this case does not preclude \nother interpretations in different circumstances.  For instance, a county might contract privately for the \nservices of a coroner.  In that case, the private coroner may not be an “administrative division of \ngovernment” but may instead have an “agency” relationship with its principal, the county.  This Court \nneed not address the question of alternative definitions for purposes of this case, however. \n13 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 15 of 23 \n5:13-CV-102, 2014 WL 5810458, at *3 (W.D. N.C 2014).  See also Iowa Prot. & Advocacy \nServs., Inc. v. Rasmussen, 206 F.R.D. 630, 639 (S.D. Iowa 2001) (P&As are “independent \nchecks on state care” that would be meaningless if states could legislate away a P&A system’s \npower to investigate). To the extent Idaho law prevents the release of the Coroner’s records, \nPAIMI preempts those laws and mandates that the Coroner release them to Disability Rights.  \nProt. & Advocacy For Persons With Disabilities v. Armstrong, 266 F. Supp. 2d 303, 319-21 (D. \nConn. 2003) (finding that PAIMI preempts state confidentiality law under the Supremacy Clause \nof the United States Constitution).10  \nMoreover, PAIMI directly addresses the Coroner’s concerns about confidentiality \nconcerning records, family members and witnesses.  PAIMI obligates a P&A to maintain records \nin a confidential manner: \nAn eligible [P&A] system which, pursuant to section 10805 (a)(4) of this title, has access \nto records which, under Federal or State law, are required to be maintained in a \nconfidential manner by a provider of mental health services, shall, except as provided in \nsubsection (b) of this section, maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same  \nextent as is required of the provider of such services.  \n42 U.S.C.A. § 10806(a) (emphasis added).  Courts have found that PAIMI’s confidentiality \nrequirements provide sufficient protection, and a P&A need not obtain consent of next of kin to \nobtain records. Armstrong, 266 F. Supp. 2d at 320 (holding that PAIMI already addresses the \n                                                 \n10  Numerous other cases are in accord.  Mo. Prot. & Advocacy Servs. v. Mo. Dep’t of Health, \n447 F.3d 1021, 1024 (8th Cir. 2006) (PAIMI preempts conflicting state law); Center For Legal \nAdvocacy v. Hammons, 323 F.3d 1262, 1272 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding that medical peer review \nand quality assurance records are accessible to the P&A); Pennsylvania Protection & Advocacy, \nInc. v. Houstoun, 228 F.3d 423, 428 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding the PAIMI Act preempts any state \nlaw giving a healthcare facility the right to withhold records); Wisconsin Coalition for Advocacy, \nInc. v. Czaplewski, 131 F. Supp. 2d 1039, 1049 n. 3 (E.D. Wis. 2001) (holding that PAIMI \npreempts state statute where it interferes with P&A access to records); Oklahoma Disability Law \nCenter, Inc. v. Dillon Family and Youth Services, Inc., 879 F. Supp. 1110, 1112 (N.D. Okla. \n1995) (finding that the PAIMI Act preempts state law requiring court order before release of \nrecords).  \n14 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 16 of 23 \nconfidentiality of patient records).  As a result, the Coroner’s records in a PAIMI investigation \nwill be as protected from unlawful disclosure as when they are in the custody of the Coroner.   \nFinally, the Coroner’s reliance on Marsh v. Cnty. of San Diego, 680 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th \nCir. 2012), for the argument that a federal common-law right of privacy trumps PAIMI is \nmisplaced.  In Marsh, a prosecutor copied autopsy photographs of the plaintiff’s deceased child \nto keep as a “memento,” then released them to a newspaper and a television station.  Id. at 1152.   \nThe Ninth Circuit found the prosecutor’s conduct “shocks the conscience” and violated the \nplaintiff’s substantive due process right to be free of “unwarranted public exploitation by the \ngovernment.”  Id. at 1154-55. \nThis case is nothing like Marsh. The P&A seeks the Coroner’s investigatory records for \na legitimate purpose pursuant to a federal statute that expressly grants that access.  PAIMI does \nnot allow the P&A to disseminate the records publicly and instead specifically requires that they \nbe maintained in confidence.  These protections are meant to ensure that the P&A can use the \nCoroner’s records to conduct its investigation while respecting the privacy and confidentiality of  \nfamily members and witnesses.   \nIII. \t  DENYING ACCESS TO THE CORONER’S RECORDS IS CONTRARY TO \nPUBLIC POLICY.  \nBlocking PAIMI access to the Coroner’s records would seriously undermine Disability \nRights’ efforts to learn what happened to D.T and why.  Autopsies involve “inspecting and \nsometimes dissecting the corpse to determine the cause and manner of death and to detect what \ndiseases may be present.”  Coroner’s Mem. at 11. Autopsy reports contain “detailed descriptions \nof the dead body” and “frequently explain how the death occurred.” Id. The Coroner’s \ninvestigation can contain “family members and witnesses’ statements about the death, along with \nthose individuals’ names and contact information.”  Id.  Medical examiners and coroners possess \n15 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 17 of 23 \nthis sort of direct and crucial evidence, and a P&A often cannot readily obtain the evidence from  \nanother source.  If the Ada County Coroner denies access to its investigatory files, Disability \nRights would be deprived of facts needed to perform a complete investigation. \nA decision denying P&A access to coroners’ records could have implications far beyond \nthe borders of Ada County. In 2004, medical examiners and coroner offices, charged with \ninvestigating suspicious or unexpected deaths, investigated roughly one-fifth of all U.S. death \ncases.11  All 50 states and the District of Columbia have either a statewide coroner system, a \ncounty-based medical examiner system, or a mixture of the two, with a total of almost 2,000 \ninvestigative offices nationwide.12  In 2004, county coroner offices made up 80 percent of these \nsystems (1,590), and the coroners were, in general, elected.13  Medical examiners’ and coroners’ \nroles in investigating possible suicides are particularly important because there are “a number of \nreasons, civil as well as cultural, to conceal information about suicide.”  Cyril H. Wecht M.D., J. \nD., Introduction, 1 Quinnipiac Health  L.J. 7, 13 (1996).  An “experienced, suspicious and \nthorough investigator” will gather the types of information from the death that enables a county \ncoroner to detect evidence of abuse, neglect, or injury that the PAIMI Act is meant to correct.  Id. \nCf.  §10805(a)(4); S. Rep. No. 102-114, at 3 (1991) (recommending the provision for access to \nrecords be clarified to afford a “significantly increased” level of authority for P&As after finding \nthat PAIMI mandates have not fully been met).  The impact of placing coroners’ investigative \n                                                 \n11  Matthew J. Hickman, Ph.D. & Kristen A Hughes, MPA, Department of Justice, Medical Examiners \n\nand Coroners’ Offices 1 (2004). \n \n12   Id. \n \n13    Id. \n\n16 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 18 of 23 \nrecords off limits to P&As would be felt nationwide and would frustrate public policy favoring \nthe broad access to records that PAIMI grants to P&As.14    \nNevertheless, the Coroner argues that allowing P&As access to investigatory records \n“could significantly impact the effective administration of Idaho’s state criminal justice system” \nand financially burden Idaho county coroners.  Coroner’s Mem. at 14.  The Coroner’s \nspeculation that disclosing its records will somehow compromise criminal investigations \nstatewide misunderstands the effect of PAIMI access.  The P&A does not confiscate the \ncoroner’s records, make them unavailable to the criminal justice system, or in any way interfere \nwith the coroner’s ability to do her job.  Access means only that, and nothing precludes an Idaho \ncoroner’s office from continuing to fulfill its statutory duties while also complying with PAIMI.  \nFinally, the Coroner argues that allowing Disability Rights to access its investigatory files \nwould impact the work of coroners across Idaho.  Because the Ada County Coroner performs  \nforensic work for 28 other Idaho coroners who cannot afford their own pathologists, the Coroner \nclaims that this Court’s decision “will impact whether the Ada County Coroner must disclose the \nautopsy reports created for other Idaho counties and, therefore, this case could have \nrepercussions . . . throughout southern and eastern Idaho.”  Coroner’s Mem. at 15. \nThat is all the more reason that this Court should be clear and firm in its decision granting \nrecords access to Disability Rights.  PAIMI grants to P&As “broad investigatory authority.”   \nDisability Rights Wisconsin, 463 F.3d at 725. Pursuant to PAIMI, Disability Rights is \nempowered to investigate throughout Idaho and should not have to relitigate its authority in \n                                                 \n14  In FY 2012, P&A’s nationwide handled 1,978 abuse/neglect investigations.  See  Protection and \nAdvocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Program (PAIMI) Fact Sheet, National Disability Rights \nNetwork (2013), www.ncmhr.org/downloads/PAIMI-fact-sheet-2013.pdf  (last visited July 16, 2015).   \n17 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 19 of 23 \ncounty after county. This Court’s decision will make clear to each Idaho coroner’s office that \nPAIMI applies to them, and they should comply with P&As’ lawful requests for records.  \nIV. \t  THE P&A HAS AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHEN PROBABLE CAUSE \nEXISTS.  \nP&As operate as part of a federally-authorized state-wide system to protect and advocate \nfor individuals with mental illness.  42 U.S.C. § 10801(b)(2).  The PAIMI Act authorizes P&As \nto “investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of  individuals with mental illness if the incidents \nare reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.” \nId. § 10801(b)(2)(B) (emphasis added); see also § 10805(a)(1)(A). The PAIMI implementing \nregulations require that a P&A seeking records have received a complaint or report and “that \nthere is probable cause to believe that the individual has been or may be subject to abuse or \nneglect.” 42 C.F.R. § 51.41. \nThe Coroner objects to providing investigatory records on the grounds that Disability \nRights has not proved probable cause to the Coroner or the Court.  Coroner’s Mem. at 7 n.9.  The \nCoroner is unwilling to accept Disability Rights’ “independent conclusion that there is probable \ncause to believe that D.T. was subject to abuse or neglect.”  Id. \nPAIMI does not allow the Coroner to second-guess Disability Rights’ determination of \nprobable cause. In Arizona Ctr. for Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689, 692 (D. Ariz. \n2000), a state behavioral health agency refused to allow a P&A access to records under PAIMI.  \nThe health agency withheld some files because  it disagreed that there was probable cause to \nbelieve abuse or neglect occurred.  Id. at 691. The court held that the P&A “is the final arbiter of \nprobable cause for the purpose of triggering its authority to access all records for an individual \nthat may have been subject to abuse or neglect.”  Id. at 693. The court reasoned, “To conclude \notherwise would frustrate the purpose of the P & A laws to establish an effective system to \n18 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 20 of 23 \nprotect and advocate for the rights of individuals with disabilities.”  Id. If Disability Rights \nbelieves it has probable cause to investigate, PAIMI requires the Coroner to cooperate.15  \nNor may the Coroner put Disability Rights to the task of proving probable cause in court.  \nA P&A’s probable cause determination does not require judicial review.  Armstrong, 266 F. \nSupp. 2d at 321 (“[C]ourts have rejected attempts to require judicial review of the P & A's \nprobable cause determination”).  See, e.g., Prot. & Advocacy Sys., Inc. v. Freudenthal, 412 F. \nSupp. 2d 1211, 1219 (D. Wyo. 2006) (P&A is the final arbiter of probable cause); Ctr. For Legal \nAdvocacy v. Earnest, 188 F. Supp. 2d 1251, 1257 (D. Colo. 2002) (state may not reevaluate \nP&A’s determination of probable cause), rev’d on other grounds,  320 F.3d 1107 (10th Cir. \n2003); Iowa Prot. & Advocacy Servs., 206 F.R.D. at 638 (the P&A, not a state agency, shall \nmake the relevant probable cause determination). \nThere is good reason that P&As need not obtain a court order to obtain access to records \nunder PAIMI. Requiring P&As to go to court every time they seek records under PAIMI would \nfrustrate the goals of PAIMI and unnecessarily burden the P&A.  See Advocacy Ctr. v. Stalder, \n128 F. Supp. 2d 358, 364 (M.D. La.1999) (“[I]t cannot be disputed that the delay in getting a \ncourt order frustrates the goal of the [PAIMI] Act.”); Okla. Disability Law Ctr., Inc. v. Dillon \nFamily and Youth Servs., Inc., 879 F. Supp. 1110, 1112 (N.D. Okla. 1995) (“The timely access \nguaranteed by the Act should not be stripped of all meaning by requiring advocacy hearings to \nsurvive an application for a court order.”).  As a recent evaluation of the PAIMI Act found, \n                                                 \n15   See generally  Ala. Disabilities Advocacy Program v. J.S. Tarwater Developmental Ctr., 894 F. Supp. \n424, 429 (M.D. Ala. 1995) (a showing of probable cause “does not involve establishing what actually  \nhappened but presenting evidence in the record that supports allegations of abuse and neglect.”), aff’d, 97 \nF.3d 492 (11th Cir. 1996).  Either the receipt of a complaint or a determination of probable cause will \nsuffice. Cf. J.S. Tarwater Developmental Ctr., 97 F.3d at 498 (discussing the separate basis for seeking \naccess to records under the DD Act); Equip for Equal., Inc. v. Ingalls Mem’l Hosp., 292 F. Supp. 2d  \n1086, 1095 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (recognizing that a P&A has “broad access to patients and facilities” as the \nresult of “an investigation, a reported incident, a complaint, the existence of probable cause of abuse, or \nthe existence of imminent danger of serious abuse or neglect”).   \n19 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 21 of 23 \n“When forced to litigate access issues, significant portions of [a P&A’s] limited resources are \nconsumed – resources that would better be used moving the nation’s mental health system  \nforward.” Substance Abuse and Mental Health Servs. Admin., HHS  Pub. No. PEP12­\nEVALPAIMI, Evaluation of the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals With Mental Illness \n(PAIMI) Program, Phase III:  Evaluation Report 87 (2011). Entities that possess records \ncovered by PAIMI should not be permitted to delay the P&A’s investigation and divert P&A \nresources to litigation by conditioning access on a court order.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe PAIMI Act is a critical component in the system of legal protections for people with \ndisabilities and its words must be given full force and effect.  This Court should affirm that the \nPAIMI Act and regulations require county coroners to comply with federal law and provide \ninvestigatory records consistent with PAIMI. \n   \n20 \n\n \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 40   Filed 07/20/15   Page 22 of 23 \nRespectfully submitted,    \n \nVANITA GUPTA  /s/ William B.

Disability Rights Idaho, Inc.  (\"DRI'') is an Idaho corporation doing business in \nAda County, state ofidaho. \n4.  Pursuant to Idaho Code § 5-514, this Court possesses personal jurisdiction over \nthe par-ties. \n5.  Venue is proper in Ada County pursuant to Idaho Code § 5-404. \n6.  Pursuant to Idaho Code§§ 10-1201, et seq., this Court is entitled to determine the \nrespective obligations of the parties under Idaho and federal statutes  regulations and to enter \na declaratory judgment in accordance with its determination. \nII. \nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \n7.  On May  29,  2014,  DRI  sent a letter to  the  Ada County Coroner demanding \n\"autopsy  reports,  coroners'  reports,  inquest  transcripts,  investigative  reports,  medical  and \ntoxicology reports, and other records or documents that were reviewed or relied upon in reaching \nthe conclusions and findings concerning [D.T's] death.\"  DRI asserted that federal laws authorize \nit  \"to  access  a  broad array  records  and  information  related to  deaths  and  other  serious \nincidents involving individuals with disabilities.\"  It claimed that it \"is the final arbiter regarding \na determination of probable cause for purposes of triggering our authority to access records.\"  It \nfurther asserted that a release was not necessary because  had died.  This letter is attached \nhereto as Exhibit A and has been redacted to remove D.T. 's name and date of death. \n8.  On June 25, 2014, the Ada County Coroner's Office denied DRI's request and \nadvised that the investigation into the death of D.T. was ongoing and that releasing the records \nmight interfere with or jeopardize that investigation.  The Ada County Coroner's Office also \nexpressed  concern that  releasing  these  records  may  violate  D.T. 's privacy rights  under  the \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF- PAGE 2 \ng:\\gap\\misc litigation\\disability rights\\pleadings\\complaint for declaratory relief. doc \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 1-3   Filed 09/08/14   Page 3 of 6\nFourteenth Amendment to  the  United  States  Constitution and Idaho  law.  The Ada County \nCoroner's Office expressed its concern that releasing these records could subject Ada County to \nliability.  The Ada County Coroner's Office also  stated that the court is the final  arbiter of \nwhether DRI has  a factual basis for  its unsupported assertion that it has  probable cause to \ninvestigate.  This letter is attached hereto as Exhibit B and has been redacted to remove D. T. 's \nname and date of death. \n9.  On July 7, 2014, DRI wrote a letter to the Ada County Coroner asking to be \nnotified when the investigation into the death of D.T. was completed.  A copy of this letter is \nattached hereto as Exhibit C and has been redacted to remove D. T. 's name and date of death. \n10.  On July 8, 2014, the Ada County Coroner advised DRl that the investigation into \nD.T.'s death was complete and provided DRI with a copy of the Coroner's Public Information \nReport. A copy of this letter and attachment are attached hereto as Exhibit n· and have been \nredacted to remove D.T.'s name, city of residence, age, date of death, and gender. \n11.  On July 21, 2014, counsel for DRl wrote a letter to counsel for the Ada County \nCoroner's Office.  In that letter, DRl stated that it disagreed with the Ada County Coroner's \ndecision not to  release the records requested.  It advised that \"[w]e do  not dispute that the \nCoroner may seek judicial review.\"  DRI again asserted that it is the final arbiter of whether \nprobable cause exists and that determination authorizes it to access Ada County Coroner records. \nThe letter claimed that the Ada County Coroner cannot prevent DRl from accessing records \nrelated to D.T. 's death.  DRI then stated if these records are not provided it may file a lawsuit \nagainst the Ada County Coroner.  A copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit E and has \nbeen redacted to remove D.T.'s name and date of death. \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF- PAGE 3 \ng:\\gap\\misc litigation\\disability rights\\pleadings\\complaint for declaratory relief. doc \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 1-3   Filed 09/08/14   Page 4 of 6\n12.  On July 23, 2014,  counsel for DRI wrote another letter to counsel for the Ada \nCounty Coroner, which cited additional statutes and regulations which DRI claimed supported its \nassertion  that  these  records  must  be  disclosed  and  that  DRI  has  certain  confidentiality \nrequirements under federal law.  A copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit F and has been \nredacted to remove D.T.'s name and date of death. \n13.  On August 5, 2014, counsel for the Ada County Coroner responded to the letters \nfrom DRI's attorney.  In that letter, counsel for the Ada County Coroner advised DRI that the. \nAda County Coroner's Office \"continues to have serious concerns about disclosing the coroner's \nrecords relating to [D.T.]\"  The statutes and regulations cited by DRI do not appear to apply to \nthe records requested because the Ada County Coroner is not statutorily charged with overseeing \nor operating facilities that care for patients with disabilities. \n14.  In addition, counsel for the Ada County Coroner explained that the Ada County \nCoroner's Office continues to be  concerned that disclosure of these records may violate the \nprivacy  rights  of D.T.,  D.T.'s  family,  and  individuals  who  interacted  with  D.T.  and  that \ndisclosing the records may subject Ada County to liability since people involved in a coroner's \nreport and investigation enjoy a constitutional right to privacy to avoid disclosure of personal \nmatters.  Under the 9th Circuit's precedent, this privacy right extends to medical information. \nCounsel for the Ada County Coroner also informed DRI that \"[d ]ue to the sensitive nature of \nthese records and the constitutional implications of disclosure, it is the Ada County Coroner's \npolicy not to release such records without a court order or permission from any person whose \nprivacy rights are at risk.\"  A copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit G and has been \nredacted to remove D. T. 's name. \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF- PAGE 4 \ng:\\gap\\misc litigation\\disability rights\\pleadings\\complaint for declaratory relief. doc \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 1-3   Filed 09/08/14   Page 5 of 6\n15.  On August 13, 2014, counsel for DRI wrote counsel for the Ada Cmmty Coroner \nand stated that he agreed there were no published decisions holding that coroners must disclose \nrecords to DRI.  provided a 2003 unpublished Wisconsin decision.  Counsel for DRI again \nmentioned the possibility of DRI filing a lawsuit against the Ada County Coroner.  A copy of \nthis letter is attached hereto as Exhibit H.  A copy of the unpublished Wisconsin decision is also \nattached hereto as Exhibit I. \n16.  DRI and the Ada County Coroner disagree as to whether the Ada County Coroner \nis legally required to provide DRI with the requested records. \n17.  The Ada County Coroner asserts that he is not required to comply with DRl's \nrequest for access to the records related the death ofD.T. \n18.  The  Ada  County  Coroner also  asserts  that providing DRI  with  requested \nrecords  would violate  the  state  and  federal  privacy rights  .,  D.T.'s  family,  and  any \nindividual who interacted with D.T. \nWHEREFORE, Ada County and the Ada County Coroner pray for judgment in their \nfavor as follows: \nA.

DRI denies each and every allegation of the complaint not expressly \nadmitted herein. \n2.  DRI admits paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the complaint. \n3.  DRI admits paragraph 4 in part only to the extent that it was proper \nfor the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, in and for \nthe County of Ada (hereinafter, “Ada County Court”) to exercise personal \njurisdiction over the parties at the time the complaint was filed on August 29, 2014. \nBecause DRI removed this case to this Court on September 8, 2014 pursuant to the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. §1441(a), DRI denies the remainder of paragraph 4 to the \nextent that it suggests that the personal jurisdiction continues to be proper in the \nAda County Court following the removal of this action to this Court. In support of \nthis denial, DRI affirmatively asserts that this Court possesses personal jurisdiction \nover the parties to this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331.  \n4.  DRI admits paragraph 5 of the complaint in part only to the extent \nthat the Ada County Court was the appropriate venue at the time the complaint was \nfiled on August 29, 2014. Because DRI removed this case to this Court on \nSeptember 8, 2014 pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §1441(a), DRI denies \nthe remainder of paragraph 5 to the extent that it suggests that venue continues to \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 2 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 3 of 20\nbe proper in the Ada County Court following the removal of this action to this Court. \nIn support of this denial, DRI affirmatively asserts that venue is proper in this Court \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(2). \n5.  DRI denies paragraph 6 of the complaint. \n6.  DRI admits paragraph 7 of the complaint. \n7.  DRI admits paragraph 8 of the complaint in part that the Coroner sent \nDRI the letter dated June 25, 2014 attached as Exhibit B to the complaint. DRI \ndenies the remainder of paragraph 8 and specifically denies the validity of the legal \nconclusions asserted in both paragraph 8 and the letter of June 25, 2014. \n8.  DRI admits paragraphs 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the complaint. \n9.  DRI admits paragraph 13 of the complaint in part that counsel for the \nCoroner sent DRI the letter dated August 5, 2014 attached as Exhibit G to the \ncomplaint. DRI denies the remainder of paragraph 13 and specifically denies the \nvalidity of the legal conclusions asserted in both paragraph 13 and the letter of \nAugust 5, 2014. \n10.  DRI admits paragraph 14 of the complaint in part that it accurately \nreflects that the Coroner stated in the letter of August 5, 2014 that the Coroner \ncontinued to have concerns about disclosing the requested records to DRI. DRI \ndenies the remainder of paragraph 14 and specifically denies the validity of the \nlegal conclusions asserted in both paragraph 14 and the letter of August 5, 2014. \n11.  DRI admits paragraph 15 and 16 of the complaint. \n12.  DRI denies paragraphs 17 and 18 of the complaint. \n \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 3 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 4 of 20\nAffirmative Defenses \n13.  Real Party in Interest. Ada County is not a real party in interest to this \ncontroversy because at no relevant time has said party had any involvement, \ninterest or stake in the events or the alleged controversy described in the \ncomplaint, thus this Court should dismiss Ada County as a party plaintiff to this \naction pursuant to Fed. Rule. Civ. P. §12(b)(6) and §17(a). \n14.  Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted. The \ncomplaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and this Court \nshould dismiss the complaint in its entirety pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§2201-02 and \nFed. Rule. Civ. P. §12(b)(6) because it fails to present an actual controversy that is \nrequired for the entry of declaratory relief. Although the complaint asserts in \nparagraph 8 that providing DRI with the records in question would “violate the state \nand federal privacy rights of D.T., D.T.’s family, and any individual who interacted \nwith D.T.” nevertheless the complaint fails to assert that either the Ada County \nCoroner or Ada County would suffer any legal jeopardy or legal liability whatsoever \ndue to the release of coroner’s records to DRI, nor does the complaint assert that \nthere are any legal obligations or duties between the parties that are in danger of \nbeing violated in the absence of declaratory relief. The complaint should be further \ndismissed under Fed. Rule. Civ. P. §12(b)(6) because it is not a “well-plead” \ncomplaint and thereby fails to state factual allegations sufficient to provide the \ngrounds for entitlement to declaratory relief. \n15.  Lack of Standing. Ada County and the Ada County Coroner lack \nstanding pursuant to Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 4 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 5 of 20\nConstitution to assert the constitutional or other legal privacy rights of third parties. \nThis Court should dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to present an \nactual case or controversy pursuant to Fed. Rule. Civ. P. §12(b)(1) and §12(b)(6) \nbecause the complaint fails to allege an invasion of a legally protected interest of \neither Ada County and the Ada County Coroner that is concrete and particularized, \nand actual or imminent, not merely speculative, conjectural or hypothetical. \nFurthermore, the complaint fails to assert a causal connection between any alleged \ninjury to either Ada County or the Ada County Coroner that is fairly traceable to \nDRI, and not the result of the independent action of third parties not before the \nCourt.   \n16.  Defendant’s Legal Authority. At all relevant times DRI was legally \nauthorized to request and receive records from the Ada County Coroner related to \nthe death of D.T. because DRI is the designated Protection and Advocacy System \n(hereinafter, “P & A System”) authorized pursuant to the Protection and Advocacy \nfor Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. §10801 et seq. and the \nimplementing federal regulations for PAIMI, 42 C.F.R. Part 51. \n17.  Privacy Protection. At all relevant times DRI as the P & A System for \nthe State of Idaho was legally required to strictly maintain the confidentiality of \nrecords obtained in connection with the investigation of the death of D.T., including \nany records obtained from the Ada County Coroner, pursuant to the provisions of \nPAIMI 42 U.S.C. §10806(a) and 42 C.F.R. §51.45(a), thus the alleged concerns of  \nthe Ada County Coroner that the disclosure of such records to DRI would violate the \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 5 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 6 of 20\nprivacy rights of D.T. or other third persons are wholly unfounded as a matter of \nlaw. \nCOUNTERCLAIM \nDRI counterclaims against the ADA COUNTY CORONER as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n18.  DRI brings this counterclaim for injunctive and declaratory relief to \nchallenge the refusal of the Ada County Coroner to provide timely access to the \nrecords of an investigation of the suicide of D.T., an individual with mental illness, \nin violation of the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act \n(PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n19.  DRI is the Protection and Advocacy System (hereafter “P & A System”) \nfor the State of Idaho. According to PAIMI, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., DRI is \nauthorized as one if its responsibilities as the P & A System to conduct \ninvestigations into incidents of possible abuse, possible neglect, injury or death of \nindividuals with mental illnesses. This investigatory authority is triggered when DRI \ndetermines that there is probable cause to believe that an individual with mental \nillness may have been subject to abuse, neglect or injury. When conducting \ninvestigations into deaths of individuals with mental illness, DRI is empowered by \nPAIMI to have access to all records of that individual, including reports and \nsupporting documents made or used by agencies charged with investigating \nincidents of abuse, neglect and injury. \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 6 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 7 of 20\n20.  Pursuant to state law, I.C. §19-4301, the office of the Ada County \nCoroner is an agency charged with investigating suicides and suspicious deaths in \nAda County. \n21.  The Ada County Coroner’s refusal to provide prompt access to the \nrequested records has substantially impaired DRI’s ability to complete a thorough, \neffective and timely investigation of the suicide of D.T.  \n22.  The Ada County Coroner’s refusal to provide access to the requested \nrecords constitutes a violation of federal law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n23.  Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction over this counterclaim pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §1331 and §1343(a)(3) as this action arises under 42 U.S.C §§10801-\n10827, 42 C.F.R. §51.41, and 42 U.S.C. §1983. \n24.  Venue. Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§1391(b) because the offices of the parties are located in and all of the events and \nomissions giving rise to this counterclaim occurred in Ada County, Idaho. \n STATUTORY PROVISIONS \n25.  28 U.S.C. §§2201-02 (FDJA), 42 U.S.C. §1983, and 42 U.S.C. §10805 \nand §10807 (PAIMI) authorize this counterclaim. \n26.  The findings and purposes of the United States Congress, in passing \nPAIMI, 42 U.S.C. §10801 et seq., as set forth in 42 U.S.C. §10801, include in \npertinent part the following: \n(a) The Congress finds that – \n  (1) individuals with mental illness are vulnerable to abuse and \nserious injury \n ... \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 7 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 8 of 20\n  (4) State systems for monitoring compliance with respect to the \nrights of individuals with mental illness vary widely and are frequently \ninadequate. \n(b) The purposes of this chapter are –  \n  (1) to ensure that the rights of individuals with mental illness \nare protected; and \n  (2) to assist States to establish and operate a protection and \nadvocacy system for individuals with mental illness which will – \n ... \n    (B) investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of \nindividuals with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the \nsystem or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents \noccurred.  \n \n27.  Congress specified the investigatory authority of protection and \nadvocacy systems in 42 U.S.C. § 10805 in pertinent part as follows: \n(a) A system established in a State under section 10803 of this title \nshall – \n  (1) have the authority to –  \n    (A) investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of \nindividuals with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the \nsystem or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents \noccurred \n... \n      (4) In accordance with section 10806 of this title, \nhave access to all records of \n ... \n        (B) any individual (including an individual \nwho has died or whose whereabouts are unknown) – \n          (i) who by reason of the mental or \nphysical condition of such individual is unable to authorize the system \nto have such access; \n          (ii) who does not have a legal \nguardian, conservator, or other legal representative, or for whom the \nlegal guardian is the State; and  \n          (iii) with respect to whom a complaint \nhas been received by the system or with respect to whom as a result \nof monitoring or other activities (either of which may result from a \ncomplaint or other evidence) there is probable cause to believe that \nsuch an individual has been subject to abuse or neglect... \n \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 8 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 9 of 20\n28.  PAIMI includes a description of the types of records to which the \nprotection and advocacy system must be granted access in 42 U.S.C. §10806 in \npertinent part as follows: \n  (b)(3)(A) As used in this section, the term “records” includes ... \nreports prepared by an agency charged with investigating incidents of \nabuse, neglect, and injury occurring at such a facility that describe \nincidents of abuse, neglect and injury occurring at such facility and \nthe steps taken to investigate such incidents ...  \n \n29.  Federal regulations implementing PAIMI further specify the access to \nrecords authority as set forth in 42 C.F.R. § 51.41 in pertinent part as follows: \n  (a) Access to records shall be extended promptly to all \nauthorized agents of a P&A system \n... \n  (c) Information and individual records, whether written or in \nanother medium, draft or final, including handwritten notes, electronic \nfiles, photographs or video or audio tape records, which shall be \navailable to the P&A system under the Act shall include but not be \nlimited to \n... \n    (2) Reports prepared by an agency charged with \ninvestigating abuse, neglect, or  injury occurring at a facility rendering \ncare and treatment, or by or for the facility itself, that describe any or \nall of the following: \n      (i) Abuse, neglect or injury occurring at the facility; \n      (ii) The steps taken to investigate the incidents \n... \n      (iv) Supporting information that was relied upon in \ncreating a report, including all information and records used or \nreviewed in preparing reports of abuse, neglect or injury such as \nrecords which describe persons who were interviewed, physical and \ndocumentary evidence that was reviewed, and the related \ninvestigative findings. \n \nPARTIES \n30.  DISABILITY RIGHTS IDAHO, INC. (Counter-Plaintiff). DRI is a \nnonprofit, charitable 501(c)(3) corporation organized in Idaho on July 6, 1977 \nunder its previous name of “Comprehensive Advocacy, Inc.” On June 29, 2009 \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 9 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 10 of 20\nComprehensive Advocacy, Inc. amended its articles of incorporation to change the \ncorporation’s name to its current name of Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. Since the \ncorporation’s founding in 1977, the State of Idaho has continuously designated DRI \nto protect and advocate on behalf of people with disabilities pursuant to federal law. \nBecause the State of Idaho receives federal funds under the Developmental \nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§6021-30, it is required to \n\"have in effect a system to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. §6042(a). DRI is also the \"eligible system\" \nunder PAIMI, 42 U.S.C. §10802(2). DRI has a mandate and authority to investigate \nabuse and neglect of people with disabilities in the State of Idaho under these laws. \nDRI spends considerable time and resources monitoring conditions at various \ninstitutions providing services to people with disabilities, including mental illness, \nwithin the State of Idaho, and in advocating for the rights of the people residing in \nthose institutions. These facilities have included and will continue to include several \nlocated within Ada County. DRI is a nonprofit, public interest law firm under the \ndirection of James R. Baugh as Executive Director with staff that includes attorneys, \nnon-attorney advocates, and administrative staff. \n31.  ERWIN SONNENBERG, ADA COUNTY CORONER (Counter-Defendant). \nErwin Sonnenberg, the Ada County Coroner, is the duly elected Coroner of Ada \nCounty, Idaho, pursuant to the Idaho Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 6, and \nTitle 31, Chapter 28, Idaho Code. Pursuant to I.C. §19-4301, the Ada County \nCoroner has the duty to investigate and conduct inquests concerning deaths in Ada \nCounty that occur as a result of violence, including suicide death, or deaths that \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 10 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 11 of 20\noccur under suspicious or unknown circumstances. The Ada County Coroner leads \nand directs an office that includes forensic medical staff, medico-legal investigators, \nadministrative staff, and medical consultants. The office of the Ada County Coroner \nhas its own forensic laboratory and employs a forensic pathologist to perform \nautopsies. The Ada County Coroner also officially records and certifies death \ncertificates to reflect the cause and manner of deaths that occur in Ada County. The \nAda County Coroner and his office completed, currently possess and presently \nmaintain records relating to an investigation of the death of D.T. At all times \nrelevant to this action, the Ada County Coroner was operating under the color of \nstate law in his official capacity as a representative of a public entity and within the \nscope of his public employment.  \nFACTS \n32.  D.T. was a patient involuntarily committed at an inpatient psychiatric \nhospital (hereinafter, the “hospital”) located in the City of Boise, Ada County, in or \nabout March 2014. \n33.  In or about March 2014, D.T. committed suicide while receiving \npsychiatric care and treatment at the hospital. \n34.  In or about March 2014, DRI received a report that a patient with \nmental illness had died in the hospital and that the cause of the patient’s death was \nsuicide. The identity of the patient as D.T. was unknown to DRI at this time. \nThereafter, DRI made inquiries of various agencies and entities, including the Boise \nPolice Department, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, and the hospital, to \ndetermine the identity of the patient and to confirm whether a suicide had occurred. \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 11 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 12 of 20\n35.  On May 27, 2014, the hospital disclosed to DRI the identity of D.T. as \nthe patient who had died in its facility due to suicide. The hospital also provided DRI \nwith confidential patient records related to the psychiatric care and treatment of \nD.T. at the hospital and the circumstances of D.T.’s death. \n36.  Based upon the information, records and reports made known to DRI \nand upon DRI’s experience in investigating deaths in inpatient psychiatric facilities, \nDRI determined that D.T. was an individual with a mental illness and that there was \nprobable cause to believe that D.T.’s death may have resulted from abuse or \nneglect. DRI, therefore, commenced an investigation of the circumstances of D.T.’s \ndeath, which is still ongoing. \n37.  As part of its investigation into the suicide of D.T., DRI requested \ninvestigatory records, including a copy of the autopsy report concerning D.T., from \nthe Ada County Coroner on May 29, 2014. A true and correct copy of DRI’s letter of \nrequest, with appropriate privacy redactions, is attached to this counterclaim as \nExhibit “A” and is incorporated herein by reference. \n38.  On June 25, 2014, the Ada County Coroner responded to DRI’s request \nfor records by letter. A true and correct copy of that letter, with appropriate privacy \nredactions, is attached to this counterclaim as Exhibit “B” and is incorporated herein \nby reference. The response letter stated that the Ada County Coroner would not \nprovide the requested records because an investigation into the death of D.T. was \nstill ongoing and that disclosure of the records may violate the privacy rights of D.T. \nand others. The response letter further denied that DRI had authority under PAIMI \nto request and receive the documents. \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 12 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 13 of 20\n39.  On July 7, 2014, DRI wrote to the Ada County Coroner in response to \nthe Coroner’s letter dated June 25, 2014. A true and correct copy of that letter, \nwith appropriate privacy redactions, is attached to this counterclaim as Exhibit “C” \nand is incorporated herein by reference. In the letter DRI stated that it did not wish \nto interfere with any ongoing investigation of the Ada County Coroner related to the \ndeath of D.T. and requested that the Coroner inform DRI when the investigation \nwas complete. \n40.  On July 8, 2014, the office of the Ada County Coroner responded to \nDRI’s letter of July 7, 2014. A true and correct copy of that letter, with appropriate \nprivacy redactions, is attached to this counterclaim as Exhibit “D” and is \nincorporated herein by reference. The letter advised DRI that the investigation into \nthe death of D.T. was complete and enclosed a copy of a public information report \nregarding the matter. \n41.  On July 21 and 23, 2014, DRI wrote letters to the legal counsel for the \nAda County Coroner. True and correct copies of those letters, with appropriate \nprivacy redactions, are attached to this counterclaim as Exhibit “E” and “F” \nrespectively and are incorporated herein by reference. In the letters, DRI advised \nlegal counsel for the Ada County Coroner that PAIMI, its implementing regulations, \nand applicable case law authorized the disclosure of the coroner’s records to DRI. \nThe letters renewed DRI’s request for records and advised that DRI would consider \nits legal remedies in the event that the Coroner refused to provide the requested \nrecords. \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 13 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 14 of 20\n42.  On August 5, 2014, legal counsel for the Ada County Coroner \nresponded to the letters of July 21 and 23, 2014. A true and correct copy of that \nletter, with appropriate privacy redactions, is attached to this counterclaim as \nExhibit “G” and is incorporated herein by reference. In this letter, legal counsel for \nthe Ada County Coroner again denied DRI’s request for records, reasserted the \nCoroner’s position that coroner records were not subject to disclosure under PAIMI, \nand restated that privacy concerns required denial of DRI’s request. \n43.  On August 13, 2014, DRI responded to the letter of legal counsel for \nthe Ada County Coroner. A true and correct copy of that letter, with appropriate \nprivacy redactions, is attached to this counterclaim as Exhibit “H” and is \nincorporated herein by reference. The letter renewed DRI’s request for the records \nin question and asserted that an unpublished federal court case decision supported \nDRI’s legal position. \n44.  To date the Ada County Coroner has refused to provide access to the \nrecords in response to DRI’s repeated requests. The Ada County Coroner has \nfurther refused to acknowledge DRI’s right to have access to these records under \nfederal law. \n45.  As a further part of its investigation into the suicide of D.T., DRI has \nrequested and received relevant records and information from the Boise Police \nDepartment and the hospital, among other entities, in addition to the records \nrequested but not received from the Ada County Coroner. Only the Ada County \nCoroner denied the requested access. \n   \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 14 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 15 of 20\nCOUNT ONE \nClaim for Relief Under 42 U.S.C. §10801 et seq.  \n46.  DRI hereby re-alleges and reasserts paragraphs 18 through 45, above, \nas if fully set forth herein. \n47.  Pursuant to PAIMI, 42 U.S.C. §10801 et seq., DRI is the designated \nProtection and Advocacy System of the State of Idaho charged with investigating \nincidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness. \n48.  D.T. was an “individual with a mental illness,” eligible for DRI services, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §10802(4) and 42 C.F.R. §51.2. \n49.  The hospital was a “facility rendering care and treatment” pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. §10802(3) and 42 C.F.R. §51.2. \n50.  The Ada County Coroner’s position is created by the Idaho \nConstitution, and pursuant to I.C. §19-4301 is charged with investigation of deaths, \nincluding suicides, in Ada County.  \n51.  Records pertaining to the investigation of the death of D.T. in the \npossession of the Ada County Coroner are “records,” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§10805(4), are “information and individual records,” pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \n§51.41(c), and are reports and supporting information prepared or used by an \nagency charged with investigating abuse, neglect or injury which occurred at a \nfacility rendering care and treatment, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §10806(b)(3)(A) and \n42 C.F.R. §51.41(c)(2).  \n52.  DRI and its authorized agents must be provided with “prompt” access \nto the records referenced in paragraph 51 upon request. 42 C.F.R. §51.41(a). \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 15 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 16 of 20\n53.  Despite numerous requests from DRI, the Ada County Coroner has \nrepeatedly refused to acknowledge DRI’s authority under PAIMI and has repeatedly \nrefused to allow DRI to have access to these records under PAIMI and its \nregulations. \n54.  The Ada County Coroner’s refusal to acknowledge DRI’s authority \nunder PAIMI and to provide DRI with prompt access to the requested records in this \nmatter prevents DRI from fully performing its statutory duty to investigate incidents \nof suspected abuse, neglect, and injury and to seek remedies to protect the rights \nof persons with disabilities. This causes immediate and irreparable harm to DRI and \nthe people with disabilities DRI is designated to protect.  \n55.  DRI has no adequate remedy at law and continues to suffer irreparable \nharm as a result of the Ada County Coroner’s actions and inactions. \n56.  The Ada County Coroner’s actions and inactions in refusing to promptly \nprovide DRI with all the records it has requested relating to the investigation of the \ndeath of D.T. violate DRI's statutory rights under PAIMI, 42 U.S.C. §10801 et seq. \n57.  Due to the Ada County Coroner’s violations of PAIMI, DRI is entitled to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs, and other relief, as set \nforth in the Prayer for Relief below. \nCOUNT TWO \nClaim for Relief Under 42 U.S.C. §1983 \n58.  DRI hereby re-alleges and reasserts paragraphs 18 through 45, above, \nas if fully set forth herein. \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 16 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 17 of 20\n59.  42 U.S.C. §1983 provides relief for persons who, under color of state \nlaw, have been deprived of any rights, privileges or immunities secured under \nfederal law. \n60.  The Ada County Coroner’s actions, inactions, practices, policies and \nprocedures, as set forth herein, violated DRI’s statutory rights under PAIMI, 42 \nU.S.C. §10801 et seq., thereby depriving DRI of rights, privileges or immunities \nsecured under federal law. \n61.  The Ada County Coroner undertook actions, inactions, practices, \npolicies and procedures, as asserted herein, under color of state law. \n62.  In refusing to comply with DRI’s records requests, as asserted herein, \nthe Ada County Coroner undertook actions and inactions knowingly, intentionally or \nwith deliberate indifference and willful and callous disregard of DRI’s rights under \nPAIMI, 42 U.S.C. §10801 et seq. \n63.  Due to the violation of DRI’s statutory rights by the Ada County \nCoroner’s actions, inactions, practices, policies and procedures, as asserted herein, \nDRI has suffered immediate and irreparable harm and has no adequate remedy at \nlaw. \n64.  Due to the Ada County Coroner’s refusal to promptly allow access to \nthe requested records, DRI has been unable to complete its investigation into the \nsuicide of D.T. Furthermore, DRI has been required to devote staff time and effort \nto repeated attempts to obtain access, thereby incurring expenses that would not \nhave been incurred if the Coroner had complied with DRI’s statutory access rights. \nDRI has thereby lost the opportunity to serve other clients and to address \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 17 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 18 of 20\nprotection and advocacy services to other issues, further affecting DRI’s allocation \nof staff resources and causing expense to DRI which would not have been incurred \nif the Coroner had complied with DRI’s statutory access rights. \n65.  Due to the Ada County Coroner’s violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983, DRI is \nentitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs, and other \nrelief, as set forth in the Prayer for Relief below. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, DRI requests as follows: \na)  That the Court exercise jurisdiction over this action; \nb)  That this Court dismiss the Complaint for Declaratory Relief of Ada \nCounty and the Ada County Coroner dated August 29, 2014 and that they take \nnothing thereby; \nc)  That the Court enter a declaratory judgment holding as follows:  \n1)  That DRI has the right to access the requested records of the \nAda County Coroner under PAIMI; \n2)  That the Ada County Coroner’s actions and inactions violated \nPAIMI; and \n3)  That the Ada County Coroner immediately give DRI access to \nthe requested records; \nd)  That the Court enjoin the Ada County Coroner, his successors and any \nother person acting in concert with the Ada County Coroner or the successor of the \nAda County Coroner regarding the following actions or inactions: \n \nANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM – PAGE 18 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL   Document 5   Filed 09/18/14   Page 19 of 20\n1)  Failing to provide to DRI any report, document, or other record \nrelating to D.T., including those related to D.T.’s death and any \ninvestigation thereof, or relating to any other person who is a client of \nDRI or whose records DRI is authorized to have access to under PAIMI \nor other federal law; and \n2)  Otherwise interfering with any investigation of abuse and \nneglect authorized under the PAIMI Act or other federal law; \ne)  That the Court, enter a judgment against the Ada County Coroner, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983 and 42 U.S.C. §1988(b), awarding attorney fees, \ncosts and expenses incurred by or on behalf of DRI in this action;  \nf)  That the Court grant such other relief to DRI as may be just, equitable, \nand appropriate. \nDated this 18th day of September, 2014. \nDISABILITY RIGHTS IDAHO, INC. \n \nBy: __ /s/  John C.

The parties have filed their responsive briefing to the Motion to Remand and the\nmatter is now ripe for the Court’s consideration. Having fully reviewed the record herein, the\nCourt finds that the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the record.\nAccordingly, in the interest of avoiding further delay, and because the Court conclusively\nfinds that the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument the Court\nwill decide this matter based on the record.\nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 1\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nOn September 8, 2014, Plaintiffs, Ada County Coroner and Ada County, initiated this\naction by filing a Complaint for Declaratory Relief in Idaho state court. The claim relates to\nrequests by the Defendant, Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. (DRI), demanding the Plaintiffs\nprovide certain records relating to the suicide death of an individual, D.T., who had been\nresiding in an inpatient behavioral health unit of an Ada County hospital. Plaintiffs denied\nthe Defendant’s request for non-public records and initiated this declaratory judgment action\nasking for a determination as to whether they are obligated to provided Defendant with the\nrequested records. (Dkt. 1-3.) The claim is brought pursuant to Idaho Code § 1201 et seq.,\nthe Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, and Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 57. (Dkt. 1-3.)\n(The Complaint also cites to Idaho Code §§ 10-1210, 12-117, 12-120, 12-121, and “other\napplicable federal and state laws and/or Rules of Civil Procedure.”). \nDefendant filed a Notice of Removal bringing the case before this Court pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441(a), 1447(c) based on federal question jurisdiction. (Dkt. 1.)\nPlaintiffs then filed the instant Motion to Remand arguing the Court has discretion to refrain\nfrom deciding this declaratory judgment action because it involves state law issues. (Dkt. 9.)\nThe Court finds as follows.\nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 2\n\nDISCUSSION\n1. Standard for Removal\nFederal district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and are “presumed to lack\nsubject matter jurisdiction until the contrary affirmatively appears.” Dragovich v. United\nStates Dep't of Treasury, 764 F.Supp.2d 1178, 1184 (N.D. Cal. 2011). When an action is\nremoved to federal district court from state court, the district court has “broad discretion” to\nremand the removed claim or cause of action. 28 U.S.C. § 1452(b); see also 28 U.S.C. §\n1446(c)(4) (noting that if a court finds “that removal should not be permitted, the court shall\nmake an order for summary remand”).\nA defendant may remove any civil action from state court to federal district court if\nthe district court has original jurisdiction over the matter. 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). Here, the\nDefendant argues a federal question is presented because the claim arises under the United\nStates Constitution and/or federal law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332. Federal\nquestion removal is appropriate under § 1331 which states: “The district courts shall have\noriginal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\nUnited States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1331. “[A]ny civil action brought in a State court of which the\ndistrict courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the\ndefendant...to the district court of the United States....”  28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). The “burden\nof establishing federal jurisdiction is on the party seeking removal, and the removal statute\nis strictly construed against removal jurisdiction.” Prize Frize, Inc. v. Matrix  Inc., 167 F.3d \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 3\n\n1261, 1265 (9th Cir. 1999). Any doubt as to the right of removal is resolved in favor of\nremand. Gaus v. Miles, Inc., 980 F.2d 564, 566 (9th Cir. 1992).\nIn determining whether removal is proper, the Court first considers whether a federal\nquestion exists on the face of the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint. Caterpillar, Inc. v.\nWilliams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987) (“Only state-court actions that originally could have been\nfiled in federal court may be removed to federal court by the Defendant.”). If a complaint\nalleges only state law claims and lacks a federal question on its face, then the federal court\nmust grant the motion to remand. See 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c); Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 392.\nThere are, however, exceptions when a well-pleaded state law cause of action will be deemed\nto arise under federal law and support removal such as “(1) where federal law completely\npreempts state law, (2) where the claim is necessarily federal in character, or where the right\nto relief depends on the resolution of a substantial, disputed federal question.” ARCO Envtl.\nRemediation L.L.C. v. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Quality of Mont., 213 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th\nCir. 2000) (internal citations omitted). Furthermore, cases “may not be removed to federal\ncourt on the basis of a federal defense.” Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 393. This is true even when\nthe federal defense is one that can be readily anticipated by the Plaintiff. Franchise Tax Bd.\nof Calif. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust of S. Cal., 463 U.S. 1, 10 (1983). \nIf the district court determines that removal was improper, then plaintiff may be\nawarded costs and attorney fees accrued in response to the defendant's removal. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1447(c). The court has broad discretion to award costs and fees whenever it finds that \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 4\n\nremoval was wrong as a matter of law. Balcorta v. Twentieth–Century Fox Film Corp., 208\nF.3d 1102, 1106 n. 6 (9th Cir. 2000).\n2. Analysis\nThis is a civil declaratory judgment action brought by Plaintiffs in Idaho state court.\n(Dkt. 1.) Defendant argues this Court has original jurisdiction because the claim requires a\ndetermination as to whether the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness\nAct (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., requires the Ada County Coroner to disclose the\nrecords requested by DRI. (Dkt. 15.) Plaintiffs counter that because the Ada County Coroner\nis not an agency described in PAIMI, 42 U.S.C. § 10806(3), that federal statue does not apply\nand, therefore, this action is solely a state law matter. (Dkt. 9 at 8.) \nThe question of whether or not PAIMI applies and its implications to the declaratory\njudgment claims raised here is not dispositive of the question raised on this Motion to\nRemand. The presence of a question concerning the application of a federal statute, in this\ncase PAIMI, “in a defensive argument does not overcome the paramount policies embodied\nin the well-pleaded complaint rule-that the plaintiff is the master of the complaint, that a\nfederal question must appear on the face of the complaint, and that the plaintiff may, by\neschewing claims based on federal law, choose to have the cause heard in state court...a\ndefendant cannot, merely by injecting a federal question into an action that asserts what is\nplainly a state-law claim, transform the action into one arising under federal law, thereby\nselecting the forum in which the claim shall be litigated.” Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 398-99.\nSimilarly, the Defendant’s reliance on PAIMI’s application to this case is a defense and/or\nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 5\n\ncounterclaim. Any “federal question defendants raise in their counterclaims does not provide\na basis for removal.” Takeda v. Northwestern Nat. Life Ins. Co., 765 F.2d 815, 822 (9th Cir.\n1985).1\nThe Court must instead look to the well-plead Complaint itself in ruling on the Motion\nto Remand. “[F]ederal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the\nface of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint.” Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 392.2 In doing so\nhere, the Court concludes that federal question jurisdiction is found on the face of the\nComplaint. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1441.\nThe Complaint seeks a declaratory judgment determination as to whether or not the\nAda County Coroner is required to provided DRI with the requested records and whether\nsuch a disclosure would expose the Defendants to liability for violating any privacy rights\nof any individuals included in those records. (Dkt. 1.) While the Complaint cites only to\nIdaho state statutes, it makes several references to “federal law.” For instance, the Complaint\ncontains statements made in Plaintiffs’ letters responding to the Defendant’s requests that\n1 Plaintiffs’ argument that PAIMI does not apply in this case because the Ada County\nCoroner is not an agency described in 42 U.S.C. § 10806(3) goes to the substance of\nDefendant’s defense/counterclaim. (Dkt. 9 at 7-8.) This Court makes no finding in this Order\nconcerning the question of whether PAIMI applies and/or requires disclosure of the records\nsought by Defendant in this case.\n2  The  Wilton/Brillhart  doctrine  argued  by  Plaintiffs  does  not  apply  to  the\ncircumstances in this case. (Dkt. 9.) That doctrine is at play when a federal court is\nconsidering whether to exercise its discretion over a federal declaratory judgment action in\nthe face of a pending parallel state court case. Here, there is no other state court case pending.\nThe state court declaratory judgment action has been removed. Thus, the question here is\ninstead whether the claim stated in the Complaint in this case gives rise to federal question\njurisdiction.\nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 6\n\nexpressed  concerns  over  violating  privacy  rights  protected  under  the  “Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution” and “Ninth Circuit precedent.” (Dkt. 1-3 at\n¶ 8, 14.) More importantly, the Complaint’s prayer for relief seeks a determination as to\nwhether “providing DRI with the requested records would violate the state and federal\nprivacy rights” and declaratory judgment that Plaintiffs are “not required by state or federal\nlaw to provide DRI records relating to D.T.’s suicide....” (Dkt. 1-3 at ¶¶ 18 and A) (emphasis\nadded.) \nThe Court finds that these statements in the Complaint, at least at this time, give rise\nto federal jurisdiction.3 Specifically, Plaintiffs’ request for a determination as to whether\neither state or federal law require them to disclose the requested records and whether doing\nso would violate privacy rights protected by both state and federal law. (Dkt. 1-3 at ¶ A.) By\nso stating in their Complaint, the Plaintiffs have clearly sought a determination concerning\ntheir obligations to disclose the records and possible privacy rights violations under both\nstate and federal law. Because federal law has been raised on the face of the Complaint itself,\nthe Court finds federal jurisdiction has been shown in this case. The Motion to Remand is\ndenied.\n3 The state law determinations implicated in this case are undoubtedly important ones\nthat may be more appropriate for the state court to rule upon. In the event the basis giving\nrise to federal jurisdiction in this case are later resolved, this Court may decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over any remaining state law claims and remand the case at that\ntime.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 7\n\nORDER\nBased on the foregoing, and being fully advised in the premises, IT IS HEREBY\nORDERED that the Motion to Remand (Dkt. 9) is DENIED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any dispositive motion(s) shall be filed by June 15,\n2015.\nDATED:  April 29, 2015\n                                                \nHonorable Edward J.
