For the reasons stated on the record in 17-cv-1216 (ABJ) Defendants' (DC, et al.,) motion to dismiss the Horse complaint 38 is granted as to claims 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14. The motion is denied as to all other claims. Plaintiffs' constitutional claims against the District cannot proceed on the final policymaker theory of municipal liability, but they may proceed on failure to train / failure to supervise grounds. Defendant John Does's 55 motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment as to Count 16 is denied. For the reasons stated on the record in 18-cv-120 (ABJ) Defendants' motion to dismiss the Schultz complaint 12 is granted as to claims 3 and 6. All other claims will move forward; however, the Schultz plaintiffs' constitutional claims against the District cannot proceed on the final policymaker theory of municipal liability, although they may proceed on failure to train / failure to supervise grounds. The parties shall file a notice with the Court by 10/18/2019 informing the Court if they seek early mediation either through the Court's Mediation Program, with a Magistrate Judge or with any other proposal they have. Class certification litigation is stayed pending further order of the Court. (Court Reporter: Janice Dickman) (jth)"

Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 7 and 12, plaintiffs' motion to strike 42 is procedurally improper because a motion to motion to strike is limited to pleadings, and a motion to dismiss under Rule 12 is not a pleading. See Modaressi v. Vedadi, 441 F. Supp. 2d 51, 54 (D.D.C. 2006). Thus, the Court will treat plaintiffs motion to strike as an opposition to defendant John Doe's motion to dismiss. See Bush v. Butler, 521 F. Supp. 2d 63, 66 n.1 (D.D.C. 2007). After consideration of the motion and the opposition, Doe's Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment 40 is hereby DENIED without prejudice on the grounds that it is premature. Defendant John Doe has not yet been served or named in the case, and so he \"cannot be dismissed... from a lawsuit to which [he is] not a part[y].\" Maverick Entmt Grp., Inc. v. Does 1−2, 115, 810 F.

The Court also wishes to advise counsel that this case is in its very early stages, and that the pleadings to be filed in the future will be more effective and better received if the emphasis is placed on factual and legal arguments rather than on casting aspersions on opposing counsel. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on 9/8/2017. (lcabj3) (Entered: 09/08/2017)"

    "summary": "<p>On June 21, 2017, a photojournalist, a practicing attorney, and two demonstrators filed this lawsuit against the District of Columbia, the individual police officers who committed the alleged acts, the police officers&rsquo; supervisors, and the chief of D.C. police in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia. Another female demonstrator and her 10-year-old son joined the suit through an amended complaint on January 3, 2018. The plaintiffs claimed, under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, that the defendants violated their rights under the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and various D.C. laws. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus costs. The case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that on the morning of Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017, they traveled to DC to peacefully demonstrate and document the demonstrations protesting the inauguration of Donald Trump. After several acts of vandalism performed by third parties, the plaintiffs claimed that the police took several illegal actions against them. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to give dispersal orders before firing chemical irritants on the crowd and chasing them toward an enclosed street corner. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants falsely imprisoned the plaintiffs, along with 200 other individuals, violating D.C.&rsquo;s First Amendment Assemblies Act and their protected free speech. They also claimed that the defendants used a practice called &ldquo;kettling&rdquo; where the plaintiffs were kept for up to 9-10 hours while denied access to food, water, or toilet services. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants intentionally trapped the plaintiffs before sealing off the kettle preventing escape and continued to use chemical irritants on the plaintiffs after they were trapped in the \"kettle.\"</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff mother, son, and legal observer, who were outside of the &ldquo;kettle,&rdquo; alleged that they peaceably observed and protested the kettling of the other demonstrators. They stated that, without any dispersal order, the defendants fired chemical irritants on the crowd, including the 10-year-old plaintiff and knocked him to the ground. After being taken out of the kettle, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants physically injured their wrists, causing one plaintiff's wrist to bleed from the zip ties for several hours. Moreover, two plaintiffs claimed that the defendants subjected them to unreasonable searches via rectal probing with no just cause.</p>\r\n<p>On March 30, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. They based their motion on the grounds that they are entitled to qualified immunity against the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional claims, there was probable cause to arrest certain plaintiffs, and other plaintiffs failed to state a claim for assault or battery, among others.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, a defendant officer John Doe filed a motion to dismiss Claim 16 (intentional infliction of emotional distress) of the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that certain plaintiffs&rsquo; allegations contradicted their prior allegations and their allegations were disproved by the evidence.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to strike the defendant's motions. However, on November 12, 2018, Judge Jackson ruled that the motion to strike is procedurally improper and treated the motion as an opposition to the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. In addition, Judge Jackson denied defendant John Doe&rsquo;s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment without prejudice on the grounds that it is premature because the defendant was not yet named as a defendant in the lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 3, 2019, defendant officer John Doe renewed his motion to dismiss, which was then opposed by the plaintiffs. The defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss filed on March 30, 2018 was pending at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2019, Judge Jackson granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss the amended complaint as to claims 2 (arrest for protected speech), 4 (negligence per se for the violation of the protected assemblies act through kettling), 5 (negligence per se for the violation of the protected assemblies act through failure to provide a dispersal order), 8 (negligence per se for the violation of the protected assemblies act through use of chemical irritants), 9 (excessive force for knocking down a minor), 10 (assault for knocking down a minor), 13 (negligence per se for the violation of the protected assemblies act through failure to provide food), and 14 (negligence per se for the violation of the protected assemblies act through failure to process arrestees promptly). Judge Jackson denied the motion as to all other claims (arrest without probable cause, false arrest, excessive force and assault for use of chemical irritants, excessive force for zipties, unlawful pre-trial confinement, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unreasonable search). Defendant John Doe&rsquo;s motion to dismiss, which was based on search practices, was also denied in whole. Class certification litigation was stayed pending further order of the court.</p>\r\n<p>With the consent of the parties on October 18, 2019, the matter was referred to the court&rsquo;s mediation program to commence on October 22, 2019. The parties filed a joint motion to extend time for mediation on December 16, 2019, which Judge Jackson granted the following day. The court ordered that mediation shall conclude by February 7, 2020 but then granted extensions on the mediation deadline based on status reports. The court ordered mediation conclude by June 12, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout 2020, the court continued to stay the case and extend the deadline for the conclusion of mediation. The parties continued to negotiate attempts to reach an agreement. A January 25, 2021 status report indicated that they had agreed on final terms of a settlement agreement, subject to Mayoral approval. The parties disputed over the next steps. The defendants sought a 60 day stay for the Mayor to consider and approve the settlement. The plaintiffs argued that Mayoral approval was not required and that all was left to do was sign the agreement. The plaintiffs requested a status hearing to discuss if the defendants would be signing the agreement, and if not, the next steps in the litigation. The court held a status hearing on February 26, 2021 and gave the defendants additional time to obtain approval.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 2021, the agreement had remained unsigned. The parties filed another status report on April 6, 2021. The defendants indicated that the Mayor approved the settlement except for one term. The plaintiffs, meanwhile, asserted that this was not true and that rather the Mayor flatly rejected the agreement. They expressed a desire to reach a settlement with the defendants but indicated that they also intend to move the litigation forward in the meantime.</p>\r\n<p>On April 13, 2021, the plaintiffs accepted the defendants&rsquo; proposed language. The parties, on April 26, 2021, submitted a Joint Notice of Settlement, stating that the plaintiffs would file a stipulation of dismissal without 15 days of completion of the agreement. According to <a href=\"https://www.acludc.org/en/cases/horse-v-district-columbia-challenging-mass-arrests-excessive-force-and-unconstitutional#:~:text=Horse%20v.-,District%20of%20Columbia%20%2D%20Challenging%20Mass%20Arrests%2C%20Excessive%20Force%2C%20and,as%20to%20Anti%2DInaguration%20Demonstrators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the ACLU DC</a>, the plaintiffs will be paid $605,000 in an agreement that the defendants would not oppose the arrested plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to expunge their arrest records and policy changes to speed up processing during the mass arrests and to require that officers be reminded of the First Amendment Assemblies Act prior to mass demonstrations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 21, 2021, the parties stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice and each party bearing its own fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed.&nbsp;</p>",

There was probable cause to arrest plaintiffs Horse and Lagesse. \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 2 of 69\n3.  Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, Gonzalez, Frisbie-Fulton, A.S., and Ariel fail \nto state a claim for assault or battery because they fail to allege intentional acts by \ndefendants. \n4.  Plaintiffs fail  to allege  a basis to  hold  the District  liable  under  42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 for plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. \n5.  Plaintiffs  fail  to  state  viable  claims  of  negligence  per se because, \namong other defects, the cited statutes do not impose specific duties on specific \nactors and the Amended Complaint does not allege that violations of these statutes \ncaused plaintiffs’ injuries. \n6.  Plaintiff  Gonzalez fails to  state  a  claim for  intentional  infliction of \nemotional distress because he fails to allege outrageous conduct by defendants or \nthat he suffered severe emotional distress. \nThese  grounds  are  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  the  accompanying \nmemorandum of points and authorities. A proposed order is attached. \nDated:  March 30, 2018.    Respectfully submitted, \n \n          KARL A.

Civil Action No. 17-1216 (ABJ) \n   \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al.,    \n   \n      Defendants.   \n   \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’  \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  On January 20, 2017, thousands of people took to the streets of Washington, \nD.C., for demonstrations relating to the presidential inauguration. Although most of \nthese demonstrations proceeded peacefully, one group of self-described anarchists \nand anti-fascists rioted across Northwest D.C., breaking storefront windows, tossing \nnewspaper stands and trashcans into the street, and spray-painting and destroying \nvehicles.  The  District  of  Columbia  Metropolitan  Police  Department  (MPD)  was \ntasked with controlling the violence and arresting the rioters, who responded by \nattacking  and  violently  charging  at  MPD  officers  in  a  bid  to  escape  arrest. \nPlaintiffs—some of whom were arrested for rioting that day, and two of whom are \nstill actively being prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office—have filed \nthis  action  against  the  District  of  Columbia  (the  District)  and  many  of  the \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 5 of 69\nresponding MPD officers, alleging a total of sixteen constitutional and common law \nclaims. But as set forth below, these claims lack merit and should be dismissed. \nFACTS \n \nOn  Inauguration  Day  2017,  while  thousands  protested  peacefully  in  the \nDistrict,  some  demonstrators  wearing  hoods,  masks,  and  all  black  clothing \ndestroyed property and engaged in other acts of vandalism. See Am. Compl. [29] ¶¶ \n15–16, 21–22, 46. These individuals were in a group of hundreds that met at Logan \nCircle at approximately 10 a.m. and walked south, towards the National Mall. Id. ¶ \n17. Plaintiffs Shay Horse and Milo Gonzalez were among them. Id. ¶¶ 19, 76. \nFifteen minutes after the group left Logan Circle, members began destroying \nproperty, including breaking storefront windows. Id. ¶¶ 32, 46. Chief Newsham and \nAssistant  Chief  Greene  were  monitoring  the  violence  from  the  MPD  Command \nCenter. Id. ¶¶ 199–200. Shortly after the violence began, the on-scene commander, \nKeith Deville, declared that the demonstration had turned into a riot and ordered \nofficers to stop the group. Id. ¶ 32. Commander Deville received this order from \nAssistant Chief Greene, who “received direction from” Chief Newsham. Id. ¶ 33. \nCommander Deville, also “under the direction of Defendant Chief Newsham and \nAsst. Chief Greene,” authorized the officers on the scene to use pepper spray and \nstingballs, as needed. Id. ¶¶ 39, 41, 42. Around this time, plaintiff Horse alleges he \nwas pepper sprayed by Officer Murphy while photographing individuals wearing \n“hoods and masks” breaking windows. Id. ¶ 46–47. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 6 of 69\nApproximately fifteen minutes after Commander Deville declared the event a \nriot—and  thirty  minutes  after  the  demonstration  began—plaintiff  Elizabeth \nLagesse joined the group. Id. ¶ 53. At some point after she began marching, but \nbefore she was arrested, Lagesse put on lab safety goggles and covered her mouth \nwith a bandana to protect herself from the possible effects of pepper spray. Id. ¶¶ \n54, 58. \nPlaintiffs  Horse  and  Lagesse  both  fled,  “run[ning]  away  from  the  police, \nheading north up 14th Street NW, then east on L Street NW,”  changing course as \nthey encountered MPD officers. Id. ¶¶ 56, 59–60. The group continued to move until \n“Cmdr. Deville, under the  direction of  Chief Newsham and Asst. Chief Greene, \nordered MPD officers to establish a blockade at the corner of 12th and L Streets \nNW.” Id. ¶ 61. Around 10:45 a.m., id. ¶ 75, officers detained approximately 200 \nindividuals in a cordoned area—the “kettle”—at 12th and L Streets, N.W., id. ¶ 65. \nOfficers Howden, Rock, Thau and Washington were “among the MPD officers who \nestablished the blockade,” id. ¶ 62; Sergeant Alioto was “among the MPD officers \nwho supervised the establishment of the blockade,” id. ¶ 63.  \nPlaintiffs Horse, Gonzalez, and Lagesse were detained in the kettle. Id. ¶ 76. \nThey allege that while they were detained, Officers Washington, Rock, and Thau \ndeployed pepper spray into the group of detainees. Id. ¶ 80. “Although Plaintiffs \nHorse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez are unsure whether they were targeted personally by \nany of the officers’ uses of pepper spray or stingballs,” they allege “the tight packing \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 7 of 69\nof the detainees into a small space ensured that everyone in the kettle would feel \nthe effects of spray directed at the crowd of detainees.” Id. ¶ 82. \n“Within 30 or 45 minutes of the formation of the kettle, by 11:30 a.m., MPD \nhad prisoner vans and processing officers at the scene and was ready for processing \nof detainees.” Id. ¶ 97. “Nonetheless, the handcuffing of detainees and placing them \ninto vehicles for transport to detention facilities stretched on for hours, with some of \nthe detainees, including Plaintiff Lagesse, remaining on the corner of 12th and L \nStreets  NW  until  the  late  afternoon  and  others,  including  Plaintiffs  Horse  and \nGonzalez, remaining until after sunset.” Id. ¶ 98. Plaintiffs allege that Assistant \nChief Alder, Commander Carroll, and Lieutenant Niepling supervised this process. \nId. ¶ 87. While detained in the kettle, Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez were without \nfood, water, and toilets. Id. ¶ 88. \nAt  approximately  1:00  p.m.,  while  some  arrestees  were  still  awaiting \ntransport, plaintiff Gwen Frisbie-Fulton went to the scene with her ten-year old \nson, plaintiff A.S. Id. ¶ 108. They stayed for approximately 45 minutes. Id. ¶ 111. At \n1:30 p.m., plaintiff Judah Ariel also went to the scene. Id. ¶ 114.  \nAriel alleges that fifteen minutes after he arrived, 11 officers “suddenly and \nwithout  warning”  pepper  sprayed  people  outside  the  kettle,  including  him;  he \nalleges  those  officers  were  Lieutenant  Whiteside  and  Officers  Dennis,  Baldwin, \nFlash,  Steffes,  Rocatto,  Baskerville,  Brooks,  Vongkeo,  Dennis,  Parker,  and \nWilliams. Id.  ¶  120.  Ariel  alleges  the  pepper  spray  was  ordered  by  Lieutenant \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 8 of 69\nWhiteside and Sergeant Hill, who “walked behind the line of officers speaking to \nthem moments before the spraying began.” Id. ¶ 122. \nPlaintiffs Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. do not allege they were directly sprayed \nwith any chemical irritant. See id. ¶¶ 140, 142. However, plaintiff Frisbie-Fulton \nalleges she inhaled pepper spray, id. ¶ 140, and plaintiff A.S. alleges pepper spray \n“landed” on his winter hat, id. ¶ 142. A.S. also alleges Officers Masci and Angulo \n“collided  with  [him],  knocking  him  to  the  ground.” Id.  ¶  129.  He  deduces  that \nLieutenant Whiteside and Sergeant Hill ordered the “charge” that resulted in this \ncollision based on observing them walk behind the line of officers and seeing them \nspeak to those officers moments before. Id. ¶ 130. Plaintiffs Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. \nfurther recount that an unnamed MPD officer attempted to help them flee, but the \ngroup became separated. Id. ¶ 138. \nAfter  Horse,  Gonzalez,  and  Lagesse  had  been  detained  in  the  kettle  for \nseveral hours, they were formally arrested and handcuffed with zipties. Id. ¶ 145. \nOfficer  Hinostroza  arrested  Horse and  Gonzalez,  and  Officer Bogardus  arrested \nLagesse. Id. ¶ 145. Horse and Lagesse allege that their zipties were too tight and \nleft scarring on their wrists. Id. ¶¶ 147, 150, 178, 185.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \nDismissal of a claim or complaint is appropriate when a party fails to set \nforth “a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “To survive \na motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 9 of 69\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). \nAlthough the factual allegations in the complaint must be taken as true, a plaintiff \nmust  offer  “more  than  labels and  conclusions”  or  “a  formulaic  recitation  of  the \nelements  of  a  cause  of  action.”  Twombly,  550  U.S.  at  555.  “Nor  does  a \ncomplaint suffice  if  it tenders  ‘naked  assertion[s]’  devoid  of  ‘further  factual \nenhancement.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557)). \nARGUMENT \nI.  CLAIM  1:    Horse’s  and  Lagesse’s  Fourth  Amendment  Unlawful  Arrest \nClaims Should be Dismissed. \n \nA.   Claim 1 Should Be Dismissed Because Plaintiffs Were Arrested Based \non Probable Cause. \n \nHorse and Lagesse allege they were arrested in violation of their Fourth \nAmendment rights and bring a § 1983 claim against the District and ten individual \ndefendants:  Newsham, Greene, Deville, Alioto, Howden, Rock, Thau, Washington, \nBogardus, and Hinostroza. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 207–09. Because Horse and Lagesse do \nnot sufficiently allege a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights, their unlawful \narrest claim should be dismissed.  \n“The Fourth Amended protects ‘[t]he right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. \nBecause  arrests  are  ‘seizures’  of  ‘persons,’  they  must  be  reasonable  under  the \ncircumstances.” District of Columbia v. Wesby, 138 S. Ct. 577, 587 (2018) (quoting \nPayton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 585 (1980)). A seizure is reasonable if it is \nsupported by probable cause, which “exists ‘when known facts and circumstances \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 10 of 69\nare sufficient to warrant [an officer] of reasonable prudence in the belief that an \noffense has been or is being committed.’” Dukore v. District of Columbia, 799 F.3d \n1137, 1142 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Davis, 458 F.2d 819, 821 (D.C. \nCir. 1972)). “To determine whether an officer had probable cause for an arrest, ‘we \nexamine  the  events  leading  up  to  the  arrest,  and  then  decide  whether  these \nhistorical  facts,  viewed  from  the  standpoint  of  an  objectively  reasonable  police \nofficer, amount to probable cause.’” Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 586 (quoting Maryland v. \nPringle,  540  U.S.  366,  371  (2003)).  “[P]robable  cause  is  evaluated  from  the \nperspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of \nhindsight.” Ronkim v. Vihn, 71 F. Supp. 3d 124 (D.D.C. 2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). It “depends on the totality of the circumstances” and is “a flued \nconcept.” Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 586 (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 232 \n(1983)). “It ‘requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not \nan actual showing of such activity.’” Id. (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 243–44 n.13). \nTaking the facts alleged in the Complaint as true, there was probable cause \nto arrest Horse and Lagesse. Under District law, it is a crime to engage in a riot or \nwillfully incite or urge other persons to riot. D.C. Code § 22-1322(b)–(c). A riot is “a \npublic  disturbance  involving  an  assemblage  of  5  or  more  persons  which  by \ntumultuous  and  violent  conduct  or  the  threat  thereof  creates  grave  danger  of \ndamage or injury to property or persons.” D.C. Code § 22-1322(a).  \nHorse and Lagesse admit they were travelling within a group that “engaged \nin acts of vandalism.” Am. Compl. ¶ 22. They also allege that some members of the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 11 of 69\ngroup left when violence began, id. ¶ 67, but that they were both with the group at \nleast 15 minutes after the violence started. See id. ¶ 32 (vandalism occurred within \nfifteen minutes of the group leaving Logan Circle); ¶ 53 (Lagesse joined the group \nthirty minutes after they left Logan Circle); ¶ 46 (Horse was with the group when \nmembers broke storefront windows).  \nAdditionally, Horse knew that the group was engaged in vandalism. See id. ¶ \n46. And although Lagesse does not allege whether or not she was aware of the \nvandalism  when  she  joined  and  continued  with  the  group,  the  probable  cause \ndetermination is made from the perspective of an officer. Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 587. \nA  reasonable  officer  would  have  had  probable  cause  to  believe  Lagesse  was \nengaging in criminal activity with the group because she remained with them at \nleast 15 minutes after the vandalism began, and was equipped with gear to hide \nportions of her face and protect herself from the effects of pepper spray. See Am. \nCompl. ¶ 58. She alleges she donned lab safety goggles and covered part of her face \nwith a bandana prior to her arrest. Id. Individuals who were engaged in vandalism \nalso covered their faces. Id. ¶ 22. \nAdditionally,  Horse  and  Lagesse  admit  to  fleeing  from  the  police  when \nofficers attempted to stop the movement of the group. Id. ¶¶ 50, 59–60. Under \nSupreme Court precedent, flight from law enforcement can be treated as suspicious \nbehavior that factors into the probable cause determination. Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at \n587; see also Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124–25 (2000). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 12 of 69\nEven if each of these facts in isolation would not establish probable cause, \nunder the totality of the circumstances it would have appeared to an objectively \nreasonable officer that there was a probability or substantial chance that Horse and \nLagesse were rioting—sufficient to meet the probable cause threshold the Supreme \nCourt has characterized as “not a high bar.” Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 586.  \nFinally, Horse and Lagesse were indicted by a grand jury following their \narrests. See United States v. Lagesse, 2017 CF2 1355 (D.C. Sup. Ct);1 United States \nv. Horse, 2017 CF2 1219 (D.C. Sup. Ct). “In evaluating the presence or lack of \nprobable cause, the court may consider  a grand jury indictment as prima facie \nevidence of probable cause.” Moore v. Hartman, 102 F. Supp. 3d 35, 115 (D.D.C. \n2015) (citing Moore v. Hartman, 571 F.3d 62, 63, 67, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Moore IV)). \n“[T]he  plaintiff  may  rebut  the  presumption  in  this  case  by  showing  ‘that  the \nindictment was produced by fraud, corruption, perjury, fabricated evidence, or other \nwrongful conduct undertaken in bad faith.’” Id. (citing Moore IV, 571 F.3d at 69). \nThe  Amended  Complaint  makes  no  allegations  questioning  the  grand  jury \nproceedings.  \n \n                                                 \n1   Lagesse is still being prosecuted; her trial is scheduled for July 23, 2018. If \nthis Court does not dismiss the claims related to Lagesse’s arrest, “it is within the \npower of the district court, and in accord with common practice, to stay the civil \naction until the criminal case or the likelihood of a criminal case is ended. If the \nplaintiff is ultimately convicted, and if the stayed civil suit would  impugn that \nconviction, Heck will  require  dismissal;  otherwise,  the  civil  action  will  proceed, \nabsent some other bar to suit.” Wallace v. Kato, 548 U.S. 384, 393–94 (2007) (citing \nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487–88 n.8 (1994)) (internal citations omitted). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 13 of 69\nB.   Defendants  Are  Entitled  to  Qualified  Immunity  On  Horse’s  and \nLagesse’s Fourth Amendment Unlawful Arrest Claims. \n \n1.    To  Hold  Individual  Defendants  Liable  Under  Section  1983, \nPlaintiffs Must Allege Facts Sufficient to Show the Defendant Is \nNot Entitled to Qualified Immunity. \n \nQualified immunity “is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to \nliability,” so entitlement to immunity should be resolved “at the earliest possible \nstage  of  litigation.”  Hunter v. Bryant,  502  U.S.  224,  227  (1991)  (per  curiam) \n(emphasis  in  original).  “At  the  motion  to  dismiss  stage,  a  plaintiff  must  allege \nsufficient  facts  to  establish  that  the  defendants  are  not  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity.” Patterson v. United States, 999 F. Supp. 2d 300, 311 (D.D.C. 2013) \n(emphasis  in  original).  “As  laid  out  by  the  Supreme  Court,  the  two  pertinent \nquestions in determining whether qualified immunity applies are (1) ‘whether a \nconstitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged,’ and (2) ‘whether \nthe right was clearly established at the time of the violation.’” Shaw v. District of \nColumbia, 944 F. Supp. 2d 43, 54 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. \n194, 201 (2001)).  \n“‘Clearly established’ means that at the time of the officer’s conduct, the law \nwas ‘sufficiently clear’ that every ‘reasonable official would understand what he or \nshe is doing’ is unlawful.” Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 589 (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 \nU.S. 731, 741 (2011)). It requires the legal principle to be “settled law,” “which \nmeans it is dictated by ‘controlling authority’ or ‘a robust consensus of cases of \npersuasive authority.’” Id. at 589–90 (quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741–42). It “also \nrequires  that  the  legal  principle  clearly  prohibit  the  officer’s  conduct  in  the \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 14 of 69\nparticular  circumstances  before  him.”  Id.  “This  requires  a  high  ‘degree  of \nspecificity.’” Id. (quoting Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 309 (2015)).  \n“In  order  to  find  a  supervisor  personally  liable  in  damages  for  the \nunconstitutional acts of his subordinate, it must be shown that he was responsible \nfor supervising the wrongdoer; that a duty to instruct the subordinate to prevent \nconstitutional harm arose from the surrounding circumstances; and that, as a result \nof  the  official’s  failure  to  instruct,  the  plaintiff  was  harmed  in  the  manner \nthreatened.” Haynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1262 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (overruled \nin part by Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250 (2006)). “The supervisor[ ] must know \nabout the conduct and facilitate it, approve it, condone it, or turn a blind eye for fear \nof what they may see.” Int’l Action Ctr. v. United States, 365 F.3d 20, 28 (D.C. Cir. \n2004). “In the absence of any such ‘affirmative links,’ the supervisors cannot be \nshown  to  have  the  requisite  ‘direct  responsibility’  or  to  have  given  ‘their \nauthorization  or  approval  to  such  misconduct,’  and  the  effort  to  hold  them \npersonally liable fades into respondeat superior or vicarious liability, clearly barred \nby § 1983.” Id. at 27 (quoting Rizzo, 423 U.S. at 371, 376)) (internal quotations \nomitted).  \n2.  Defendants Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity Because It Was \nNot  Clearly  Established  That  Horse’s  and  Lagesse’s  Arrests \nLacked Probable Cause. \nThis  “clearly  established”  component  of  qualified  immunity  is  “especially \nimportant in the Fourth Amendment context” because “[g]iven its imprecise nature, \nofficers will often find it difficult to know how the general standard of probable \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 15 of 69\ncause  applies  in  ‘the  precise  situation encountered.’” Wesby,  138  S.  Ct.  at  590. \n(quoting Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1866 (2017)). Thus, the Supreme Court \nhas  “stressed  the  need  to  ‘identify  a  case  where  an  officer  under  similar \ncircumstances … was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment.’” Id. (quoting \nWhite v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017) (per curiam)). If there is no case on point, \nexisting  precedent  must  place  the  lawfulness  of  the  particular  arrest  “beyond \ndebate,” except in the “rare ‘obvious case,’ where the lawlessness of the officer’s \nconduct is sufficiently clear even though existing precedent does not address similar \ncircumstances.”  Id.  (citing  Brosseau v, Haugen,  543  U.S.  149,  199  (2004)  (per \ncuriam)). \nBecause  this  is  not  one  of  those  rare  obvious  cases,  plaintiffs  must \ndemonstrate that legal precedent of this Circuit placed it beyond debate that there \nwas no probable cause to arrest them on Inauguration Day. Plaintiffs cannot meet \nthis standard. To the contrary, the case law of this Circuit provides a legal basis for \ndefendants’ reasonable belief that there was probable cause to arrest Horse and \nLagesse. See Carr v. District of Columbia, 587 F.3d 401 (D.C. Cir. 2009). And at \nminimum, Carr demonstrates that it was not “clearly established” that Horse’s and \nLagesse’s arrests were unlawful. \nCarr was brought by five individuals who were arrested on January 20, 2005, \nduring counter-inaugural demonstrations that turned violent. Id. at 403–05. Around \n11:00 p.m. on January 20, 2005, approximately 250 to 300 individuals marched \nwestbound on Columbia Road from its intersection with 16th Street, N.W. Id. at \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 16 of 69\n403.  As  they  marched,  members  of  the  group  committed  the  following  acts  of \nvandalism:  dragged newspaper vending machines into the street; broke windows or \nglass doors of businesses; spray painted buildings and cars; and threw objects at \npolice cars. Id. at 404. Officers “witnessed the group cheering with members raising \ntheir  arms  in  response  to  the  destruction.”  Id.  The  commander  ordered  the \nprotesters to be arrested, but many of them ran away first. Id. Ultimately, 65 to 75 \nwere arrested. Id. \nThe Carr plaintiffs challenged their arrests under the Fourth Amendment. \nId. at  402.  Reversing  the  district  court’s  grant  of  summary  judgment  for  the \nplaintiffs, the D.C. Circuit recognized that under this Circuit’s precedent, “officers \nmay  be  able  to  establish  they  had  probable  cause  to  arrest  an  entire  group  of \nindividuals if the group is observed violating the law even if specific unlawful acts \ncannot be ascribed to specific individuals.” Id. at 406. And although probable cause \nmust be particularized, “that showing is satisfied if the officers have grounds to \nbelieve all arrested persons were part of a unit observed violating the law.” Id. at \n407. Meaning, “[p]olice witnesses must only be able to form a reasonable belief that \nthe entire crowd is acting as a unit and therefore all members of the crowd violated \nthe law.” Id. at 408 (“[I]t is possible that an entirely innocent person would be \nmistaken for a rioter. But it should be borne in mind that the legal issue is probable \ncause, not ultimate conviction. Probable cause only requires a reasonable belief of \nguilt, not a certitude.”). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 17 of 69\nIn light of Carr, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate it was clearly established that \ntheir arrests were unlawful. Like in Carr, plaintiffs allege they were with a large \ngroup, Am. Compl. ¶ 17, that members of the group engaged in acts of vandalism, \nid. ¶ 22, and that they remained with the group at least 15 minutes after the \nvandalism began, as the group continued to travel together through the District, id. \n¶¶ 31, 32, 46, 53. Under the totality of the circumstances and from the perspective \nof a reasonable officer on the scene, it was not clearly established under Carr or any \nother precedent that defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Horse and Lagesse.  \nC.    Plaintiffs Horse and Lagesse Fail to State a Claim for Unlawful Arrest \nin Violation of the Fourth Amendment Against Officers Howden, Rock, \nThau, Washington and Sergeant Alioto Because They Fail to Allege \nThese Defendants Arrested Them.  \n \nHorse’s and  Lagesse’s Fourth  Amendment  unlawful  arrest  claims against \nOfficers  Howden,  Rock,  Thau,  Washington,  and  Sergeant  Alioto  should  also  be \ndismissed because plaintiffs fail to allege adequately that these defendants arrested \nthem. For Officers Howden, Rock, Thau, and Washington, plaintiffs allege:  (1) that \nthese officers “were among the MPD officers who established the blockade” at the \ncorner of 12th and L Streets, N.W., id. ¶ 62, and (2) that they did not take “any \nactions to try to ensure that only individuals whom they had probable cause to \nbelieve had committed crimes would be in the kettle,” id. ¶ 66. The allegations \nagainst Sergeant Alioto are the same, except plaintiffs also allege he “was among \nthe MPD officers who supervised establishment of the blockade.” Id. ¶¶ 62, 66, 63.  \nPlaintiffs  do  not  allege  these  defendants  arrested  them.  And  as  for  the \nallegation that defendants failed to ensure there was probable cause for detaining \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 18 of 69\nevery person in the kettle, there is no such obligation, see Carr, 587 F.3d at 407–08, \nparticularly where the arrest decision was made by these defendants’ supervisors, \nAm. Compl. ¶ 61. Plaintiffs have not stated a Fourth Amendment unlawful arrest \nclaim against Officers Howden, Rock, Thau, Washington, and Sergeant Alioto. \nII.  CLAIM 3:  Horse and Lagesse Fail to State a Claim for False Arrest. \n \nA.  Horse and Lagesse Fail to State a Claim for False Arrest Because They \nWere Arrested Based on Probable Cause. \n \n“In  actions  for  false  arrest  and  false  imprisonment,  the  central  issue  is \nwhether the arresting officer was justified in ordering the arrest of the plaintiff; if \nso, the conduct of the arresting officer is privileged and the action fails.” Scott v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 493 A.2d 319, 321 (D.C. 1985). To prevail on their common law \nfalse  arrest  claim,  plaintiffs  “must  demonstrate  ‘that  the  police  acted  without \nprobable  cause,  in  an  objective  constitutional  sense,  to  effectuate  his  arrest.’” \nBarnhardt v. District of Columbia, 723 F. Supp. 2d 197, 214 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting \nTaylor v. District of Columbia, 691 A.2d 121, 125 (D.C. 1997)). “Constitutional and \ncommon law false arrest claims are generally analyzed as though they comprise a \nsingle cause of action. The elements of both claims are substantially identical.” \nAmobi v. D.C. Dep’t of Corr., 755 F.3d 980, 989 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (internal citations \nomitted).  \nHorse and Lagesse bring a common law false arrest claim against the same \ndefendants as their Fourth Amendment claim for arrest without probable cause. \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 213–15. For the reasons explained above in Section I, plaintiffs fail \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 19 of 69\nto allege their arrests lacked probable cause. Thus, their common law false arrest \nclaim should be dismissed against all defendants.  \nB.  Horse  and  Lagesse  Fail  to  State  a  Claim  for  False  Arrest  Against \nOfficers Howden, Rock, Thau, Washington, Bogardus, Hinostroza, and \nSergeant Alioto Because Defendants Acted In Good Faith Based on \nReasonably Trustworthy Information. \n \nFor the defendants who were ordered to arrest plaintiffs—Officers Howden, \nRock, Thau, Washington, Bogardus, Hinostroza and Sergeant Alioto, id. ¶ 61—there \nis an additional basis for defendants’ dismissal from plaintiffs’ common law false \narrest  claim.  “’[T]he  law  of  this  jurisdiction  …  also  allows  a  lesser,  partially \nsubjective test to support a police officer’s defense to a false arrest claim. Under the \n‘partially subjective test it,’ ‘it will suffice if the officer can demonstrate that (1) he \nor she believed, in good faith, that his [or her] conduct was lawful, and (2) this belief \nwas  reasonable.’” Scales v. District of Columbia,  973  A.2d  722,729  (D.C.  2009) \n(quoting District of Columbia v. Murphy, 635 A.2d 929, 932 (D.C. 1993)). The officer \nmay  form  his  or  her  “good  faith”  belief  based  on  “reasonably  trustworthy \ninformation.” Funchess v. United States, 677 A.2d 1019, 1020–21 (D.C. 1996). \nUnder the facts plaintiffs allege, Officers Howden, Rock, Thau, Washington, \nBogardus,  Hinostroza,  and  Sergeant  Alioto  relied  on  the  probable  cause \ndeterminations made by superiors. Am. Compl. ¶ 61. Plaintiffs do not make any \nfactual allegations that would support a finding that these officers lacked good faith \nin their reliance on the probable cause determination of their superiors, or that the \ndetermination  was  not  reasonably  trustworthy  information  under  the \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 20 of 69\ncircumstances. As a result, the partially subjective test warrants the dismissal of \nClaim 3 against these defendants.  \nIII.  CLAIM 2:  Horse’s and Lagesse’s Claims Alleging Arrest for Protected Speech \nin Violation of the First Amendment Should be Dismissed. \n \nA.  Plaintiffs  Fail  to  State  A  Claim  For  Violation  of  Their  First \nAmendment  Rights  Because  They  Do  Not  Allege  a  Causal  Link \nBetween Their Arrests and Exercise of Their First Amendment Rights. \n \nHorse  and  Lagesse  allege  they  were  arrested  for  engaging  in  protected \nspeech, in violation of the First Amendment. Id. ¶¶ 210–12. As defendants, they \nname the District and the same ten individuals in Horse’s and Lagesse’s Fourth \nAmendment unlawful arrest claim (Claim 1) and false arrest claim (Claim 3). To \nestablish a First Amendment retaliation violation, plaintiffs must allege “(1) that \n[they] engaged in protected conduct, (2) that the government ‘took some retaliatory \naction, sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness in plaintiff[s’] position from \nspeaking again, and (3) that there exists ‘a causal link between the exercise of a \nconstitutional right and the adverse action taken against [them].’” Daugherty v. \nSheer, 248 F. Supp. 3d 272, 283 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting Doe v. District of Columbia, \n796 F.3d 96, 106 (D.C. Cir. 2015)). Horse and Lagesse fail to state a claim for First \nAmendment  retaliation  because  they  do  not  allege  a  causal  link  between  the \nexercise of their First Amendment rights and their arrests. \nFirst, at the time of the arrests, the demonstration was no longer protected \nspeech  under  the  First  Amendment.  Although  Horse  and  Lagesse  allege  they \nengaged  in  protected  speech  activity  when  they  joined  a  group  of  “hundreds” \nwalking from Logan Circle towards the National Mall, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19, 53, \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 21 of 69\nthey admit that the demonstration did not remain peaceful. Id. ¶ 21. In fact, by the \ntime Lagesse arrived, members of the group had been engaging in vandalism for at \nleast fifteen minutes. See id. ¶¶ 32, 53. As a result, when plaintiffs were arrested, \nthe  demonstration  had  already  turned  violent  and  had  lost  its  protection  as \nexpression under the First Amendment. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. \n104,  116  (1972) (“Of  course,  where  demonstrations  turn violent,  they  lose  their \nprotected quality as expression under the First Amendment.”). \n Second, plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege they were arrested because of \ntheir  speech  rather  than  because  of  the  vandalism.  Plaintiffs  each  have  one \nconclusory  statement  alleging  the  causation  between  their  arrests  and  First \nAmendment  activity:    Horse  alleges  he  was  arrested  “merely  because  he  was \nexercising  his  First  Amendment  right  to  document  the  demonstrations  as  a \nphotojournalist,” Am. Compl. ¶ 72; and Lagesse alleges she was arrested “merely \nbecause  she  wished  to  exercise  her  First  Amendment  right  to  demonstrate \npeacefully in opposition to the Inauguration,” id. ¶ 74. These allegations do not \nsatisfy the pleading standards of Rule 12(b)(6), because they are legal conclusions \nand naked assertions, devoid of “further factual enhancement.” See Iqbal, 556 U.S. \nat  678.  Plaintiffs have  not  sufficiently  alleged  a  factual basis  to  find  causation \nbetween their First Amendment protected expression and their arrests; in contrast, \nthey have presented facts that provide an alternative explanation for their arrests—\nthe unlawful activity of the group, see Am Compl. ¶ 21. Their First Amendment \nretaliation claims should be dismissed. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 22 of 69\nB.  Defendants Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity Because There Was No \nClearly Established Right for Plaintiffs to be Free From Arrest When \nThere Was Probable Cause to Arrest Them. \n \nThere is a “First Amendment right not to be arrested in retaliation for one’s \nspeech where there is otherwise no probable cause for the arrest.” Patterson v. \nUnited States, 999 F. Supp. 2d 300, 310 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing Dellums v. Powell, 566 \nF.2d 167, 195–96 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). However, there is no clearly established right to \nbe free from a retaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable cause. \nReichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, 2094 (2012) (“Here, the right in question is not \nthe general right to be free from retaliation for one’s speech, but the more specific \nright to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable \ncause. This Court has never held that there is such a right.”); Dukore, 799 F.3d at \n1145  (finding  no  clearly  established  right  to  be  free  from  First  Amendment \nretaliatory arrest where there is probable cause); Ronkin v. Vihn, 71 F. Supp. 3d \n124, 137 (D.D.C. 2014) (same). In other words, even if plaintiffs had sufficiently pled \nthat they were arrested because they were engaged in protected speech, as long as \ntheir arrests were also supported by probable cause, defendants are entitled to \nqualified immunity.  \nAs  a  result,  Horse’s  and  Lagesse’s  First  Amendment  retaliation  claims \ndepend—like  plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  unlawful  arrest  claim—on  whether \nunder the totality of the circumstances a reasonable officer in their position would \nhave believed there was probable cause to arrest Horse and Lagesse. As explained \nabove in Section I:  (1) there was probable cause to arrest Horse and Lagesse; and \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 23 of 69\n(2) under the totality of the circumstances it was not clearly established that that \nthe officers lacked probable cause to execute the arrests. Defendants are entitled to \nqualified immunity.  \nIV.  CLAIM 6:  Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment Excessive Force Claims Regarding \nthe Use of Pepper Spray Should be Dismissed. \n \nA.  Gwen Frisbie-Fulton, A.S., and Judah Ariel Fail to State a Claim for \nViolation of Their Fourth Amendment Rights Because They Were Not \nSeized. \n \n“The Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures \nalso ‘encompasses the right to be free from the use of excessive force during an \narrest, investigatory stop, or any other seizure.’” Robinson v. District of Columbia, \n130 F. Supp. 3d 180, 193 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Armbruster v. Frost, 962 F. Supp. \n2d 105, 111 (D.D.C. 2013)). “An excessive-force claim shares with an unreasonable-\nseizure claim the requirement that a Fourth Amendment seizure occurred.” Id.  \nA  seizure  requires  significant,  intentional  governmental  termination  of \nfreedom  of  movement.  Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis,  523  U.S.  833,  844  (1998) \n(stating that a seizure “does not occur whenever there is a governmentally caused \ntermination of an individual’s freedom of movement (the innocent passerby), nor \neven  when  there  is  a  governmentally  caused  and  governmentally  desired \ntermination of an individual’s freedom of movement (the fleeing felon), but only \nwhen there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means \nintentionally applied.”) (emphasis in original). Frisbie-Fulton, A.S., and Ariel were \nnot seized. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 24 of 69\nFrisbie-Fulton alleges her Fourth Amendment rights were violated because \nshe “inhaled” residual pepper spray that was in the air at the scene of the arrests. \nAm. Compl. ¶ 139–40. She does not allege she was seized; neither does A.S. Instead, \nhe  alleges  his  Fourth  Amendment  rights  were  violated  because  pepper  spray \n“landed” on his hat. Id. ¶ 142. Finally, Ariel alleges that he was across the street \nfrom the kettle when he was pepper sprayed. Id. ¶ 120. He does not allege he was \never seized or even that his freedom of movement was restricted. \nBecause Frisbie-Fulton, A.S., and Ariel fail to state a claim under the Fourth \nAmendment, Claim 6 should also be dismissed against Whiteside, Hill, Baldwin, \nFlash,  Steffes,  Rocatto,  Baskerville,  Brooks,  Vongkeo,  Dennis,  Parker,  and \nWilliams, because Frisbie-Fulton, A.S., and Ariel are the only plaintiffs who allege \nthese defendants pepper sprayed them; Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez do not allege \nthey were sprayed by these 12 defendants. See id. ¶¶ 47, 80. \nB.  Horse Fails to State a Fourth Amendment Violation Against Officer \nMurphy Because He Was Not Seized By Officer Murphy. \n \nHorse’s claim against Officer Murphy should be dismissed because Horse also \ndoes  not  allege  he  was  being  seized  when  Officer  Murphy  allegedly  used  force \nagainst him. See Robinson, 130 F. Supp. 3d at 180 (noting a plaintiff must allege a \nseizure to state a claim for excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment). \nHorse alleges Officer Murphy’s use of force against him before he was seized and \nbefore MPD officers attempted to seize him. See Am. Compl. ¶ 47. Consistent with \nthis understanding of Horse’s alleged timeline of events, Horse never alleges Officer \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 25 of 69\nMurphy’s use of force was related to his seizure. See id. ¶ 46–48. Horse has not \nstated a Fourth Amendment violation against Officer Murphy. \nC.  Horse’s, Lagesse’s, and Gonzalez’s Claims Against Officers Washington \nRock,  and  Thau  Should  Be  Dismissed  Because  They  Fail  To \nSufficiently Allege Defendants’ Use of Force Was Unreasonable. \n \nHorse, Lagesse, Gonzalez have not stated a Fourth Amendment excessive \nforce claim against Officers Washington, Rock, and Thau because they do not allege \ndefendants’ use of force was unreasonable under the circumstances. For a Fourth \nAmendment claim in the excessive-force context, the plaintiff must prove the force \nused to carry out the seizure was objectively unreasonable. Robinson, 130 F. Supp. \n3d at 193; Dormu v. District of Columbia, 795 F. Supp. 2d 7, 22 (D.D.C. 2011). \nHowever, “the test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of \nprecise definition or mechanical application.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 \n(1989).  As  a  result,  reasonableness  depends  on  the  totality  of  the  particular \nsituation, including the severity of the crime, whether the plaintiff was actively \nresisting or attempting to evade arrest, whether the plaintiff posed an immediate \nthreat to the officers’ or others’ safety, and the severity of the plaintiff’s injury. Id.  \nThis reasonableness assessment must be “judged from the perspective of a \nreasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Id. \nUnder that standard, “an officer has the authority to use ‘some degree of physical \ncoercion or threat thereof’ during the course of the arrest, and ‘not every push or \nshove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of the judge’s chambers,’ \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 26 of 69\nviolates the Fourth Amendment.” Rogala v. District of Columbia, 161 F.3d 44, 55 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 395–97)). \nPlaintiffs allege Officers Washington, Rock, and Thau violated their Fourth \nAmendment rights by deploying pepper spray into the kettle. Am. Compl. ¶ 80. But \nthey fail to sufficiently allege this use of force was unreasonable under the totality \nof  the  circumstances.  First,  plaintiffs  admit  that  individuals  in  the  kettle  had \ncommitted  criminal  acts.  Id.  ¶  22.  Second,  they  admit  members  of  the  group \nattempted  to  flee,  meaning  at  least  some  members  of  the  group  were  not \ncooperative. Id. ¶ 64. Third, plaintiffs allege that they do not know who the target of \nthe use of force was—they do not allege that they were personally the targets. Id. ¶ \n82. Under these facts, plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege the use of force by Officers \nWashington, Rock, and Thau—against unknown targets—was unreasonable.  \nAdditionally, the occurrence of a constitutional violation is just the first step \nto allege a claim against individual defendants—qualified immunity confers upon \nofficers an extra layer of protection from § 1983 liability. “[E]ven if the degree of \nforce  used  might,  objectively  speaking,  exceed  that  allowed  by  the  Fourth \nAmendment,  immunity  should  be  granted  where  the  officer  was  reasonably \nmistaken (in light of the then-existing state of the law) about ‘whether a particular \namount of force [was] legal’ under the circumstances.” Qutb v. Ramsey, 285 F. Supp. \n2d  33,  48  (D.D.C.  2003)  (quoting  Saucier,  533  U.S.  at  205).  Even  if  Officers \nWashington, Rock, and Thau were mistaken regarding the necessity of the force, \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 27 of 69\nunder the totality of the chaotic and violent circumstances, defendants should be \nafforded qualified immunity. \nV.  CLAIM 7:  Plaintiffs’ Assault and Battery Clams Should Be Dismissed. \n \nA.  A.S.  and  Frisbie-Fulton  Do  Not  Allege  Assault  or  Battery  Because \nThey Fail to Allege an Intentional Act by Defendants.  \n \nAn individual injured by a District police officer may recover for assault by \nproving “‘intentional and unlawful attempt or threat, either by words or acts, to do \nphysical harm to the plaintiff,’ and for battery by proving ‘an intentional act that \ncauses harmful or offensive bodily contact.’” District of Columbia v. Chinn, 839 A.2d \n701, 705 (D.C. 2003) (quoting Holder v. District of Columbia, 700 A.2d 738, 741 \n(D.C. 1997)).  \nFrisbie-Fulton’s and A.S.’s assault and battery claims should be dismissed \nbecause they fail to allege defendants intentionally attempted to do them physical \nharm, threatened to do them physical harm, or intentionally caused them physical \nharm. Frisbie-Fulton does not allege she was intentionally targeted by any pepper \nspray or that she was pepper sprayed at all. See Am. Compl. ¶ 140. She alleges \nmerely  that  she  inhaled  residual  pepper  spray  from  the  air.  Id.  ¶  140.  A.S.’s \nallegations are even more tenuous—he alleges that pepper spray “landed” on his \nhat. Id. ¶142. Plaintiffs’ claims also fail because they do not allege offensive bodily \ncontact. Neither plaintiff has stated a claim for assault or battery.  \n \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 28 of 69\nB.  Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez Have Not Stated an Assault or Battery \nClaim  against  Defendants  Newsham,  Alder,  Greene,  Deville, \nWhiteside, Hill, Washington, Rock, and Thau Because They Fail to \nAllege Defendants Committed an Intentional Act Against Them. \n \nHorse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez also allege that they do not know if they were \nthe  targets  of  the  intentional  acts  they  allege  were  committed  by  Officers \nWashington, Rock, and Thau. Am. Compl. ¶ 82. Because they do not allege Officers \nWashington, Rock, or Thau intentionally threatened them or intentionally caused \nthem physical harm, plaintiffs’ claims against Washington, Rock, and Thau should \nbe dismissed. See Chinn, 839 A.2d at 705 (assault and battery are intentional torts). \nSimilarly, they allege only that Chief Newsham, Assistant Chiefs Alder and \nGreene, Commander Deville, Lieutenant Whiteside, and Sergeant Hill authorized \nofficers to use pepper spray and stingballs. See Am. Compl. ¶ 227. Plaintiffs do not \nallege personal involvement of defendants. See Smith v. D.C., 149 F. Supp. 3d 128, \n135 (D.D.C. 2015); King v. Kidd, 640 A.2d 656, 666 (D.C. 1993). \nC.  Defendants  Washington,  Rock,  Thau,  Murphy,  Whiteside,  Hill, \nBaldwin,  Flash,  Steffes,  Roccato,  Baskerville,  Brooks,  Vongkeo, \nDennis, Parker, and Williams are Entitled to Qualified Privilege. \n \nIf the elements of an assault and battery claim are satisfied, the “outcome of \nthe claim turns on the defense of privilege.” Chinn, 839 A.2d at 706. “Under District \nof Columbia law, a police officer is privileged to use force so long as the ‘means \nemployed are not in excess of those which [he] reasonably believes [are] necessary.’” \nDormu, 795 F. Supp. 2d at 27 (quoting Etheredge v. District of Columbia, 635 A.2d \n908, 916 (D.C. 1993)). “Just as qualified immunity is a shield against liability in § \n1983  excessive  force  claims,  qualified  privilege  protects  officers  in  common  law \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 29 of 69\nclaims of assault and battery.” Ingram v. Shipman-Meyer, 241 F. Supp. 3d 124, 148 \n(D.D.C. 2017) (citing Chinn, 839 A.2d at 705–06). “A police officer has a qualified \nprivilege  to  use  reasonable  force  to  effect  an  arrest,  provided  that  the  means \nemployed  are  not  in  excess  of  those  which  the  actor  reasonably  believes  to  be \nnecessary.” Scales, 973 A.2d at 730 . “[T]he test for qualified privilege in an assault \nand  battery  suit  is  both  subjective  and  objective:  the  officer  must  subjectively \nbelieve that he or she used no more force than necessary, but the officer’s judgment \nis compared to that of a hypothetical reasonable police officer placed in the same \nsituation.” Id.  \nUnder the totality of the circumstances alleged, defendants are entitled to \nqualified  privilege.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  defendants  Washington,  Rock,  Thau, \nMurphy,  Whiteside,  Hill,  Baldwin,  Flash,  Steffes,  Roccato,  Baskerville,  Brooks, \nVongkeo, Dennis, Parker, and Williams had all been authorized to use pepper spray \nwhere appropriate, and that the authorization came from superiors who had a more \ncomplete  perspective  of  the  events.

Because  the  qualified  privilege \nreasonableness analysis must  be  made  “with allowance  for  the officer’s need  to \nmake quick decision under potentially dangerous situations,” Dormu, 795 F. Supp. \n2d at 28, it was objectively and subjectively reasonable for defendants to deploy \npepper spray under the circumstances; they are entitled to qualified privilege.   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 30 of 69\nVI.  CLAIM  8:    Plaintiffs’  Assault  and  Battery  Claims  (Claim  7)  and \nNegligence Claims (Claim 8) Are Incompatible; Plaintiffs Cannot Proceed \non Both. \n \n“Intent  and  negligence  are  regarded  as  mutually  exclusive  grounds  of \nliability. As the saying goes, there is no such thing as a negligent battery.” Chinn, \n839 A.2d at 706. “Under District of Columbia law, a plaintiff who simultaneously \nasserts claims for negligence and assault and battery based on excessive force must \nensure that the negligence claim is:  (1) ‘distinctly pled;’ (2) ‘based upon at least one \nfactual  scenario  that  presents  an  aspect  of  negligence  apart  from  the  use  of \nexcessive  force  itself;’  and  (3)  ‘violative  of  a  distinct  standard  of  care.’  These \nrequirements  stem  from  the  different  states  of  mind  each  theory  of  liability \nrequires. Battery and assault are intentional torts. Negligence is not.” Dormu, 795 \nF. Supp. 2d at 30 (quoting Chinn, 839 A.2d at 706, 711)).  \nPlaintiffs have not distinctly pled their claims for negligence and assault and \nbattery because the factual allegations plaintiffs allege to support the claims are the \nsame. As a result, plaintiffs have pled inconsistent theories of liability. In the event \nthe claims survive the motion to dismiss stage, plaintiffs should not be permitted to \nproceed on both theories of liability, as alleged in Claims 7 and 8. \nVII.  CLAIMS 9 AND 10:  A.S. Fails to State a Claim for a Violation of his Fourth \nAmendment Rights or an Assault or Battery. \n \nTen-year old A.S. alleges that he arrived with his mother at 12th and L \nStreet,  N.W.,  where  hundreds  of  individuals  had  been  arrested  for  rioting,  at \napproximately 1:00 p.m. on January 20, 2018. Am. Compl. ¶ 108. They were still \nthere 45 minutes later, when A.S. alleges “[w]ithout warning or provocation, a line \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 31 of 69\nof  police  officers, including  Ofcr.  Joseph  Masci  and  Ofcr.,  Auilo  Angulo,  rushed \nforward” and “Ofcrs. Masci and Angulo collided with A.S., knocking him to the \nground.” Id.  ¶  129.  He  also  alleges  “Lt.  Michael  Whiteside  and  Sgt.  Sean  Hill \nwalked  behind  the  line  of  police  officers  speaking  to  them  moments  before  the \ncharge,”  and  that  “this  conduct,  in  combination  with  the  coordinated  action  by \nmultiple officers, reflects that Defendants Lt. Whiteside and Sgt. Hill ordered the \ncharge into nonviolent protestors.” Id. ¶ 130. Based on these allegations, A.S. claims \na violation of his Fourth Amendment rights (Claim 9) and assault and battery \n(Claim  10).  Both  claims  should  be  dismissed  because  the  facts  alleged  are \ninsufficient to constitute a constitutional violation or an intentional tort. \n  First—as with A.S.’s Fourth Amendment excessive force claim regarding the \npepper spray that “landed” on his hat—A.S. has not stated a claim for a Fourth \nAmendment excessive force violation because he does not allege he was seized. See \nRobinson, 130 F. Supp. 3d at 193; see also Section IV, above. A.S. cannot state a \nclaim to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures when he does not allege he \nwas searched or seized. \n  Second, A.S. also fails to allege any of the defendants intentionally knocked \nhim down or threatened him, caused him actual physical harm, or that defendant \nWhiteside and Hill actually ordered the other defendants to knock him down. He \nalleges merely that the officers “collided” with him; this is insufficient to form the \nbasis for assault or battery. A.S.’s claim should be dismissed against all defendants.  \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 32 of 69\nVIII.  CLAIM  11:    Horse’s  and  Lagesse’s  Allegations  That  Their  Zipties  Were \nExcessively Tight Fail to State a Claim Under the Fourth Amendment. \n \nThere  is  a  clearly  established  right  to  be  free  from  injury-inflicting \nhandcuffing when an individual complains about the tightness of the cuffs. Dormu, \n795 F. Supp. 2d at 24. However, the injury to the plaintiff must be more than de \nminimus. Id. Plaintiffs Horse’s and Lagesse’s claims should be dismissed because \nthey fail to allege more than minor injuries. Both plaintiffs allege minor scarring \nand Horse alleges he experienced numbness in his fingers, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 178, 185; \nthese injuries are de minimus. Compare id. at 22 (plaintiff alleged more than a de \nminimus injury where the injury he sustained from the excessively tight handcuffs \nrequired surgery) with Glenn v. City of Tyler, 242 F.3d 307, 314 (5th Cir. 2001) \n(plaintiff failed to show more than de minimus injury where the excessively tight \nhandcuffs resulted in swelling).  \nIX.  CLAIM  12:    Plaintiffs  Fail  to  Allege  Violations  of  Clearly  Established \nConstitutional Rights Regarding the Conditions of Their Confinement.  \n \nA.  Plaintiffs  Do  Not  Sufficiently  Allege  Newsham,  Alder,  Carroll,  or \nNiepling Deprived Them of Food, Water, or Toilets.  \n \n  Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez allege they went a “prolonged period” without \nfood, water, and toilets and that these deprivations amount to a violation of their \nFifth Amendment due process rights and Fourth Amendment right to be free from \nunreasonable searches and seizures. To support this claim, plaintiffs Horse and \nGonzalez  allege  they  were  without  a  toilet  for  9  to  10  and  10  to  11  hours, \nrespectively, and were both without food or water for 10 to 11 hours while they were \nin the kettle.

Id. ¶¶ 158–59. Plaintiffs name Newsham, \nAlder, Carroll and Niepling as defendants. Id. ¶ 242–43.   \nBut plaintiffs’ factual allegations against each defendant are insufficient to \nallege that the defendant violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. The basis for \nplaintiffs’  claim  against  Chief  Newsham  is  that  he  authorized  the  kettle  and \nsupervised  the  officers who  maintained  the kettle  from  the  command  center  at \nMPD. Id. ¶ 87. They do not allege he was present at the kettle or that he was even \naware  that  plaintiffs were without  food,  water, and  toilets. See id.  ¶  88.  Chief \nNewsham’s position of authority and remote supervision of officers who maintained \nthe  kettle  is  an  insufficient  basis  to  find  him  liable,  personally  or  through \nsupervisory liability. See Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 376 (1976). \nFor  defendants Alder,  Carroll,  and  Niepling,  plaintiffs allege  merely  that \nthey “failed to provide them with food, water, or access to a toilet.” Am. Compl. ¶ 88. \nBut plaintiffs do not allege that Alder, Carroll, and Niepling were at the kettle \nduring the entire duration or knew that plaintiffs were without food, water, and \ntoilets for the full duration. Id. ¶ 88. Additionally, although plaintiffs Lagesse and \nGonzalez allege they requested food, water, or bathrooms, they do not allege that \nthey made this request to any of the defendants, or that any of the defendants were \naware  of  their  requests. Id.  ¶  89.  Based  on  their  allegations  in  the  Amended \nComplaint, these defendants cannot be responsible for the alleged constitutional \nviolation of plaintiffs’ rights.

Plaintiffs  Do  Not  Allege  a  Violation  of  a  Clearly  Established  Fifth \nAmendment Right. \n \nPlaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged a constitutional violation under the \nFifth  Amendment.  “[P]retrial detainees  have  an  independent due-process right \nunder  the Fifth and Fourteenth  Amendments to  humane  conditions  while \nincarcerated.” Estate of Gaither v. District of Columbia, 655 F. Supp. 2d 69, 86 \n(D.D.C. 2009). A detainee’s due-process rights are violated if the conditions of the \npretrial confinement amount to punishment of the detainee. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \nU.S.  520,  535  (1979)  (citing Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,  372  U.S.  144,  168 \n(1963)). The factors in Mendoza-Martinez provide “useful guideposts in determine \nwhether  particular  restrictions  and  conditions  accompanying  pretrial  detention \namount to punishment in the constitutional sense of the word.” Id. at 538. They are: \nWhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, \nwhether it has historically been regarded as punishment, whether it \ncomes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will \npromote  the  traditional  aims  of  punishment-retribution  and \ndeterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, \nwhether  an  alternative  purpose  to  which  it  may  rationally  be \nconnected  is  assignable  for  it,  and  whether  it  appears  excessive  in \nrelation  to  the alternative  purpose  assigned  are  all  relevant  to  the \ninquiry and may often point in differing directions. \n \nMendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168–69. “A court must decide whether the disability \nis imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some \nother legitimate governmental purpose.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 538. \nPlaintiffs do not allege that Newsham, Alder, Carroll or Niepling imposed \npretrial  conditions  akin  to  punishment,  and  have  not  alleged  facts  to  find  the \nconditions  of  their  confinement  amounted  to  punishment  under  the  Mendoza-\n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 35 of 69\nMartinez guideposts. First, plaintiffs do not allege that defendants intentionally \ndeprived them of food, water, or toilets; instead they allege defendants “failed to \nprovide them” with food, water, and toilets. Am. Compl. ¶ 88. Second, there is a \nclearly a non-penal explanation for the deprivations. Plaintiffs were detained on a \npublic street, not in a location with bathrooms or where the police would have ready \naccess to food and water. Id. ¶ 75. Plaintiffs also admit that there were nearly 200 \nindividuals in the kettle, which is a significant number of individuals for the officers \nto manage. Id. ¶ 76. Complicating the situation further, it was Inauguration Day, \nwhen  there  were  road  closures  and  thousands  of  pedestrians.  Under  these \ncircumstances  and  applying  plaintiffs’  allegations  to  the  guideposts  outlined  in \nMendoza-Martinez,  plaintiffs  have  not  alleged  a  deprivation  that  amounts  to \npunishment or rises to the level of a due process violation.  \n  Further,  it  was  not  clearly  established  that  under  these  circumstances, \nNewsham, Alder, Carroll, and Niepling would violate plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment \nrights if they did not ensure plaintiffs received food, water, or bathrooms more \npromptly. See Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 589. There is no precedent in this jurisdiction \nthat holds that due process requires arrestees to receive food, water, or access to \ntoilets within a certain amount of time. There also are no similar cases in this \njurisdiction which would establish the boundaries of a Fifth Amendment violation \nin this context; the right was not clearly established. \nOther jurisdictions have found that comparable allegations do not reach the \nthreshold of a due process deprivation. See, e.g., Williams v. Dellorco, No. 05-4129, \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 36 of 69\n2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85721, at *33 (D.N.J. Nov. 20, 2007) (“Even accepting, as \nPlaintiffs allege, that Defendants withheld food as a means of ‘playing hardball’ \nwith them for declining to make statements to police, ten hours without food does \nnot  meet  the  threshold  of  constitutional  concern.  Effectively,  Plaintiffs  missed \nbreakfast  on  one  occasion,  which  does  not  amount  to  a  deprivation  under  the \nFourteenth Amendment.”); Dzwonczyk v. Syracuse City Police Dep’t, 710 F. Supp. \n2d 248 (N.D.N.Y. 2008) (dismissing plaintiff’s constitutional claim where plaintiff \nwas  incarcerated  at  5:35  p.m.  and  not  given  food  or  drink  until  the  following \nmorning); Villari v. Township of Wall, No. 06-0004, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS (D. N.J. \nSept. 15, 2009) (finding nine hours without food while plaintiff was in custody was \ninsufficient to amount to a constitutional deprivation). But there are no clearly \nestablished rules for when deprivations of food, water, and toilets constitute a due \nprocess violation. Because plaintiffs do not allege a violation of a clearly established \nright, defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \nC.  Plaintiffs Do Not Allege a Violation of a Clearly Established Fourth \nAmendment Right. \n \nPlaintiffs also have not stated a violation of an established right under the \nFourth Amendment. Although some jurisdictions have held the Fourth Amendment \ngoverns  conditions  of  confinement  when  an  individual  is  post-arrest  but  pre-\nprobable cause hearing, this jurisdiction has not. See, e.g., Lopez v. City of Chicago, \n464 F.3d 711, 718 (7th Cir. 2006); Chambers v. Pennycook, 641 F.3d 898, 905 (8th \nCir.  2011).  Instead,  in  a  case  involving  a  plaintiff’s  condition  of  detention \nimmediately post-arrest while he was in an MPD holding cell, this Court applied \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 37 of 69\nthe Fifth Amendment due process standard. See Robinson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 03-1455, 2005 WL 491467, at *3 (D.D.C. March 2, 2005). Plaintiffs cannot allege \na violation of a clearly established right under the Fourth Amendment where there \nis no guidance in this jurisdiction establishing the right. \nX.   Plaintiffs Fail To Plead A Plausible Basis For Municipal Liability Under § \n1983. \n \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  the  District  is  responsible  for  the  alleged \nconstitutional violations in Claims 1 (“arrest without probable cause”), 2 (“arrest for \nprotected  speech”),  6  (“excessive  force”  with  “chemical  irritants”),  and  12 \n(“conditions of pre-trial confinement”), but they have not pled sufficient facts to \nsupport municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Municipal liability cannot be \npredicated on a respondeat superior theory. Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of New \nYork, 436 U.S. 658, 690–91 (1978). Rather, “[p]laintiffs who seek to impose liability \non local governments under § 1983 must prove that ‘action pursuant to official \nmunicipal policy’ caused their injury.” Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 60 (2011) \n(quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 691). \nThe  Circuit  has  identified  four  ways  official  municipal  policy  can  be \ndemonstrated:    (1)  express  municipal  policy;  (2)  actions  of  a  final  municipal \n“policymaker”; (3) persistent conduct by non-policymakers (i.e. “custom” with force \nof law); and (4) “deliberate indifference” to a risk of constitutional injury. See Baker \nv. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306–07 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). \nEach theory has its own “elements,” which a § 1983 plaintiff bears the burden of \npleading in accordance with Iqbal. Blue v. District of Columbia, 811 F.3d 14, 20 \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 38 of 69\n(D.C.  Cir.  2015).  Additionally,  under  any  theory,  a  municipal  liability  claim \nseparately requires proof of causation—specifically, an “affirmative link” between \nthe alleged municipal policy and the alleged constitutional violation, “such that [the \nformer] was the moving force behind the [latter].” Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306.  \nPlaintiffs do not articulate the “type of municipal policy at issue” in any of the \nfour claims for which they seek to hold the District liable under § 1983. Cf. Blue, \n811 F.3d at 20 (“If the plaintiff fails to identify the type of municipal policy at issue, \nthe  court  would  be  unable  to  determine  …  whether  the  plaintiff  had  provided \nplausible support for her  claim. Although the court could try to surmise which \ntheory of municipal liability has the strongest support in the complaint, this is not \nour  role.”).  Rather,  Claims  1,  2,  6,  and  12  each  contain  the  same  formulaic \nstatement of the District’s alleged fault:  “Defendant District of Columbia is liable to \nPlaintiffs … pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for this violation of [plaintiffs’] rights, \nbecause the violation was caused by a policy, practice, or custom of the District of \nColumbia.”  Am.  Compl.  ¶¶  209,  212,  225,  244.  To  substantiate  this  conclusory \nassertion,  plaintiffs  include  nine  individually-numbered  paragraphs  under  the \nheading, “The District’s Responsibility for Plaintiffs’ Injuries.” Id. at ¶¶ 197–205. \nThese allegations do not state a valid claim for municipal liability under any of the \nCircuit’s theories for demonstrating a municipal policy.  \nA.  Plaintiffs Fail to Allege an Express Municipal Policy. \nPlaintiffs never state or even imply that the District had any express policy \nthat facilitated the allegedly unlawful conduct at issue in Claims 1, 2, 6, and 12. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 39 of 69\nNor could they:  the District’s written municipal policy governing police conduct \nrelating to First Amendment assemblies is set forth in D.C. Code § 5-331.01, et seq., \nand specifically provides for “reasonable” policing of peaceful demonstrations on \npublic space, id. §§ 5-331.03, 5-331.04(a), 5-331.07, explicitly prohibiting restrictions \nbased on viewpoint discrimination, id. § 5-331.04(c), and instructing on the use of \nchemical irritants, id. § 5-331.16. In fact, plaintiffs’ attempted reliance on these \nprovisions to establish the District’s duty of care in handling First Amendment \nassemblies (i.e., as an element of negligence per se) effectively concedes that “[their] \ntrue grievance is not with a policy or custom of the District, but rather with [ ] \nspecific [individual] decision[s].” Coppet v. District of Columbia, 75 F. Supp. 3d 144, \n148 (D.D.C. 2014) (Berman Jackson, J.) (plaintiff’s statement that municipal policy \nwas  “fair  [o]n  paper”  undermined  Monell  claim  absent  allegation  that  a  final \npolicymaker’s decision caused alleged departure from policy). \nB.   Plaintiffs Fail to Allege a Custom. \nPlaintiffs fail to plead sufficient facts to show municipal liability based on \n“custom.” To establish municipal policy arising from custom, a § 1983 plaintiff bears \nthe burden of putting forth “evidence that the municipality’s employees engaged in \na persistent or regular pattern of conduct that gave rise to the alleged constitutional \nviolations.” Egudu v. District of Columbia, 72 F. Supp. 3d 34, 41 (D.D.C. 2014) \n(Berman Jackson, J.) (citing Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. \nCir.  2004)).  Here,  plaintiffs  contend  that  “[t]he  coordinated  MPD  response  [on \nJanuary 20, 2017, was] part of a custom of … responding with overwhelming and \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 40 of 69\nunlawful  force  to  non-violent  demonstrators  at  largely  peaceful  demonstrations \nwhere some law-breaking occurs.” Am. Compl. ¶ 202. Plaintiffs allege four events \nthat involved MPD’s response to large-scale protests—the latest of which occurred \nin  January  2005—prove  a  broad  custom  of  constitutional  violations  in  January \n2017. Id. at ¶ 202. Plaintiffs’ assertion fails for three main reasons. \nFirst, it is well-settled that the “persistent” and “pervasive” pattern necessary \nto  show  municipal  custom  cannot  be  inferred  from  events  with  no  temporal \nproximity to the conduct allegedly giving rise to a § 1983 plaintiff’s constitutional \ninjury. For example, in Page v. Mancuso, 999 F. Supp. 2d 269, 285 (D.D.C. 2013), \nthe court rejected as evidence of a pattern rising to the level of municipal policy the \nplaintiff’s reference to “[two] cases from this district [that] previously recognized … \na [District] policy of authorizing [the same type of conduct allegedly causing the \nplaintiff’s  injury].”  As  grounds,  the  court  in Page noted  that  the  “policy  being \naddressed [in the earlier cases] was one that existed at least seven years prior,” and \nthe  plaintiff  supplied  no  facts  suggesting  “the  District  persisted  in  its \nunconstitutional actions.” Id. at 285-86. This Court reached substantially the same \nresult in Egudu v. District of Columbia, 72 F. Supp. 3d 34 (D.D.C. 2014), declining \nto credit as evidence of municipal custom a report, a compilation of statistics, and a \ndistrict court opinion that predated the plaintiff’s alleged injury by six, nine, and \nfour years, respectively. Id. at 43. The same rationale is dispositive of plaintiffs’ \nmunicipal custom claim:   events occurring between twelve and seventeen years \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 41 of 69\nprior to the incident that resulted in plaintiffs’ alleged constitutional injuries are \nsimply too far removed to plausibly infer an underlying municipal custom. \nSecond,  to  prove  the  existence  of  municipal  custom,  a  §  1983  plaintiff  is \nrequired to identify past events involving government actions that are prima facie \nidentical to the alleged wrongdoing underlying her claim. Egudu, 72 F. Supp. 3d at \n41  (report  “analyz[ing]  data  related  to  disorderly  conduct  arrests  [but]  tailored \ntoward exposing racial disparities” could not show policy or custom of “violat[ing] an \nindividual’s free speech right or the right to be free from an unlawful seizure”); \nHunter v. District of Columbia, 824 F. Supp. 2d 125, 133-34 (D.D.C. 2011) (report \ncould  not  evidence  municipal  custom  where  “plaintiff  was  not  arrested  for  the \noffense examined in the report”). Plaintiffs, however, describe MPD’s “response” to \ndemonstrations in 2000, 2002, and 2005 using only legal conclusions (“excessive \nforce,”  “unconstitutional”  detention),  buttressed  by  generic  and  over-generalized \nassertions  of  presumptively  unlawful  police  activity  (“pepper-spraying  of  law-\nabiding demonstrators,” “hogtying of protestors,” “denial of food and water”). Am. \nCompl. ¶ 202. “[W]ithout some further factual enhancement,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678,  there  is  simply  no  way  to  determine  whether  any  of  the  events  to  which \nplaintiffs refer are relevant to their claim of municipal liability based on custom. Cf. \nBlue, 811 F.3d at 20 (requiring § 1983 plaintiff to plead “elements” of municipal \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 42 of 69\nliability with “adequate factual support to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face,’” as required by Iqbal).2 \nFinally, even if plaintiffs had pled sufficient facts to establish the municipal \ncustom they allege in the Amended Complaint—“a custom of … responding with \noverwhelming and unlawful force to non-violent demonstrators at largely peaceful \ndemonstrations where some law-breaking is occurring,” Am. Compl. ¶ 202—they \nwould have only arguably provided a basis for municipal liability as to one of their § \n1983 claims:  Claim 6 (“excessive force” with “chemical irritants”). The remainder—\nClaims 1 (“arrest without probable cause”), 2 (“arrest for protected speech”), and 12 \n(“conditions of pre-trial confinement”)—have nothing to do with an alleged custom \nthat promotes the use of “unlawful force [against] non-violent demonstrators.” As \nexplained, causation is an independent element of a municipal liability claim under \n§ 1983, Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306, which plaintiffs’ municipal “custom” allegations \nfail to plausibly demonstrate for all but their constitutional excessive force claim. \n \n                                                 \n2   Even  if  the  Court  looks  beyond  the  pleadings,  the  2000,  2002,  and  2005 \nevents  plaintiffs  cite  involved  markedly  different  circumstances.  For  example, \nMPD’s response to “counter-inaugural demonstrations in Adams Morgan in January \n2005,” presumably a reference to an incident subsequently challenged as Carr v. \nDistrict of Columbia, involved the arrest of 65 to 75 people for parading without a \npermit. 587 F.3d 401, 404 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Not only were plaintiffs “not arrested for \n[that] offense,” Hunter, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 133, there was also no finding in that \ncase that MPD lacked probable cause to arrest the plaintiffs for rioting, the charge \nplaintiffs Horse and Lagesse seek to challenge here, in Claim 1, Egudu, 72 F. Supp. \nat 43 (“Plaintiff takes no steps to demonstrate how many of [the 5,338 arrests for \ndisorderly conduct in 2009] raised constitutional concern,” and the arrests, “without \nmore,” do “not demonstrate a custom of constitutional violations”). \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 43 of 69\nC.   Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Deliberate Indifference. \nPlaintiffs  also  fail  to  plausibly  demonstrate  municipal  liability  on  a \n“deliberate indifference” theory, and in particular, based on the assertion that the \nallegedly unlawful actions underlying Claims 1, 2, 6, and 12 “were the result of the \nDistrict’s failure to train MPD officers.” Am. Compl. ¶ 203. As the Supreme Court \nhas cautioned, “[a] municipality’s culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most \ntenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.” Connick, 563 U.S. at 61 (citing \nOklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 822–23 (1985)). Only if a failure to train \namounts  to  “‘deliberate  indifference’  to  the  rights  of  [the  municipality’s] \ninhabitants,” such that it can “be properly thought of as a city ‘policy or custom,’” is \nit “actionable under § 1983.” City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989). \nDeliberate indifference in this context is an objective but “stringent standard of \nfault,” Bd. Of Cty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 410 (1997), \nrequiring that city policymakers both:  (1) had “actual or constructive notice that a \nparticular  omission  in  their  training  program  causes  city  employees  to  violate \ncitizens’ constitutional rights,” Connick, 563 U.S. at 61; and (2) made a “deliberate \nchoice” not to act, Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 483 (1986) (“[M]unicipal \nliability  under  §  1983  attaches  where—and  only  where—a  deliberate  choice  to \nfollow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by [the relevant] \nofficials”); accord Harvey v. District of Columbia, 798 F.3d 1042, 1053 (D.C. Cir. \n2015). Here, the Amended Complaint does not establish a plausible basis for either \nelement. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 44 of 69\n1.   Plaintiffs Do Not Allege Notice. \nTo establish the notice element of their deliberate indifference failure-to-train \nclaim, plaintiffs rely upon the same “prior incidents” that underlie their assertion of \na municipal custom, Am. Compl. ¶ 203, which also fail here for similar reasons.3 \nThe notice element of a deliberate indifference municipal liability claim “ordinarily” \nrequires  proof  of  “[a]  pattern  of  similar  constitutional  violations  by  untrained \nemployees.” Connick, 563 U.S. at 61. Whatever evidence is presented by plaintiffs, \n“the need for more or different training [must be] obvious,” and the inadequacy in \nthe training program must be “likely to result in the violation of constitutional \nrights.” City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390. \nAs  in  the  municipal  custom  context,  temporal  proximity  is  crucial  to \nestablishing government notice for deliberate indifference claims. For example, in \nDormu v. District of Columbia,  the  court  refused  to  assume  “that  the  District \ncontinued to be on notice [of a practice of improper conduct] four years [after first \nreceiving notice that the conduct was occurring].” 795 F. Supp. 2d at 26. Likewise, \nin Robinson v. District of Columbia,  the  court  rejected  the  plaintiff’s deliberate \nindifference notice evidence, despite finding that it “reflect[ed] an awareness by the \nDistrict of serious allegations relating to [the conduct at issue],” explaining that “a \nmere awareness of a problem in January 1999 and a need for improvement is not, \nas a matter of law, sufficient to impose municipal liability for an incident that \n                                                 \n3   If plaintiffs are permitted to proceed on their deliberate indifference theory at \nall, the District should still be dismissed from Counts 1, 2, and 12, on the same \ncausation-related grounds discussed above in connection with plaintiffs’ municipal \ncustom claim. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 45 of 69\noccurred in October 2000.” 403 F. Supp. 2d 39, 55 (D.D.C. 2005); accord Moore v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 79 F. Supp. 3d 121, 140 (D.D.C. 2015) (approximately eight-\nyear-old  study  showing  pattern  of  challenged  conduct  “too  remote”  to  support \nplaintiff’s deliberate indifference notice claim); Byrd v. District of Columbia, 297 F. \nSupp. 2d 136, 140 (D.D.C. 2003) (notice of problem in 1999 insufficient to impose \nmunicipal liability for an incident in 2001). As noted above, the latest of plaintiffs’ \nprior incidents occurred in 2005, twelve years before the events underlying Counts \n1, 2, 6, and 12, Am. Compl. ¶ 202, with countless demonstrations occurring on \npublic streets during that time; it is plainly not plausible, without more, that those \nprior events put the District on notice of a risk that plaintiffs were “likely” to suffer \nconstitutional injury absent some further training, City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 \n(notice requires that constitutional injury is “likely to result”).  \nMoreover,  plaintiffs  nowhere  allege  anything  regarding  “particular \nomission[s],” Connick, 563 U.S. at 61, in the District’s training regarding police \nhandling  of  violent  criminal  activity  arising  out  of  demonstrations.  In  fact,  the \nAmended Complaint states nothing about the training (neither subject matter nor \nfrequency) that MPD officers receive; nor does it mention any particular deficiencies \nin any such training program or how it could have been improved. As this Court has \nobserved, a § 1983 plaintiff who “includes no specific details about police training in \nthe District or how it might be deficient,” fails to “supply [necessary] facts from \nwhich a court could draw the inference that the District ignored a known risk [of \nconstitutional injury].” Miango v. Democratic Republic of the Congo, 243 F. Supp. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 46 of 69\n3d 113, 128 (D.D.C. 2017) (Berman Jackson, J.) (citing Bell v.

Plaintiffs’ \ndeliberate  indifference  theory  of  municipal  liability  fails  for  precisely  the  same \nreason:  “Since  the  [C]omplaint  contains  no  factual  allegations  detailing  any \ndeficiencies in MPD training on how officers should respond to violence committed \n[at public demonstrations], plaintiffs’ § 1983 allegations amount to nothing more \nthan simpl[e] formulaic recitation of the elements of a deliberate indifference claim, \nand  dismissal  is  warranted.”  Miango,  243  F.  Supp.  3d  at  128–29  (internal \nquotations omitted) (citing Martin v. District of Columbia, 720 F. Supp. 2d 19, 23–\n24 (D.D.C. 2010)). \n2.   Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Deliberate Indifference. \nEven if plaintiffs could establish notice, other evidence reasonably inferred \nfrom  plaintiffs’  pleadings undermines  their  contention that  the  District  made a \n“deliberate choice” not to act, Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483, in response to the 2000, \n2002, and 2005 incidents featured in the Amended Complaint, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 202–\n203. Most notably, plaintiffs make numerous references to the First Amendment \nAssemblies Act (FAAA). That legislation, which explicitly requires, among other \nthings, “regular and periodic training” for MPD personnel “on the handling of, and \nresponse to, First Amendment assemblies,” was passed by the Council after, and as \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 47 of 69\nthe legislative history confirms, D.C. Comm. Rep., B. 15-968 (2004), in response to, \nthe incidents cited by plaintiffs. D.C. Code § 5-331.15. It is simply not plausible to \nconclude  that  the  District  remained  deliberately  indifferent  to  the  risk  of \nconstitutional  violations  at  First  Amendment  assemblies,  having  passed \ncomprehensive  legislation  to  reform  municipal  policy  relating  to  that  subject \nmatter.  Plaintiffs  do  not  challenge  that  legislation,  or  the  training  program  it \nrequired,  as  inadequate,  further  evidencing  that  the  District  responded \nappropriately, not with deliberate indifference. Egudu, 72 F. Supp. at 45 (finding \nDistrict’s change in training and procedures following events serving as notice of \npotential constitutional violations, in conjunction with plaintiff’s failure to challenge \nchanges as inadequate, “tend[ed] to support the conclusion that the District did not \nremain deliberately indifferent”).  \nD.   Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Actions of a Final Policymaker. \nFinally,  plaintiffs  have  not  alleged  sufficient  facts  to  establish  that  their \nalleged  constitutional  injuries  were  caused  by  the  actions  of  a  final  municipal \npolicymaker. Although the Amended Complaint is not clear on the point, Blue, 811 \nF.3d at 20, plaintiffs appear to contend that three MPD officials—Chief Newsham, \nAssistant  Chief  Greene,  and  Commander  Deville—either  ordered  or  condoned \n(“acknowledged”) the actions of the individual officers who, in turn, directly caused \nplaintiffs’ alleged constitutional injuries underlying Claims 1, 2, 6, and 12.

District of Columbia, 54 F. Supp. 3d 35, 42 (D.D.C. 2014) (Berman \nJackson, J.) (citing St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 126 (1988) (O’Connor, J., \nplurality op.)); accord Singletary v. District of Columbia, 766 F.3d 66, 74 (D.C.

Rather, “an individual must ‘speak with \nfinal policymaking authority for the local governmental actor’ as established by \nstate law.” Allen-Brown, 54 F. Supp. 3d at 42 (quoting Jett v. Dallas Indep.

Warminster, 629 F.3d \n121 (3d Cir. 2010), a case in which the Third Circuit affirmed dismissal of a § 1983 \nmunicipal liability claim, purportedly based on a final policymaker theory, because \nthe plaintiff failed “‘to plead in some fashion that [the police chief] had final policy \nmaking authority, as that is a key element of a Monell claim.’” 811 F.3d at 20 \n(quoting Santiago, 629 F.3d at 135). The Third Circuit required this of Santiago \ndespite  recognizing  that  “whether  [the  police  chief  was]  a  final  policymaker  is \nultimately a legal rather than a factual question.” Santiago, 629 F.3d at 135, n.11. \nThe Amended Complaint here fails in exactly the same way:  “[Plaintiffs] needed to \nassert the elements of [their policymaker theory but] failed to do so.” Blue, 811 F.3d \nat 20. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 49 of 69\npolicymakers  ‘have  retained  the  authority  to  measure  the  official’s  conduct  for \nconformance with their policies.’” Miner v.

Supp. 3d 260, \n266 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 127) (emphasis in original). \nUnder District law, all members of the police force, including the Chief of \nPolice, are subordinate to the Mayor and (ultimately) the Council, and thus non-\npolicymakers for purposes of municipal liability. As the Court in Miner explained: \nIn the District of Columbia, the Mayor is ultimately responsible for the \npolice department, see D.C. Code § 5-101.03, and the Mayor appoints a \nChief of Police, ‘with the advice and consent of the [City] Council,” D.C. \nCode § 5-105.01(a-1)(1), to administer the police department. All police \nofficers are required to “respect and obey the Chief of Police as the \nhead and chief of the police force, subject to the rules, regulations, and \ngeneral orders of the Council [ ] and the Mayor [ ].” D.C. Code § 5-\n127.03. \n \n87  F.  Supp.  3d  at  266.  These  provisions  establish  that  all  police  officers  and \ncommand  officials,  including  the  Chief,  are  subordinate  to  the  policymaking \nauthority of the Mayor, as ultimately constrained by the “rules, regulations, and \ngeneral orders,” which are within the Council’s purview to issue. See id. (“Thus, by \nlaw, police officers below the level of the Chief of police—and, arguably, the Chief \nherself … are subordinates [under the  meaning of Supreme Court precedent]”); \naccord Coleman v. District of Columbia, 828 F. Supp. 2d 87, 91 (D.D.C. 2011) (fire \nchief and assistant fire chief are not policymakers for municipal liability purposes \nbecause  the  “Mayor  and  the  City  Council  have  expressly  reserved  supervisory \npowers  to  themselves”).  Against  this  backdrop,  regardless  of  any  individually \nnamed  defendants’  involvement  in  MPD’s  response  to  the  events  at  issue  in \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 50 of 69\nplaintiffs’  Claims  1,  2,  6,  and  12,  their  actions  are  not,  as  a  matter  of  law, \nattributable to the District for municipal liability purposes. \nThis  conclusion  makes  particular  sense  in  the  context  of  policing  First \nAmendment assemblies, where the Council has generated comprehensive, express \nmunicipal policy governing police conduct. See D.C. Code § 5-331.01, et seq. It is \ntrue that all members of the police force, including the Chief, are authorized to \nmake arrests based on probable cause, Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 587, and use force when \nreasonably necessary, Robinson, 130 F. Supp. 3d at 193 (D.D.C. 2015); however, as \nthe Circuit has reminded, “discretion is insufficient to create municipal liability \nunless the decision maker had been granted final policy making authority under \nD.C. law in the area [at issue in plaintiffs’ complaint].” See Singletary, 766 F.3d at \n74 (citing Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480-81, 481–83 & n.12; Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 129-\n30). Here,  against  the  backdrop  of  the  policies  and  procedures  set  forth  in the \nFAAA, that authority was lacking. The Chief and his subordinates were constrained \nby  those  policies  and  procedures  when  they  ordered  or  acknowledged  the  MPD \nresponse to the violent protest activities on January 20, 2017, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 198–\n201;  any  alleged  decision  that  departed  from  them  was  not  an  act  of  the \nmunicipality for purposes of § 1983. See Singletary, 766 F.3d at 74 (“The board thus \nwas ‘constrained by polices not of [its] making,’ and its decision to ‘depart[ ]’ from \nthose policies by revoking [the plaintiff’s] parole based on unreliable hearsay was \nnot an ‘act of the municipality’ for purposes of § 1983”).  \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 51 of 69\nEven  if  plaintiffs  are  correct  that  Chief  Newsham  is  a  final  municipal \npolicymaker for the District, their suggestion that his actions on Inauguration Day \ngive rise to municipal liability for Claims 1, 2, 6 and 12 is flawed on other grounds. \nFor  starters,  even  accepting  as  true  that  Chief  Newsham,  “supervis[ed]  and \ndirect[ed]” plaintiffs’ detention on the street, plaintiffs offer no facts to plausibly \ndemonstrate that he issued any instructions regarding food, water or toilets, see \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 87–88, 99; nor do plaintiffs contend that the Chief had knowledge of \nany particular arrestee’s conditions. Likewise, assuming, as plaintiffs contend, that \nChief Newsham generally “directed” the use of chemical irritants, there is no basis \nto  infer  that  he  had  anything  to  do  with  any  particular  use  of  force  by  any \nindividual  MPD  officer  against  any  individual  plaintiff. Id. ¶¶  39–40.  In  other \nwords, plaintiffs’ policymaker theory of municipal liability—to the extent it is based \non any direct orders from Chief Newsham—is completely lacking any conceivable \nbasis for causation. See Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306. To much the same end, there is no \nbasis  to  infer  from  the  pleadings  that  Chief  Newsham  acted  with  “deliberate \nindifference  to  the  risk  that  a  violation  of  [any]  particular  constitutional  or \nstatutory  right  [would] follow  [from  his decisions on Inauguration  Day],”  which \nstandard the Circuit has recently insisted is an independent element of a municipal \npolicymaker claim founded on a policymaker’s “single decisions.” Blue, 811 F.3d at \n19  (quoting Bd. of Cty Comm’rs v. Brown,  520  U.S. 397,  411  (1997)).  Allowing \nplaintiffs’ constitutional claims against the District on these allegations—devoid of \ncausation or  any  suggestion of  deliberate  indifference—would  be  tantamount  to \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 52 of 69\naccepting respondeat superior as a vehicle for municipal liability under the rubric of \n§ 1983, which the Court is not authorized to do. Monell, 436 U.S. at 690. \nSo  too,  plaintiffs’  effort  to  hold  the  District  liable  for  their  constitutional \ninjuries  on  the  grounds  that  Chief  Newsham—in  his  alleged  role  as  final \npolicymaker—ratified  the  actions  of  his  subordinates  shortly  after  Inauguration \nDay falls short. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 204–05. Although the D.C. Circuit has not \naddressed  the  issue,  several  other  circuits  have  acknowledged  that  municipal \nliability  under  §  1983  can  be  based  on  a  final-policymaker-ratification  theory; \nhowever,  “[t]he  final  policymaker  must  not  only  approve  the  [subordinate’s] \ndecision, but also adopt the basis for the decision, and the ratification must be the \nmoving force, or cause, of the alleged constitutional violation.” Dempsey v. City of \nBaldwin, 143 F. App’x 976, 986 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 127); \nSoltesz v. Rushmore Plaza Civic Ctr.,  847  F.3d  941,  946–47  (8th  Cir.  2017) \n(“[R]atification requires both knowledge of the alleged constitutional violation, and \nproof that the policymaker specifically approved the subordinate’s act.”). Plaintiffs’ \nallegations regarding ratification by Chief Newsham fail under this standard for \ntwo main reasons. First, the Chief’s general statements in defense of his officers’ \nconduct on Inauguration Day, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 204–05, are not the sort of “specific[ ] \napprov[al]” required to establish ratification of a non-policymaker’s conduct. See \nSoltesz, 847 F.3d at 946. To the contrary, “good faith statements [by a policymaker] \nmade while defending complaints of constitutional violations by [non-policymaker] \nemployees do not generally demonstrate ratification.” Davidson v. City of Stafford, \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 53 of 69\n848 F.3d 384, 395–96 (5th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Second, it is impossible for \nplaintiffs to establish a causal nexus between the Chief’s subsequent defense of his \nofficers’ conduct—the supposed “ratification,” according to plaintiffs’ theory—and \nany of the constitutional violations alleged in Claims 1, 2, 6, and 12. Causation is an \nessential  element  of  a  §  1983  municipal  liability  claim  under  this  Circuit’s \nprecedent, Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306, and plaintiffs’ theory of the District’s liability \nfails as a matter of law to establish it. All claims against the District under § 1983 \nshould be dismissed with prejudice. \nXI.  CLAIMS 4, 5, 8, 13, AND 14:  Plaintiffs’ Negligence Per Se Claims Must Fail. \nPlaintiffs bring five claims under theories of negligence per se.5  See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 216–22, 230–33, 245–50 (Claims 4, 5, 8, 13, 14). Each of these claims is \nbased on provisions of the FAAA, D.C. Code § 5-331.01 et seq., including provisions \non the use of police lines (Claim 4), dispersal orders (Claim 5), use of chemical \nirritants (Claim 8), access to food (Claim 13), and the processing of arrestees (Claim \n14). As set forth below, these claims must fail. \n“To establish negligence under D.C. law, a plaintiff must prove a duty of care \nowed by the defendant to the plaintiff, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and \ndamage  to  the  interests  of  the  plaintiff,  proximately  caused  by  the  breach.” \n                                                 \n5   The District does not waive any arguments that these claims are not properly \nbrought or analyzed under a negligence per se framework. See District of Columbia \nv. White, 442 A.2d 159, 162 (D.C. 1982) (“In reviewing appellant’s claim, neither the \ntrial court nor this court is bound by plaintiff’s characterization of the action as \nnegligence.” (citation omitted)); see also Caroline Forell, The Statutory Duty Action \nin Tort: A Statutory/common Law Hybrid, 23 Ind. L. Rev. 781, 797–801 (1990) \n(discussing the difference between negligence per se and statutory duty cases).  \n \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 54 of 69\nSigmund v.

Beretta, U.S.A., Corp., 872 A.2d 633, 642 n.3 (D.C. \n2005) (en banc)). “Violation of a statute or regulation may constitute negligence per \nse only if the statute is meant to promote safety, if the plaintiff is a member of the \nclass to be protected by the statute, and if the defendant is a person upon whom the \nstatute imposes specific duties.” Night & Day Mgmt., LLC v. Butler, 101 A.3d 1033, \n1039–40  (D.C.  2014)  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted); see also \nJarrett v. Woodward Bros.,  751  A.2d  972,  977  (D.C.  2000)  (discussing  whether \nstatute  could  provide  “the  requisite  duty  and  standard  of  care”).  Plaintiffs’ \nnegligence per se claims do not meet this standard and thus lack the requisite duty \nand standard of care, among other deficiencies. These claims must therefore be \ndismissed. \nA.  Plaintiffs May Not Maintain Negligence Per Se Claims Against Any \nIndividual Defendants Because the Cited Regulations Do Not Impose \nDuties on Any Individual Defendants. \n \nA negligence per se claim may only be maintained against “a person upon \nwhom the statute imposes specific duties.” See Night & Day Mgmt., 101 A.3d at \n1039–40 (citations omitted); see also McNeil Pharm. v. Hawkins, 686 A.2d 567, 579 \n(D.C.  1996)  (“The  statute  must  also  ‘impose  specific  duties  on  the  defendant.’” \n(quoting District of Columbia v.

See Night & Day Mgmt., 101 A.3d at 1040 (noting that \nregulation  prohibiting  a  retail  licensee  from  permitting  underage  drinking  at  a \nlicensed establishment could form basis for claim of negligence per se); cf. White, \n442 A.2d 163–64 & n.12 (discussing evidence of detective’s violation of statutory \nprovision prohibiting use of excessive force by “[a]ny officer”); see also Ingram v. \nShipman-Meyer, 241 F. Supp. 3d 124, 152–53 (D.D.C. 2017) (discussing D.C. Code § \n5-125.03,  which  prohibits  use  of  chokeholds  by  “any  police  officer”), appeal \ndismissed, No. 17-7074, 2017 WL 5157752 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 31, 2017). Unlike these \nregulations,  the  FAAA  provisions  upon  which  plaintiffs  base  their  claims  of \nnegligence per se do not impose specific duties on any individual defendant—as \nopposed to MPD or the District as a whole—and therefore cannot support a claim \nfor negligence per se.  \nClaim 4 relies upon D.C. Code § 5-331.08, which provides: \nNo emergency area or zone will be established by using a police line \nto encircle, or substantially encircle, a demonstration, rally, parade, \nmarch, picket line, or other similar assembly (or subpart thereof) \nconducted  for  the  purpose  of  persons  expressing  their  political, \nsocial, or religious views except where there is probable cause to \nbelieve  that  a  significant  number  or  percentage  of  the  persons \nlocated in the area or zone have committed unlawful acts (other \nthan failure to have an approved assembly plan) and the police \nhave the ability to identify those individuals and have decided to \narrest them; provided, that this section does not prohibit the use of \na  police  line  to  encircle  an  assembly  for  the  safety  of  the \ndemonstrators. \n \nD.C.  Code  §  5-331.08  (Use  of  police  lines).  On  its  face,  the  statute  imposes  no \nspecific duties on any individual officer; it therefore cannot form the basis for a \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 56 of 69\nclaim of negligence per se. That other sections of the FAAA place specific burdens \non specific actors makes clear that provisions lacking such specificity “do not impose \nspecific duties on [any] defendant.” See Night & Day Mgmt., 101 A.3d at 1039–40. \nCf. D.C.  Code  §  5-331.06(b)(1)  (“The  Chief  of  Police  shall…”);  D.C.  Code  §  5-\n331.16(b)(3)  (“A  commanding  officer…shall…”).  In  addition,  any  burden  arising \nfrom this provision’s language cannot logically lie with any individual officer but \nmust instead lie with the District.  \nClaim 8 suffers a similar defect. Plaintiffs cite D.C. Code § 5-331.16(b), which \nprovides: \n(1) Large scale canisters of chemical irritant shall not be used at \nFirst Amendment assemblies absent the approval of a commanding \nofficer at the scene, and the chemical irritant is reasonable and \nnecessary  to  protect  officers  or  others  from  physical  harm  or  to \narrest actively resisting subjects. \n \n(2) Chemical irritant shall not be used by officers to disperse a First \nAmendment assembly unless the assembly participants or others \nare  committing  acts  of  public  disobedience  endangering  public \nsafety and security. \n \n(3) A commanding officer who makes the determination specified in \nparagraph (1) of this subsection shall file with the Chief of Police a \nwritten report explaining his or her action within 48 hours after the \nevent. \n \nD.C.  Code  §  5-331.16(b)(1)–(3).  Much  like  the  provision  discussed  above,  this \nprovision places no specific duties on any specific actor. To the contrary, the only \nspecific burden it creates is a reporting requirement for “[a] commanding officer” to \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 57 of 69\nfile a written report with the Chief of Police. D.C. Code § 5-331.16(b)(3). As a result, \nClaim 8 must fail as against all individual defendants.6 \nClaims 5, 13, and 14 all rely upon FAAA provisions that expressly place \nduties  not  on  any  individual  but  on  the  MPD  as  a  whole. See D.C.  Code  §  5-\n331.07(e)(1) (“[T]he MPD shall issue at least one clearly audible and understandable \norder to disperse….” (emphasis added)); D.C. Code § 5-331.12(b)(2) (“The MPD shall \nprovide  to  any  person  not  released  within  a  reasonable  time  of  arrest  food \nappropriate to the person’s health.” (emphasis added)); D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1) \n(“The MPD shall promptly process…” (emphasis added)).  \nBecause the FAAA provisions upon which plaintiffs base their negligence per \nse claims do not impose any specific duties upon any of the individual defendants, \nthey cannot give rise to claims for negligence per se against them. Claims 4, 5, 8, 13, \nand 14 must therefore be dismissed as against all individual defendants. \nB.  The Cited FAAA Provisions Cannot Form the Basis for Negligence Per \nSe Because They Do Not Impose “Specific” Duties. \n \nA statute will support a claim for negligence per se “only” if it “imposes \nspecific duties.” Night & Day Mgmt., 101 A.3d at 1039–40; see also McNeil Pharm., \n686 A.2d at 579. Thus, if a statute provides actors with discretion or essentially \nrestates the common law standard of reasonable care, it cannot form the basis for \nnegligence per se. See id. at 1040 (stating that “the statute or regulation must not \n                                                 \n6   To the extent plaintiffs base this claim on D.C. Code § 5-331.16(b)(2), the \nclaim must fail because the Amended Complaint alleges “acts of public disobedience \nendangering  public  safety  and  security.”  See, e.g.,  Am.  Compl.  ¶¶  21–22 \n(vandalism), 36 (“unlawful acts”), 46 (“breaking a storefront window”). Accordingly, \nplaintiffs do not allege a breach of the standard they cite. \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 58 of 69\nmerely repeat the common law duty of reasonable care, but must set forth specific \nguidelines  to  govern  behavior”  and  finding  that  requirements  using  terms \n“sufficient” and “adequate” grant “considerable discretion and do not specifically \noutline any standards” to support negligence per se); see also Gadaire v. Orchin, 197 \nF. Supp. 3d 5, 14 (D.D.C. 2016);Chadbourne v. Kappaz, 779 A.2d 293, 296–97 (D.C. \n2001)  (“Thus,  while  the  statute  sets  a  general  standard  of care  …,  it  does  not \ncontain the kind of specific guidelines that would allow one to determine whether \nthe statute has been violated without resorting to a common law reasonable care \nanalysis. Thus, we conclude that a negligence per se instruction was not warranted \nin this case.”). The FAAA provisions upon which plaintiffs rely do not meet this \nstandard. \nClaim 4 rests on the alleged violation of D.C. Code § 5-331.08. This regulation \npermits  MPD  to  use  police  lines  to  encircle, i.e.,  “kettle,”  only  “where  there  is \nprobable cause to believe that a significant number or percentage of the persons \nlocated in the area or zone have committed unlawful acts … and the police have the \nability to identify those individuals and have decided to arrest them.” D.C. Code § 5-\n331.08 (emphasis added). This regulation simply does not contain specific guidelines \nsufficient to form the basis for a claim of negligence per se.  \nProbable cause is an inherently non-specific matter. The Supreme Court has \ndescribed the probable-cause standard as “a practical, nontechnical conception that \ndeals  with  the  factual  and  practical  considerations  of  everyday  life  on  which \nreasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.” See Pringle, 540 U.S. at \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 59 of 69\n370–71  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted)  (emphasis  added). \nSimilarly, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has boiled the standard down \nto “a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.” Perkins v. United States, 936 A.2d 303, \n305–06  (D.C.  2007)  (citations  omitted).  Because  this  regulation  relies  on  an \nimprecise  standard  like  probable  cause—which  itself  relies  on  a  generalized \nconception  of  reasonableness—it  lacks  the  requisite  specificity.  This  regulation \ncannot  form  the  basis  for  negligence  per se for  two  additional  reasons:    the \nregulation’s use of “a significant number or percentage of persons located in the \narea  or  zone”  is  inherently  imprecise,  see  Significantly,  OXFORD  ENGLISH \nDICTIONARY  (3d  ed.  2011)  (“1.  Highly  expressive  or  suggestive;  loaded  with \nmeaning…4. Sufficiently great or important to be worthy of attention; noteworthy; \nconsequential,  influential.”),  and  the  regulation’s  applicability  turns  on  MPD’s \nexercise of discretion to arrest. See, e.g., Night & Day Mgmt., 101 A.3d at 1039–40. \nThe regulation relied on for Claim 5, D.C. Code § 5-331.07(e)(1), similarly \ncannot form the basis for a claim of negligence per se because it turns on MPD’s \nexercise  of  discretion  to  issue  a  dispersal  order  and  merely  restates  a  general \nreasonableness standard. See D.C. Code § 5-331.07(e)(1).7 Claim 5 must also fail \n                                                 \n7   This section provides:  \n \nIf and when the MPD determines that a First Amendment assembly, or \npart  thereof,  should  be  dispersed, the  MPD  shall  issue  at  least  one \nclearly  audible  and  understandable  order  to  disperse using  an \namplification  system  or  device,  and  shall  provide  the  participants a \nreasonable and adequate time to disperse and a clear and safe route for \ndispersal. \n \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 60 of 69\nbecause plaintiffs do not allege that MPD ever made a determination to disperse \nany First Amendment assembly; thus, on plaintiffs’ own allegations, D.C. Code § 5-\n331.07(e)(1) simply does not apply.8 \nClaim  8  rests  on  D.C.  Code  §  5-331.16(b),  which  similarly  turns  on \ndiscretionary decisions and merely repeats a general reasonableness standard. See \nD.C. Code § 5-331.16(b)(1) (“reasonable and necessary”); D.C. Code § 5-331.16(b)(2) \n(implicitly  requiring  a  determination  that  “acts  of  public  disobedience  [are] \nendangering public safety and security”). And Claims 13 and 14 simply restate \ngeneral  reasonableness  standards. See D.C.  Code  §  5-331.12(b)(2)  (“reasonable”; \n“appropriate”); D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1) (“promptly”). This type of language simply \ndoes not amount to specific guidance upon which to base a claim of negligence per \nse. See, e.g., Thoma v. Kettler Bros., 632 A.2d 725, 727 & 728 n.8 (D.C. 1993) \n(noting that regulation requiring slippery conditions to be “eliminated as soon as \npossible” did not differ significantly from common law standard of reasonable care \nand thus did not support negligence per se). Accordingly, Claims 4, 5, 8, 13, and 14 \nmust fail.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nD.C. Code § 5-331.07(e)(1) (emphasis added). \n \n8   D.C. Code § 5-331.07 does not require dispersal orders be given in lieu of, or \nbefore,  arrest.  Rather,  it  permits  MPD  to  respond  to  unlawful  conduct  by \n“dispersing, controlling, or arresting the persons engaged in such conduct.” D.C. \nCode § 5-331.07(c). Moreover, dispersal would be inconsistent with a decision to \narrest in accordance with D.C. Code § 5-331.08. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 61 of 69\nC.  Plaintiffs Do Not Allege Injuries Proximately Caused by the Violation \nof Any FAAA Provision and of a Type the FAAA Was Designed to \nPrevent. \n \nTo prevail under a theory of negligence per se, a plaintiff must show that “the \nviolation was the proximate cause of the injuries, and the alleged injuries were of \nthe type which the statute was designed to prevent.” See, e.g., McNeil Pharm., 686 \nA.2d at 578 (citations omitted). “Proximate cause has two components:  ‘cause-in-\nfact’ and a ‘policy element’ which limits a defendant’s liability when the chain of \nevents leading to the plaintiff’s injury is unforeseeable or ‘highly extraordinary’ in \nretrospect.” Majeska v. District of Columbia, 812 A.2d 948, 950 (D.C. 2002) (quoting \nDistrict of Columbia v. Carlson, 793 A.2d 1285, 1288 (D.C. 2002)). The cause-in-fact \nprong will be satisfied where the actor’s conduct was a substantial factor in bringing \nabout the harm. See, e.g., Majeska, 812 A.2d at 951 (citation omitted). However, \nconclusory allegations do not suffice. See Johnson v. Sullivan, 748 F. Supp. 2d 1, 9 \n(D.D.C. 2010) (“In asserting such a claim, as with any claim, more than speculation \nis required; mere ‘[c]onclusory allegations of ... harm do not allege facts that would \nsupport causation and injury sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.’” (quoting \nHerbin v. Hoeffel, 806 A.2d 186, 196 (D.C. 2002))); see also Maddox v. Bano, 422 \nA.2d 763, 764 (D.C. 1980). The Amended Complaint does not meet this standard. \nThe Amended Complaint’s allegations do not demonstrate that the violation \nof the cited FAAA provisions was a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiffs’ \nalleged injuries. Claim 4 turns on D.C. Code § 5-331.08, which prohibits police from \n“kettling” groups “except where there is probable cause to believe that a significant \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 62 of 69\nnumber or percentage of the persons located in the area or zone have committed \nunlawful acts … and the police have the ability to identify those individuals and \nhave decided to arrest them.” Because probable cause existed to arrest Horse and \nLagesse specifically, see above Section I, they have not alleged a violation of the \ncited provision. Because a negligence per se claim requires that a violation of the \ncited regulation be the proximate cause of injury, this claim must fail.   \nPlaintiffs similarly fail to allege a violation to support Claim 5. Plaintiffs base \nthis  claim  on  D.C.  Code  §  5-331.07(e)(1),  which  relates  to  dispersal  of  First \nAmendment assemblies. But this provision only applies when “MPD determines” \nthat  a  First  Amendment  assembly  should  be  dispersed;  because  the  Amended \nComplaint does not allege that MPD ever made such a decision, it does not allege \nthat the provision was triggered, let alone violated. As a result, plaintiffs have not \nalleged that the violation was the proximate cause of the[ir] injuries. And even if \nplaintiffs had alleged that violation of the regulation was a substantial factor in \ncausing injury, any injury could not have been “of the type which the statute was \ndesigned to prevent.” See McNeil Pharm., 686 A.2d at 578. On its face, D.C. Code § \n5-331.07(e)(1) is meant to prevent injuries to individuals during dispersal. See D.C. \nCode § 5-331.07(e)(1) (“If and when the MPD determines that a First Amendment \nassembly,  or  part  thereof,  should  be  dispersed,  the  MPD  …  shall  provide  the \nparticipants … a clear and safe route for dispersal.”). Because plaintiffs have not \nalleged that they were injured because of or during an MPD-ordered dispersal, any \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 63 of 69\ninjuries  could  not  have  been  within  the  scope  of  D.C.  Code  §  5-331.07(e)(1)’s \nprotections.  \nPlaintiffs base Claim 8 upon D.C. Code § 5-331.16(b), which relates to the use \nof chemical irritants. But because the Amended Complaint alleges unlawful acts \nand attempts to evade arrest, see, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 21–22, 36, 46, 59, 64, the \nallegations do not make out a violation this regulation. In the absence of such a \nviolation, plaintiffs have not alleged a viable claim of negligence per se. \nClaim 13 relies on D.C. Code § 5-331.12(b)(2), which requires the MPD to \n“provide  to  any  person  not  released  within  a  reasonable  time  of  arrest  food \nappropriate to the person’s health.” D.C. Code § 5-331.12(b)(2) (emphasis added). \nThe specific reference to a “person’s health” makes clear that this provision is not \nmeant as a duty to provide snacks to prevent “hunger” and “discomfort,” see, ¶¶ \n179, 186, 191, but to protect individuals for whom a delay in food or consumption of \ninappropriate food would affect the person’s health, such as diabetics or those with \nserious allergies. Plaintiffs do not allege that a delay in being fed was inappropriate \nto their health. As a result, they have not alleged any violation, and this claim must \nfail.  \nPlaintiffs’ prompt processing claim relies upon D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1). \nBut as discussed below, see Section D, that regulation was intended to protect \narrestees’ Fourth Amendment interest in a prompt probable cause determination \nand prevent resulting damage to an individual’s employment, relationships, and \nreputation. Because plaintiffs do not allege that this violation caused them these \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 64 of 69\ntypes  of  injuries,  their  claim  for  negligence  per se based  on  D.C.  Code  §  5-\n331.12(a)(1) must also fail.9  \nD.   Claim 14 Also Fails Because D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1) is Not a Public \nSafety Regulation. \n \nA statute or regulation cannot form the basis for a negligence per se claim \nunless it promotes public safety. Night & Day Mgmt. Butler, 101 A.3d at 1039–40; \nsee also Ginsberg v. Granados, 963 A.2d 1134, 1140 (D.C. 2009); McNeil Pharm., \n686 A.2d at 579 (“At a minimum, however, the statute or regulation relied on must \npromote public safety and have been enacted to protect persons in the plaintiff's \nposition or to prevent the type of accident that occurred.” (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted)). Claim 14 asserts a negligence per se claim based on \nviolation of D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1), which states:  “The MPD shall promptly \nprocess any person arrested in connection with a First Amendment assembly to \ndetermine whether the person is eligible for immediate release pursuant to a lawful \nrelease  option,  and  shall  promptly  release  any  person  so  eligible  who  opts  for \nrelease.” But “[u]nlike statutes held to promote public safety, … [D.C. Code § 5-\n331.12(a)(1)] in no way relates to the safety of the public at large.” See Ginsberg, \n963  A.2d  at  1140  (citing  cases  applying  negligence  per se  theory  to  statutes \nprohibiting  tavernkeepers  from  permitting  alcohol  consumption  by  underage \npatrons and traffic regulations governing brakes, among others); see also White, \n                                                 \n9   Although  Horse  alleges  that  he  was  unable  to  sell  photographs  of  the \nJanuary 20, 2017 demonstrations and could not cover other newsworthy events, he \nattributes this loss to the confiscation of his photographs and equipment and not to \nthe delay in his on-scene processing. See Am. Compl. ¶ 177.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 65 of 69\n442 A.2d at 164 (finding that statute criminalizing police use of excessive force \npromoted safety). \nOn its face, D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1) has no public safety purpose. The \nprovision’s legislative history confirms that its purpose is not to promote public \nsafety  but  to  protect  arrestees’  Fourth  Amendment  interest  in  promptly  being \nbrought before a neutral magistrate for a determination on probable cause. The \n“Committee Reasoning” section of the Committee on the Judiciary’s report on the \nFAAA specifically states that “[s]ection 112 [D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1)] reflects the \nstandard contained in Lively v. Cullilane, 451 F. Supp. 1000, 1009 (D.D.C. 1978)….” \nD.C. Comm. Rep., B. 15-968 at 13 (2004). The plaintiffs in Lively sought declaratory \nand injunctive relief prohibiting MPD from detaining arrestees “without presenting \nthem promptly to a judicial officer.” Lively, 451 F. Supp. at 1002. The Lively court \nidentified  the  “consequences  of  prolonged  detention,”  noting  that  “[p]retrial \nconfinement  may  imperil  the  suspect’s  job,  interrupt  his  source  of  income,  and \nimpair his family relationships.” Id. at 10005. The Lively court also identified the \nliberty  interests  at  stake  in  a  pre-presentment  detention  as  including  an \nindividual’s freedom of movement, “ability to go to work or carry on his life,” and \nreputation. Id. These interests are important but they do not promote public safety. \nAs a result, D.C. Code § 5-331.12(a)(1) cannot serve as the basis for a claim of \nnegligence per se, and Claim 14 must therefore fail. \n \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 66 of 69\nE.    Claims 13 and 14 Must be Dismissed as Against Defendants \nNewsham, Alder, Carroll, and Niepling for Lack of Personal \nInvolvement. \n \nPlaintiffs bring Claims 13 and 14 against the District and, in their individual \ncapacities,  Chief  Newsham,  Assistant  Chief  Alder,  Commander  Carroll,  and \nLieutenant Niepling. These claims allege negligence per se arising from the alleged \nfailure of MPD to provide food (Claim 13) and promptly process arrestees (Claim \n14).  But  “public  officials  …  cannot  be  held  liable  in  tort  for  the  acts  of  their \nsubordinates  under  a respondeat  superior theory  unless  they  directed  or \ncountenanced the tortious acts.” Turner v. D.C., 532 A.2d 662, 675 (D.C. 1987) \n(citation omitted).  \nHere,  plaintiffs  have  not  alleged  that  any  of  these  individual  defendants \nspecifically  directed  that  plaintiffs  not  be  provided  with  food  or  specifically \ncountenanced  a  deprivation of  food.  Instead,  they  conclusorily  allege  that  these \nfailures came under the generalized “supervision and direction” of these defendants \nand that this can be inferred from “[t]he gap in time” until plaintiffs were processed. \nSee Am. Compl. ¶¶ 88, 99. This constitutes the type of “unadorned, the-defendant-\nunlawfully-harmed-me accusation,” see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, “that is not enough \nto state a plausible claim for relief against defendant[s] [Newsham, Alder, Carroll, \nand Niepling] in [their] individual capacity[ies],” see Smith, 149 F. Supp. 3d at 135. \nSee also King, 640 A.2d at 666 (holding “as a matter of law only the employer, the \nDistrict  of  Columbia,  could  be  held  liable  for  the  tortious  acts  of  one  of  its \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 67 of 69\nemployees” (citations omitted)). For this reason too, Claims 13 and 14 must be \ndismissed as against these individual defendants. \nXII.  CLAIM  15:    Plaintiff  Gonzalez  Fails  to  State  a  Claim  for  Intentional \nInfliction of Emotional Distress. \n \nGonzalez fails to state a claim against defendants Newsham, Alder, Carroll, \nor Niepling for intentional infliction of emotional distress. “To succeed on the claim \nof intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show (1) extreme and \noutrageous  conduct  on  the  part  of  the  defendant  which  (2)  intentionally  or \nrecklessly  (3)  causes  plaintiff  severe  emotional  distress.”  Minch v. District of \nColumbia, 952 A.2d 929, 940 (D.C. 2008). The conduct must be “so outrageous in \ncharacter, and so extreme in degree, to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, \nand to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” \nLarijani v. Georgetown Univ., 791 A.2d 41, 44 (D.C. 2002).   \nGonzalez alleges that “Defendants Asst. Chief Robert Alder, Cmdr. Jeffrey \nCarroll, and Lt. Paul Niepling supervised the continued maintenance of the kettle” \nduring which they communicated with and received orders from the MPD command \ncenter, “where Defendant Newsham was overseeing the operation.” Am. Compl. ¶ \n87. He alleges that “during the many hours” he was detained in the kettle, “under \nthe supervision and direction of Chief Newsham, Assist. Chief Alder, Cmdr. Carroll, \nand Lt. Niepling failed to provide [him] with food, water, or access to a toilet” \ndespite Gonzalez’s request for access to a toilet. Id. ¶¶ 88–89.  \nMore  important  is  what  Gonzalez  fails  to  allege:    that  defendants \nintentionally held him without access to a toilet. He does not allege defendants \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 38   Filed 03/30/18   Page 68 of 69\nprevented him from using an available bathroom, or that they intentionally kettled \nthe arrestees in a place without a bathroom. He also does not allege he told these \ndefendants he needed access to a toilet. See id. ¶¶ 88–89. Finally, Gonzalez does not \nallege he suffered “severe emotional distress” as a result of having to wait to have \naccess to a bathroom.  \nDefendants’ “failure,” id. ¶ 88, to provide Gonzalez with a toilet does not rise \nto the level of conduct that is so outrageous and egregious that it constitutes a claim \nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress. \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  plaintiffs’  First Amended  Complaint  should  be \ndismissed with prejudice. \nDated:  March 30, 2018.

Civil Action No. 17-1216 (ABJ) \n   \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al.,   \n   \n  Defendants.   \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF OFFICER \nJOHN DOE’S MOTION TO DISMISS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, MOTION FOR \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nOn June 21, 2017, six months after their arrests for rioting, plaintiffs Shay \nHorse and Milo Gonzalez publicly claimed in their Complaint, press releases, and \nstatements to the media, that on Inauguration Day an officer of the District of \nColumbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) lined them up against a wall with \nother arrestees, ordered them to pull down their pants, and subjected them to body \ncavity exams, inserting his finger into their rectums—one after the other—without \nchanging gloves. Plaintiffs claimed that all of this happened while five-to-ten other \nmale and female MPD officers looked on, laughing. \nThe graphic details of plaintiffs’ post-arrest searches are objectively false. \nPlaintiffs apparently did not anticipate that their searches would be captured on \nsurveillance video, which clearly shows that the searches described in the original \ncomplaint,  and  depicted  above, did  not  happen.  To  the  contrary,  plaintiffs \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 4 of 21\nunderwent standard clothed pat-down searches along with other arrestees. Their \npants were not pulled down, their rectums were not penetrated with dirty gloves, \nand no MPD officers stood around laughing.   \nPlaintiffs’  account  of  their  searches,  broadcast  in  public  statements  and \nsubsequent pleadings filed with this Court, were not mere embellishments—they \nwere  outright  and  intentional  misrepresentations.  Claim  16  of  plaintiffs’  First \nAmended Complaint should be dismissed, or in the alternative, the Court should \ngrant Officer John Doe judgment for the reasons below.  \nBACKGROUND \nI.   Procedural History \n \nPlaintiffs filed their initial Complaint [1] on June 21, 2017. In it, Horse and \nGonzalez alleged that while at the MPD Police Academy on Blue Plains Drive: \n115. Defendant Officer John Doe 150, who was wearing rubber \ngloves, ordered Mr. Horse, Mr. Gonzalez, and three other detainees to \nremove their pants. \n \n116.  Without  warning,  Defendant  Officer  John  Doe  150 \ngrabbed Mr. Horse’s testicles and yanked on them. \n \n117. He then put his finger into Mr. Horse’s rectum, through \nhis underwear. \n \n118. As Defendant Officer John Doe 150 pushed his finger into \nMr. Horse’s rectum, he ordered Mr. Horse not to flinch. \n \n119. Defendant Officer John Doe 150 pushed his finger an inch \ndeep  into  Mr.  Horse’s  rectum  and  wiggled  it  around  for  several \nseconds. \n \n120. Defendant Officer John Doe 150 then reached inside Mr. \nGonzalez’s underwear and fondled his testicles. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 5 of 21\n121.  Defendant  Officer  John  Doe  150  reach  inside  Mr. \nGonzalez’s underwear and put his finger into Mr. Gonzalez’s rectum. \n… \n \n124. Defendant Officer John Doe 150 then moved down the line \nand subjected the other three detainees there to similar treatment; \nMr. Horse heard another detainee yelp.  \n \nCompl. ¶¶ 115–21, 124. Horse and Gonzalez initially brought three claims related to \nthese allegations:  unlawful search in violation of the Fourth Amendment (Claim \n14); assault and battery (Claim 15); and intentional infliction of emotional distress \n(Claim 16).  \nDue to the gravity of these allegations, on August 7, 2017, the MPD Internal \nAffairs Division, Sexual Assault Unit (SAU) was assigned to investigate plaintiffs’ \nnarrative. On September 7, 2017, as part of the investigation, SAU interviewed \nHorse  and  Gonzalez,  separately,  in  the  presence  of  plaintiffs’  counsel.  The \ninterviews were audio recorded. During the interviews, Horse and Gonzalez told \nstories  that  were  consistent  with  the  allegations  in  the  Complaint,  but  both \nprovided  additional  details  and  descriptions  of  the  alleged  searches  beyond  the \nallegations included in the pleading. Plaintiff Horse told SAU: \n[T]he officers had us line up and they started doing more invasive \nsearches. They brought us in like groups of like five from each side of \nlike the van. Um, but yeah, they told us to line up against the wall and \nassume the position. \n \nHorse, Interview Audio (Sept. 7, 2017) at 5:22–5:37 (Ex. A). Plaintiff Horse’s \ndialogue with the investigator continued: \nHorse: He said assume the position. Those were his exact words.   \nInvestigator: Tell me what you understood that to mean. \nHorse: I assumed that means hands against the wall. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 6 of 21\nInvestigator: Is that what you did? \nHorse: Yes. \nInvestigator: Are you facing the wall or facing away from the wall? \nHorse: Facing the wall. \n \nId. at 16:05–16:25. Horse then told the investigators that when he was facing the \nwall, he was at the end of a line of five or six arrestees, who were in the same \nposition. Id. at 16:30–17:40. According to Horse, the searching officer—John Doe \n150—next told the arrestees to “drop em,” and Horse unbuttoned his pants and they \nfell down “somewhere past [his] knees.” 19:17–19:52. Horse stated the officer began \nto search him by patting down his arms and moving down his body. Id. at 17:47–\n18:05. He said the officer then inserted two fingers into his rectum “for several \nseconds,” through his underwear, while his pants were down. Id. at 21:00–22:20. \nHorse told SAU investigators that after the officer searched him and moved down \nthe line to search the other arrestees, Horse “pulled [his] pants up” and continued \nfacing the wall waiting for the other searches to be over. Id. at 23:25–23:48. \nPlaintiff Gonzalez also described being ordered to pull down his pants and \ndropping them to his knees for his search: \nInvestigator: So when you dropped your pants, how far did you drop \nthem? \nGonzalez: He told me to my knees. \nInvestigator: So, and did you drop them to your knees? \nGonzalez: Yes. \n \nGonzalez, Interview Audio (Sept. 7, 2017) at 21:20–21:28 (Ex. B). Gonzalez told the \nSAU investigator the Officer “fondled [him] and put his finger in [his] bum.” Id. at \n7:50–7:52.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 7 of 21\nAs part of their investigation, SAU obtained and reviewed surveillance video \nfootage from the tactical village at the MPD Police Academy on Blue Plains Drive \n(Blue Plains video). The Blue Plains video captures the arrestee processing and \nsearches  that  occurred  at  the  MPD  Police  Academy  on  January  20,  2017,  and \nduring the morning hours of January 21, 2017. The location in the video matches \nthe “mock street” where Horse and Gonzalez allege the unlawful searches occurred. \nCompl.  ¶¶  113–14.1  SAU  reviewed  the  footage,  which  captured  the  entire  time \nHorse and Gonzalez were at Blue Plains, including their searches. SAU discovered \nthe Blue Plains video directly contradicts the accounts of Horse and Gonzalez in \ntheir initial Complaint and SAU interviews.  \n  On October 6, 2017, counsel for the District wrote to counsel for plaintiffs, \ninforming plaintiffs of the Blue Plains video’s existence and that the video footage \ncontradicts  the  allegations  in  the  Complaint  and  SAU  interviews.  Letter  from \nAmanda Montee, Assistant Attorney General, to Scott Michelman, ACLU (Oct. 6, \n2017)  (Ex.  C).  In  the  correspondence,  the  District  offered  to  make  the  video \navailable for plaintiffs to view, subject to a protective order. Id. The District also \nrequested that plaintiffs withdraw Interrogatory No. 3, which was then pending in \n                                            \n1   See also  Horse, SAU  Interview  (Sept.  7,  2017) at 9:14–9:37, 10:55–12:10; \nGonzalez, SAU Interview at 10:30–10:50, 18:18–19:53. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 8 of 21\naccordance with the Doe discovery authorized by the Court2 and sought the identity \nof the officer who conducted the search, as well as Claims 14, 15, and 16, which the \nDistrict maintained were contradicted by the video. The District produced the Blue \nPlains video to plaintiffs on October 17, 2017, pursuant to a Protective Order [24]. \nOn  October  20,  2017,  the  District  also  produced  the  SAU  investigative  file  for \nplaintiffs’ consideration.  \n  On October 26, 2017, counsel for plaintiffs wrote to counsel for the District, \nstating: \nThank you for the opportunity to view the Blue Plains video and read \nIAD’s report. We have completed our investigation, and we agree with \nyou that the factual allegations need to be amended. We also intend to \ndrop or modify several claims. We will do both of these things when we \namend the complaint.  \n \nEmail  from  Scott  Michelman,  ACLU,  to  Amanda  Montee,  Assistant  Attorney \nGeneral (Oct. 26, 2017) (Ex. D). Plaintiffs’ counsel also agreed to withdraw the \ninterrogatory seeking the name of the searching officer. Id. \n  The following week, on October 31, 2017, plaintiffs’ counsel sent the District \nplaintiffs’  proposed  Second  Set  of  Interrogatories,  and  requested  the  District’s \nconsent to another round of expedited discovery to identify John Doe defendants. \nThe  proposed  interrogatories,  specifically,  Interrogatory  No.  1(b),  included  a \nphotograph of the officer who conducted the searches of Horse and Gonzalez, which \n                                            \n2   On September 18, 2017, this Court issued an Order [22] granting plaintiffs \nleave to serve interrogatories on the District for the limited purpose of identifying \nthe “John Doe” defendants described in the Complaint. Interrogatory No. 3 sought \n“the name(s) and badge number(s) of the MPD member(s) who performed any of the \nsearches  on  Plaintiffs  Horse  and/or  Gonzalez  described  in  ¶¶  113-128  of  the \nComplaint.” Pls.’ First Set of Interrog. to District [19-1]. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 9 of 21\nhad been captured as a screenshot from the Blue Plains video produced subject to \nthe Protective Order. The interrogatory sought the identity of the person depicted in \nthe screenshot.  \n  Counsel for the District wrote to plaintiffs’ counsel on November 9, 2017, \nstating  again  that  the  Blue  Plains  video  contradicts  plaintiffs’  claims  and \nexplaining: \nOn October 6, 2017, we wrote to inform you that we investigated the \nsearch allegations made by Shay Horse and Michael “Milo” Gonzalez in \nthe  Complaint, see ¶¶  113–28,  198–206,  and  found  that  the  video \nsurveillance footage recorded at the facility where Mr. Horse and Mr. \nGonzalez  were  processed  (the  Blue  Plains  Video)  contradicts  their \naccounts. We provided you the Blue Plains Video on October 17, 2017, \nsubject to a Protective Order  [24]. We brought this matter to your \nattention  and  provided  the  video  so  that  you  would  have  an \nopportunity review the evidence and remove the false allegations and \nclaims from the Complaint. \n \nAs you undoubtedly saw on the video, Mr. Horse and Mr. Gonzalez did \nnot remove, or pull down, their pants for the searches. Cf. Compl. ¶ \n115 (“Defendant Officer John Doe 150, who was wearing rubber gloves, \nordered Mr. Horse, Mr. Gonzalez, and three other detainees to remove \ntheir  pants.”).  They  were  not  searched  in  a  line  with  three  other \ndetainees. Cf. Compl. ¶ 124 (“Officer John Doe 150 then moved down \nthe  line  and  subjected  the  other  three  detainees  there  to  similar \ntreatment”); Shay Horse, ACLU Press Conference (June 21, 2017) (“[A] \ngroup  of  officers,  maybe  a  dozen,  lined  up  five  male  detainees, \nincluding myself.”). And they were not subject to a visual or physical \nrectal examination. Cf. Compl. ¶¶ 117–22. \n \nLetter from Eric Johnson, Assistant Attorney General, to Scott Michelman, ACLU \n(Nov. 6, 2017) (Ex. E). Plaintiffs’ counsel responded: \nWe have agreed to drop or modify claims 14-16 as you requested. We \nhave not agreed that we will necessarily delete them all and assert no \nclaim arising from the searches at the Blue Plains facility. We agree \nthat the video shows that not all of the allegations made in the original \ncomplaint were accurate. However, we also think the video confirms \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 10 of 21\nthat our clients were subject to invasive and unjustified probing of \n[their] private [areas] that is actionable as excessive force. Therefore \nour current plan (subject to further research and further discussion \nwith  our  clients)  is  to  substantially  revise  but  not  eliminate  the \nallegations concerning the individual who searched Mr. Horse and Mr. \nGonzalez at the Blue Plains facility. As a result, each of claims 14 to 16 \nwill be dropped or modified. We do not intend to drop all three. We \nagreed to drop Interrogatory 3 from our initial discovery because it \nreferred to the current allegations of the complaint, which we agree are \nnot  entirely  accurate.  But  we  still  have  a  need  to  identify  the \nindividual  who  searched  Mr.  Horse  and  Mr.  Gonzalez  at  the  Blue \nPlains facility, because we intend to modify but retain at least one \nclaim against him. \n \nEmail from Scott Michelman, ACLU, to Amanda Montee, Matthew Blecher, and \nEric Johnson, Assistant Attorneys General (Nov. 6, 2017) (emphasis added) (Ex. F). \nUltimately, plaintiffs withdrew the proposed interrogatory seeking the identity of \nJohn Doe 150 and did not include it in Plaintiffs’ Second Set of Interrogatories to \nthe District [26-1]. \nII.   Factual Allegations in Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint \n \n  Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint [29] on January 3, 2018. The \nFirst Amended Complaint still includes one allegation that Horse and Gonzalez \nwere  unconstitutionally  searched—a  claim  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  alleging \nviolation  of  plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  rights  against  Officer  John  Doe. \nHowever, the factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint differ markedly \nfrom those in the prior Complaint. Plaintiff Horse alleges that “Officer John Doe \npatted  [him]  down  and  then  jabbed  into  [his]  rectum,  through  his  pants,”  and \nordered  Horse  not  to  flinch.  Am.  Compl.  ¶¶  168–69.  Plaintiff  Gonzalez  alleges \n“Officer John Doe reached inside [his] underwear and fondled his testicles … and \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 11 of 21\nreached inside [his] underwear and put his finger into [his] rectum,” while ordering \nGonzalez not to resist. Id. ¶¶ 171–73. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nI.   Dismissal Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \nDismissal of a claim or complaint is appropriate when a party fails to set \nforth “a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “To survive \na motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). \nAlthough the factual allegations in the complaint must be taken as true, a plaintiff \nmust  offer  “more  than  labels and  conclusions”  or  “a  formulaic  recitation  of  the \nelements  of  a  cause  of  action.”  Twombly,  550  U.S.  at  555.  “Nor  does  a \ncomplaint suffice  if  it tenders  ‘naked  assertion[s]’  devoid  of  ‘further  factual \nenhancement.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). \nII.   Summary Judgment Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 \n“[W]hen ‘matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by \nthe court’ on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), ‘the motion must be treated as \none  for  summary  judgment  [under  Rule  56(a)].’” Highland Renovation Corp. v. \nHanover Ins. Grp., 620 F. Supp. 2d 79, 82 (D.D.C. 2009). Rule 56 requires courts to \ngrant summary judgment when the “materials in the record” show “that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)–(c); see George v. Leavitt, 407 F.3d 405, 410 \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 12 of 21\n(D.C. Cir. 2005). The mere existence of a factual dispute does not preclude summary \njudgment; “the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.” \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986). A fact is material if, \nunder the substantive law applicable to the case, it can affect the outcome of the \nlitigation. Id. And a dispute is “genuine” for summary judgment purposes if the \n“evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving \nparty.” Doe v. Dep’t of the Treasury, 706 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2009). Because \nplaintiffs would bear the burden of proof on a dispositive issue at trial, they bear the \nburden of production at the summary judgment stage to designate specific facts \nshowing that there exists a genuine dispute requiring trial. Faison v. Vance-Cooks, \n896 F. Supp. 2d 37, 49 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 129 \n(2009)). “Otherwise, the plaintiff could effectively defeat the ‘central purpose’ of the \nsummary  judgment  device  –  namely,  ‘to  weed  out  those  cases  insufficiently \nmeritorious to warrant … trial’ – simply by way of offering conclusory allegations, \nspeculation, and argument.” Id. (citing Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. \nCir. 1999)). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The  Court  Should  Strike  Horse’s  and  Gonzalez’s  Search  Allegations  and \nDismiss Claim 16. \n \nA.  The Court May Strike Claims in an Amended Complaint that Contradict \nAllegations Originally Pled. \n   \nAt the motion to dismiss stage, the factual allegations in the complaint must \nbe taken as true, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, and “reconcilable ‘small variations’” \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 13 of 21\nbetween an original and amended complaint “are acceptable,” Hourani v. Mirtchev, \n943 F. Supp. 2d 159, 171 (D.D.C. 2013) (citation omitted), aff'd, 796 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. \n2015). “A plaintiff, however, may not plead facts in their amended complaint that \ncontradict those in their original complaint.” Id.  \nUnder such circumstances, the Court may exercise its discretion to strike \n“changed and inconsistent factual allegations as false and sham.” See Bradley v. \nChiron Corp., 136 F.3d 1317, 1325–26 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citations omitted) (finding \ndistrict  court  did  not  err  in  striking  factual  allegations  that  were  inconsistent \nbetween the  complaint  and  amended  complaint); Clay v. Howard Univ.,  128  F. \nSupp.  3d  22,  26  (D.D.C.  2015)  (“The  court  does  have  the  authority  to  strike \nobviously ‘false and sham’ allegations that have changed from the complaint to the \namended  complaint.”  (citation  omitted));  Hourani,  943  F.  Supp.  2d  at  171 \n(dismissing  amended  complaint  with  prejudice  based  on  inconsistencies  but \ndeclining to impose Rule 11 sanctions); see also Schwartz v. Esmark, Inc., No. 78-C-\n1909, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10878, at *4 (N.D. Ill. March 31, 1980) (noting that \n“plaintiff could not, in good faith, have so diametrically reversed his recollection and \nposition between the time of the filing of his original complaint and that of his \nsecond amended pleading” and striking paragraph from amended complaint). \nB. The Amended Complaint’s Search Allegations Directly Contradict Those in \nthe Original Complaint and Should be Stricken. \n \nPlaintiffs  have  not  simply  changed  their  legal  theory  or  reconciled  small \nvariations;  they  have  changed  their  story.  Plaintiffs no longer  allege  they were \nordered to remove their pants, or that they pulled down their pants for the alleged \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 14 of 21\nsearches.  Compare Compl.  ¶  115  (“Defendant  Officer  John  Doe  150,  who  was \nwearing rubber gloves, ordered Mr. Horse, Mr. Gonzalez, and three other detainees \nto remove their pants.”) with Am. Compl. ¶¶ 166–174. And in the initial complaint, \nHorse alleged John Doe 150 “put his finger into Mr. Horse’s rectum, through his \nunderwear,” Compl. ¶ 117 (emphasis added), “an inch deep…and wiggled it around \nfor several seconds,” id. ¶ 118. Now, Horse alleges “Defendant Officer John Doe \npatted  Mr.  Horse  down  and  then  jabbed  into  Mr.  Horse’s  rectum, through his \npants.” Am. Compl. ¶ 168 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs also no longer allege they \nwere searched while standing together in a line of five arrestees. Cf. Compl. ¶ 124 \n(“Defendant Officer John Doe 150 then moved down the line and subjected the other \nthree detainees there to similar treatment; Mr. Horse heard another detainee yelp).  \nSeveral other factual allegations that were included in plaintiffs’ Complaint \nwere removed from the First Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs no longer make the \nfollowing allegations:    \n  123. Defendant Officer John Doe 150 and other officers laughed \nat Mr. Gonzalez while this degrading search was performed. \n \n  124.  Defendant  Officer  John  Doe  150  did  not  change  gloves \nwhen he moved from one individual to the next. \n \n  135. The manual rectal searches were performed in the presence \nof several other detainees and approximately five to ten other MPD \nofficers, including at least one or two female officers.  \n \nCompl. [1]. \nPlaintiffs are undoubtedly aware of the significance of their allegations as \nthey initially pled them; in fact, plaintiffs capitalized on the inflammatory nature of \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 15 of 21\nthe allegations to garner publicity for their lawsuit, to the detriment of MPD. See, \ne.g., “Lawsuit Challenges Excessive Force, Manual Rectal Probing, and Denial of \nFood,  Water,  and  Toilets,  ACLU  (June  21,  2017),  available  at \nhttps://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-dc-sues-dc-police-false-arrests-free-speech-\nviolations-police-abuse-inauguration-day (accessed Mar. 12, 2018); “Lawsuit: Police \nLaughed While Rectally-Probing Inauguration Mass Arrest Group, Didn’t Change \nGloves,”  U.S.  News  &  World  Report  (June  21,  2017),  available  at \nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-06-21/lawsuit-police-laughed-while-\nrectally-probing-inauguration-mass-arrest-group-didnt-change-gloves  (accessed \nMar. 12, 2018). And the press releases issued by the plaintiffs announcing their \ncomplaint and amended complaint indicate plaintiffs are aware of the significance \nof the changes in their allegations. Compare “Lawsuit Challenges Excessive Force, \nManual Rectal Probing, and Denial of Food, Water, and Toilets,” ACLU (June 21, \n2017),  available at  https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-dc-sues-dc-police-false-arrests-\nfree-speech-violations-police-abuse-inauguration-day (accessed Mar. 12, 2018) with \n“ACLU-DC  Names 27  Police  Officers  and  Adds  10-Year-Old  Boy  as  Plaintiff  in \nInauguration  Day  Lawsuit,”  ACLU  (Jan.  3,  2018),  available  at \nhttps://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-dc-names-27-dc-police-officers-and-adds-10-year-old-\nboy-plaintiff-inauguration-day-lawsuit  (accessed  Mar.  24,  2018)  (describing  the \nnature  of  all  of  the  claims  in  plaintiffs’  First  Amended  Complaint  except  for \nplaintiffs’ search allegations, which are not mentioned in the press release).  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 16 of 21\nPlaintiffs abandoned their initial narrative—that they were lined up in a \ngroup of five, ordered to pull their pants down, and then subjected to humiliating, \npublic manual rectal searches by an officer who did not changed gloves between \nsearches—in lieu of one that would not be so easily disproven by the evidence (the \nBlue Plains video). As plaintiffs’ counsel admitted, “the video shows that not all of \nthe allegations made in the original complaint were accurate.” Email from Scott \nMichelman,  ACLU,  to  Amanda  Montee,  Matthew  Blecher,  and  Eric  Johnson, \nAssistant Attorneys General (Nov. 6, 2017) (Ex. F).  \nPlaintiffs have fundamentally changed their allegations. These differences \nare  not  “reconcilable  small variations”;  they  are  an attempt to  evade  the  video \nevidence  that  demonstrates  the  original  Complaint’s  allegations  were  not  mere \nembellishment or innocent misrecollection, but pure fabrication. Accordingly, the \nCourt should exercise its discretion to strike plaintiffs’ search-related allegations \nand dismiss Claim 16 with prejudice.  \nII.   In  the  Alternative,  The  Court  Should  Grant  Officer  John  Doe  Summary \nJudgment on Claim 16. \n \n  A. The Blue Plains Video Disproves Plaintiffs’ Excessive Force Allegations. \n   \n“[T]o  survive  a  Fourth  Amendment  challenge,  searches  must  be \nreasonable. This requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against \nthe invasion of the personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the \nscope  of  the  particular  intrusion,  the  manner  in  which  it  is  conducted,  the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Bell v. Wolfish, \n441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). In the Amended Complaint, plaintiff Horse alleges that \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 17 of 21\nthe search he underwent at the MPD Training Academy was unreasonable because \nOfficer John Doe “jabbed into Mr. Horse’s rectum, through his pants.” Am. Compl. ¶ \n168.  And  plaintiff  Gonzalez  alleges  that  Officer  John  Doe  “reached  inside  Mr. \nGonzalez’s  underwear  and  fondled  his  testicles,”  and  “put  his  finger  into  Mr. \nGonzalez’s rectum.” Id. at ¶¶ 170–73. However, video evidence recorded at the scene \ndisproves plaintiffs’ allegations.  \nThe search of Horse lasts only nineteen seconds. See Blue Plains video at \n5:12–5:32. The angle on the Blue Plains video captures Horse in profile. See id. \nWhen the officer pats down Horse’s back and backside, it is visible on the video. See \nid. The officer’s hand pats down Horse’s buttocks for only one second. See id at 5:30. \nIt is apparent from the video that Officer John Doe did not “jab” a finger into \nHorse’s rectum, through his pants. Compare id., with Am. Compl. ¶ 168. After \nviewing the video, no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.3 \nAlthough the entirety of Gonzalez’s search is longer in duration, Officer John \nDoe only patted down Gonzalez’s lower body for thirty-five seconds, a portion of \nwhich  included  Gonzalez  repositioning  himself.  Blue  Plains  video  at  8:50–9:25. \nWhen Officer John Doe pats down Gonzalez’s buttocks area, Officer John Doe is \nstanding  behind  Gonzalez  and  the  camera  view  is  taken  from  the  front.  Id.  \nGonzalez alleges that Officer John Doe “reached inside Mr. Gonzalez’s underwear.” \n                                            \n3   A brief review of basic human anatomy demonstrates the incredible nature of \nHorse’s  and  Gonzalez’s  claims  of  “rectal”  “jabbing.”  See Ex.  G,  HENRY  GRAY, \nANATOMY OF THE HUMAN BODY fig. 403 (rectum) (Warren H. Lewis, ed. 20th ed. \n1918), available at: http://www.bartleby.com/107/illus403.html (last visited Mar. 29, \n2018). Put simply, no reasonable jury could credit Horse’s and Gonzalez’s claims. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40   Filed 03/30/18   Page 18 of 21\nAm.  Compl.  ¶¶  171–72.  But in the  video  Officer  John  Doe’s  hand can be  seen \npatting down the groin and buttocks area from outside Gonzalez’s pants. See Blue \nPlains video at 9:13.  No reasonable jury could find for Gonzalez on his  Fourth \nAmendment claim based on the allegation that Officer John Doe reached inside his \nunderwear and inserted his finger into Gonzalez’s rectum.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Claim 16 of plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint \nshould be dismissed with prejudice or, in the alternative, this Court should grant \njudgment in favor of Officer John Doe on Claim 16. \nDated:  March 30, 2018.

District of Columbia, et al. (Civil Action \nNo. 17-1216 (ABJ)) \n \nDear Counsel: \n \nThe District of Columbia has investigated the allegations of plaintiffs Shay Horse \nand  Michael  “Milo”  Gonzalez  regarding  rectal  searches  contained  in  their \nComplaint, ¶¶ 113–28, 198–206, in Horse v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. \n17-1216 (ABJ). Video surveillance footage recorded at the facility where plaintiffs \nHorse and Gonzalez were processed does not support and, indeed, contradicts their \nallegations. Simply put, plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez were not subject to manual \nrectal searches by the District of Columbia. We invite you to review the footage for \nyourselves.  Once  you  have  done  so,  we  ask  that  plaintiffs  Horse  and  Gonzalez \nwithdraw their rectal search allegations, all claims and causes of action related to \nthose allegations, and any related discovery requests, including Interrogatory 3.  \n \nIn their Complaint, plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez assert that they were the subjects \nof rectal searches by an unnamed District of Columbia defendant at what they \nbelieve to be the MPD Training Academy on Blue Plains Drive, S.W., in a “training \narea that was set up to look like a mock street.” Compl. ¶¶ 113–14. Plaintiffs’ \ndescription of the location corresponds to the setting at the MPD Training Academy \nwhere  plaintiffs  Horse  and  Gonzalez  were  processed  and,  while  fully  clothed, \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 3 of 16\nSearch Allegations in Horse v. District of Columbia \nOctober 6, 2017 \nPage 2 \n \nreceived pat-down searches. No rectal search of them was conducted by any District \ndefendant.  \n \nThe video footage from the MPD Training Facility captures plaintiffs Horse and \nGonzalez from the time they arrived until their release on January 21, 2017. When \nyou watch that footage, you will see the following:  (1) plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez \ndid  not  remove  or  pull  down  their  pants  for  the  searches.  Cf. Compl.  ¶  115 \n(“Defendant Officer John Doe 150, who was wearing rubber gloves, ordered Mr. \nHorse,  Mr.  Gonzalez,  and  three  other  detainees  to  remove  their  pants.”);  (2) \nplaintiffs  Horse  and  Gonzalez  were  not  searched  in  a  line  with  three  other \ndetainees. Cf. Compl. ¶ 124 (“Officer John Doe 150 then moved down the line and \nsubjected the other three detainees there to similar treatment”); Shay Horse, ACLU \nPress Conference (June 21, 2017) (“[A] group of officers, maybe a dozen, lined up \nfive male detainees, including myself”); (3) “Officer John Doe 150” did not “grab[ ] \nMr. Horse’s testicles and yank[ ] on them.” Cf. Compl. ¶ 116; and (4) plaintiffs Horse \nand Gonzalez were not subject to a visual or physical rectal examination. Cf. Compl. \n¶¶ 117–22, 198, 201, 204. \n \nWe propose the Parties meet and confer in person at OAG on October 10, 2017, \nwhere we will make the video footage available for your review. Once an agreed-\nupon protective order is in place, the District then will produce one copy of the video \nfootage to counsel. We expect to have a copy of the footage ready to produce on \nOctober 13, 2017, and have enclosed a draft proposed stipulated protective order \nwith this letter. \n \nThe video footage establishes that the allegations in ¶¶ 115–26, 198, 201, and 204 of \nplaintiffs’ Complaint are unsupported and contrary to fact. Once you have had an \nopportunity to review the video footage, we request that plaintiffs withdraw those \nallegations and all related claims and discovery. Should plaintiffs not agree to do so \nby  1  p.m.  on  October  13,  2017,  the  District  will  pursue  all  its  available  legal \nremedies. \n \nPlease let us know when you are available to meet on October 10, 2017. \n \nSincerely, \n \nKARL A.

Spitzer, Esq. \nScott Michelman, Esq. \nShana Knizhnik, Esq. \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union Foundation \n  of the District of Columbia \n4301 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 434 \nWashington, D.C. 20008 \n \nRe:   Horse, et al. v. District of Columbia, et al. (Civil Action No. 17-1216 (ABJ)) \n \nCounsel: \n \nThe District of Columbia writes in response to plaintiffs’ proposed second set of \ninterrogatories  and  further  to  our  communications  about  the  unfounded  search \nallegations and claims made by plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez.  \n \nWe  are  surprised  by  your  proposed  Interrogatory  No.  1(b),  which  includes  a \nscreenshot from the Blue Plains Video1 and seeks the name and badge number of \nthe officer depicted, whom you identify as the officer who “performed searches of \nPlaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez” at Blue Plains. See Pls.’ Proposed Second Set of \nInterrog. to Def. District of Columbia, Interrog. No. 1(b). Our concerns are twofold.  \n \nFirst, any discovery related to the search claims in the Complaint (Claims 14–16) is \nnot relevant because those claims are unfounded. On October 6, 2017, we wrote to \ninform you that we investigated the search allegations made by Shay Horse and \nMichael “Milo” Gonzalez in the Complaint, see ¶¶ 113–28, 198–206, and found that \nthe video surveillance footage recorded at the facility where Mr. Horse and Mr. \nGonzalez were processed (the Blue Plains Video) contradicts their accounts. We \nprovided you the Blue Plains Video on October 17, 2017, subject to a Protective \n                                                           \n1   The image appears to have been taken at approximately 12:56. \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 9 of 16\nHorse, et al. v. District of Columbia, et al. \nNovember 6, 2017 \nPage 2 \n \nOrder [24]. We brought this matter to your attention and provided the video so that \nyou would have an opportunity review the evidence and remove the false allegations \nand claims from the Complaint. \n \nAs you undoubtedly saw on the video, Mr. Horse and Mr. Gonzalez did not remove, \nor pull down, their pants for the searches. Cf. Compl. ¶ 115 (“Defendant Officer \nJohn Doe 150, who was wearing rubber gloves, ordered Mr. Horse, Mr. Gonzalez, \nand three other detainees to remove their pants.”). They were not searched in a line \nwith three other detainees. Cf. Compl. ¶ 124 (“Officer John Doe 150 then moved \ndown the line and subjected the other three detainees there to similar treatment”); \nShay Horse, ACLU Press Conference (June 21, 2017) (“[A] group of officers, maybe a \ndozen, lined up five male detainees, including myself.”). And they were not subject \nto a visual or physical rectal examination. Cf. Compl. ¶¶ 117–22. \n \nAfter reviewing the video, on October 26, 2017, you notified the District that you \n“agree … that the factual allegations need to be amended” and that you “intend to \ndrop or modify several claims.” See E-mail from Scott Michelman to Amanda J. \nMontee, et al. (Oct. 26, 2017 14:57 EDT). Plaintiffs therefore agreed to withdraw \nInterrogatory No. 3, which sought the name of the officer who searched Horse and \nGonzalez at Blue Plains. See id. (“We agree to withdraw interrogatory 3 (referring \nto the search described in the original complaint).”). Yet plaintiffs now seek the very \nsame information sought by the interrogatory plaintiffs withdrew  less than two \nweeks  ago.  Given  your  agreement  to  amend  the  Complaint  and  withdraw \nInterrogatory No. 3, we see no good-faith basis for plaintiffs to continue to seek this \ninformation. Accordingly, we will not agree to plaintiffs’ proposed Interrogatory No. \n1(b).2 \n \nSecond, and of equal if not greater concern, is plaintiffs’ use of the Blue Plains Video \nin violation of the operative Protective Order [24]. The District provided plaintiffs \nwith  the  Blue  Plains  Video  (and,  subsequently,  with  materials  from  the \nMetropolitan Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) Investigation into \nplaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez’s allegations) for the limited purpose of considering \nthe District’s request that plaintiffs withdraw the search-related allegations and \nclaims and Interrogatory No. 3. To that end, the Parties agreed upon—and the \nCourt entered—a Stipulated Protective Order regarding the Blue Plains Video. The \nStipulated Protective Order prohibits copying the video, see Stipulated Protective \nOrder [24] ¶ 3, transmitting the video, see id. ¶ 2, and limits the video’s use to \nplaintiffs’ consideration of the District’s request that plaintiffs withdraw the search-\nrelated allegations and claims, see id. ¶ 5. Plaintiffs’ recent use of the Blue Plains \n                                                           \n2   The District will provide a more complete response to plaintiff’s discovery \nproposal in a separate communication. \n \n441 Fourth Street, N.W., Suite 630 South, Washington, D.C. 20001, (202) 724-7854, eric.johnson@dc.gov \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 10 of 16\nHorse, et al. v. District of Columbia, et al. \nNovember 6, 2017 \nPage 3 \n \nVideo—capturing an image from the video, transmitting that image via electronic \nmeans, and (ultimately) using the image in connection with a discovery request—\nviolates both the letter and spirit of the Stipulated Protective Order [24].  \n \nWe therefore request that you immediately return the Blue Plains Video and IAB \nmaterials, destroy all copies of any of these materials (including, but not limited to, \nany screenshots of the video), and certify when such destruction is complete.3 The \nDistrict also renews its request that plaintiffs withdraw claims 14–16 as well as the \nrelated allegations in the Complaint. Should plaintiffs not agree to do so by 1 p.m. \non November 8, 2017, the District will seek Court intervention. \n \nIf you would like to discuss these issues further, please do not hesitate to contact us. \n \nSincerely, \n \nKARL A. RACINE \nAttorney General for the District of Columbia \n   \nBy: /s/ Eric U. Johnson   \nEric U. Johnson \nAssistant Attorney General \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n3   We recognize that the District recently agreed to allow plaintiffs to maintain \npossession of the Blue Plains Video and IAB materials until plaintiffs amend the \nComplaint sometime after November 3, 2017. See E-mail (and e-mail chain) from \nAmanda J. Montee to Scott Michelman, et al. (Oct. 27, 2017, 14:10 EDT). However, \nthat  agreement  was  based  upon  plaintiffs’  representation  that  the  purpose  of \nmaintaining the materials was to aid plaintiffs in “deciding which claims to drop \nand  which claims to  modify  in  the  amended  complaint.” See E-mail  from  Scott \nMichelman to Amanda J. Montee, et al. (Oct. 27, 2017, 12:00 EDT). Given plaintiffs’ \naffirmative  use  of  the  Blue  Plains  Video  for  other  purposes,  and  the  actions \ndescribed above that we view as being in violation of the Stipulated Protective \nOrder  [24],  the  District  can  no  longer  agree  to  allow  plaintiffs  to  continue  to \nmaintain these materials. \n441 Fourth Street, N.W., Suite 630 South, Washington, D.C. 20001, (202) 724-7854, eric.johnson@dc.gov \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 11 of 16\n \n \n \nExhibit F \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 12 of 16\n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 13 of 16\n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 14 of 16\n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 15 of 16\n \n \n \nExhibit G \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 16 of 16\n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 40-2   Filed 03/30/18   Page 1 of 1\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n   \nHORSE, et al., \n   \n  Plaintiffs,   \n   \n  v.

Trump was sworn in as President of the United \nStates. Exercising their constitutional right to freedom of speech and assembly, people \nfrom all over the country took to the streets of the nation’s capital to express their \ndisapproval  of  his  policies.  Journalists  came  to  report  on  the  demonstrations.  Legal \nobservers came to document any violations of the demonstrators’ legal rights. \nDuring the course of demonstrations in the District of Columbia that day, several \nacts of vandalism occurred. In response, the District’s Metropolitan Police Department \n(MPD) rounded up and arrested hundreds of people, including people who engaged in no \nillegal activity, by chasing them and blocking streets so as to force them into a confined \narea (a “kettle”) on a D.C. street corner. During the chase and then while detaining \ndemonstrators for hours, police fired pepper spray, stingballs, and flash-bang grenades at \ncrowds of demonstrators, journalists, and legal observers, frequently without warning or \njustification. In the course of the roundup and subsequent processing of demonstrators, \npolice held detainees for hours without food, water, or access to toilets; handcuffed \ndetainees so tightly as to cause injury or loss of feeling; and subjected some detainees to \nmanual rectal jabbing. Much of MPD’s misconduct has been independently documented \nby the District of Columbia’s Office of Police Complaints. \nPlaintiffs are individuals who came to the District to express their views concerning \nthe inauguration, a photojournalist who covered the demonstrations, and a legal observer \nwho was present at the scene. Each of them suffered one or more of the constitutional, \nstatutory, and common law violations described here.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 3 of 51\n \n \nAmong the violations committed by MPD and its officers were the following: \nPlaintiff Horse, a photojournalist, was pepper-sprayed while he was taking a photograph \nof demonstrators and neither posing a threat nor breaking the law; he was subsequently \narrested even though he was not participating in any unlawful activity. Plaintiff Lagesse \nwas arrested even though she did not participate in any acts of vandalism and was not even \nclose enough to witness any; she was marching to express her views when she was caught \nup in the stampede created by MPD’s pursuit of the demonstrators and its use of chemical \nirritants. At one point, multiple MPD officers pepper-sprayed into a large and peaceful \ncrowd of individuals without warning and for no apparent reason other than they were \nstanding near the corner where MPD was detaining demonstrators; among the victims of \nthis attack were Plaintiff Ariel, a clearly identified legal observer, and Plaintiffs Frisbie-\nFulton and her ten-year-old son A.S., who were peaceful demonstrators. Pepper spray and \nother chemical irritants were used against all plaintiffs without justification and without \nwarning. While Plaintiffs Lagesse, Horse, and Gonzalez were detained on a D.C. street \ncorner and later in police transport vehicles, they were unreasonably denied food, water, \nand access to a toilet for periods ranging from 7 to 16 hours; arresting officers unnecessarily \nprolonged the arrest process in order to keep detainees in a state of anxiety, hunger, thirst, \nand other discomfort. Plaintiffs Lagesse and Horse were handcuffed so tightly that one of \nPlaintiff Lagesse’s wrists bled and Plaintiff Horse lost feeling in several fingers, some of \nwhich were numb for months afterward. During processing, Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez \nwere subjected to intrusive, humiliating, and unjustified manual rectal jabbing.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 4 of 51\n \n \nTo obtain compensation for their injuries and to vindicate their rights under the \nFirst, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, the D.C.

On  Inauguration  Day  2017,  MPD  officers  who  interacted  with \ndemonstrators were equipped with several types of chemical or other weapons, including: \na.  Oleoresin Capsicum spray dispensers, which resemble small fire \nextinguishers containing 14-48 ounces of solution, with a typical range of 25-\n30 feet. The solution, commonly known as pepper spray, produces a burning \nsensation on a person’s skin and in a person’s eyes and lungs, vision problems, \nand breathing problems including coughing and choking. \nb.  “Stingballs,” which are explosive devices that release smoke, rubber \npellets, and a chemical irritant within a radius of approximately 50 feet. \nc.  Smoke flares, which are explosive devices that release smoke. \nd.  Concussion grenades, which are devices that produce loud explosive \nnoises. \ne.  Flash-bang grenades, which are devices that produce loud explosive \nnoises and bright flashes of light. \nf.  Long range acoustic devices, or LRADs, which are devices that emit \nan excruciatingly loud tone. \nDemonstrators March Down 13th Street NW \n15.  On January 20, 2017, thousands of people demonstrated in the District of \nColumbia to express their opposition to the new President. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 8 of 51\n \n \n16.  The overwhelming majority of the demonstrators were peaceful and law-\nabiding. \n17.  Between 10 and 11 a.m. on January 20, hundreds of demonstrators walked \nsouth on 13th Street NW from Logan Circle toward the National Mall. \n18.  The  number  of  demonstrators  walking  down  13th  Street  NW  was \nsufficiently large that they took up two or three blocks. \n19.  Plaintiff Shay Horse was walking alongside the demonstrators in order to \nphotograph the demonstration for journalistic purposes. He intended to sell his photographs \ncommercially, and he had a well-founded expectation that he would be able to do so. \n20.  Mr. Horse was wearing dark jeans, a hooded sweatshirt with the hood down, \na leather jacket, and a camera around his neck. He carried a bag onto which he had affixed \nsilver duct tape to make the bag more identifiable. \n21.  Between 10 and 11 a.m. on January 20, some demonstrators engaged in acts \nof vandalism on or near 13th Street NW between Logan Circle and Franklin Square. \n22.  The  individuals  who  engaged  in  vandalism  were  dressed  in  all-black \nclothing with hoods over their heads and masks over their faces. \n23.  Mr. Horse was not wearing a hood or a mask. \nThe Police Assault \n24.  When demonstrators began to march down 13th Street NW from Logan \nCircle, MPD had approximately 100 officers present, including Defendant Cmdr. Keith \nDeville, along with approximately 10 police vans and five or six additional police vehicles. \n25.  Cmdr. Deville was the on-scene commander who directed the MPD officers \non the ground as they responded to the march. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 9 of 51\n \n \n26.  Cmdr. Deville, in turn, received orders from top MPD officials in MPD’s \ncommand center.  \n27.  Among the officials directing Cmdr. Deville from the command center was \nDefendant Asst. Chief Lamar Greene. \n28.  Defendant Chief Peter Newsham has acknowledged that he was stationed \nin the command center on January 20. \n29.  On information and belief, Chief Newsham himself was overseeing and \ndirecting the actions of Asst. Chief Green, Cmdr. Deville, and other top MPD officials as \nthey, in turn, directed MPD’s actions regarding the demonstrators who marched down 13th \nStreet NW between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on January 20. \n30.  MPD officers witnessed acts of vandalism on and around 13th Street NW \nand made Cmdr. Deville, Asst. Chief Greene and (on information and belief) Chief \nNewsham aware of these acts. \n31.  Cmdr. Deville, under the direction of Defendants Chief Newsham and Asst. \nChief Greene, did not order MPD officers to identify or apprehend individuals committing \nacts of vandalism. \n32.  Instead, approximately 15 minutes after demonstrators began to march \nsouth down 13th Street NW, and after a few acts of vandalism had been committed by a \nfew people, Cmdr. Deville declared to MPD officers that the march was a “riot” and \nordered MPD officers to stop the marchers from continuing further south. \n33.  Cmdr. Deville received the order to stop the march from Asst. Chief Greene \nat the command center, where (on information and belief) he received direction from Chief \nNewsham. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 10 of 51\n \n \n34.  Cmdr. Deville knew that not all of the individuals who were marching were \ncommitting acts of vandalism when he declared the march a “riot.” He was also aware that \nsome of the individuals walking down 13th Street NW were journalists photographing the \nmarch or otherwise documenting the march. \n35.  Throughout the time when demonstrators were moving south on 13th Street \nNW, both before and after acts of vandalism occurred, some individuals joined the march \nand others left it. Not all individuals who were part of the march were aware of the acts of \nvandalism that occurred. \n36.  Neither when Cmdr. Deville declared a “riot” nor at any time for the rest of \nthe day, did Cmdr. Deville or his supervisors — from Chief Newsham and Asst. Chief \nGreene to the officers on the ground — distinguish or attempt to distinguish between \nindividuals who were peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights and individuals \nwho were committing unlawful acts. \n37.  A  number  of  MPD  officers  had  ready  access  to  bullhorns  and  to \nloudspeakers on their vehicles. \n38.  Nonetheless, at no time did Chief Newsham, Asst. Chief Greene, Cmdr. \nDeville, or any other MPD official order that demonstrators be given a dispersal order, be \ngiven an opportunity to disperse, or be given a safe route to disperse. No order to disperse, \nopportunity to disperse, or safe route to disperse was ever provided. \n39.  Instead, Cmdr. Deville, under the direction of Defendants Chief Newsham \nand  Asst.  Chief  Greene,  ordered  that  MPD  officers  use  pepper  spray  against  the \ndemonstrators.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 11 of 51\n \n \n40.  Among MPD officers’ weapons for discharging pepper spray on January 20 \nwere large canisters that fire a steady stream of pepper spray as if from a small hose. \nOfficers refer to these weapons as “supersoakers.” \n41.  Cmdr. Deville told his officers: “any time you need pepper [spray], use it.” \n42.  A few minutes later, Cmdr. Deville, under the direction of Defendants Chief \nNewsham and Asst. Chief Greene, authorized the use of stingballs, which shoot out rubber \npellets and chemical irritants at people. \n43.  At their commanders’ orders, MPD officers used stingballs, “supersoakers” \nof pepper spray, and noise-emitting crowd-control devices against the demonstrators. \n44.  At least some of the time, officers fired chemical irritants at people without \nregard for whether these weapons were necessary to prevent unlawful conduct or subdue a \nperson who was resisting officers.   \nPlaintiff Horse Is Unjustifiably Pepper-Sprayed  \n45.  As  MPD  officers  confronted  demonstrators  at  Franklin  Square,  many \ndemonstrators and Mr. Horse moved away from the police down streets to the east and \nsouth of Franklin Square. \n46.  Plaintiff Horse continued to take photographs of the events, including \nphotographs of a few demonstrators in hoods and masks breaking a storefront window and \na photograph of Defendant Ofcr. Michael Murphy as he pepper-sprayed demonstrators.  \n47.  Although Ofcr. Murphy had observed Mr. Horse with a large, professional-\nquality camera around his neck taking photographs, Ofcr. Murphy pepper-sprayed Mr. \nHorse without warning.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 12 of 51\n \n \n48.  At the time Ofcr. Murphy pepper-sprayed Mr. Horse, Mr. Horse was not \nengaged in any unlawful or dangerous activity. He was not disobeying any orders by any \npolice officer. \n49.  As a result of the pepper spray, Mr. Horse choked and gasped for breath. As \nthe pepper spray flooded his eyes, they began to burn. \n50.  As Mr. Horse and a number of demonstrators ran away from the police \nassault, MPD officers confronted them on the streets immediately east and/or south of \nFranklin Square and discharged pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, concussion grenades, \nstingballs, smoke flares, and LRADs at demonstrators and other individuals in the vicinity, \nincluding Plaintiff Horse.  \n51.  Using pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, concussion grenades, stingballs, \nsmoke flares, and LRADs, MPD officers chased Mr. Horse and many of the demonstrators \nback toward Franklin Square. \nPlaintiff Lagesse Marches Down 13th Street NW \n52.  Throughout  demonstrators’  chaotic  flight  from  the  police,  some \ndemonstrators left the Franklin Square area, while other individuals were still arriving to \ndemonstrate.   \n53.  Plaintiff  Elizabeth  Lagesse  began  marching  later  than  most  of  the \ndemonstrators.  She  walked  south  down  13th  Street  NW  toward  Franklin  Square \napproximately thirty minutes after most of the demonstrators had begun marching. \n54.  Ms. Lagesse was wearing a black and white T-shirt, a bright-colored inner \njacket, and a long grey rain jacket that she removed as she marched, and she was carrying \na multi-colored bag. She did not wear a hood or mask. Having encountered overzealous \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 13 of 51\n \n \npolice officers using pepper spray at prior demonstrations, Ms. Lagesse brought a bandana \nand a pair of lab safety goggles she owned. They were not on her face as she walked south \ndown 13th Street NW.  \n55.  Ms. Lagesse did not engage in or witness any acts of vandalism. \nContinued Police Assault and Mass Detentions \n56.  On or near 13th Street NW, MPD officers deployed pepper spray and/or \nstingballs against individuals, including Mr. Horse and Ms. Lagesse, without warning or a \ndispersal order, often in circumstances where the officers faced no threat to themselves or \nto public safety or disobedience of any commands they had given. \n57.  The pepper spray caused Mr. Horse’s and Ms. Lagesse’s eyes to burn.  \n58.  Ms. Lagesse put on her safety goggles and pulled her bandana from around \nher neck to cover her mouth in an attempt to protect herself from the pepper spray that \nMPD officers were discharging. \n59.  Although neither Ms. Lagesse nor Mr. Horse had committed any unlawful \nact, the police conduct put each of them in fear for their safety, causing them to run away \nfrom the police, ultimately heading north on 14th Street NW. \n60.  Cmdr. Deville, under the direction of Chief Newsham and Asst. Chief \nGreene, ordered MPD officers to block numerous alternative egress routes in order to force \nMr. Horse, Ms. Lagesse, and many other demonstrators to flee north up 14th Street NW \nand then east on L Street NW to the corner of 12th and L Streets NW. Defendants \nNewsham, Greene, and Deville thus caused MPD officers to act in a coordinated manner \nto funnel individuals to that location. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 14 of 51\n \n \n61.  Cmdr. Deville, under the direction of Chief Newsham and Asst. Chief \nGreene, ordered MPD officers to establish a blockade at the corner of 12th and L Streets \nNW to trap individuals proceeding east on L Street NW. \n62.  Defendant  Ofcrs.  Michael  Howden,  Gregory  Rock,  Daniel  Thau,  and \nMelvin Washington were among the MPD officers who established the blockade. \n63.  Sgt. Anthony Alioto was among the MPD officers who supervised the \nestablishment of the blockade. \n64.  Although some individuals on L Street NW managed to escape by evading \nthe MPD blockade before it closed in, Ms. Lagesse, Mr. Horse, and most of the other \nindividuals on L Street NW were detained by police at the northwest corner of 12th and L \nStreets NW and on L Street NW itself. \n65.  MPD officers detained more than 200 individuals in the cordoned area (the \n“kettle”) they had created at 12th and L Streets NW. \n66.  Neither  the  MPD  officials  who  ordered  the  creation  of  the  kettle  — \nincluding  Defendants  Newsham,  Greene  and  Deville  —  nor  the  MPD  officers  who \nestablished the kettle — including Ofcrs. Howden, Rock, Thau, Alioto, and Washington \n— took any actions to try to ensure that only individuals whom they had probable cause to \nbelieve had committed crimes would be detained in the kettle. \n67.  Chief Newsham (on information and belief), Asst. Chief Greene, and Cmdr. \nDeville  were  aware  that  the  size  of  the  march  had  fluctuated  dramatically  since \ndemonstrators left Logan Circle, and they were aware that numerous demonstrators had \njoined or left the march throughout its disorganized progress until the point at which a \nnumber of demonstrators were forced into the kettle and prevented from leaving. Chief \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 15 of 51\n \n \nNewsham, Asst. Chief Greene, Cmdr. Deville, and the officers involved in forming the \nkettle had no ability to identify which, if any, of the kettled individuals had committed \ncrimes. Chief Newsham, Asst. Chief Greene, and Cmdr. Deville knew that neither they nor \ntheir officers had the ability to identify which, if any, of the kettled individuals had \ncommitted crimes. \n68.  As Cmdr. Deville subsequently testified regarding the decision to detain \ndemonstrators, “I wasn’t differentiating who was demonstrating and who was rioting.”  \n69.  Chief Newsham later acknowledged to the Washington Post that his officers \nstrategically maneuvered the demonstrators to trap them in the kettle. The MPD official in \ncharge at the scene, Cmdr. Deville, was in constant contact with the MPD command center, \nwhere Defendant Newsham was stationed throughout the day. On information and belief, \nDefendant Newsham ordered or approved trapping demonstrators in the kettle at the time \nthis action took place, and/or approved the continued detention and arrest of the kettled \ndemonstrators despite his awareness that the police had no ability to identify which, if any, \nof these individuals had committed crimes. \n70.  Because  of  Defendants’  intentional  and  coordinated  action  in  chasing \nindividuals north on 14th Street NW, then east on L Street NW, while driving them on by \nusing pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, concussion grenades, and stingballs, and blocking \ntheir egress via alternate routes, the individuals who were trapped in the kettle at 12th and \nL Streets NW were not there by virtue of having acted unlawfully but merely because they \nwere present on particular downtown D.C. streets on the morning of January 20 and then \ntried to flee when police chased and assaulted them. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 16 of 51\n \n \n71.  Mr. Horse did not engage in any vandalism or other unlawful activity on the \nstreets of Washington, D.C. on January 20, 2017. He did not encourage anyone to do so or \ncheer for anyone who did so. He was not dressed the same as anyone who did so. \n72.  Mr. Horse was detained in the kettle without probable cause and merely \nbecause he was exercising his First Amendment right to document the demonstrations as a \nphotojournalist, was present on particular downtown D.C. streets on the morning of \nJanuary 20, and tried to run away when police officers chased and assaulted him. \n73.  Ms. Lagesse did not engage in any vandalism or other unlawful activity on \nthe streets of Washington, D.C. on January 20, 2017. She did not encourage anyone to do \nso or cheer for anyone who did so. She was not dressed the same as anyone who did so. \n74.  Ms. Lagesse was detained in the kettle without probable cause and merely \nbecause she wished to exercise her First Amendment right to demonstrate peacefully in \nopposition to the Inauguration, was present on particular downtown D.C. streets on the \nmorning of January 20, and tried to run away when police officers chased and assaulted \nher. \nIn the Kettle \n75.  The kettle of detainees at 12th and L Streets NW was formed at about 10:45 \na.m. \n76.  Plaintiffs Horse and Lagesse were detained there along with approximately \n200 other individuals, one of whom was Plaintiff Milo Gonzalez. \n77.  Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez were detained in the kettle for \nhours. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 17 of 51\n \n \n78.  Defendant  Cmdr.  Deville,  under  the  direction  of  Defendants  Chief \nNewsham and Asst. Chief Greene, declared that all the detainees were under arrest and \nordered that no one was to leave the kettle. Defendants Ofcr. Howden and Sgt. Alioto were \namong those primarily responsible for ensuring that the detainees could not leave. \n79.  While individuals were detained in the kettle, MPD officers repeatedly \ndeployed pepper spray and stingballs containing chemical irritants against individuals or \ngroups of individuals in the kettle, including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez.  \n80.  Many of these deployments came without warning or dispersal order—\nindeed, the individuals in the kettle were physically prevented from dispersing—and were \ncarried out when there was no threat to officer or public safety or any disobedience of \npolice orders on the part of the detainees. For instance: \na.  Defendant Ofcr. Washington discharged pepper spray into the crowd of \nindividuals,  including  Plaintiffs  Horse,  Lagesse,  and  Gonzalez,  being \nherded into the kettle, even though the detainees were not disobeying orders \nor posing a threat. \nb.  Defendant Ofcr. Thau discharged pepper spray into the crowd of kettled \nindividuals, including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez, as detainees \nretreated from the line of officers on the east side of the kettle and at a time \nwhen detainees were not disobeying orders or posing a threat. \nc.  Defendant Ofcr. Thau discharged a stingball into the crowd of kettled \nindividuals, including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez, as detainees \nretreated from the line of officers on the east side of the kettle and at a time \nwhen detainees were not disobeying orders or posing a threat. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 18 of 51\n \n \nd.  Defendant Ofcr. Rock discharged a stingball into the crowd of kettled \nindividuals, including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez, as detainees \nretreated from the line of officers on the east side of the kettle and at a time \nwhen detainees were not disobeying orders or posing a threat. \n81.  Defendant Ofcr. Howden remarked to his supervisor that the police had \nbeen “extremely wild” with their use of pepper spray. \n82.  Although Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez are unsure whether they \nwere targeted personally by any of the officers’ uses of pepper spray or stingballs, the tight \npacking of the detainees into a small space ensured that everyone in the kettle would feel \nthe effects of spray directed at the crowd of detainees.  \n83.  The pepper spray and other chemical irritants were so thick that at times \nthey created a haze over the kettle and all the individuals detained there. \n84.  The repeated deployment of chemical irritants caused panic among the \nkettled detainees, including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez, because they were \nhaving difficulty breathing, were tightly pressed together with other detainees, and could \nnot escape the kettle. \n85.  Each time Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez were hit with pepper spray or other \nchemical irritants, their eyes began to burn painfully, and they began to cough and to gasp \nfor breath. \n86.  Because Plaintiff Lagesse had goggles on by this time, her eyes were \nprotected, but the pepper spray caused her to cough, to have difficulty breathing, and to \nexperience a burning sensation on the uncovered part of her face. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 19 of 51\n \n \n87.  Defendants Asst. Chief Robert Alder, Cmdr. Jeffery Carroll, and Lt. Paul \nNiepling supervised the continued maintenance of the kettle. These officials continued to \ncommunicate with and receive orders from the MPD command center, where Defendant \nChief Newsham was overseeing the operation. \n88.  During the many hours that Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez were \ndetained  in  the  kettle,  MPD  officers,  under  the  supervision  and  direction  of  Chief \nNewsham, Asst. Chief Alder, Cmdr. Carroll, and Lt. Niepling, failed to provide them with \nfood, water, or access to a toilet. \n89.  Many demonstrators, including Ms. Lagesse and Mr. Gonzalez, specifically \nrequested food, water, and/or access to a toilet. \n90.  While the detainees were kettled, several MPD officers threw edible food \nin a garbage can in view of the detainees, including Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez, to taunt \nthem. Mr. Gonzalez specifically asked the officers for the food that they were throwing \naway, and they refused to provide it. The officers laughed at Mr. Gonzalez as they threw \ntheir food away. \n91.  Hungry, Mr. Horse and Mr. Gonzalez both resorted to rummaging in a city \ntrashcan for the food the officers had discarded. \n92.  One MPD officer made clear to the detainees that no toilets would be made \navailable by stating in response to one detainee’s request that she should “shit [her] pants” \nto prove she needed a toilet. \n93.  Having no other place to urinate, some of the demonstrators urinated on the \nstreet or against the side of buildings. Some demonstrators rummaged in the trash for empty \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 20 of 51\n \n \nbottles in which to urinate. One demonstrator crouched against the side of a building and \ndefecated into a paper bag.  \n94.  Mr. Gonzalez badly needed to use a toilet, but, fearing that he could be \ncharged with public urination, did not dare to urinate on the street. \n95.  Holding his bladder was painful for Mr. Gonzalez. \n96.  One officer taunted Mr. Gonzalez, saying “If you wanted to go to the \nbathroom, you shouldn’t have gotten arrested.”  \n97.  Within 30 to 45 minutes of the formation of the kettle, by 11:30 a.m., MPD \nhad prisoner vans and processing officers at the scene and was ready for the processing of \ndetainees.  \n98.  Nonetheless, the handcuffing of detainees and placing them into vehicles \nfor transport to detention facilities stretched on for hours, with some of the detainees, \nincluding Plaintiff Lagesse, remaining at the corner of 12th and L Streets NW until the late \nafternoon and others, including Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez, remaining until after sunset.  \n99.  The gap in time between the point at which MPD was prepared to take \ndetainees into formal custody and the point at which the detainees were actually processed \nreflects that MPD officers, under the supervision and direction of Chief Newsham, Asst. \nChief Alder, Cmdr. Carroll, and Lt. Niepling, purposefully conducted the arrest process \nunnecessarily slowly in order to maximize the detainees’ discomfort. \nBystanders and Legal Observers Are Pepper-Sprayed \n100.  Plaintiffs Gwen Frisbie-Fulton and her ten-year-old son A.S. were also \npresent at the intersection of 12th and L Streets NW in the early afternoon of January 20. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 21 of 51\n \n \n101.  Plaintiffs Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. have engaged together in a variety of \ndemonstrations over the years. Ms. Frisbie-Fulton, a single mother, has a strong sense of \nsocial responsibility, having worked for over two decades with non-profit organizations \nthat help poor and marginalized communities. She currently works at a food bank; she has \npreviously served as co-director of a homeless shelter and before that was employed at an \norganization supporting survivors of domestic violence. She has been active in public \ndemonstrations  for  approximately  twenty  years  in  order  to  speak  out  against  social \ninjustice. After A.S. became old enough, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton began bringing A.S.  to \npeaceful demonstrations in order to expose him to important issues of public concern, to \nillustrate the power of peaceful political protest, and to educate him about his First \nAmendment rights.  \n102.  Over the years, A.S. has attended a few dozen protests with his mother and \nhas come to feel strongly about expressing his political opinions. Among the causes for \nwhich Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. have demonstrated together are racial justice, economic \njustice, and environmental protection. Ms. Frisbie-Fulton takes care to be keenly aware of \nher surroundings when she is with her son at a demonstration so that she can avoid exposing \nhim to any risk of harm. \n103.  A.S. followed the 2016 election closely, asking his mother to be allowed to \nstay up past his bedtime to watch the presidential debates and to follow the election returns. \nA.S. was strongly opposed to candidate Donald Trump because of his hostile views toward \na variety of groups, especially immigrants, and because A.S. thinks that Trump said terrible \nthings during the campaign. A.S. was deeply disappointed and concerned for the future of \nthe country when Donald Trump was elected.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 22 of 51\n \n \n104.  As Inauguration Day approached, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton wanted to come to \nWashington, D.C. to protest, in particular by attending the Women’s March on the day \nafter the inauguration. Ms. Frisbie-Fulton also wanted to show A.S. how citizens of a \ndemocracy can respond peacefully and constructively to an election result they disagree \nwith: by exercising their First Amendment right to protest.  Because of his own strong \nfeelings of opposition to Donald Trump, A.S. decided, together with his mother, that he \nwould join her in protesting the inauguration. \n105.  Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. traveled to D.C. with a number of their friends \nfrom their tight-knit community in North Carolina. \n106.  On January 20, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. had spent about three hours \nparticipating in various peaceful demonstrations around Washington, D.C. when Ms. \nFrisbie-Fulton learned via text message in the early afternoon that a friend from their \nhometown had been detained by police at the corner of 12th and L Streets NW. Ms. Frisbie-\nFulton and A.S. were three blocks away and decided to walk to the intersection to check \non their friend. \n107.  Ms. Frisbie-Fulton was wearing a black windbreaker and jeans. A.S. was \nwearing a gray sweater, jeans, a red bandana, and a gray Star Wars hat. Both Ms. Frisbie-\nFulton’s and A.S.’s faces were uncovered, and neither was wearing a hood or mask. \n108.  Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. arrived at the southeast corner of 12th and L \nStreets NW at approximately 1:00 p.m. They saw the group of detainees kettled on the \nnorthwest corner of the intersection. A large group of bystanders, protestors, and legal \nobservers had gathered outside the kettle on the south side of the intersection of 12th and \nL Streets NW.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 23 of 51\n \n \n109.  The south side of the intersection was cordoned off by yellow police tape \nand blocked by a row of police motorcycles and bicycles. In the intersection, and extending \nwest on L Street NW, a row of MPD officers lined up facing south towards the crowd. \nAdditional MPD officers were lined up behind the first police line. \n110.  After  about  five  minutes,  Ms.  Frisbie-Fulton  and  A.S.  moved  to  the \nsouthwest corner of the intersection. From there, A.S. saw their friend in the kettle and \nboosted himself up by holding onto a streetsign in order to wave at their friend.  \n111.  Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. were present at the intersection of 12th and L \nStreets NW for approximately 45 minutes.  \n112.  Plaintiff Judah Ariel was also present at the intersection of 12th and L \nStreets NW.  \n113.  He had started working as a legal observer at 6:30 a.m. on January 20 at \nvarious demonstrations throughout the District. He was dressed in a dark green jacket and \nblue jeans with a blue and red backpack, and he was wearing the distinctive bright neon \ngreen baseball cap commonly worn by some legal observers to identify themselves. He \nwas not wearing a hood or mask.  \n114.  At approximately 1:30 p.m., Mr. Ariel was walking east from McPherson \nSquare on K Street NW. \n115.  Because Mr. Ariel had heard from another legal observer about police \nactivity in the area of 12th and L Streets NW, he walked north on 12th Street NW toward \nthat intersection to see if he could be of use as a legal observer there. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 24 of 51\n \n \n116.  Mr. Ariel joined a crowd of people at the southeast corner of 12th and L \nStreets NW, outside the kettle. The crowd included multiple legal observers along the \nsidewalk, clearly identifiable by their bright neon green hats. \n117.  Mr. Ariel observed the kettled group of detainees surrounded by police at \nthe northwest corner of the intersection. \n118.  Many members of the crowd outside the kettle shouted at the police to \ndemand the release of the people being detained.  \n119.  While Mr. Ariel, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton, and A.S. were present, neither they \nnor any of the other individuals outside the kettle menaced, threatened, or assaulted the \npolice or their vehicles.  \n120.  At approximately 1:45 p.m., suddenly and without warning or a dispersal \norder, Defendants Lt. Michael Whiteside, Ofcr. Dennis Baldwin, Ofcr. Courtney Flash, \nOfcr. Timothy Steffes, Ofcr. Leonard Roccato, Ofcr. Bruce Baskerville, Ofcr. Diane \nBrooks, Ofcr. Phokham Vongkeo, Ofcr. Ferney Dennis, Ofcr. Kenneth Parker, and Ofcr. \nSequita Williams began to pepper-spray the people outside the kettle, including Mr. Ariel \non the south side of L Street NW. \n121.  When the pepper-spraying began, there was no threat to public or officer \nsafety, and none of the individuals in the crowd outside the kettle — including Mr. Ariel, \nMs. Frisbie-Fulton, and A.S. — was disobeying police orders. \n122.  Defendants Lt. Michael Whiteside and Sgt. Sean Hill walked behind the \nline of officers speaking to them moments before the spraying began. This conduct, in \ncombination with the coordinated action by multiple officers, reflects that Defendants Lt. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 25 of 51\n \n \nWhiteside and Sgt. Hill ordered the pepper-spraying of bystanders, despite the absence of \na threat to officer or public safety or disobedience of any officer’s command. \n123.  Defendants Ofcrs. Baldwin, Flash, Steffes, Roccato, Baskerville, Brooks, \nVongkeo, Dennis, Parker, and Williams moved forward down 12th Street NW, advancing \non the retreating crowd, continuing to deploy pepper spray indiscriminately on people in \nthe crowd. \n124.  One of these officers held his spray gun in front of him, sweeping the spray \nback and forth across the crowd. \n125.  Mr. Ariel coughed and felt his lungs and eyes burn from the spray. \n126.  Mr. Ariel covered his mouth with a cloth but a few seconds later, he began \nto choke. \n127.  Fearing for his safety, Mr. Ariel fled. He felt that he was on the verge of \npassing out. \n128.  As soon as Ms. Frisbie-Fulton saw the pepper-spraying begin, she feared \nfor A.S.’s safety and her own and so told to A.S. that it was time to go. A.S. hopped down \nfrom the streetsign he had been holding onto and began to hurry ahead of his mother west \non L Street NW away from the intersection where the officers were pepper-spraying the \ncrowd. \n129.  Without warning or provocation, a line of police officers, including Ofcr. \nJoseph Masci and Ofcr. Aulio Angulo, rushed forward. Ofcrs. Masci and Angulo collided \nwith A.S., knocking him to the ground.  \n130.  Defendants Lt. Michael Whiteside and Sgt. Sean Hill walked behind the \nline of officers speaking to them moments before the charge. This conduct, in combination \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 26 of 51\n \n \nwith the coordinated action by multiple officers, reflects that Defendants Lt. Whiteside and \nSgt. Hill ordered the charge into nonviolent protestors, despite the absence of a threat to \nofficer or public safety or disobedience of any officer’s command. \n131.  A.S. felt his ribs scrape against the curb of the sidewalk as he hit the ground. \n132.  Ms. Frisbie-Fulton instinctively threw her body on top of her son, and she \nfelt herself pushed from behind as police and demonstrators collided and became tangled. \n133.  Scared and confused why he had been assaulted while trying to flee, A.S. \nbegan to cry. From his mother’s arms at the bottom of the pile of people, he hoped the \nofficers would hear him and permit them to leave. \n134.  As she tried to round her back to create space to protect A.S. from being \ncrushed under her, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton felt terror at the possibility that her son could be \ninjured or that she could be injured and unable to see him to safety. \n135.  After approximately half a minute, people began to stand up from the crush \nof bodies, and Ms. Frisbie-Fulton managed to stand up. She picked up A.S., who was \nsobbing, and looked for an escape route. \n136.  L Street NW was clear to the west except for a group of police officers. Ms. \nFrisbie-Fulton asked the officers whether she and A.S. could leave in that direction, but an \nofficer responded that she could not and chastised Ms. Frisbie-Fulton, “You shouldn’t have \ncome here with your child.” \n137.  From behind her, an MPD officer tapped Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and told her to \nfollow him. Carrying A.S., she complied. The officer led Ms. Frisbie-Fulton back toward \nthe intersection of 12th and L Streets NW, moving through the line of officers, whom he \nasked to let the pair pass. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 27 of 51\n \n \n138.  Soon, however, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. became separated from the \nofficer who had tried to help them. Other officers, including Lt. Whiteside and Ofcrs. \nBaldwin, Flash, Steffes, Roccato, Baskerville, Brooks, Vongkeo, Dennis, Parker, and \nWilliams, continued to pepper-spray the retreating crowd. Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. \nattempted to flee south on 12th Street NW with the rest of the crowd. \n139.  The street was clouded with pepper spray. \n140.  As they ran, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton inhaled pepper spray from the officers’ \nbarrage and began to cough and choke. She felt unable to carry A.S. any further.  \n141.  Another demonstrator indicated his willingness to help, so Ms. Frisbie-\nFulton handed A.S., terrified and crying, to the demonstrator, who carried him further down \n12th Street NW away from the officers as Ms. Frisbie-Fulton struggled to keep up. \n142.  Pepper spray landed on A.S.’s Star Wars winter hat. A.S. felt his throat \nclogged from either his own crying or the effects of the pepper spray, and he began to \ncough uncontrollably.   \n143.  Both Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. feared losing each other in the crowd. At \none point, A.S. lost sight of his mother and became terrified. \n144.  Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. were able to reunite at the end of the block. \nThey hurried away from the area as A.S. continued to cough. \nThe Formal Arrests \n145.  Defendant Asst. Chief Greene ordered the formal arrests of Plaintiffs Horse, \nLagesse, and Gonzalez, which took place after they had been detained for several hours. \nDefendant Ofcr. Harvy Hinostroza took Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez into formal custody. \nDefendant Ofcr. Borgardus took Plaintiff Lagesse into formal custody. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 28 of 51\n \n \n146.  When  Mr.  Horse  was  formally  arrested,  Defendant  Ofcr.  Hinostroza \nhandcuffed him using zipties so excessively tightly that he lost feeling in some of the \nfingers on both of his hands. \n147.  Mr. Horse complained to Ofcr. Hinostroza that the zipties were painfully \ntight, but Ofcr. Hinostroza refused to remove them, explaining that the zipties were not \nsupposed to be comfortable.  \n148.  Mr. Horse’s zipties were not removed for approximately three hours. \n149.  When Ms. Lagesse was arrested, Defendant Ofcr. Borgardus handcuffed her \nusing zipties so excessively tightly that one of her wrists was cut and began to bleed.  \n150.  Ms. Lagesse complained to Ofcr. Borgardus that the zipties were painfully \ntight, but he refused to remove them. \n151.  Ms. Lagesse’s zipties were not removed for approximately two hours. \n152.  Mr. Horse was detained in the kettle for approximately 7 hours. \n153.  By the time Mr. Horse was formally arrested and transported to a detention \nfacility, he had gone approximately 9-10 hours without access to a toilet. \n154.  Mr. Horse was not given food or drink until later in the evening; he was \ndetained an approximate total of 10-11 hours without being provided food or drink. \n155.  Ms. Lagesse was detained on the street for approximately 5-6 hours. \n156.  By the time Ms. Lagesse was formally arrested, transported to a detention \nfacility, and had her belongings inventoried, she had gone approximately 7-8 hours without \naccess to a toilet. \n157.  The toilet to which Ms. Lagesse was finally given access had no toilet paper. \nSeveral of the women detained with her asked for toilet paper but none was provided.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 29 of 51\n \n \n158.  Ms. Lagesse was not given access to water until late that night; she was \ndetained an approximate total of 11-12 hours without water. \n159.  Ms. Lagesse did not receive food at the detention facility until the early \nhours of the following morning; she was detained an approximate total of 13-16 hours \nbefore she was given food. \n160.  Mr. Gonzalez was detained on the street for approximately 7 hours. \n161.  By the time Mr. Gonzalez was formally arrested, transported to a detention \nfacility, and given the opportunity to use a toilet, he had gone approximately 9-10 hours \nwithout access to a toilet. \n162.  By the time he was allowed to urinate, Mr. Gonzalez was in pain from \nhaving held his urine for so long.  \n163.  When Mr. Gonzalez was allowed to use a portable toilet, MPD officers held \nthe door open and watched him urinate. They rushed Mr. Gonzalez out of the toilet before \nhe had finished emptying his bladder. \n164.  Mr. Gonzalez was not given food or drink until later in the evening; he was \ndetained an approximate total of 10-11 hours without being provided food or drink.  \n165.  Neither the officials in charge of the kettle and/or the arrests — Defendants \nChief Newsham, Asst. Chief Greene, Asst. Chief Alder, Cmdr. Carroll, Cmdr. Deville, and \nLt. Niepling — nor arresting officers Defendants Hinostroza and Borgardus took any \nactions to ensure that only individuals whom they had probable cause to believe had \ncommitted crimes would be handcuffed and transported to detention facilities. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 30 of 51\n \n \nThe Rectal Searches \n166.  After Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez were arrested, they were detained at the \nMetropolitan Police Academy on Blue Plains Drive SW, off I-295 near the Maryland state \nline. \n167.  MPD officers took them inside the facility to what appeared to be an officer-\ntraining area that was set up to look like a mock street. There each of them was subjected \nto a search. \n168.  Defendant Officer John Doe patted Mr. Horse down and then jabbed into \nMr. Horse’s rectum, through his pants. \n169.  As Defendant Officer John Doe pushed his finger into Mr. Horse’s rectum, \nhe ordered Mr. Horse not to flinch. \n170.  Several minutes later, Defendant Officer John Doe patted Mr. Gonzalez \ndown and ordered him to spread his legs, then to spread them again, wider. \n171.  Defendant Officer John Doe then reached inside Mr. Gonzalez’s underwear \nand fondled his testicles.   \n172.  Defendant Officer John Doe reached inside Mr. Gonzalez’s underwear and \nput his finger into Mr. Gonzalez’s rectum. \n173.  As the Defendant Officer John Doe jabbed into Mr. Gonzalez’s rectum, he \nordered Mr. Gonzalez not to resist.  \n174.  No officer had reason to believe that Mr. Horse or Mr. Gonzalez possessed \ncontraband. No contraband was found on either Mr. Horse or Mr. Gonzalez. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 31 of 51\n \n \nPlaintiff Horse’s Injuries  \n175.  As  a  result  of  Defendants’  unjustified  use  of  pepper  spray  and  other \nchemical irritants, Plaintiff Horse suffered severe pain as his eyes burned from the pepper \nspray. Pepper spray remained in his hair throughout his detention, which lasted more than \n24 hours; every time his long hair touched his face, it caused a burning sensation and \ncoughing. Mr. Horse had a rash on his scalp for a week after his arrest. Mr. Horse suffered \nemotional distress from the panic at being trapped and unable to breathe while he was \npepper-sprayed during the kettle. \n176.  As a result of his arrest without probable cause and in response to his \nexercise of his First Amendment rights, Mr. Horse was detained for approximately 33 \nhours. \n177.  Because Mr. Horse’s arrest and detention led to the confiscation of his \nphotographs and camera for approximately two months, Mr. Horse lost income because he \nwas unable to sell his photographs of the January 20 demonstrations in a timely manner \nand did not have the equipment he needed to cover other newsworthy protests in the weeks \nfollowing his arrest.  \n178.  As  a  result  of  the  application  of  excessively  tight  zipties,  Mr.  Horse \nexperienced pain in his hands and lost feeling in several fingers on both hands. Several \nfingers on his left hand remained numb for more than four months after his arrest. Because \nof the numbness, Mr. Horse has had difficulty with important daily tasks, including typing \non a keyboard and operating his camera.  Mr. Horse had scarring on his left wrist from the \nzipties for more than two months after the arrest.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 32 of 51\n \n \n179.  As a result of the denial of food, water, and access to a toilet, Mr. Horse \nexperienced hunger, thirst, discomfort, and anxiety. \n180.  As a result of Defendants’ manual  rectal  jabbing, Mr. Horse suffered \nhumiliation, anxiety, and emotional distress. He feels as if he has been raped. Mr. Horse’s \nanus was sore for a day or two after the intrusion. Mr. Horse has felt irritable and withdrawn \nfrom other people, and he has found it harder to trust and confide in other people. The \nemotional distress has negatively affected Mr. Horse’s relationships, including impinging \non his sex drive and performance. Mr. Horse remains haunted by what he experienced. \n181.  As a result of the defendants’ conduct described above, particularly the \nkettling and the rectal jabbing, Mr. Horse has suffered bouts of anxiety and has had \ndifficulty sleeping since January 20. He suffers from nightmares filled with violent imagery \nand wakes up approximately  every three hours, often in a panicked state. Covering \ndemonstrations—a crucial part of Mr. Horse’s job—heightens his anxiety as he remembers \nwhat happened to him on January 20.   \nPlaintiff Lagesse’s Injuries \n182.  As  a  result  of  Defendants’  unjustified  use  of  pepper  spray  and  other \nchemical irritants, Plaintiff Lagesse coughed, had difficulty breathing, and experienced a \nburning sensation on her face and in her eyes. Ms. Lagesse also suffered emotional distress \nfrom the panic at being trapped and unable to breathe when she was pressed in a crush of \npeople and pepper-sprayed while being detained in the kettle. \n183.  As a result of her exposure to pepper spray, the skin on Ms. Lagesse’s face \nwas peeling for more than a week after the arrest. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 33 of 51\n \n \n184.   As a result of her arrest without probable cause and in response to her \nexercise of her First Amendment rights, Ms. Lagesse was detained for approximately 37 \nhours.  \n185.  As a result of Defendants’ application of excessively tight zipties, Ms. \nLagesse’s wrist bled and she experienced pain in her wrists and hands. More than four \nmonths after her arrest, she still has a quarter-inch-long scar on her right wrist.  \n186.  As a result of the denial of food, water, and access to a toilet, Ms. Lagesse \nexperienced hunger, thirst, discomfort, and anxiety. \n187.  As  a  result  of  the  defendants’  conduct  described  above,  Ms.  Lagesse \nsuffered stress, anxiety, and emotional distress both on January 20 and subsequently. For \nweeks after her arrest, she experienced heightened anxiety whenever she heard helicopters \nor loud noises such as fireworks. She continues to feel increased anxiety around police \nofficers. Ms. Lagesse participated in many political demonstrations prior to January 20, but \nis now reluctant to do so because she fears that she may again be subjected to police \nviolence  through  no  fault  of  her  own.  Although  she  has  nevertheless  attended \ndemonstrations since January 20, she has sometimes been nervous while demonstrating, \nwatching for police and worrying about their whereabouts, and she has sometimes avoided \nchanting or carrying a sign because she feared that if she called attention to herself she \nmight be again become a target of police violence.   \nPlaintiff Ariel’s Injuries \n188.  As  a  result  of  Defendants’  unjustified  use  of  pepper  spray  and  other \nchemical  irritants,  Plaintiff  Ariel  coughed,  choked,  had  difficulty  breathing,  and \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 34 of 51\n \n \nexperienced a burning sensation in his eyes and lungs. He feared he would pass out and \nsuffer further injury. \n189.  As a result of Defendants’ unjustified and sudden pepper-spraying, Mr. \nAriel suffered emotional distress and anxiety during and after his encounter with the police. \nHe often continues to feel increased anxiety around police officers and whenever he passes \nby the intersection of 12th and L Streets NW. Mr. Ariel regularly participated in political \ndemonstrations prior to January 20, but he has since been hesitant to attend potentially \ncontentious protests, whether as a legal observer or a participant. Although Mr. Ariel \nfulfilled his prior commitment to serve as a legal observer at the Women’s March on \nJanuary 21, he made sure to keep his distance from the police and has avoided attending \nother  protests  —  such  as  the  August  12,  2017  counter-demonstration  against  white \nsupremacists in Charlottesville — due to fear of police violence.  \nPlaintiff Gonzalez’s Injuries \n190.  As  a  result  of  Defendants’  unjustified  use  of  pepper  spray  and  other \nchemical irritants, Plaintiff Gonzalez coughed, had difficulty breathing, and experienced a \nburning sensation in his eyes, on his face, and in his lungs and chest. He experienced \nextreme panic when he was being pepper-sprayed in the kettle and felt unable to breathe \nand unable to escape. When Mr. Gonzalez attended a Chinese New Year celebration shortly \nafter his arrest, the fireworks caused Mr. Gonzalez to panic and feel as if concussion \ngrenades were being detonated near him. \n191.  As a result of the denial of food, water, and access to a toilet, Mr. Gonzalez \nexperienced  hunger,  thirst,  discomfort,  and  anxiety.  Specifically,  Mr.  Gonzalez \nexperienced pain and discomfort in his midsection as a result of holding his bladder; the \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 35 of 51\n \n \npain persisted for two weeks after his arrest. Additionally, Mr. Gonzalez experienced \ndifficulty urinating for two weeks after his arrest. He sought medical attention for both of \nthese conditions. \n192.  As a result of Defendants’ manual rectal jabbing and the grabbing of his \ntesticles, Mr. Gonzalez suffered humiliation, anxiety, and emotional distress. He feels more \nwithdrawn from people and has had difficulty relating to people since the search. \n193.  As a result of all the conduct described here, Mr. Gonzalez has had difficulty \nsleeping since January 20. He has regular nightmares about being chased, attacked, or \nlocked up by the police. He frequently cannot sleep for hours and occasionally goes all \nnight without sleeping. Mr. Gonzalez also feels nervous about attending protests. When he \nencounters police, he becomes extremely fearful, and begins to shake and sweat. After \nexperiencing  these  symptoms  at  several  demonstrations  after  January  20,  he  ceased \nattending demonstrations entirely because of his fear and anxiety. \nInjuries to Plaintiffs Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. \n194.  As a result of Defendants’ conduct toward nonthreatening demonstrators \noutside the kettle at 12th and L Streets — including Defendants’ unjustified use of pepper \nspray and other chemical irritants and Defendants’ charge into a nonthreatening crowd on \nthe south side of L Street NW — Plaintiffs Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. coughed and choked \nfor several minutes, and A.S. scraped his ribs. They both continued to cough intermittently \nthroughout the rest of the day. \n195.  As a result of Defendants’ conduct, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and A.S. suffered \nsignificant anxiety, fear, and other emotional distress as they became entangled beneath a \ncrush of people, feared for their own and each other’s safety, and feared becoming \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 36 of 51\n \n \nseparated from each other. Ms. Frisbie-Fulton experienced particular anxiety and fear at \nthe thought that she might be unable to protect her son. Although ten years old, A.S. found \nthat he needed to sleep with his mother on the night of January 20 after what they had \nexperienced. For approximately a month after January 20, A.S. had difficulty recalling their \nexperience at 12th and L Streets NW without becoming emotional. A.S. continues to \nremember that experience when he sees police officers. \n196.  As a result of Defendants’ conduct on January 20, Ms. Frisbie-Fulton and \nA.S. have become wary at political demonstrations. As they had planned to do, Ms. Frisbie-\nFulton and A.S. attended the Women’s March in Washington, D.C. on January 21, 2017, \nbut they decided to leave early when A.S. became frightened at the sight of a police officer. \nBoth of them have become more nervous at demonstrations, and Ms. Frisbie-Fulton no \nlonger takes A.S. to certain types of demonstrations where she expects the police presence \nwill be too concentrated to feel safe. \nThe District’s Responsibility for Plaintiffs’ Injuries \n197.   The actions of the Defendants described above were taken pursuant to a \nmunicipal policy, practice, and custom of responding to demonstrations at which some law-\nbreaking occurs by using excessive force against participants who have not broken the law. \n198.  Chief Newsham has acknowledged that the Defendant Officers’ kettling of \ndetainees  was not  mere happenstance but a  coordinated strategy. All  the Defendant \nofficers’ actions in pepper-spraying, assaulting with additional noise- and light-emitting \nweaponry, and detaining demonstrators were carried out in a coordinated manner. \n199.  Chief Newsham spent the day on January 20 in an MPD command center, \nwhere he was well aware of and (on information and belief) directed the massive and \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 37 of 51\n \n \ncoordinated MPD response to the march down 13th Street NW, pursuant to MPD Standard \nOperating  Procedure  16-01  (“Handling  First  Amendment  Assemblies  And  Mass \nDemonstrations”),  which  provides  (at  page  11)  that  “During  periods  in  which  the \nDepartment is fully mobilized for mass demonstration operations . . . [t]he Chief of Police, \nas the commanding official of the MPD, shall oversee all police activities ….” \n200.  Cmdr.  Keith  Deville,  the  officer  in  command  on  the  scene  of  the \ndemonstration and subsequent kettling, was in constant communication with the MPD \ncommand center, where he received orders from Asst. Chief Lamar Greene and other top-\nranking members of MPD. On information and belief, Asst. Chief Greene and the other \nofficials who instructed Cmdr. Deville acted on the orders or with the approval of Chief \nNewsham, who was with them in the command center. \n201.  To whatever extent Chief Newsham did not direct the coordinated MPD \nresponse himself, he nonetheless was aware of the large-scale MPD actions taken against \nthe individuals who marched down 13th Street NW, and he deliberately failed to supervise \nand restrain Defendants Greene and Deville, and other officers under his command, from \nviolating the rights of Plaintiffs and others repeatedly and continually throughout January \n20. \n202.  The coordinated MPD response is part of a custom of the District of \nColumbia  of  responding  with  overwhelming  and  unlawful  force  to  non-violent \ndemonstrators at largely peaceful demonstrations where some law-breaking is occurring. \nFor instance, MPD has: \na.  Used  excessive  force  against  and  unconstitutionally  detained \ndemonstrators during the counter-inaugural demonstrations in Adams Morgan \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 38 of 51\n \n \nin  January  2005;  the  pepper-spraying  and  arrest  of  numerous  peaceful \ndemonstrators led to lawsuits resolved by large settlement payments to victims \nof MPD violence. \nb.  Used excessive force against demonstrators during the counter-\ninaugural demonstrations near the White House in January 2005 after other \ndemonstrators had removed a portion of security fencing; the pepper-spraying \nof law-abiding demonstrators led to a lawsuit resolved by large settlement \npayments to victims of MPD violence.  \nc.  Used  excessive  force  against  and  unconstitutionally  detained \ndemonstrators during the World Bank protests in Pershing Park in September \n2002; the mass arrests and hogtying of protestors led to lawsuits resolved by \nlarge settlement payments to victims of MPD violence. \nd.  Used excessive force against and unconstitutionally detained anti-\nglobalization demonstrators in April 2000; the kettling, use of pepper spray, and \ndenial food and water to detainees led to lawsuits resolved by large settlement \npayments to victims of MPD violence.  \n203.  The  prior  incidents  in  which  MPD  used  excessive  force  against  and \nunconstitutionally detained peaceful demonstrators where some law-breaking occurred \nmade clear to the District that its officers required training regarding the constitutional \nlimits of their authority to detain demonstrators and use force against them. The widespread \nuse of chemical irritants on January 20 in violation of both D.C. law and the Fourth \nAmendment  reflects  a  deliberately  indifferent  failure  to  train  MPD  officers  on  the \nappropriate circumstances in which to deploy chemical irritants. To whatever extent the \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 29   Filed 01/03/18   Page 39 of 51\n \n \nindividual Defendants’ actions described here did not reflect municipal custom or carry out \naffirmative instructions from Chief Newsham, these actions were the result of the District’s \nfailure to train MPD officers.  \n204.  When asked to comment on MPD officers’ January 20 conduct, Chief \nNewsham responded by ratifying the officers’ conduct in a WTOP radio interview, in \nwhich he stated: “[A]ll the police officers were outstanding in the judgment that they used. \nThey used the least amount of force necessary to bring those folks safely and respectfully \ninto custody. I couldn’t be more proud of the way this department responded.” Chief \nNewsham further stated to WTOP that he was “very, very pleased” with the way police \nresponded to the demonstration. \n205.  Following a report by the Office of Police Complaints raising concerns \nabout MPD’s conduct on Inauguration Day, an official MPD spokesperson reaffirmed that \nits officers’ actions conformed to the District’s expectations: “The Metropolitan Police \nDepartment stands by its assertion that our officers acted responsibly and professionally \nduring Inauguration Day,” MPD spokesperson Rachel Reid said in a statement emailed to \nthe news media.  \nNotices of Claims \n206.  Plaintiffs have timely given notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of \nColumbia of the “approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances” of their injuries, \npursuant to D.C. Code § 12-309. The Notice of Claim letter for Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, \nAriel, and Gonzalez was hand-delivered to the D.C. Office of Risk Management on June \n12, 2017.

Attorney Eric Uriol Johnson terminated. \n(Johnson, Eric) (Entered: 09/28/2018) \n11/20/2018    \nMINUTE ORDER. Defendant John Doe has filed 40  a Motion \nto Dismiss or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, and \nplaintiffs have moved 42  to strike the motion. Pursuant to \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 7 and 12, plaintiffs' motion to \nstrike 42  is procedurally improper because a motion to motion \nto strike is limited to pleadings, and a motion to dismiss under Rule \n12 is not a pleading. See Modaressi v. Vedadi, 441 F. Supp. 2d 51, \n54 (D.D.C. 2006). Thus, the Court will treat plaintiffs motion to \nstrike as an opposition to defendant John Doe's motion to dismiss. \nSee Bush v. Butler, 521 F. Supp. 2d 63, 66 n.1 (D.D.C. 2007). After \nconsideration of the motion and the opposition, Doe's Motion to \nDismiss or for Summary Judgment 40  is hereby DENIED \nwithout prejudice on the grounds that it is premature. Defendant \nJohn Doe has not yet been served or named in the case, and so he \n\"cannot be dismissed... from a lawsuit to which [he is] not a \npart[y].\" Maverick Entmt Grp., Inc. v. Does 1-2, 115, 810 F. Supp. \n2d 1, 16 (D.D.C. 2011); see also Hard Drive Prods., Inc. v. Does, \n2012 WL 3296582, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 13, 2012) (finding that it is \n\"improper as a matter of law\" to evaluate motions to dismiss for \nlack of venue and personal jurisdiction where the defendants have \nnot yet been named); Patrick Collins, Inc. v. Does 1-11, No. CV 12-\n\n767, 2012 WL 13063445, at *2 (D.D.C. Oct. 10, 2012) (denying a \nmotion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction as premature \nbecause defendant John Doe was not named as a defendant in the \nlawsuit). It is therefore ORDERED that defendant District of \nColumbia must inform plaintiffs and the Court, under seal, of John \nDoe's identity by November 30, 2018. If plaintiffs intend to proceed \nwith the allegations against him, plaintiffs must serve him and \nrespond to his request to remain anonymous in this litigation by \nDecember 14, 2018. Since defendant John Doe has already filed a \nresponsive pleading, the Court is hopeful that counsel will agree to \naccept service on his behalf. It is FURTHER ORDERED that \ndefendant John Doe may then renew his motion to dismiss based on \nthe previously filed memorandum of points and authorities, and \nplaintiffs must file a substantive opposition within 14 days.

Trump was sworn in as President of the United \nStates. Exercising their constitutional right to freedom of speech and assembly, people \nfrom all over the country took to the streets of the nation’s capital to express their \ndisapproval  of  his  policies.  Journalists  came  to  report  on  the  demonstrations.  Legal \nobservers came to document any violations of the demonstrators’ legal rights. \nDuring the course of demonstrations in the District of Columbia that day, several \nacts of vandalism occurred. In response, the District’s Metropolitan Police Department \n(MPD) rounded up and arrested hundreds of people, including people who engaged in no \nillegal activity, by chasing them and blocking streets so as to force them into a confined \narea (a “kettle”) on a D.C. street corner. During the chase and then while detaining \ndemonstrators for hours, police fired pepper spray, tear gas, and flash-bang grenades at \ncrowds of demonstrators, journalists, and legal observers, frequently without warning or \njustification. In the course of the roundup and subsequent processing of demonstrators, \npolice held detainees for hours without food, water, or access to toilets; handcuffed \ndetainees so tightly as to cause injury or loss of feeling; and subjected some detainees to \nmanual rectal probing. Much of MPD’s misconduct has been independently documented \nby the District of Columbia’s Office of Police Complaints. \nPlaintiffs are two individuals who came to the District to express their views \nconcerning the inauguration, a photojournalist who covered the demonstrations, and a legal \nobserver who was present  at  the scene. Each of them suffered one or  more of the \nconstitutional, statutory, and common law violations described here.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 3 of 41\n \n \nAmong the violations committed by MPD and its officers were the following: \nPlaintiff Horse, a photojournalist, was pepper-sprayed while he was taking a photograph \nof  demonstrators  and  neither  posing  a  safety  threat  nor  breaking  the  law;  he  was \nsubsequently arrested even though he was not participating in any unlawful activity. \nPlaintiff Lagesse was arrested even though she did not participate in any acts of vandalism \nand was not even close enough to witness any; she was marching to express her views \nwhen she was caught up in the stampede created by MPD’s pursuit of the demonstrators \nand its use of chemical irritants. Plaintiff Ariel, a clearly identified legal observer, was \npepper-sprayed without warning and for no apparent reason other than standing near the \ncorner where MPD was detaining demonstrators.  Pepper spray and tear gas were used \nagainst all plaintiffs without justification and without warning. While Plaintiffs Lagesse, \nHorse, and Gonzalez were detained on a D.C. street corner and later in police transport \nvehicles, they were unreasonably denied food, water, and access to a toilet for periods \nranging from 7 to 16 hours; arresting officers unnecessarily prolonged the arrest process in \norder to keep detainees in a state of anxiety, hunger, thirst, and other discomfort. Plaintiffs \nLagesse and Horse were handcuffed so tightly that one of Plaintiff Lagesse’s wrists bled \nand Plaintiff Horse lost feeling in several fingers, some of which were numb for months \nafterward. During processing, Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez were subjected to intrusive, \nhumiliating, and unjustified manual rectal probing and grabbing of their testicles.  \nTo obtain compensation for their injuries and to vindicate their rights under the \nFirst, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, the D.C. First Amendment \nAssemblies Act, and the common law, plaintiffs now seek relief in this Court. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 4 of 41\n \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, because the plaintiffs’ claims arise under the First, Fourth and Fifth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and are asserted here pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983. Plaintiffs’ claims under the statutory and common law of the District of Columbia \narise  from  the  same  events  as  the  constitutional  claims  and  are  within  the  Court’s \nsupplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  \n2.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because the \nevents giving rise to all claims occurred in the District of Columbia.  \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Shay Horse is an adult resident of New York and a freelance \nphotojournalist whose work has been purchased by Getty Images and Associated Press and \npublished in a variety of outlets including Rolling Stone, Al Jazeera America, and The \nIntercept.

On January 20, he was serving as a legal observer to document any \nviolations of the rights of counter-inaugural demonstrators.  \n5.  Plaintiff Elizabeth Lagesse is an adult resident of Maryland. On January 20, \nshe traveled to Washington, D.C. for the purpose of expressing her opposition to the policy \npositions of the new President.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 5 of 41\n \n \n6.

In this case, the District of Columbia acted through its agents, \nemployees, and servants, including all of the individual Defendants.  \n8.   Defendant MPD Officers John/Jane Doe 1-150 are sworn officers who are \nemployed by the MPD and whose real names are unknown at this time.

They are sued in their individual capacities. \n9.  Defendant  MPD  Supervisory  Officers  John/Jane  Soe  1-20  are  sworn \nofficers who are employed by the MPD and whose real names are unknown at this time. \nThe Soe defendants supervised the Doe defendants as indicated herein. At the time of the \nevents at issue, the Soe defendants were acting within the scope of their employment and \nunder color of law of the District of Columbia. They are sued in their individual capacities. \n10.  Defendant Peter Newsham is the Chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police \nDepartment. At the time of the events at issue, he was the Interim Chief of Police and was \nacting within the scope of his employment and under color of law of the District of \nColumbia. He is sued in his individual capacity.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 6 of 41\n \n \nFACTS \nPolice Weapons \n11.  On  Inauguration  Day  2017,  MPD  officers  who  interacted  with \ndemonstrators were equipped with several types of non-lethal weapons, including: \na.  Oleoresin Capsicum spray dispensers, which resemble small fire \nextinguishers containing 14-48 ounces of solution, depending on the model, \nwith a typical range of 25-30 feet. The solution, commonly known as pepper \nspray, produces a burning sensation on a person’s skin and in a person’s eyes \nand lungs, vision problems, and breathing problems including coughing and \nchoking. \nb.  “Stingers,” which are explosive devices that release smoke, rubber \npellets, and a chemical irritant within a radius of approximately 50 feet. \nc.  Smoke flares, which are explosive devices that release smoke. \nd.  Concussion grenades, which are devices that produce loud explosive \nnoises. \ne.  Flash-bang grenades, which are devices that produce loud explosive \nnoises and bright flashes of light. \nf.  Long range acoustic devices, or LRADs, which are devices that emit \nan excruciatingly loud tone. \nDemonstrators March Down 13th Street NW \n12.  On January 20, 2017, thousands of people demonstrated in the District of \nColumbia to express their opposition to the new President. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 7 of 41\n \n \n13.  The overwhelming majority of the demonstrators were peaceful and law-\nabiding. \n14.  Between 10 and 11 a.m. on January 20, hundreds of demonstrators walked \nsouth on 13th Street NW from Logan Circle toward the National Mall. \n15.  Plaintiff Shay Horse was walking alongside the demonstrators in order to \nphotograph the demonstration for journalistic purposes. He intended to sell his photographs \ncommercially, and had a well-founded expectation that he would be able to do so. \n16.  Mr. Horse was wearing dark jeans, a hooded sweatshirt with the hood down, \na leather jacket, and a camera around his neck. He carried a bag onto which he had affixed \nsilver duct tape to make the bag more identifiable. \n17.  Between 10 and 11 a.m. on January 20, some demonstrators engaged in acts \nof vandalism on or near 13th Street NW between Logan Circle and Franklin Square. \n18.  The  individuals  who  engaged  in  vandalism  were  dressed  in  all-black \nclothing with hoods over their heads and masks over their faces. \n19.  Mr. Horse was not wearing a hood or a mask. \nPolice Confront the Demonstrators \n20.  As  demonstrators  walking  south  on  13th  Street  NW  reached  Franklin \nSquare, they encountered a group of MPD officers, who diverted protestors away from \nFranklin Square to the east. \n21.  Many demonstrators and Mr. Horse moved away from the police down \nstreets to the east and south of Franklin Square. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 8 of 41\n \n \n22.  Additional police officers converged on the demonstrators as they were \ndiverted down side streets, and some began discharging pepper spray and various types of \nnoise-emitting devices at the demonstrators. \n23.  Plaintiff Horse continued to take photographs of the events, including \nphotographs of a few demonstrators in hoods and masks breaking a storefront window and \na photograph of Defendant Officer John Doe 1 as he pepper-sprayed demonstrators. A \nphotograph of Officer John Doe 1 is attached to the complaint as Exhibit A.   \n24.  Although  Officer  John  Doe  1  had  observed  Mr.  Horse  with  a  large, \nprofessional-quality camera around his  neck taking  photographs, Office John  Doe 1 \npepper-sprayed Mr. Horse without warning.  \n25.  At the time Officer John Doe 1 pepper-sprayed Mr. Horse, Mr. Horse was \nnot engaged in any unlawful or dangerous activity. He was not disobeying any orders by \nany police officer. \n26.  As a result of the pepper spray, Mr. Horse choked and gasped for breath. As \nthe pepper spray flooded his eyes, they began to burn. \n27.  As Mr. Horse and a number of demonstrators ran away from the police \nassault, Defendant Officers Doe 1-60 confronted them on the streets immediately east \nand/or  south  of  Franklin  Square  and  discharged  pepper  spray,  flash-bang  grenades, \nconcussion grenades, stingers, smoke flares, and LRADs at demonstrators and other \nindividuals in the vicinity, including Plaintiff Horse. \n28.  Neither Defendant Officers Doe 1-60, nor any other MPD officers or \nofficials, ordered anyone to disperse, halt, or turn back, before Does 1-60 deployed their \nweapons. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 9 of 41\n \n \n29.  Defendant Officers Doe 1-60 deployed pepper-spray, flash-bang grenades, \nconcussion grenades, stingers, smoke flares, and LRADs against individuals (including Mr. \nHorse) in many instances in which the officers faced no threat to themselves or to public \nsafety or disobedience of any commands they had given.  \n30.  Defendant Supervisory Officers Soe 1-10 directed the Doe defendants to \ndeploy their weapons against individuals (including Mr. Horse) in many instances in which \nthe Doe defendants faced no threat to themselves or to public safety or disobedience of any \ncommands they had given. \n31.  Using pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, concussion grenades, stingers, \nsmoke flares, and LRADs, Defendant Officers Doe 1-60 chased Mr. Horse and many of \nthe demonstrators back to the north and west. \nPlaintiff Lagesse Marches Down 13th Street NW \n32.  Plaintiff Elizabeth Lagesse arrived at Logan Circle later than most of the \ndemonstrators. She walked south down 13th Street NW from Logan Circle approximately \nthirty minutes after most of the demonstrators had begun marching. \n33.  Ms. Lagesse was wearing a black and white T-shirt, a bright-colored inner \njacket, and a long grey rain jacket that she removed as she marched, and she was carrying \na multi-colored bag. She did not wear a hood or mask. Having encountered overzealous \npolice officers using pepper spray at prior demonstrations, Ms. Lagesse brought a bandana \nand a pair of lab safety goggles she owned. They were not on her face as she walked south \nfrom Logan Circle.  \n34.  Ms. Lagesse did not engage in or witness any acts of vandalism. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 10 of 41\n \n \nContinued Police Assault and Mass Detentions \n35.  On or near 13th Street NW, Defendant Officers Doe 1-60 deployed pepper \nspray and/or tear gas against individuals, including Mr. Horse and Ms. Lagesse, without \nwarning or a dispersal order, and in many instances in which the officers faced no threat to \nthemselves or to public safety or disobedience of any commands they had given. \n36.  Defendant Supervisory Officers Soe 1-10 directed the Doe defendants to \ndeploy pepper spray against individuals (including Mr. Horse and Ms. Lagesse) in many \ninstances in which the Doe defendants faced no threat to themselves or to public safety or \ndisobedience of any commands they had given. \n37.  The pepper spray caused Mr. Horse’s and Ms. Lagesse’s eyes to burn.  \n38.  Ms. Lagesse put on her safety goggles and pulled her bandana from around \nher neck to cover her mouth in an attempt to protect herself from the pepper spray that \nMPD officers were discharging. \n39.  Although neither Ms. Lagesse nor Mr. Horse had committed any unlawful \nact, the police conduct put each of them in fear for their safety and so they ran away from \nthe police, ultimately heading north on 14th Street NW. \n40.  Defendant Officers Doe 61-90 strategically blocked numerous alternative \negress routes in order to force Mr. Horse, Ms. Lagesse, and many demonstrators to flee \nnorth up 14th Street NW and then east on L Street NW to the corner of 12th and L Streets \nNW. \n41.  At the corner of 12th and L Streets NW, Defendant Officers Doe 91-140 \nestablished a blockade to trap individuals running east on L Street NW. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 11 of 41\n \n \n42.  Although some individuals on L Street NW managed to escape by evading \nthe MPD blockade before it closed in, Ms. Lagesse, Mr. Horse, and most of the other \nindividuals on L Street NW were detained by police at the northwest corner of 12th and L \nStreets NW and on L Street NW itself. \n43.  Defendant Officers Doe 91-140 detained more than 200 individuals in the \ncordoned area (the “kettle”) they had created at 12th and L Streets NW. \n44.  Defendant Supervising Officers Soe 11-15 supervised and/or commanded \nMPD officers to act in a coordinated manner to funnel individuals into the kettle by chasing \nthem to 12th and L Streets NW and by blocking off alternative routes of dispersal.  \n45.  Neither  Defendant  Officers  Doe  61-140  nor  Defendant  Supervisory \nOfficers Soe 11-15 took any actions to try to ensure that only individuals whom they had \nprobable cause to believe had committed crimes would be detained in the kettle.  \n46.   Defendant Supervising Officers Soe 11-15 were well aware that the police \nhad no ability to identify which, if any, of the kettled individuals had committed crimes. \n47.  Defendant Newsham later acknowledged to the Washington Post that his \nofficers  strategically  maneuvered  the  demonstrators  to  trap  them  in  the  kettle.    On \ninformation and belief, Defendant Newsham ordered or approved this action at the time it \ntook place, and/or approved the continued detention and arrest of the kettled demonstrators \ndespite becoming aware that the police had no ability to identify which, if any, of these \nindividuals had committed crimes. \n48.  Because  of  Defendants’  intentional  and  coordinated  action  in  chasing \nindividuals north on 14th Street NW, then east on L Street NW, while driving them on by \nusing pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, concussion grenades, and stingers, and blocking \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 12 of 41\n \n \ntheir egress via different routes, the individuals who were trapped in the kettle at 12th and \nL Streets NW were not there by virtue of having acted unlawfully but merely because they \nwere present on particular downtown D.C. streets on the morning of January 20 and then \ntried to disperse when police chased and assaulted them. \n49.  Mr. Horse did not engage in any vandalism or other unlawful activity on the \nstreets of Washington, D.C. on January 20, 2017. He did not encourage anyone to do so or \ncheer for anyone who did so. He was not dressed the same as anyone who did so. \n50.  Mr. Horse was detained in the kettle without probable cause and merely \nbecause he was exercising his First Amendment right to document the demonstrations as a \nphotojournalist, was present on particular downtown D.C. streets on the morning of \nJanuary 20, and tried to run away when police officers chased and assaulted him. \n51.  Ms. Lagesse did not engage in any vandalism or other unlawful activity on \nthe streets of Washington, D.C. on January 20, 2017. She did not encourage anyone to do \nso or cheer for anyone who did so. She was not dressed the same as anyone who did so. \n52.  Ms. Lagesse was detained in the kettle without probable cause and merely \nbecause she wished to exercise her First Amendment right to demonstrate peacefully in \nopposition to the Inauguration, was present on particular downtown D.C. streets on the \nmorning of January 20, and tried to run away when police officers chased and assaulted \nher. \nIn the Kettle \n53.  The kettle of detainees at 12th and L Streets NW was formed by Defendants \nat about 10:45 a.m. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 13 of 41\n \n \n54.  Plaintiffs Horse and Lagesse were detained there along with approximately \n200 other individuals, one of whom was Plaintiff Milo Gonzalez. \n55.  Plaintiffs, Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez were detained in the kettle for \nhours. \n56.  While individuals were detained in the kettle, Defendant Officers Doe 91-\n140 repeatedly deployed pepper spray and tear gas against individuals or groups of \nindividuals in the kettle, including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez.  \n57.  Many of these deployments came without warning or dispersal order—\nindeed, the individuals in the kettle were physically prevented from dispersing—and were \ncarried out in the absence of any threat to officer or public safety or any disobedience of \npolice orders on the part of the detainees.  \n58.  Defendant  Supervisory  Officers  Soe  16-20,  overseeing  the  conduct  of \nofficers  at  the  kettle,  directed  the  Doe  defendants  to  deploy  pepper  spray  against \nindividuals (including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez) in many instances in which \nthe Doe defendants faced no threat to themselves or to public safety or disobedience of any \ncommands they had given. \n59.  The pepper spray and tear gas were so thick that at times they created a haze \nover the kettle and all the individuals detained there. \n60.  The repeated deployment of chemical irritants caused panic among the \nkettled detainees, including Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez, because they were \nhaving difficulty breathing, were tightly pressed together with other detainees, and could \nnot escape the kettle. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 14 of 41\n \n \n61.  Each time Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez were hit with pepper spray or tear \ngas, their eyes began to burn painfully, and they began to cough and to gasp for breath. \n62.  Because Plaintiff Lagesse had goggles on by this time, her eyes were \nprotected, but the pepper spray caused her to cough, to have difficulty breathing, and to \nexperience a burning sensation on the uncovered part of her face. \n63.  While Plaintiffs Horse, Lagesse, and Gonzalez were detained in the kettle, \nthe defendants failed to provide them with food, water, or access to a toilet. \n64.  Many demonstrators, including Ms. Lagesse and Mr. Gonzalez, specifically \nrequested food, water, and access to a toilet. \n65.  While the detainees were kettled, Defendant Officers Doe 91-95 threw \nedible food in a garbage can in view of the detainees, including Plaintiffs Horse and \nGonzalez, to taunt them. Mr. Gonzalez specifically asked the officers for food that they \nwere throwing away and they refused to provide it. Defendant Officers Doe 91-95 laughed \nat Mr. Gonzalez as they threw their food away. \n66.  Hungry, Mr. Horse and Mr. Gonzalez both resorted to rummaging in a city \ntrashcan for the food the officers had discarded. \n67.  One of the MPD officers, Defendant Officer John Doe 96, made clear to the \ndetainees that no toilets would be made available by stating in response to one detainee’s \nrequest that she should “shit [her] pants” to prove she needed a toilet. \n68.  Having no other place to urinate, some of the demonstrators urinated on the \nstreet or against the side of buildings. Some demonstrators rummaged in the trash for empty \nbottles in which to urinate. At least one demonstrator crouched against the side of a building \nand defecated into a paper bag.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 15 of 41\n \n \n69.  Mr. Gonzalez badly needed to use a toilet, but, fearing that he could be \ncharged with public urination, did not dare to urinate on the street. \n70.  Holding his bladder was painful for Mr. Gonzalez. \n71.  Defendant Officer John Doe 97 taunted Mr. Gonzalez, saying “If you \nwanted to go to the bathroom, you shouldn’t have gotten arrested.”  \n72.  In the early afternoon, MPD began handcuffing detainees and placing them \ninto vehicles for transport to detention facilities.  \n73.  Neither  Defendant  Officers  Doe  91-140  nor  Defendant  Supervisory \nOfficers Soe 16-20 took any actions to try to ensure that only individuals whom they had \nprobable cause to believe had committed crimes would be handcuffed and transported to \ndetention facilities. \n74.  Defendant Officers John Doe 91-140 purposefully proceeded slowly with \nthe arrests to maximize the detainees’ discomfort. \n75.  The level of coordination in slow-walking the formal arrest of detainees \nreflects that Defendant Supervisory Officers Soe 16-20 instructed the arresting officers to \nprocess the detainees slowly to maximize their discomfort. \nBystanders and Legal Observers Are Pepper-Sprayed \n76.  Plaintiff Judah Ariel had started working as a legal observer at 6:30 a.m. on \nJanuary 20 at various demonstrations throughout the District. He was dressed in a brown \njacket and blue jeans, and he was wearing the distinctive bright neon green hat commonly \nworn by legal observers to identify themselves. He was not wearing a hood or mask.  \n77.  At approximately 1:30 p.m., Mr. Ariel was walking east from McPherson \nSquare on K Street NW.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 16 of 41\n \n \n78.  Because Mr. Ariel had heard from another legal observer about police \nactivity in the area of 12th and L Streets NW, he walked north on 12th Street NW toward \nthat intersection to see if he could be of use as a legal observer there. \n79.  Mr. Ariel joined a crowd of people at the southeast corner of 12th and L \nStreets NW, outside the kettle. The crowd included multiple legal observers along the \nsidewalk, clearly identifiable by on their bright neon green hats. \n80.  The south side of the intersection was cordoned off by yellow police tape \nand blocked by a row of police motorcycles. In the intersection, and extending west on L \nStreet NW, a row of MPD officers lined up facing south towards the crowd. Additional \nMPD officers were lined up behind the first police line. \n81.  Mr. Ariel observed the kettled group of detainees surrounded by police at \nthe northwest corner of the intersection. \n82.  Many members of the crowd outside the kettle shouted at the police to \ndemand the release of the people being detained.  \n83.  While Mr. Ariel was present, neither he nor the other individuals outside \nthe kettle menaced, threatened, or assaulted the police or their vehicles.  \n84.  At approximately 1:45 p.m., suddenly and without warning or a dispersal \norder, Defendant Officers Doe 141-149 began to pepper-spray the people outside the kettle, \nincluding Mr. Ariel, on the south side of L Street NW. \n85.  When the pepper-spraying began, there was no threat to public or officer \nsafety, and neither Mr. Ariel nor other individuals in the crowd were disobeying police \norders. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 17 of 41\n \n \n86.  The  coordinated  action  by  multiple  officers  reflects  that  Defendant \nSupervisory Officers Soe 16-20, overseeing the conduct of officers at the kettle, ordered \nthe pepper-spraying of bystanders, despite the absence of a threat to officer or public safety \nor disobedience of any officer’s command. \n87.  The crowd began to retreat from the spray. \n88.  Officers Doe 141-149 moved forward down 12th Street NW, advancing on \nthe retreating crowd, continuing to deploy pepper spray indiscriminately on people in the \ncrowd. \n89.  One MPD officer, Defendant Officer John Doe 141, held his spray gun in \nfront of him, sweeping the spray back and forth across the crowd. \n90.  Mr. Ariel coughed and felt his lungs and eyes burn from the spray. \n91.  Mr. Ariel covered his mouth with a cloth but a few seconds later, he began \nto choke. \n92.  Fearing for his safety, Mr. Ariel fled. He felt that he was on the verge of \npassing out. \nThe Formal Arrests \n93.  The pace of the formal arrests of the kettled detainees speeded up in the \nmid- to late afternoon. \n94.  When Mr. Horse was formally arrested, Defendant Officer John Doe 101 \nhandcuffed him (using zipties) so excessively tightly that he lost feeling in some of the \nfingers on both of his hands. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 18 of 41\n \n \n95.  Mr. Horse complained to Defendant Officer John Doe 102 that the zipties \nwere painfully tight, but the officer refused to remove them, explaining that the zipties were \nnot supposed to be comfortable.  \n96.  Mr. Horse’s zipties were not removed for approximately three hours. \n97.  When  Ms.  Lagesse  was  arrested,  Defendant  Officer  John  Doe  103 \nhandcuffed her using zipties so excessively tightly that one of her wrists was cut and began \nto bleed.  \n98.  Ms. Lagesse complained to Defendant Officer John Doe 104 that the zipties \nwere painfully tight, but the officer refused to remove them. \n99.  Ms. Lagesse’s zipties were not removed for approximately two hours. \n100.  Mr. Horse was detained in the kettle for approximately 7 hours. \n101.  By the time Mr. Horse was formally arrested and transported to a detention \nfacility, he had gone approximately 9-10 hours without access to a toilet. \n102.  Mr. Horse was not given food or drink until later in the evening; he was \ndetained an approximate total of 10-11 hours without being provided food or drink. \n103.  Ms. Lagesse was detained on the street for approximately 5-6 hours. \n104.  By the time Ms. Lagesse was formally arrested, transported to a detention \nfacility, and had her belongings inventoried, she had gone approximately 7-8 hours without \naccess to a toilet. \n105.  The toilet to which Ms. Lagesse was finally given access had no toilet paper. \nSeveral of the women detained with her asked for toilet paper but none was provided.  \n106.  Ms. Lagesse was not given access to water until late that night; she was \ndetained an approximate total of 11-12 hours without water. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 19 of 41\n \n \n107.  Ms. Lagesse did not receive food at the detention facility until the early \nhours of the following morning; she was detained an approximate total of 13-16 hours \nbefore she was given food. \n108.  Mr. Gonzalez was detained on the street for approximately 7 hours. \n109.  By the time Mr. Gonzalez was formally arrested, transported to a detention \nfacility, and given the opportunity to use a toilet, he had gone approximately 9-10 hours \nwithout access to a toilet. \n110.  By the time he was allowed to urinate, Mr. Gonzalez was in pain from \nhaving held his urine for so long.  \n111.  When Mr. Gonzalez was allowed to use a portable toilet, MPD officers held \nthe door open and watched him urinate. They rushed Mr. Gonzalez out of the toilet before \nhe had finished emptying his bladder. \n112.  Mr. Gonzalez was not given food or drink until later in the evening; he was \ndetained an approximate total of 10-11 hours without being provided food or drink.  \nThe Rectal Searches \n113.  After Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez were arrested, they were detained at a \nfacility they believe to have been the Metropolitan Police Academy on Blue Plains Drive \nSW, off I-295 near the Maryland state line. \n114.  MPD officers took them inside the facility to what appeared to be an officer-\ntraining area that was set up to look like a mock street. There the officers searched both of \nthem along with several other detainees. \n115.  Defendant Officer John Doe 150, who was wearing rubber gloves, ordered \nMr. Horse, Mr. Gonzalez, and three other detainees to remove their pants. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 20 of 41\n \n \n116.  Without warning, Defendant Officer John Doe 150 grabbed Mr. Horse’s \ntesticles and yanked on them. \n117.  He then put his finger into Mr. Horse’s rectum, through his underwear. \n118.  As Defendant Officer John Doe 150 pushed his finger into Mr. Horse’s \nrectum, he ordered Mr. Horse not to flinch. \n119.  Defendant Officer John Doe 150 pushed his finger an inch deep into Mr. \nHorse’s rectum and wiggled it around for several seconds.  \n120.  Defendant  Officer  John  Doe  150  then  reached  inside  Mr.  Gonzalez’s \nunderwear and fondled his testicles.   \n121.  Defendant Officer John Doe 150 reached inside Mr. Gonzalez’s underwear \nand put his finger into Mr. Gonzalez’s rectum. \n122.  As  the  Defendant  Officer  John  Doe  150  pushed  his  finger  into  Mr. \nGonzalez’s rectum, he ordered Mr. Gonzalez not to resist.  \n123.  Defendant Officer John Doe 150 and other officers laughed at Mr. Gonzalez \nwhile this degrading search was performed. \n124.  Defendant Officer John Doe 150 then moved down the line and subjected \nthe other three detainees there to similar treatment; Mr. Horse heard another detainee yelp. \n125.  Defendant Officer John Doe 150 did not change gloves when he moved \nfrom one individual to the next. \n126.  The manual rectal searches were performed in the presence of several other \ndetainees and approximately five to ten other MPD officers, including at least one or two \nfemale officers. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 21 of 41\n \n \n127.  No  circumstances  provided  reasonable  suspicion  or  probable  cause  to \nsuspect Mr. Horse or Mr. Gonzalez of concealing contraband in any body cavity. \n128.  No contraband was found on either Mr. Horse or Mr. Gonzalez. \nPlaintiff Horse’s Injuries  \n129.  As a result of Defendants’ use of pepper spray and tear gas, Plaintiff Horse \nsuffered severe pain as his eyes burned from the pepper spray. Pepper spray remained in \nhis hair throughout his detention, which lasted more than 24 hours; every time his long hair \ntouched his face, it caused a burning sensation and coughing. Mr. Horse had a rash on his \nscalp for a week after his arrest. Mr. Horse suffered emotional distress from the panic at \nbeing trapped and unable to breathe while he was pepper-sprayed during the kettle. \n130.  As a result of his arrest without probable cause and in response to his \nexercise of his First Amendment rights, Mr. Horse was detained for approximately 33 \nhours. \n131.  Because Mr. Horse’s arrest and detention led to the confiscation of his \nphotographs and camera for approximately two months, Mr. Horse lost income because he \nwas unable to sell his photographs of the January 20 demonstrations in a timely manner \nand did not have the equipment he needed to cover other newsworthy protests in the weeks \nfollowing his arrest.  \n132.  As  a  result  of  the  application  of  excessively  tight  zipties,  Mr.  Horse \nexperienced pain in his hands and lost feeling in several fingers on both hands. Several \nfingers on his left hand remained numb for more than four months after his arrest. Because \nof the numbness, Mr. Horse has had difficulty with important daily tasks, including typing \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 22 of 41\n \n \non a keyboard and operating his camera.  Mr. Horse had scarring on his left wrist from the \nzipties for more than two months after the arrest.  \n133.  As a result of the denial of food, water, and access to a toilet, Mr. Horse \nexperienced hunger, thirst, discomfort, and anxiety. \n134.  As a result of Defendants’ manual rectal probing and grabbing of his \ntesticles, Mr. Horse suffered humiliation, anxiety, and emotional distress. He feels as if he \nhas been raped. Mr. Horse’s anus was sore for a day or two after the intrusion. Mr. Horse \nhas felt irritable and withdrawn from other people, and he has found it harder to trust and \nconfide in other people. The emotional distress has negatively  affected Mr. Horse’s \nrelationships, including impinging on his sex drive and performance. Mr. Horse remains \nhaunted by what he experienced. \n135.  As a result of the defendants’ conduct described above, particularly the \nkettling and the rectal probing, Mr. Horse has suffered bouts of anxiety and has had \ndifficulty sleeping since January 20. He suffers from nightmares filled with violent imagery \nand wakes up approximately every three hours, often in a panicked state. Covering \ndemonstrations—a crucial part of Mr. Horse’s job—heightens his anxiety as he remembers \nwhat happened to him on January 20.   \nPlaintiff Lagesse’s Injuries \n136.  As a result of Defendants’ use of pepper spray and tear gas, Plaintiff \nLagesse coughed, had difficulty breathing, and experienced a burning sensation on her face \nand in her eyes. Ms. Lagesse also suffered emotional distress from the panic at being \ntrapped and unable to breathe when she was pressed in a crush of people and pepper-\nsprayed while being detained in the kettle. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 23 of 41\n \n \n137.  As a result of her exposure to pepper spray, the skin on Ms. Lagesse’s face \nwas peeling for more than a week after the arrest. \n138.   As a result of her arrest without probable cause and in response to her \nexercise of her First Amendment rights, Ms. Lagesse was detained for approximately 37 \nhours.  \n139.  As a result of Defendants’ application of excessively tight zipties, Ms. \nLagesse’s wrist bled and she experienced pain in her wrists and hands. More than four \nmonths after her arrest, she still has a quarter-inch-long scar on her right wrist.  \n140.  As a result of the denial of food, water, and access to a toilet, Ms. Lagesse \nexperienced hunger, thirst, discomfort, and anxiety. \n141.  As  a  result  of  the  defendants’  conduct  described  above,  Ms.  Lagesse \nsuffered stress, anxiety, and emotional distress both on January 20 and subsequently. For \nweeks after her arrest, she experienced heightened anxiety whenever she heard helicopters \nor loud noises such as fireworks. She continues to feel increased anxiety around police \nofficers. Ms. Lagesse participated in many political demonstrations prior to January 20, but \nis now reluctant to do so because she fears that she may again be subjected to police \nviolence  through  no  fault  of  her  own.  Although  she  has  nevertheless  attended  two \ndemonstrations  since  January  20,  she  was  nervous  while  demonstrating,  constantly \nwatching for police and worrying about their whereabouts, and she sometimes avoided \nchanting or carrying a sign because she feared that if she called attention to herself she \nmight be again become a target of police violence.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 24 of 41\n \n \nPlaintiff Ariel’s Injuries \n142.  As a result of Defendants’ use of pepper spray and tear gas, Plaintiff Ariel \ncoughed, choked, had difficulty breathing, and experienced a burning sensation in his eyes \nand lungs. He feared he would pass out and suffer further injury. \n143.  As a result of Defendants’ unjustified and sudden pepper-spraying, Mr. \nAriel suffered emotional distress and anxiety during and after his encounter with the police. \nHe often continues to feel increased anxiety around police officers.  \nPlaintiff Gonzalez’s Injuries \n144.  As a result of Defendants’ use of pepper spray and tear gas, Plaintiff \nGonzalez coughed, had difficulty breathing, and experienced a burning sensation in his \neyes, on his face, and in his lungs and chest. He experienced extreme panic when he was \nbeing pepper-sprayed in the kettle and felt unable to breathe and unable to escape. When \nMr. Gonzalez attended a Chinese New  Year celebration  shortly after his arrest, the \nfireworks caused Mr. Gonzalez to panic and feel as if concussion grenades were being \ndetonated near him. \n145.  As a result of the denial of food, water, and access to a toilet, Mr. Gonzalez \nexperienced  hunger,  thirst,  discomfort,  and  anxiety.  Specifically,  Mr.  Gonzalez \nexperienced pain and discomfort in his midsection as a result of holding his bladder; the \npain persisted for two weeks after his arrest. Additionally, Mr. Gonzalez experienced \ndifficulty urinating for two weeks after his arrest. He sought medical attention for both of \nthese conditions. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 25 of 41\n \n \n146.  As a result of Defendants’ manual rectal probing and the grabbing of his \ntesticles, Mr. Gonzalez suffered humiliation, anxiety, and emotional distress. He feels more \nwithdrawn from people and has had difficulty relating to people since the search. \n147.  As a result of all the conduct described here, Mr. Gonzalez has had difficulty \nsleeping since January 20. He has regular nightmares about being chased, attacked, or \nlocked up by the police. He frequently cannot sleep for hours and occasionally goes all \nnight without sleeping. Mr. Gonzalez also feels nervous about attending protests. When he \nencounters police, he becomes extremely fearful, and begins to shake and sweat. After \nexperiencing these symptoms at several demonstrations after January 20, he has ceased \nattending demonstrations entirely because of his fear and anxiety. \nThe District’s Responsibility for Plaintiffs’ Injuries \n148.   The actions of the Defendants described above were taken pursuant to a \nmunicipal policy, practice and custom of responding to demonstrations at which some law-\nbreaking occurs by using excessive force against participants who have not broken the law. \n149.  Chief Newsham has acknowledged that the Defendant Officers’ kettling of \ndetainees  was  not  mere  happenstance  but  a  coordinated  strategy.  Indeed,  all  of  the \nDefendants Officers’ actions in pepper-spraying, assaulting with additional noise- and \nlight-emitting weaponry, and detaining demonstrators were carried out in a coordinated \nmanner. \n150.  Chief Newsham spent the day on January 20 in an MPD command center, \nwhere he was well aware of and (on information and belief) directed the massive and \ncoordinated MPD response to the march down 13th Street NW, in accordance with MPD \nStandard Operating Procedure 16-01 (“Handling First Amendment Assemblies And Mass \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 26 of 41\n \n \nDemonstrations”),  which  provides  (at  page  11)  that  “During  periods  in  which  the \nDepartment is fully mobilized for mass demonstration operations . . . [t]he Chief of Police, \nas the commanding official of the MPD, shall oversee all police activities ….” \n151.  To whatever extent Chief Newsham did not direct the coordinated MPD \nresponse himself, he nonetheless was aware of the large-scale MPD actions taken against \nthe individuals who marched down 13th Street NW, and he deliberately failed to supervise \nand restrain Defendants under his command from violating the rights of Plaintiffs and \nothers repeatedly and continually throughout January 20. \n152.  The coordinated MPD response is part of a custom of the District of \nColumbia  of  responding  with  overwhelming  and  unlawful  force  to  non-violent \ndemonstrators at largely peaceful demonstrations where some law-breaking is occurring. \nFor instance, MPD has: \na.  Used  excessive  force  against  and  unconstitutionally  detained \ndemonstrators during the counter-inaugural demonstrations in Adams Morgan \nin  January  2005;  the  pepper-spraying  and  arrest  of  numerous  peaceful \ndemonstrators led to lawsuits resolved by large settlement payments to victims \nof MPD violence. \nb.  Used excessive force against demonstrators during the counter-\ninaugural demonstrations near the White House in January 2005 after other \ndemonstrators had removed a portion of security fencing; the pepper-spraying \nof law-abiding demonstrators led to a lawsuit resolved by large settlement \npayments to victims of MPD violence.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 27 of 41\n \n \nc.  Used  excessive  force  against  and  unconstitutionally  detained \ndemonstrators during the World Bank protests in Pershing Park in September \n2002; the mass arrests and hogtying of protestors led to lawsuits resolved by \nlarge settlement payments to victims of MPD violence. \nd.  Used excessive force against and unconstitutionally detained anti-\nglobalization demonstrators in April 2000, including kettling, use of pepper \nspray, and denying detainees of access to food and water, all of which led to \nlawsuits resolved by large settlement payments to victims of MPD violence.  \n153.  The  prior  incidents  in  which  MPD  used  excessive  force  against  and \nunconstitutionally detained peaceful demonstrators where some law-breaking occurred \nmade clear to the District that its officers required training regarding the constitutional \nlimits of their authority to detain demonstrators and use force against them. To whatever \nextent the individual Defendants’ actions described here did not reflect municipal custom \nor carry out affirmative instructions from Chief Newsham, these actions were the result of \nthe District’s failure to train, or its inadequate training of, MPD officers. \n154.  Dozens  of  individuals  detained  by  MPD  on  January  20,  including \nindividuals  who  were  transported  to  detention  facilities  at  various  times  during  the \nafternoon and evening, report that MPD officers subjected them to manual cavity searches \nand other molestations similar to those experienced by Plaintiffs Horse and Gonzalez. \n155.  The widespread and pervasive nature of MPD’s abusive cavity searches \ndemonstrates that they were undertaken pursuant to a central policy or pervasive custom \nof the District to humiliate and degrade individuals arrested for demonstrating. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01216-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 06/21/17   Page 28 of 41\n \n \n156.  When asked to comment on the conduct of MPD officers on January 20, \nChief Newsham responded by ratifying the officers’ conduct in an interview with WTOP \nradio, in which he stated: “[A]ll the police officers were outstanding in the judgment that \nthey used. They used the least amount of force necessary to bring those folks safely and \nrespectfully into custody. I couldn’t be more proud of the way this department responded.” \nChief Newsham further stated to WTOP that he was “very, very pleased” with the way \npolice responded to the demonstration. \n157.  Following a report by the Office of Police Complaints raising concerns \nabout MPD’s conduct on Inauguration Day, an official MPD spokesperson reaffirmed that \nits officers’ actions conformed to the District’s expectations: “The Metropolitan Police \nDepartment stands by its assertion that our officers acted responsibly and professionally \nduring Inauguration Day,” MPD spokesperson Rachel Reid said in a statement emailed to \nthe news media.  \nNotice of Claim \n158.  Plaintiffs have timely given notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of \nColumbia of the “approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances” of their injuries, \npursuant to D.C.
