    "summary": "<p>On January 23, 2017, four minor children confined to the state juvenile facilities Copper Lake School for Girls and Lincoln Hills School for Boys filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The plaintiffs sued various state officials responsible for the facility under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by wrongfully and unlawfully imposing solitary confinement, mechanical constraints, chemical agents such as pepper spray, and strip searches on the minors incarcerated in these facilities. Represented by the ACLU and the Juvenile Law Center, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to District Judge James D. Peterson and Magistrate Judge Stephen L. Crocker.</p>\r\n<p>The State of Wisconsin operated the Lincoln Hills School for Boys and the Copper Lake School for Girls, which incarcerated approximately 150&ndash;200 youths who were as young as 14 years old. According to the plaintiffs, the Schools routinely subjected these minors to unlawful mechanical restraints and pepper spraying, as well as to solitary confinement whereby the children were forced to remain in their cells for 22&ndash;23 hours a day. Many of these children were forced to spend their only free hour outside of a solitary confinement cell in handcuffs and chained to a table. The plaintiffs alleged that officers also repeatedly and excessively used bear mace and other pepper sprays against the children, causing them excruciating pain and impairing their breathing. The plaintiffs claimed that these practices constituted serious violations of the children&rsquo;s constitutional rights, including their rights to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>On January 24, 2017, the plaintiffs moved for certification of a class defined as &ldquo;[a]ll prisoners who are now, or in the future will be, confined at Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls.&rdquo; On September 18, 2017, Judge Peterson granted class certification.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 17, 2017, adding five plaintiffs and additional factual allegations regarding those plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also requested attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in their amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2017, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction ordering the defendants and their agents to eliminate the use of solitary confinement for disciplinary or punitive purposes, the routine use of mechanical restraints, and the use of pepper spray for punishment and behavior management or control. They also requested that the defendants limit any use of chemical agents to rare and temporary responses necessary to prevent imminent and serious physical harm to persons. In support of this motion, the plaintiffs argued that each of these practices violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\r\n<p>The Wisconsin State Journal, the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Wisconsin Newspaper Association, and the Associated Press moved to intervene on June 21, 2017 for the limited purpose of objecting to any closure of any part of any proceedings in this lawsuit. Specifically, the intervenors objected to the plaintiffs' motion to close the courtroom for the display of videos to protect the identities of juveniles, urging the court to consider the public&rsquo;s interest in transparency. That same day, the court entered an order granting the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to close the courtroom but, in light of the intervenors&rsquo; objection, required the court to take a break before displaying the videos, and asked that those who remained in the courtroom sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Finding the plaintiffs&rsquo; arguments compelling, the court granted a preliminary injunction on July 10, 2017, barring defendants from using disciplinary or punitive restrictive housing or any other form of disciplinary or punitive solitary confinement in any manner other than in very limited and brief specific instances outlined by the court. The court also enjoined the defendants from using chemical agents in any manner other than where a minor engaged in physical harm to himself or others. Additionally, the court required the defendants and their agents to meet certain minimum standards with regard to their use of restrictive housing and their use of mechanical restraints.</p>\r\n<p>The parties began settlement negotiations in September 2017.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2018, the Wisconsin State Legislature voted to close Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake by January 1, 2021. (In the summer of 2019, that deadline was pushed back to July 1, 2021).</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued their negotiations in mediation sessions before Magistrate Peter Oppeneer in April and May 2018. On June 1, 2018, after reaching a settlement, the parties jointly moved the court to grant preliminary approval of the proposed settlement agreement. On June 20, 2018, Judge Peterson granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement agreement and approved the proposed notice. The preliminary approval contained eleven points for the parties to use as guidelines in reaching an agreement. These included: reducing the maximum amount of time incarcerated youth are held in solitary confinement, reducing the use of pepper spray, increasing opportunities for physical exercise, and ending a rule that only one book be allowed to inmates in solitary confinement. (Details <a href=\"https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2017/07/05/court-watch-judge-sets-guidelines-for-lincoln-hills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.) On September 21, 2018, Judge Peterson approved the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement required the defendants to adopt policy changes with regard to punitive solitary confinement, the use of chemical agents and mechanical restraints, and the administration of strip searches. All of these practices were in large part prohibited by the settlement agreement and those few instances where they were not prohibited were clearly defined by the agreement. The agreement also required that the defendants be monitored during the three-year-minimum settlement term and that they submit reports detailing the use of the new policies and practices. The defendants agreed to pay for a monitor's reasonable fees and costs. The defendants also agreed to pay the plaintiffs' counsel $885,000 in fees and costs for work done through June 18, 2018 and an additional $220.50/hour for work done by the plaintiffs' counsel from June 19, 2018 until entry of the settlement agreement. The court retained jurisdiction to ensure compliance.</p>\r\n<p>Pursuant to the parties' agreement that the facilities be monitored, the monitor submitted her first report on January 14, 2019, indicating partial compliance with the settlement by the defendants and a need for documentation of policies to be improved. Under the settlement terms, administrative confinement was only to be used for a youth posing a serious risk of imminent physical harm to others, but the monitor observed instances where administrative confinement was used though the youth wasn't at risk of imminent physical harm to others. Additionally, though strip searches had decreased, staff had been utilizing a \"hygiene\" check instead, where they required the youth to strip to their underwear. The monitor noted that this search should only be used for probable cause of youth possession drugs or weapons. In general, the monitor noted that documentation for policies, programs, and quality assurance needed to be improved further.</p>\r\n<p>Several senators and representatives of the Wisconsin Legislature sent a letter to Judge Peterson on August 6, 2021, with an invitation to tour both schools. The letter was concerned with the consequences of the injunction issued on July 10, 2017, namely conditions for the staff of the schools (characterized as &ldquo;an unstable and traumatizing workplace&rdquo;). In a response that same day, Judge Peterson declined the invitation to tour the schools and speak with the staff personally. After acknowledging the second half of 2020 was &ldquo;a difficult period at the facilities,&rdquo; Judge Peterson also noted recent reports indicated some improvement. Finally, Judge Peterson explained that either side could seek modification of the consent decree and noted that the legislators could also take action (&ldquo;consider whether Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake continue to serve the interests of the people of Wisconsin&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation to add a named plaintiff, noting that none of the named plaintiffs were currently housed at either Lincoln Hills or Copper Lake. This motion was granted on December 6, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court-appointed monitor regularly submitted reports in compliance with the consent decree. The most recent report was submitted on April 5, 2024 (the nineteenth report). The report noted that the population of students between the two facilities remained consistently in the low to mid 50s throughout the reporting period. The monitor also noted that recruitment and retention efforts had decreased staffing shortages, though &ldquo;there was still an average daily operational vacancy rate of 35%, which is reflective of daily unanticipated leave.&rdquo; This report also highlighted review of several use of force incidents, finding that &ldquo;appropriate force was used in each instance.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While both of the schools were scheduled to be closed by July, 2021, the state of Wisconsin missed the deadline, and the facilities are still open. Construction on the new site is expected to begin in the second half of 2024, though the facility is not expected to be operational until 2026.</p>\r\n<p>On August 8, 2024, Wisconsin State Legislatures sent a <a href=\"https://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/21/wanggaard/media/3ffcdhrl/letter-from-senate-assembly-committees-requesting-modifications-to-consent-decreedot.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a> to the Department of Corrections, stating that \"the consent decree is directly resulting in more kids being charged with more crimes while in custody and staying in custody longer. This is because the real-world implementation of the consent decree has created an environment where kids have less structure and discipline, giving them more opportunities to act out.\" Legislatures asked that the Wisconsin Department of Corrections petition Judge James Peterson to revisit and revise the consent decree and permanent injunction requirements. Wisconsin Governor Evers also sent a letter to Judge Peterson asking him not to not to order changes at Wisconsin's youth prison in wake of counselor death. Republican state legislators sent an <a href=\"https://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/21/wanggaard/media/bbthmhsh/letter-to-judge-peterson-correcting-governor-evers-finaldocx.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">additional letter</a> to Judge Patterson to rebut Governor Evers' letter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Patterson has <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/26/judge-says-no-to-altering-lincoln-hills-consent-decree/74903083007/?utm_source=TMP-Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=e3ead143e8-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_09_06_04_16&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5e02cdad9d-e3ead143e8-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signaled</a> that he will not modify the settlement.

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nSECOND REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n  \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe First Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on January 13, 2019.  The Monitor’s \nsecond report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the last site visit which took place December 6-8, 2018.  \n \nSITE VISIT \nThe second site visit by the Monitor took place on March 8-11, 2019.  The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit.  Materials included, but \nwere  not  limited  to:  policies,  procedures,  resident  handbooks  (including  the  pilot  Krueger \nprogram), grievances, school schedules, recreation schedules, counselor logs, various staff memos \nand daily shift reports, video footage of use of force incidents, all of the monthly data submitted \nto the parties per this court order for the months of December through February, unit rules, work \nrules, employee leave data, employee corrective action reports, behavior and treatment plans, \nmechanical restraint documentation, incident reports, other housing documentation, and various \nproposals for capital projects such as paint, furniture, and electronic room monitoring systems.  \nThe Parties were present during the site visit. The Monitor took photographs, toured LHS/CLS, \nand interviewed youth and staff.  Approximately thirty-four (34) youth and twenty-five (25) staff \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 2 of 25\n \nwere interviewed by the parties.   \n \nThe Monitor learned that in January of 2019, newly elected Governor Evers and Secretary Carr \nand other members of their staff toured LHS/CLS. Governor Evers and Secretary Carr spoke to \nyouth and staff during this visit and spent time with the leadership team.  Secretary Carr and \nDeputy Secretary Pechacek visited LHS/CLS on February 11, 2019 to tour and talk with youth \nand staff.  Based on interviews with youth and staff, these visits had a positive impact as they were \nable to provide feedback as it relates to daily life at LHS/CLS and meet the new administration in \nperson.  Additionally, the Monitor met with Secretary Carr and members of his staff in Madison, \nWisconsin after completion of the LHS/CLS site visit. The Monitor debriefed with Secretary Carr \nand he and his team expressed a commitment to improving conditions for youth and staff at \nLHS/CLS.   \n \nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS \n \nPhysical Plant \n \nThe general areas of the facility were clean, however youth living units were not as clean as the \nlast site visit.   Unfortunately, during this site visit, LHS/CLS had more of an institutional feel as \nthe holiday decorations that were displayed during the last visit were not replaced with other decor \nand there did not appear to be any changes with respect to paint color, murals, furniture, etc. as \nrecommended in the previous Monitor report and the February 2018 technical assistance report. \nMuch of the unit signage (youth behavior expectations) were written in a negative tone with a lot \nof bold “DO NOT” “NOT ALLOWED” “DO NOT ENTER!!!!”. There was still a lot of graffiti \nand etching of glass throughout LHS/CLS.  The Monitor was told that staff are working on getting \nthe glass in the doors replaced when etching obstructs the staff’s view into the room and they were \nworking on painting over the graffiti.  Defendants informed the Monitor that there was a bid for \npainting the interior of the cottages and that there will be a youth program to further decorate the \nwalls with murals and artwork once the base painting project is completed.  Youth rooms and \nbathrooms remain unchanged in terms of cleanliness.  There needs to be a continued focus on \nyouth rooms being clean and orderly and the bathrooms being cleaned more regularly and \nthoroughly.  Overall, there was not an improvement in the overall physical plant. Furthermore, \nseveral serious incidents occurred in which youth have used furniture and other unsecured unit \nequipment during unit disturbances to facilitate escapes from their housing units and used debris \nfrom these disturbances as potential weapons against staff.  Safety and security searches of all \nbuildings need to be conducted to remove excessive objects, materials, equipment, furniture, etc., \nto enhance the safety and security of the units/buildings.  Defendants should consider replacing \nexisting  furniture  with  furniture  that  is  specifically  designed  and  engineered  for  secure \nenvironments. The Monitor is hopeful that there will be noticeable improvement as to cleanliness, \nreduced graffiti, and etched glass during the next site visit.  \n \nLiving Unit/School Observations \n \nThe average daily population is 145 which is the same as that of the last site visit. Some of the \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 3 of 25\n \ncottages were combined due to population and staff shortages. The Monitor saw some staff \nengaging with youth, several youths were out cleaning, recreation was taking place, and telephone \ncalls were being made. The Monitor did observe tournaments taking place and the volunteers in \nthe Foster Grandparent’s program were interacting with youth.  As recommended in the technical \nreport, a  youth  advisory council  has been  implemented,  however,  the Monitor made some \nsuggested modifications. The Monitor saw a significant amount of idle time for youth during the \nsite visit. Recommendations were made in the February 2018 technical assistance report that \nshould be implemented as to additional programming that would be beneficial to youth.  \n \nThe boys’ cottages were similar to the last visit, but the Monitor observed significant differences \nin the girls’ cottage. All the girls were on the King unit. The girls, in general, were less jovial, less \ntalkative, less active on their unit, were not actively engaged in programming, and seemed quite \nagitated.  There was a noticeable difference in the attitudes of the girls during this site visit.  During \nthe last visit, the girls were laughing, making popcorn, interacting with staff and youth in a positive \nmanner, and were doing artwork. There was no decoration or artwork in King during this visit. \nThe Monitor asked staff for the room logs and staff could not find them (Monitor wanted to look \nat confinement documentation.)  Everything written in the unit for the youth was written in a \nnegative tone as described above. The girls’ mugshots were taped to the tables which is where \neach girl is assigned during out time. It was reported that the girls’ school and recreation activities \nwere more limited than they were during the last site visit.  It was reported that the girls were not \nallowed to use the main school or main gym as a consequence for passing notes to the boys. It \nwould be helpful for the agency to utilize a consultant to focus on gender specific programming to \nenhance the programs and activities for the girls’ facility.  \n \nWith respect the boys’ cottages, generally all the youth rooms were messy and dirty.  The Monitor \nreviewed the “counselor logs” which document name of staff, youth safety/welfare checks, counts, \nand activity on each living unit and none of the documentation complied with policy/procedure, \nthis Court Order, and/or best practices.  In Curtis, 17 out of 24 youth were confined to their rooms \n(something that was, improperly, not documented as “room confinement”). Youth that were in the \nday room were playing cards.  There was explicit graffiti on the walls and the living unit smelled. \nStaff were positioned in or near the staff office on the unit and were not in the lower day room \nwith youth. Youth on Black Elk were out eating when the Monitor toured. Staff were not observed \neating or sitting with youth but were positioned in or near the staff office on the unit.  The Monitor \nwas happy to see that all the youth were out of their rooms and the atmosphere was more relaxed \nthan the other living units. Adams (intake unit) had a lot of graffiti on the walls. Youth rooms on \nRoosevelt (where the TIP program is now located) were cleaner than the other living units.  Mug \nshots were taped on the youth doors. Staff were eating with youth and staff were engaged with the \nyouth.  On Krueger, only two youth are allowed to be in the day room at a time which means there \nis significant confinement on this unit.  At the time of the site visit, Krueger was no longer the \nRestrictive Housing Unit (“RHU”) but is operating under a new “Krueger Program” which in a \nnumber of respects does operate as restrictive housing. The Krueger program includes Phases 1-3, \nwith youth progressing from more to less restrictive situations. Youth in the Krueger Program \nreported that there were a lot of limitations and that the program was not run like general \npopulation. Here again, it is highly recommended that the agency hires a consultant to help with \nprogramming and activities for the boys.   \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 4 of 25\n \nThe school seemed less controlled than last visit.  Some of the windows in the classrooms had \npaper over the windows, which is a safety concern as staff cannot see inside the rooms. Foster \nGrandparents were present and engaged. Teachers reported that 50% of the youth were in special \neducation, yet there are only three special education teachers.  The teachers seemed to enjoy their \njob, but they are struggling with staff shortages and wish there was more technology available.  \nSome classrooms had youth actively engaged and others had several youths with heads down \nand/or sitting on top of desks and being disruptive with no redirection from teachers.  The \nDefendants asked for an education consultant, and the Monitor has made recommendations. \n \nStaffing \n \nStaffing problems continue to exist at LHS/CLS. There are 311 total positions at LHS/CLS.  \nApproximately 155 of these positions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor \nAdvanced (“YC/YCA”)).   The Defendants have made significant progress with the number of \nvacancies for the Youth Counselor positions, however there are still a large number of staff on \nvarious  leaves  of  absence  (FMLA/Workers’  Comp,  etc.)  which  contributes  to  the  staffing \nshortages.    Staffing  challenges  remain  as  evidenced  by  the  number  of  staff  working \novertime/double shifts. The teacher vacancy rate remains unchanged and recruiting remains a \nchallenge.  \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of \nFebruary 20, 2018  November 28, 2018  March 14, 2019 \nYouth  48% (45 out of 94)  22% (23 of 105)           15% (16 out of 105) \nCounselor \nYouth  45% (27 of 60)  18% (9 of 50)               26% (24 out of 50) \nCounselor Adv \nTeacher  25%  (7 of 28)  39% (11 of 28)             39% (11 of 28) \nSocial Worker   13% (2 of 15)  14% (2 of 14)   0% (14 of 14) \n \nThe Monitor recommended combining living units in order to adequately supervise youth while \nstill meeting legally mandated staffing requirements and ensuring the safety of youth and staff. \nThe Defendants have combined cottages as recommended in the technical assistance report, but \nnon-traditional scheduling or scheduling changes have not been considered. In the last report, the \nMonitor recommended that the facility conduct a full staffing assessment to include a relief factor \nanalysis looking at all leave types and its impact on staffing levels. To date, this has not occurred.  \n \nThe Monitor spoke to over twenty-five (25) staff and the majority said they are tired and often \nwork double shifts several days in a row. The vast majority of staff do not feel safe and do not feel \nthey  are  adequately  trained  and  prepared  with  the  alternatives  to  OC  spray  and \nreduction/elimination of confinement. The Defendants will not be able to come into substantial \ncompliance with the Court Order without solving the staffing issues. The Monitor cannot stress \nenough the need to make staff wellness a major focus moving forward.  Recommendations for \nstaff wellness were made in the February 2018 technical assistance report that should be explored \nfurther. Although there was communication with staff and youth regarding the reform effort \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 5 of 25\n \n(written and verbal), the Monitor recommended that the message be communicated differently, \nwhich the Monitor shared during the site visit.  As recommended in the technical assistance report, \nstaff are engaged in developing programming and policy changes. The Monitor saw that there were \nemployees recognized as “Employees of the Month.”   The Defendants should continue to create \npolicy driven staff recognition programs, and tap into staff’s talents, passions, and interests (artists, \nmusicians, yoga etc.) to bring into programming. Staff exhaustion, fear, and discontent are \nhindering any positive relationship building with the youth.  \n \nThe hearing officer position has been eliminated due to the restrictive housing unit (“RHU”) being \neliminated and replaced with a new pilot “Krueger Program.” The Monitor believes that there is a \nneed for this position particularly in light of youth interviews (in more detail below).  During this \nsite visit, the Monitor spent time with the mental health staff (PSU) and the recreation staff and \nwas very impressed with the level of energy, commitment and shared vision for what programming \ncan look like at LHS/CLS.  The Monitor suggests modifying the mental health and recreational \nstaff work schedules to include more evening and weekend hours which is when youth idleness is \nat the highest.  The Monitor believes this would have a huge impact on youth and staff. \n \nQuality Assurance \n  \nData collection continues to be a significant problem at LHS/CLS.   The Monitor stressed the fact \nthat data-driven decision making is critical to the safety and quality of life of youth and staff, as \nwell as to ascertain compliance with the Court Order. Data continues to not be accurately recorded, \nadequately collected or analyzed for incidents giving rise to this litigation.  Not only does there \nneed to be additional data measures, but a plan should be developed for implementation of \ncompetent data collection with a focus on accuracy at the line staff level (i.e. safety/welfare check \nlogs,  incident  reports,  use  of  force  incidents,  all  confinement,  youth  idleness,  grievances, \neducational hours per youth, etc.). \n \nThe jurisdiction utilizes Performance Based Standards (“PbS”) which is a program for juvenile \njustice  agencies,  facilities,  and  residential  care  providers  to  identify,  monitor,  and  improve \nconditions and services provided to youths using national standards and outcome measures. The \nMonitor cannot include updated outcome measures in this report because PbS data collection \ncycles only occur twice a year, in April and October. When it becomes available, the Monitor will \nupdate the Court.   \n \nThe Monitor recommended that the jurisdiction monitor incidents of assaults, fights, youth and \nstaff injuries, and other critical outcomes measures on a monthly basis using the most recent PbS \nfield averages as a guide to gauge the overall safety for staff and youth.  During the site visit, the \nMonitor met with the Department of Juvenile Corrections Program and Policy Chief in which the \nMonitor provided examples of a monthly outcomes metrics data report (separate from the PbS \noutcome measures) that would be beneficial to the overall safety and quality of life for youth and \nstaff. The Monitor will update the Court on any data improvements in the next report. \n \nTo address the need for a quality assurance and improvement program, the Defendants have \ncreated two new positions (Quality Assurance Specialist and Program and Policy Analyst).  The \ngoal will be to continuously assess not only compliance with this Court Order, but the quality and \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 6 of 25\n \nadequacy  of  the  social  and  recreational  programming  provided,  healthcare,  education, \nenvironmental health and safety, and discipline and order.  The Monitor is happy to work with the \nindividuals selected for these positions. It is clear from discussions with Secretary Carr and his \nstaff that this will be priority hiring.  \n \nThe Program and Policy team for the Division of Juvenile Corrections should work with the vendor \n(J-Tracker) to include other critical measures as described during the site visit.  The Monitor \ncontinues to have difficulty assessing accuracy of the data because of the lack of documentation, \nlack of electronic systems to automatically capture data, and lack of staff available whose sole \nresponsibility is data collection and analysis.  To address the data issues, the Defendants have \ncreated two new positions, identified funding for experts as recommended by the Monitor, and an \nelectronic room check system was tested recently (a module of a currently existing system) and is \nbeing piloted at LHS/CLS. \n \nPolicies and Procedures \n \nSignificant revisions to policy and procedure and Administrative Codes have not yet occurred. The \nMonitor does not have any updates as to when certain Codes will be repealed and recreated. All \npolicies refer to the Administrative Code and thus modifications to the Administrative Code should \nbe a priority as stated in the First Report of the Monitor.   \n \nPolicies relevant to LHS/CLS need to be compliant with the federal court orders and should contain \na quality assurance section for every policy.  After review of updated DOC DJC policies and \nprocedures and local procedures, quality assurance is still not part of the policies and reference to \nthis litigation is not listed in the “references” section.  Policy and procedure changes still need to \nbe made as it relates to Security and Inspections, Mental Health Screening, Mechanical Restraints, \nClinical Observations, Youth Movement and Suspension of Movement, Use of Force, Searches of \nYouth (not compliant with Court Order), Emergency Response Unit, and several others.  The \nMonitor was pleased to see that the CARE team has been implemented and is being regularly \nutilized, however, a policy and procedure needs to be created which clearly outlines the mission \nof the CARE team, identify circumstances where CARE team will be deployed, describes how \nstaff are chosen for the CARE team, and includes a quality assurance section. The Monitor \nsuggests increasing the CARE team as it appears they are successful at deescalating situations and \ntheir hours of operation should be extended to evening and increased weekend hours when youth \nare not in school. Also, many of the policies continue to indicate “discuss at staff meeting.”  There \nshould be formalized training with employee sign offs acknowledging receipt and understanding.  \nEffective proficiency testing for all training classes still needs to be developed.  The Monitor will \ncontinue to work with the Defendants on policy and procedure. \n \nYouth Interviews \n \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and the Monitor conducted several youth interviews.  Approximately thirty (34) \nyouth were interviewed during the site visit (formally and informally).   \n \nSeveral youths were able to identify staff that they thought were caring and often interacted with \nthem in a positive way. There were also staff identified as being consistently disrespectful, unfair, \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 7 of 25\n \nexhibited favoritism, and provoked youth to act out. Youth stated most staff do not interact with \nthem other than directing them.  Youth reported several inconsistencies involving staff not \nfollowing the grievance procedure, program rules, phone restrictions, canteen, and inconsistencies \nin the staff assigned to the various living units.  This is not to say that there are not staff who \nactively engage with youth, but more staff need to engage with the youth in a productive manner. \n \nThe common complaints from youth interviewed were that they were bored and had nothing to do \n(not enough programming or activities) and too much time being confined (both for misbehavior \nand for administrative reasons, including inadequate staffing and/or lack of other activities for \nthem to do). Youth disliked split hallway times (half of youth locked in rooms while remainder \nare out in day room).  Youth who spent time in RHU had the same complaints as stated in the \nMonitor’s last report. RHU was eliminated in January 2019 and replaced with the pilot “Krueger \nProgram.”  Youth in the “Krueger Program” reported that they are being confined alone in their \ncells without due process, had no television privileges except educational programs, limited \neducation, were not offered recreation in “Phase 1” of the program, and felt it was similar to RHU.   \n \nYouth also stated that strip searches were occurring.  When interviewing youth who have been OC \nsprayed, they complained that they were unjustly sprayed, and the decontamination process took \na long time.  Youth complained of delayed response to call lights (often indicated when a youth \nhas to use the restroom because there is no toilet in their rooms). \n \nThe Monitor found that much of what youth reported was accurate.  When touring the all of the \nliving units, youth were often confined. (even youth outside of TIP and Krueger).  When reviewing \nconfinement logs, the logs did not reflect confinement time as staff believe time spent alone in a \ncell for “cool offs,” counts, “resets,” split hall out time, and periods of positive behavior (“PPB”) \nwere not confinement time. Staff did not think that time spent alone in a cell by any youth not in \nKrueger for whatever reason, including for reasons related to a youth’s own behavior, to the \nbehavior of other youths, to lack of activities, or for other administrative reasons was confinement \ntime which should be documented.  The Monitor observed that when youth were out of their rooms, \nmost were not engaged in structured programming.  Most (not all) staff were not engaging with \nyouth in a positive manner but were usually standing arms crossed and verbally directing youth to \ndo one thing or another.  With respect to the youth statements regarding staff not responding to \ntheir call lights timely or at all, this was confirmed in a survey and camera review. 10 out of 10 \nyouth reported staff not responding timely to the lights in their room.  \n \nWith respect to the youths’ statements on OC usage and decontamination, the Monitor reviewed \nsome documentation that shows the time between spray and decontamination is excessive.  Also, \nin reviewing video of several OC spray incidents, there were lesser means available. The threat of \nOC Spray is made often, as documented in the daily shift reports. \n \nThe Monitor observed (and youth reported) several positive interactions between youth and staff. \nOne youth did report that LHS is “way better than before” and was much happier.  Some youth \nliked being in the Krueger Program and spoke positively of the staff and structure. Youth generally \nliked the food offered at LHS/CLS. Youth really enjoyed when staff sat with them at meals, or at \nthe tables when the youth were conversing with friends.  Youth enjoyed playing games with the \nstaff and enjoyed the basketball and ping pong tournaments.  \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 8 of 25\n \n \nThe  Defendants  have  made  efforts  to  identify  and  contact  community  partners  to  increase \nprogramming at LHS/CLS such as technical schools, local colleges, Boys and Girls Club, and \nvarious ministries.  Hopefully, there will be continued movement on bringing in community \npartners.  There  have  been  be  more  resources  identified,  specifically,  positions  created  for \ndedicated staff allocated to make the necessary changes needed to improve conditions for youth \nand staff, funding for various capital projects and national experts on a temporary basis to assist in \ndeveloping systems, programs, and assist in making the necessary changes to reach substantial \ncompliance with the Court Order. Defendants need to continue revisiting the February technical \nassistance report and develop a plan to implement the recommendations contained within that will \nimprove the quality of life and conditions for youth and staff.   \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree. As previously stated, \nthere is a challenge with adequacy of data for many areas (documentation, accuracy, consistency, \nand analysis) thus, some sections do not contain a detailed narrative.  \n \nA.  Room Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court  's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Although the official data shows \nthat there was not a single youth in punitive confinement in excess of seven days during this \nreview period, however, documentation of youth time in room confinement is inconsistent \nand inadequate. Given the long-standing staffing deficiencies, there is an urgent need to also \nexplore methods for promptly reducing youth populations. This might include expediting the \nOJOR process and evaluating youth for placement under community supervision, including \nintensive community supervision, as permitted by state law. During the site visit, there was \nmuch discussion on the definition of “punitive” confinement. The Defendants believe since \nRHU has been replaced by the Krueger Program, that there is no administrative or punitive \nconfinement or need for due process. The Monitor deemed many instances of confinement \nas punitive but because staff did not view these as punitive, there is no data available to assess \ncompliance Also, because confinement logs are not accurately recorded, the Monitor cannot \nassess the pre-hearing and post-hearing time. One youth (female) reported being on PPB \n(“Periods of Positive Behavior”) in excess of 7 days. The Monitor can say that the majority \nof youth are not confined in excess of seven days.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 9 of 25\n \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been seven months after entry of the Court’s \norder on September 21, 2018). The Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A: It has not been ten months after entry of the Court’s \norder incorporating the Agreement. The Monitor will assess compliance with this section \nat the applicable time.  However, the Monitor suggests that the parties and Monitor have \na further discussion on what constitutes “punitive” confinement ahead of the established \nelimination timeframe because there are several types of confinement currently utilized – \ninside and outside the Krueger program - that the Monitor would deem “punitive.” These \ninclude (but are not necessarily limited to) PPB, Resets, Cool offs as being  used at \nLHS/CLS, “reflection,” and times when youth are confined due to some youth acting up \non a unit.   \n \n2. Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative confinement may exceed four hours only under the following \ncircumstances: \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s \nSeptember 21, 2018 Order. The Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. If \nDefendants implement “administrative confinement” in the way it was during the visit, with \nPPB substituting for it, the Monitor believes this may violate this Agreement.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 10 of 25\n \nhours) when: \n \n1.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s \nSeptember 21, 2018 Order. The Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n \ni i.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s \nSeptember 21, 2018 Order. The Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to \n8 am. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Although it has not been six \nmonths after entry of the Court’s September 21, 2018 Order, time is being tolled from 8 pm \nto 8 am.   \nc.  Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s \nSeptember 21, 2018 Order.  The Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s \nSeptember 21, 2018 Order. The Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended pol icy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated on 9/19/18 and dates were corrected. Training on policy changes has \nnot occurred to date although the Monitor has been told it has been discussed in roll call. \nThe Monitor saw meeting notes reflecting the change. The Monitor suggests a more formal \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 11 of 25\n \ntraining and staff sign off reflecting they read and understand policy. Additionally, a quality \nassurance mechanism needs to be created. \n  \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: Non-Compliance.  The Monitor would not deem any room in \nany facility as being “suicide resistant,” however there are safety and security measures \nthat can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides.  With respect to youth rooms, \nthere is no change from the last site visit. Most youth rooms were not clean and organized. \nSeveral rooms had multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of the room making it \ndifficult for staff to assess whether there is contraband that can be harmful to youth inside \nthe rooms or assessing youth activity while in bed.  Most rooms had graffiti and etching \non the glass which makes it difficult for staff to clearly see the youth through the window. \nThere are beds and screening in some rooms that create increased suicide risk. The \nMonitor has been told and shown that quotes have been received to replace the furniture \nin rooms and other modifications.  \n \nRoom checks are not well documented and not being done on an individual basis. The \nMonitor personally observed that room check forms continue to be kept in the staff office.  \nSafety/welfare  documentation  show  that  room  checks  are  not  being  completed  in \nstaggered intervals and some were completed more than 30 minutes apart. The Monitor \nalso observed staff fill in the logs well after the fact and not contemporaneous with the \nroom check.   The Monitor recognizes that an electronic system is being explored by the \nagency, but this will take some time. Safety/welfare checks need to be a priority and the \nMonitor hoped that the recommendations made would have been implemented by the \ntime this second site visit occurred.  While not required by the Court Order, the Monitor \ncontinues to recommend increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum \nof every 15 minutes when youth are confined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. A common complaint among youth \nin rooms without toilets (dry rooms) is that staff are very slow to respond when they indicate \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 12 of 25\n \nthey need to use the restroom. Administration investigated this complaint and it was proven \nthat this is in fact occurring frequently.  There is no documentation created to show whether \nthis requirement is being met or not. Defendants need to create a form, policy, and quality \nassurance measures as to this section and others.  Administration needs to continue to \ninvestigate and hold staff accountable until the problem is fixed.  Staff need to be held \naccountable should an investigation reveal the delay is purposeful. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no \nlater than two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nbut still needs more improvement.  Time of call to PSU staff is now being documented on \nthe incident report. This requirement should be included in the development of a quality \nassurance program. \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Monitor  requested  any \ndocumentation  indicating  that  confinement  is  contraindicated  and  there  were  no \ninstances documented. There is a form “Psychology Input for Security Decision” which \nis  where  the  contraindication  would  be  documented  and  there  is  a  policy  (Policy \n500.70.04) Again, as with all policies, a section should be created to include quality \nassurance and monitored by facility administrators. \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 13 of 25\n \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The Monitor’s recommendations \nremain the same as the last report to the Court. Safety/welfare checks continue to be kept \nin the staff office and not kept on each individual door thus, contemporaneous recording \nis impossible.  Every room should have individual room check sheets in which times are \nnot pre-printed or pre-written.  A section should be included for staff to describe a youth’s \nactivities while in room. Although RHU no longer existed at the time of the site visit, it did \nexist during this reporting period. The room checks in RHU are preprinted with times \nand only contain space for staff initials.  Review of staff discipline showed that staff were \nnot disciplined for failure to complete these checks/falsifying. Although the requirement \nin this Court Order is “at least every 30 minutes” the Monitor recommends that every \nyouth should have a visual inspection at least every 15 minutes at staggered intervals. This \nis supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the \nBest Practice Model. The agency should make an electronic, software-based rounds \nchecking system a priority.  PSU staff do visit youth daily when on site. \n \nf.   Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary in \nnature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Some  rooms  contained  more \nproperty than outlined in handbooks.  Some rooms had less property in their rooms (RHU, \nTargeted Intervention Unit (“TIP”) and Krueger Unit). Because staff do not consider “PPB,” \n“resets,” “reflection,” “cool offs,” or on occasions where they confine youth to their rooms \nif/there is a situation on the living unit involving a couple/few youth, etc. as confinement, the \nMonitor could not confirm whether this was restricted as needed for safety. Documentation \nneeds to be improved as to this requirement and confinement needs to be recorded. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Social  worker  visits,  mental \nhealth  services,  and  other  health  services  are  provided,  however  there  is  a  lack  of \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 14 of 25\n \ndocumentation and quality of services is difficult to assess.  \n \n11.  Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Programming  is  inconsistent.  \nThere is a lack of documentation as to specific programming that occurs daily. There does \nnot seem to be programming when youth are on PPB or, according to the Krueger handbook, \nin Phase 1 of the program. Also, there are occasions where staffing levels do not allow for \nplanned  programming.  In  addition  to  the  concerns  about  formal  rehabilitative \nprogramming, there is also a significant lack of other activities for youth to engage in, \nresulting in excessive amounts of idle time and excessive hours of room confinement. This \noccurs especially, but not only, on weekends). \n \n111.   Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Educational Services for general \npopulation occur in the classrooms in the school area. Youth in the Targeted Intervention \nProgram (“TIP”) attend classes in the school area but separate from the general population. \nYouth in RHU/Krueger do not receive educational services in the school area (except for \nyouth on Phase 3) but remain on living units.  RHU “secure treatment unit out time record” \nreflect less times spent in education than do the PbS activity logs, although it is unclear how \naccurate the RHU (Krueger) records are. Secure treatment unit out time records raise \nsignificant concerns as to what, if any education the youth in Krueger are receiving.  A \nreview of the logs in February show many days where no education is listed or only shows \none period of education.  The youth receive packets to be completed on the Unit.  Youth \ncontinue to be “suspended” from school. PbS data is not available for this reporting period, \nhowever, it does not appear that youth are engaged in educational activities for more time \nthan during the last visit. Youth stated in interviews that they often do not attend classes or \nparticipate in educational services.  Youth should be engaged in educational activities \n(regardless of unit) as a primary program during normal school hours. This should be \nbetween 5-6 hours per school day. As reflected in the staffing section of this report, the \ncurrent teacher vacancy rate remains at 39% (11 of 28 allocated positions) is mostly likely \nimpacting the ability of youth to be in school for longer periods.  There are classes available \nin welding, business class, and construction, however youth do not seem to actively engage \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 15 of 25\n \nin these programs. Moreover, youth who have graduated are reportedly not allowed to \nparticipate in these programs at all.  Staff should encourage participation and consider \nadding  other  programs  that  youth  will  participate  in.  Educational  hours  need  to  be \nincreased for all youth on a daily basis.  The Monitor recommends that all youth regardless \nof status have education in the school area or, at a minimum, off their living unit. The \nMonitor also recommends culturally relevant  programming/materials be offered. The \nMonitor has also connected the agency with an education consultant who can be used to \nassist in enhancing the education program.  \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Youth  are  only  allowed  out  in \ngroups of two in which they rotate back into room every 45 minutes in the new Krueger \nprogram and former RHU according to staff.  In youth interviews, youth stated that they \nspend most of the time in their rooms and when they are out of their rooms, they do not \nreally do anything. There is not any real programming in Phase 1 of the Krueger Program \nand not a lot in Phase 2. There is limited out time, limited phone calls, no or little television, \nyouth cannot move without permission and have assigned seats, and the limited amount of \nrecreational time is unstructured.  Phase 3 has a little more sensory stimulation. The Monitor \nrecognizes that the Krueger program is in pilot form, and will further assess at the next site \nvisit, but the Monitor recommends that the leadership re-evaluate the program to ensure \ncompliance with the Court Order and technical assistance report.  Enhancing programs and \nmeaningful activities for the Krueger program should have a positive impact and allow for \nyouth to be out of their rooms for significantly longer periods of time than is now being \nachieved. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Majority of meals take place out \nof the room but there are occasions where youth eat meals in their rooms when there is \nnot an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm.  The Monitor witnessed some \nyouth eating in their rooms and have seen this documented in shift reports. Should a youth \neat a meal in their room, the decision by staff needs to be justified, supported by \ndocumentation, and instances need to be reviewed by facility administrators.  \n \nv1.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 16 of 25\n \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Logs indicate that there are many \ninstances where youth are not receiving 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week. \nThis is particularly true on weekends and on other days when there is no school, and for \nyouth in Krueger Phase I or PPB. However, actual non-compliance may be more extensive \ndue to the failure to document many forms of room confinement throughout the facility and \nthe lack of consistent contemporaneous documentation. Documentation, data collection and \nreliability make it difficult for the Monitor to assess level of compliance, and the failure to \nimprove data collection may result in a future finding of non-compliance. \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.   Many youths utilize the grievance \nprocedures. However, youth still feel the process is confusing and some reported that staff \nwere not following the grievance procedure as required by policy.  It is not clear whether \nyouth are being told that they can grieve their placements in room confinement at all (or \nwithin 15 minutes of placement). Moreover, because staff are not considering PPB, resets, \nreflection, and many other forms of room confinement as confinement, the Monitor does not \nbelieve this requirement is being met in such situations (i.e. staff is not providing the required \nnotice because they do not believe they have to do so). The Monitor does suggest that a more \nrobust tracking system be developed with a quality assurance piece that ensures grievances \nare being timely and appropriately addressed and communicated to youth. The Monitor \ndescribed and showed examples of quality assurance measures to create. The Court Order \nrequires  documentation  of  all  forms  of  room  confinement  which  is  not  being  done.  \nDocumentation needs to be implemented and consistently applied to all situations, other than \nsleeping hours, in which youth are confined alone in their rooms, regardless of what unit \nthey are in or the reason for the confinement. The failure to do so may result in a future \nfinding of non-compliance. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation, data collection \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 17 of 25\n \nand reliability, and quality assurance needs to be improved. \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants need to continue to \nimplement their OC reduction plan.  On 2/1/19 Defendants moved into the second phase of \nOC  removal  from  posts.  Currently  one  person  on  each  unit  is  carrying  OC  (the \npatrols/responders, and the supervisors) There are youth still being sprayed in instances \nwhere lesser means could have been used (video of several instances were viewed during the \nsite visit), and spray is being used to “prevent self-harm” when other means could have been \nused. The OC reduction plan should involve training staff on a variety of de-escalation skills \nas well as a directive that OC should only be used in situations that present a serious life \nsafety or threatening situation.  The expanded use of CARE Teams can greatly assist in de-\nescalating situations and ultimately reducing the use of OC.  Additionally, as recommended \nin the technical assistance report, a new incentive-based behavior management program that \nfocuses on rewarding positive behavior should be created which will have a direct impact on \nyouth behavior and thus, reduce the need for force of any kind.  There has been a significant \ndecrease in the use of OC spray over the last three months (eighteen (18) incidents from \nDecember through February compared to forty (46) incidents the prior three months).  \nThere remains a need to focus on staff de-escalation training and skills development as well \nas a need to improve the overall atmosphere and culture of the environment in order to \nreduce incidents of violence.  Merely reducing or modifying the intervention protocols for \nthese types of incidents is not a sufficient response.   \n \nThe below graph reflects the combined usage of OC at LHS and CLS in 2018/2019. \n \nLHS/CLS 2018 Combined Chemical Restraint Use  \n25\n21\n20\n20 18\n14 14\n15\n12\n11\n10\n9 9\n10 8\n5 5\n5 3\n0\nJan 18  Feb 18 Mar 18 Apr 18  May  Jun 18  Jul 18  Aug 18 Sep 18 Oct 18 Nov 18 Dec 18 Jan 19 Feb 19\n18\nLHS/CLS Combined\n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 18 of 25\n \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  Compliance will be assessed by the Monitor at the time \nrequired under this section. \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The Monitor did not personally \nsee any youth in mechanical restraints during site visits, but logs show there are occasions \nwhere youth are placed in mechanical restraints and there was one instance of a youth in \nthe belt restraint. Although documentation needs to be improved, there seems to have been \nconsiderable improvement made in this area. With better documentation, and quality \nassurance measure, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Mechanical restraints are rarely \nused. There needs to be a continuous effort to monitor youth who are placed in mechanical \nrestraints and consistent documentation. It is difficult to measure compliance based on lack \nof documentation. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \nMechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \n1. \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Documentation  needs  to  be \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 19 of 25\n \nimproved and a quality assurance mechanism in place. \n \n11.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved and quality assurance mechanism in place. \n \ni ii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved and quality assurance mechanism in place. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Use of mechanical restraints has \nbeen reduced significantly. Documentation needs to be improved and quality assurance \nmechanism needs to be in place. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved and quality assurance mechanism needs to be in place. \n \nf.   Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation.  However, de-escalation training needs to be completed more often \n(regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue to develop this skill.  Proper de-\n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 20 of 25\n \nescalation cannot be trained only once a year.  The Monitor suggested having staff who are \nvery good at de-escalation work with staff who could use a refresher or with new staff.  \nDuring the site visit, there was a unit that was out of control and when the Monitor talked \nwith staff, they all had been at LHS/CLS for a year or less.  Documentation needs to be \nimproved and a quality assurance mechanism needs to be in place. \n \ng.   Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No  youth shall be  left alone  in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: NON-COMPLIANCE/PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The Monitor \nreported  in  her  last  report  that  strip  searches  significantly  decreased.  However,  strip \nsearches without probable cause were reinstituted in January 2019, including strip searching \nall youth at intake.  On March 15, 2019, a memo was issued to staff to discontinue strip \nsearches without probable cause.  Staff are doing a “hygiene” check which requires a youth \nto strip to underwear and bra which seems to be replacing the “strip search.” This type of \nsearch should only be used for the same reasons as a strip search when utilized for this \npurpose (probable cause of youth possessing drugs or weapons that could not be discovered \nthrough less intrusive means). As previously stated, the policy for searches need to be \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 21 of 25\n \namended to reflect the language in this section. \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. It does not appear that less intrusive \nsearches are attempted before a strip search is conducted. Staff are not conducting pat down \nsearches.  This was confirmed with leadership at LHS/CLS. Additionally, hygiene checks go \nbeyond  tank  top  or  other  clothes  (youth  are  stripped  to  underwear  and/or  bras.)  \nDocumentation needs to be improved.  \n \n3.  Process for strip searches. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved as to how staff are ensuring that unintended individuals cannot view the search \n(detail the area where search is occurring, state that there are no recording devices, and \ndocument who is present in the area, etc.) \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved detailing the area where search is conducted and how other youth cannot view the \nyouth being strip searched. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nd.   \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved as to which staff conducted the search, that the search is by staff who is of the same \ngender identity as the youth if the strip search is being conducted by someone other than a \nmedical professional. \n \ne.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 22 of 25\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Training records indicate that \nmajority of staff have been trained in trauma informed care.  Documentation needs to be \nimproved as to strip searches.  \n \n \nf.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor is told by direct care \nstaff and mental staff that mental health is consulted. Documentation needs to be improved.  \n \n4.  Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most staff have been trained in the \nnew MANDT training and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. The \nMonitor recommends increasing the training frequency for staff to increase their experience \nand skill levels in managing and de-escalating situations before they result in the use of \nrestraint and/or isolation.  Although there is a use of force review process, it needs to be \nthorough and comprehensive, include a corrective action plan when force was used where it \ncould have been avoided, and timelier than they are being done. The Monitor recommended \nin instances where de-escalation was successful, they should be used as a training tool.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of id le time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Many recommendations were made \nin  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report  that  have  not  been  implemented. \nCounselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in \ncreating  and  leading  programming  for  youth.    Several  staff  had  suggestions  for \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 23 of 25\n \nprogramming such as art therapy, dog therapy, increased tournaments, job readiness skills, \nmusic, balance and restorative justice, and teen court. Administration needs to increase \nmeaningful/structured program and activity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours.  \nAs mentioned previously, increasing education hours can greatly assist in reducing idleness \ntime and provide positive youth development strategies through meaningful education and \nvocational programming.  Recreation and exercise schedules are every other day according \nto staff and appear to be inconsistent and often limited.  Extended recreation should be \nconsidered. The volunteer coordinator has contacted several potential community partners \nhowever, the Monitor is unaware if this was successful and hopefully, continued efforts are \nmade.  The Defendants have identified funding to pay for a consultant that can assist with \ndeveloping gender and culturally appropriate programming. The Monitor is working on \ngathering potential experts for Defendants to consider.  \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Some of the recommendations made \nin the February 2018 report have been implemented such as  hiring bonuses and staff \nrecognition.  There has been a huge reduction in vacancy rates for direct care staff.  There \nstill are staffing challenges due various employee leaves. Other recommendations have not \nbeen implemented such as developing wellness programs in order to retain current staff, \nutilizing suggested recruiting efforts, redrafting job descriptions and job postings which \nhighlights  the  youth  counselor  aspect  of  position  instead  of  “guard”  or  “corrections” \ndescription, rewrite position summary, reassess current staff schedules and placement, part-\ntime staff to fill in the gaps and/or outside security firms to supplement existing staff,  or \nassessing and ensuring staff are not working too much overtime. Given the long-standing \nstaffing deficiencies, there is an urgent need to also explore methods for promptly reducing \nyouth populations. This might include expediting the OJOR process and evaluating youth \nfor placement under community supervision, including intensive community supervision, as \npermitted by state law. \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  DOC has identified sections of the Administrative Code that \nneed to be modified, but significant revisions have not yet occurred.  The Monitor has been \ntold implementation will take some time as it requires certain Codes to be repealed and \nrecreated.  All policies  refer to the Administrative Code and thus modifications to the \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 24 of 25\n \nAdministrative Code should be a priority.  Interim policies should be considered. \n \nII.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any \nincident  that  involved  the  use  of  force;  OC  spray;  room  confinement;  or \nmechanical restraints used for more than 45 minutes (excluding during \ntransportation). The review committee will include all staff directly involved in the \nincident, their supervisors, the social worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who \nare  familiar  with  the  youth,  the  facility  director  of  security,  the  deputy \nsuperintendent, and the superintendent.  Within 24 hours, all available members of \nthe review committee shall meet to assess whether physical force, OC spray, room \nconfinement, or mechanical restraints were used appropriately, to discuss less \nrestrictive alternative strategies that staff could have used, and to provide an \nopportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If not all members of the \nreview committee are available for the meeting within 24 hours, the full review \ncommittee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later than one week after \nthe event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of strip searches weekly \nto ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon probable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Although reviews occur for most \nincidents, the reviews often occur well after the 24-hour timeframe.  Often, the reviews do \nnot occur until 3-4 weeks after the incident. Staff involved are not brought together for \nmeaningful discussions.  When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, \nthere is not a corrective action plan developed. The Monitor made suggestions to the \nSuperintendent as to this section during the site visit utilizing specific incidents occurring \nduring the reporting period.   \n \nB.  Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    (Please  see  the  “general \nobservations” section of this report for explanation.) \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Defendants have made improvements with reducing mechanical restraints, reducing OC \nusage, decreasing vacancy rates for direct care staff, creating new positions to help with data \ncollection and quality assurance, identifying funding for various outside experts and funding for \nphysical plant improvements.  Continued efforts need to be made and the Monitor is hopeful that \nimprovements as identified in this report will be evident during the next site visit. The Monitor is \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 110   Filed: 04/17/19   Page 25 of 25\n \nhappy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n25 \n ",

LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nSEVENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Sixth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on July 9, 2020. The Monitor’s seventh \nreport  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree,  implementation  of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the sixth site visit which took place on May 15, 2020.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe seventh site visit by the Monitor took place on September 17, 2020.  Due to the pandemic, the \nMonitor limited onsite time to one day and completed necessary interviews/information gathering \nvia virtual meetings over the following two weeks after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to and after the site visit for the reporting period ending \nAugust 31, 2020. Materials included but were not limited to: Covid-19 related memos, directives \nand plans, programming materials, project plans, grievances, various staff memos, daily shift \nreports, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order (June, July, and August \n2020),  updated  unit  rules,  work  rules,  employee  leave  data,  behavior  and  treatment  plans, \nmechanical restraint documentation, incident reports, and other housing documentation.  Due to \nCovid-19 (reducing visitors during this time), only the monitoring team was on site during this site \nvisit. Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted youth interviews virtually. The Monitor took photographs, \ntoured LHS/CLS, and interviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to the \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 2 of 35\n \nmajority of youth and staff present during the site visit. Approximately fifty-nine (59) youth and \nthirty-four (34) staff were interviewed formally and informally by the Monitor during this site \nvisit.   \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction \n \nIt is important to note that during the evaluation period, the pandemic, Covid-19, is still impacting \nthe world. The systematic changes required to stop the spread of this infectious disease were still \nin place during this site visit with some modifications. LHS/CLS as well as other institutions \ndeveloped an emergency operation plan with the goal of mitigating any potential exposures to \nCovid-19.  The Governor put a temporary transfer hold in which LHS/CLS did not receive new \nadmissions from March 26, 2020 until August 10, 2020.  From August 10 to present, new \nadmissions occurred every two weeks. There is quarantine living space for the girls and boys \nconsistent with CDC and Wisconsin public Health guidelines. All staff are required to wear masks \nas of July 13, 2020. Youth are encouraged to wear masks.  All staff and visitors entering the \nfacilities are screened with a questionnaire and temperature check prior to being allowed to enter \nthe facilities.  No youth have tested positive for Covid-19 as of the site visit.  \n  \nDue to a combination of reducing frequency of new youth admits and working to get youth out \nmore quickly, the total LHS/CLS population declined to below 70 youth.  The Monitor is happy \nto see that the population continues to decline. As stated many times, having fewer youth and \nkeeping them together with consistent, individualized and improved staffing ratios can reduce \nincidents, improve relationships between youth and staff, which benefits youth and staff alike. \nProgram modifications continued due to the pandemic including, but not limited to: no in person \nvisitation (virtual visitation occurred frequently); youth are still e-learning and the units continue \nto not comingle; PSU, teachers, social workers, and other staff rotate and conduct services virtually \nwhen they could not be done in-person. Although youth and staff had relatively good attitudes, the \nMonitor noticed a change in the overall atmosphere from the last visit.  Staff were not interacting \nwith youth and overall seemed frustrated.  Staff seem concerned about the lack of negative \nincentives and punishments, especially in light of closing the Krueger program. There clearly is a \nneed for change in the incentive structures.  Hopefully, the new DBT and behavioral modification \ntraining will train staff to interact with youth in ways that minimize negative interactions and \nincrease positive behavior.  Moreover, there are not enough positive incentives provided (which \ncould be taken away if youth misbehave).  This will help a great deal with managing youth \nbehavior. \nPhysical Plant \nThe grounds and the general areas of the facility were the cleanest the Monitor has ever seen thus \nfar.   Seven (7) of the twelve (12) cottages have been remodeled to date (Wells, Miller, Dubois, \nCurtis, King, Black Elk, and Roosevelt) and the new staff breakroom was completed during the \nlast site visit and now is being utilized (it was closed due to Covid-19).  Additional projects not \nyet  completed  are  the  camera  upgrade,  electrical  upgrade,  and  remaining  cottage  remodels \n(scheduled for end of 2020 and beginning of 2021).  The Monitor will continue to update the Court \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 3 of 35\n \non physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and staff.   \nAll of the entrances into the units, the bathrooms, and day rooms were very clean and orderly in \ngeneral. The level of cleanliness of youth rooms were far better than any previous visit. Youth and \nstaff should truly be commended for all of their efforts.  \nThe Monitor previously recommended that searches of all buildings be conducted to maintain a more \norderly and safer environment.  Prior to Covid-19, Defendants regularly conducted and documented \nsearches. However, search procedures were modified due to Covid-19 emergency procedures.  The \nDefendants have taken the Monitor’s recommendation, and reinstituted room and facility searches \nthroughout the facility and pat down searches of youth.   \nSchool/Living Units Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage (except Hughes due to an incident occurring at the time of site \nvisit) and toured the school during the site visit.  The school continues to be a beautiful environment. \nThe classrooms and the general school area were very clean.  Yet, youth were not present in the \nschool due to educational services continuing to be held virtually and on the units. A couple of the \nteachers were present in the school area.  On March 24, 2020, the schools began providing \neducation on the units with most education staff working off-site, and this is ongoing.  Meetings \nhave occurred to discuss how to safely return youth to in-person learning or at least providing \neducation off of the living units.  The Monitor highly recommends a plan be implemented to return \nyouth to the school area as soon as reasonably possible. Music, art, and recreation still occurred \nwith a goal of increasing the frequency.  Grandparents program supervisor facilitating youth \nvolunteer work/programming and one on one PSU sessions occur in the school area.  Students \nhave Zoom meetings with teachers when needed. Teachers checked in regularly with unit staff and \nstudents and are able to monitor youth’s progress through Edgenuity. Of course, e-learning is not \nthe preferred format for teaching, but during the pandemic, many learning institutions have taken \nthis approach. However, a number of youth and staff complained and had difficulties with this \nformat, especially the inability to ask questions and receive real time feedback from teachers. As \nthe country slowly opens up and education in various areas around the country and Wisconsin are \nmoving to a hybrid or full in-person model, LHS/CLS should consider adjusting the education \nprogram as well. At a minimum, increased teacher access, such as moving to live e-learning will \ngreatly impact all youth, but especially those with IEPs.   In discussions with the educational staff, \nthey are eager to return to in person instruction. On a positive note, educational staff’s professional \ndevelopment is continuing to regularly occur.  \nThe Monitor was told that retaining the educational consultant has been put on hold due to the \npandemic.  The Monitor encourages the Defendants to engage the consultant further and work to \naddress the concerns raised – including the need for more deep and meaningful teacher interaction \nwith  youth,  enhancing  or  expanding  the  daily  education  hours,  and  implementing  the \nrecommendations  made  by  the  consultant  and  the  Monitor  with  respect  to  staffing  and  the \neducational  program  for  LHS/CLS.    Lack  of  educational  hours  and  structure  is  contributing \nnegatively to the environment.  The Monitor believes that the major contributing factor to this issue \nis the increased time youth spend on their living units due not being able to attend education classes \nin the school.  Youth are clearly bored and in need of environment and atmosphere changes \nthroughout the day to help reduce mental fatigue, anxiety and boredom.  \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 4 of 35\n \nThere continues to be more than adequate staffing levels on the living units. The Monitor saw \nlimited staff engagement with youth.   Youth attitudes overall were good during this site visit but not \nas positive as the last visit.   All the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful but were \nless interested in interacting with the monitoring team.   The Monitor had an opportunity to talk to \nmost of the youth present in the day rooms.   \nThe RFID system has been fully implemented for the completion of safety/welfare checks. During \nthe last reporting period, Defendants were unable to provide data with respect to safety/welfare \nchecks.  The Defendants have corrected these issues and were able to provide data/reports to the \nMonitor. DJC continues to work on creating and refining reports regarding various outcomes \nincluding youth confinement by date, type, and youth, track length of confinement and reasons for \nconfinement.  \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed on the Wells cottage (female population is very low at \n4).  King is being utilized as the female quarantine unit.  One youth was on the King unit as she was \na new admission.  The atmosphere on the girls’ units was positive.  The girls were not as engaged \nwith the Monitor as in previous visits. Youth in general stated that they were bored but in general \nhad  no  major  complaints.  On  Wells,  one  youth  was  in  her  room  (due  to  mental  health \nrecommendations) and two youth were in the day room eating and doing homework. The girls were \nin good spirits.  The rooms on the unit were clean and orderly with beds made. The Monitor \nobserved staff in the staff office on the unit.  The staff present knew the youth very well and were \nrelatively talkative with the Monitor.  \nKing was clean and very beautifully decorated. The rooms in general were clean and the unit itself \nwas clean and orderly. Only one youth was present on the unit.  The youth on the unit was \ncompleting her homework and doing puzzles. She had a good attitude and enjoyed being on the unit \nalone.  The staff present spends a lot of one on one time with the youth.   \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, generally, the cottages themselves were very clean. The \nMonitor did not observe any graffiti anywhere in LHS/CLS.  This is a huge improvement from \nprevious visits. The Monitor recommended during the last couple of site visits that staff adjust \ntheir placement since youth can more freely move around the unit (some youth in day room, \noutside, in and out of their rooms, and bathroom).  Unfortunately, staff were mainly positioned in \ntheir office or on perimeter of the living unit. During this site visit, staff in general were not \ninteracting with the youth at all nor were they positioned near/with the youth (except for one staff \nmember).  \nAs of June 30, 2020, the Krueger Program was discontinued and no longer houses a special \nprogram unit thus, youth were not housed on the Krueger living unit.  The unit was being \nremodeled during this time.  \nIn Black Elk, the entry way, day room, and bathroom were very clean.  Youth rooms on this unit \nwere the messiest of all the units.  One (1) youth was voluntarily in his room. Nine (9) youth were \nout in the day room appropriately interacting with each other and staff. Most youth were engaged \nin schoolwork. The atmosphere was calm, and youth and staff were very talkative with the \nmonitoring team. Youth talked to the Monitor about being bored and that they have nothing to do.  \nYouth would like to get off of the unit more and do in person schooling in the school area. Staff \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 5 of 35\n \nstill like the 12-hour shift. \n \nThe Rogers unit was clean.  Entry way, bathroom, and day rooms were clean.  All eleven (11) \nyouth were out of their rooms (no confinement). Youth were out cleaning.  This was the loudest \nunit by far.  There were two (2) staff on the unit. Staff were positioned around the unit.  Unlike \nlast visit (unit was calm and quiet and wanted to engage with the Monitor), youth were loud and \ndid want to engage much with the Monitor.  Youth stated that they wanted to be able to use the \nbathroom more than one person at a time, wanted more gaming systems, wanted to go to the gym \nmore.  Youth want a “calm” or “relaxation” room on the unit. Youth complained about some of \nthe canteen items being stale. The youth also complained about wanting a better barber. Staff are \nvery frustrated on this unit. Staff said youth are acting out and difficult all day.  Staff said there is \nnothing they can do but let the behavior continue because they do not perceive that they have \ncontrol or the ability to impose consequences. Staff also feel there are no incentives for youth to \nearn that have any meaningful impact on behavior.  The Monitor agrees that positive incentives – \nwhich could be taken away if youth engage in anti-social behaviors - need to be increased and \nmade more meaningful to youth needs. \nThe Curtis Unit was clean and quiet.  This was the cleanest unit with the cleanest rooms. Ten (10) \nyouth present on unit with two (2) staff. One staff was in office and one staff was standing on the \nperimeter of the unit. Youth stated that staff do not interact with them and don’t care about them. \nYouth were in the day room watching television, doing crafts, and one was doing duty work. Not a \nsingle youth was confined.  As in the other units, staff here also stated that all of their tools were taken \naway to manage youth behavior and no meaningful incentives exist to help manage behaviors. \nIn Miller, the entryway, day room, and bathroom were relatively clean.  Youth rooms was generally \nclean.  Eleven (11) youth were in the day room and no one was confined. Three (3) staff were working \non the unit. Youth were in the day room eating. It was noticeable that there were not any cushions on \nthe furniture.  Youth were sitting on wood. Overall, the unit was calm. All of the youth talked with \nthe Monitor.  Youth complained about being bored and wanting to go to school.  They also \ncomplained that they only received 45 minutes of outside time. The facility should work to increase \nexercise and outdoor time for youth as this would reduce idleness and likely reduce anti-social \nbehaviors. They also stated that they would like the ping pong table to be fixed.  Staff stated that \nthey did not feel safe and that the boys were becoming increasingly aggressive.  \n \nThe Dubois unit was very clean. Most youth rooms were clean. Youth were eating in the day room \nand some were watching television. There were ten (10) youth on the unit. There were two (2) staff \non the unit. One was in the booth and one was just outside the booth. The Monitor spoke to 9 of the \n10 youth.  Three youth loved the food. None of the youth like e-learning and definitely are eager for \nschool to go back to “normal.” I asked the youth why they run around outside and climb buildings \nand they said because they are really bored and have nothing to do. Youth were extremely polite and \nwell behaved when the Monitor was on the unit.  \n \nIn Roosevelt, the entryway, day room, and bathrooms were clean. Youth rooms were a mix of \nclean and messy.  There were unoccupied rooms that were used as storage.  There were a lot of \ndead bugs in these unoccupied rooms (rooms 11, 12,13, and 14). There was a total of eight (8) \nyouth and six (6) staff on unit. Seven (7) youth were outside playing basketball with one staff and \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 6 of 35\n \nthe other youth was on the unit doing e-learning. No youth were confined. Youth were chatty and \nquite funny.  Youth said they would like to see Oreos in canteen, the food in general was good, \nand they would like to have the opportunity for more Zoom calls. One staff was engaged with \nyouth and one PSU staff was talking with another youth.  The staff were very quiet and did not \nseem happy overall. Staff said youth were bored and had nothing to do.  The staff suggested more \nfences around the recreation area to prevent youth from running into other areas. Staff were \nconfused as to what the “Roosevelt” unit was in terms of general population or TIP.   \n \nWhat is very clear is that there is still a need for additional structured programming overall especially \nas youth are on their units the vast majority of the time.  The Monitor has stressed in every report the \nimportance  of  structured  programming  for  youth.  Although  the  Defendants  are  working  on \nimproving this, much more must be done to improve programming and idleness.  It is clear by the \ndata, shift reports, and youth and staff attitudes that boredom is taking its toll.  The Monitor \nunderstands that Covid-19 has required some programming to change/cease, but there still could be \nmore activities for the youth to do.  As previously mentioned, youth are bored and while being out \nof their rooms is certainly an improvement, more meaningful activities and weekend programs \nwould also help reduce the risk of youth engaging in anti-social behaviors when they have little \nelse to do (like climbing on roofs and running around unauthorized areas) – particularly during \nCovid-19 when so many interactions with other youth, family, staff, and educators are now being \ndone virtually. Youth need more to do than simply sitting in the dayroom area watching television \nor  playing  cards.    In  response  to  needing  more  structured,  gender  and  culturally  relevant \nprogramming, Defendants have created a new position of “Program Director.” The job description \nhas been finalized and recruiting has begun. In the meantime, the Defendants need to create and \nimplement a daily schedule.  The Monitor worked with the Defendants on developing a weekly \nschedule with accountability/quality control measures. \n \nIt should also be noted that any improvements in structured and meaningful activities to better engage \nyouth will also have a positive impact on staff well-being and help reduce their frustrations and \nanxiety levels as well.  In turn, this enhances the staff and youth interactions and works to foster \nimproved relationships, awareness and de-escalation of behaviors when necessary.  As mentioned \npreviously, staff are very frustrated with a lack of sanctions to hold youth accountable as well as a \nlack of incentives that will foster improved behaviors as youth focus on earning the incentives and \nrewards.  Improving the behavior management system and improving the rewards and incentives \nwill have a profound impact on the overall behavior and atmosphere issues that are driving the main \nissues that are frustrating both staff and youth. \nYouth Interviews  \nThe Monitor conducted several youth interviews. Approximately fifty-nine (59) youth were \ninterviewed during the site visit (formally and informally).  Plaintiffs’ counsel also interviewed a \nhalf-dozen youth remotely.  There was only one request to talk to Plaintiffs’ counsel. The biggest \ncomplaints from youth since the last visit was the food, canteen out of stock items, being bored, \nmissing school, and phone restrictions.  Youth in general did not complain to the Monitor about \nconfinement, restraints, being unfairly treated by staff, feeling unsafe, phone restrictions or their \nRFID bracelets.  \nYouth did complain to counsel about use of physical force, staff being too quick to use administrative \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 7 of 35\n \nconfinement, keeping youth in administrative confinement even after they have calmed down, \nmissing  school  while  they  are  in  administrative  confinement,  and  the  inadequacy  of  virtual \nschooling. They also requested more frequent zoom calls. \nThe most common complaint this visit was being bored, having nothing to do, and not getting off \nthe living units much.  The common complaint regarding staff was that staff did not care about \nthem and did not interact with them and staff “go through the motions.”  The third most common \ncomplaint was missing being in school.  The fourth most common complaint was issues with \ncanteen.  The Monitor suggested that LHS/CLS leadership continue to work with the vendor and \nthe  business  office  to  fix  this  communication  problem  and  also  consider  an  on-site  mini \ncanteen/commissary of items that youth desire should their canteen order be unavailable/stale etc., \nor as other incentives.  As the Monitor previously stated, the youth work hard to earn points and \nin turn, earn canteen privileges. The issues with canteen have been going on long enough and it is \nunacceptable that the issues with canteen have not been fixed to date.  The challenges with canteen \nis a management issue (unit staff accountability) and external with the vendor/business office.  \n \nCovid-19 required several changes to programming and the general day to day with youth; not just \nat LHS/CLS but in every juvenile facility.  Regular programming is slowly resuming in various \ncorrectional facilities around the country. Defendants are and should continue to identify more \nresources and continue to implement the programs as recommended by the retained experts. The \nDefendants should take advantage of the reduced population and the available staff in planning for \nthe future and developing programs for youth and continuing to offer more creative and other \nactivities for youth while in-person interaction is limited.  If additional programming – and \nespecially culturally competent programming - is not available in the vicinity of this facility, that \nremains a serious concern and one that should lead to an increased sense of urgency to move youth \ncloser to locations where such programs and services are available. \n \nStaffing  \n \nDuring this reporting period, there have been a few key staffing changes.  The new Superintendent \nof LHS/CLS is active in his new role.   In September, an individual has been promoted to Safety \nDirector.  A new psychology Supervisor has been hired (promoted from another position within \nLHS/CLS). There are four new PSU interns. Two new Unit Supervisor positions have been created \nwhich will allow for the Unit Supervisors to supervise two units. Recruiting is currently underway. \n \nAuthority to fill the vacant Chaplain position has not yet been granted to the division at the time \nof the site visit.  However, as of September, CLS/LHS secured an agreement with Stanley \nCorrection Institution in which the Chaplain there is available to meet with youth through tele-\nvisitations upon a youth’s request.  The Educational Assistant recruitment process has been \nmoving through the required stages since the position was posted for applicants on August 24. \nFirst round interviews for the position were held on October 16. The Monitor hopes there can be \nexceptions made to any hiring freezes for any key positions at LHS/CLS in order to meet the \nrequirements of this Court Order.  \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has increased from the last reporting period (see below).  \nThere have been 25 new direct-care staff hired during this reporting period. There are 311 total \npositions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS.  Approximately 153 of these positions are “direct-care” staff \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 8 of 35\n \n(Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  The teacher vacancy rate remains \nhigh (7 vacancies- one less that last reporting period). Hiring for educational staff has not occurred \nduring this reporting period due to Covid-19 and education being online. The Monitor encourages \ncontinuing to recruit teachers despite the reduced population and challenges with Covid-19.  \nRecruiting is still a challenge due to the location of the facility, overall teacher shortages, relatively \nlow compensation, location of LHS/CLS, and the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring \nneeds to continue.  As previously mentioned, the entire educational program at LHS/CLS needs to \nbe evaluated and improved. \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \nSept. 6, 2019  January 30, 2020  May 13, 2020  September 19, 2020 \n \nYouth   14% (15 out of 105)  7% (8 of 115)  8.6% (10 out of 115)  18.2% (21 out of 115) \n \nCounselor \n, 2020  \nYouth  7% (3.5 out of 50)  15% (5.5 of 37.5)  13% (5 out of 37.5)  12% (4.5 out of 37.5) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  36% (10 of 28)  32% (8 of 25)  32% (8 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25) \nSocial Worker  21.5% (3 of 14)  21 % (3 of 14)  21% (3 out of 14)  21% (3 out of 14) \n  \nIn August, the third staff survey regarding the 12-hour shift (which began in Nov. 2019) was \nconducted by the Office of Budget and Programs. Every staff person the Monitor spoke to said \nthey love the new schedule. In the recent survey conducted, a large majority of staff said the 12-\nhour shift had a positive impact on their well-being (approximately 83%). Approximately 62% of \nstaff think the new schedule change has improved the health and safety of staff.  Approximately \n43% of staff feel the length of shift makes them feel physically fatigued.  The Monitor recommends \nthat DJC continue to monitor this issue and provide data tracking measures to assess whether or \nnot fatigue plays a role in any increased incidents or use of restraints or confinement later in a shift \nwhen staff are more fatigued.  The Monitor recommended asking other youth specific questions in \nthe next survey which hopefully will be incorporated. A data driven assessment has not been \ncompleted to date (impact on employee leaves (FMLA, Workers’ Comp, etc.) vacancies, turnover \netc.  There are more staffing issues during this reporting period than last period.  Whether staff are \nordered to work overtime is dependent on which shift and which cottage they work in.  There were \nmore staff comments regarding ordering and breaking protections during this site visit.  The \nMonitor spent time reviewing staffing in general to try and reduce this happening as frequently as \nit is as of late.  \nThe Monitor spoke to over thirty-four (34) staff and the majority of staff seemed tired and felt \nthere were not enough activities for the youth and there were less “tools” available to manage \nbehavior.  Management recognized this and conducted “Administrator Listening Sessions” and \n“Superintendent Town Halls” in which the Division’s vision could be shared and introduced new \nprogramming (DBT and Behavioral Motivation Program) coming to LHS/CLS. Staff were also \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 9 of 35\n \nable to express their concerns and frustrations.  The Monitoring team (in a technical assistance \ncapacity) developed action steps for improving staff morale and safety. This needs to be a priority \nfor the Division.  Staff were definitely not as engaged with the youth this visit. The Monitor \ncontinues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving forward.  \n \nAs part of the agency and facility’s desire to improve conditions for both staff and youth, they are \ncontinuing to engage in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”), which was explained \nin the previous Monitor reports.  The YICPM Core Leadership Team continues to meet and discuss \nimplementation and sustainability of the YICPM model at LHS/CLS. The current focus of the \nCore Leadership Team is the development and implementation of DBT as a behavioral motivation \napproach.  \n \nOn  June  16-17,  2020,  the  Core  Leadership  Team  met  with  consultants  from  Georgetown \nUniversity Center of Juvenile Justice Reform, as part of a quarterly site visit. The site visit was \nconducted via Zoom and focused on three practice model areas; developing a youth’s case plan, \ntransitioning youth into the community and supporting youth in the community. Both days of the \nZoom training sessions were recorded and allowed for additional DJC teams to view the training \nsessions.  \n \nAction steps from the June site visit included continued work implementing the new Youth Growth \nPlan and changes to the case management system at LHS/CLS. Also, leaders from DJC field \ncommunity  supervision  were  tasked  with  continuing  its  efforts  around  Family  Find  and \nEngagement along with improving the transition process when youth are exiting the facility and \nmoving back into a community setting.  \n \nOn September 3, 2020, a video call was conducted with the Georgetown consultants. The focus of \nthe meeting was to develop an agenda for the last site visit in October and discuss the next phase \nof working with the Georgetown evaluator on designing a model to evaluate outcomes. The final \nsite visit will again be conducted via Zoom and will focus on helping staff understand their role as \nchange agents and sustaining change as an agency. A meeting has been scheduled for September \n22, 2020 for the DJC data team to begin discussions with the Georgetown evaluator.  \n \nThe Defendants are also collaborating with Massachusetts Department of Youth Services to \nexplore Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (“DBT”) as a behavior management system. The DBT \nbehavioral motivation project kicked off on July 16, 2020 with an executive leadership meeting \nwith the DBT consultant. The team reviewed a project outline developed by the DBT consultant \nand next steps were discussed.  \n \nOn July 22, 2020, another executive leadership meeting occurred to further discuss organizational \nstructure and designating participants for the DBT Core Leadership team. The results of the facility \nreadiness assessment and the importance of being clear on our DBT goals was discussed, for both \nyouth and staff.  \n \nOn July 29, 2020 and August 5, the DBT consultant presented an overview to over twenty-five \n(25) staff that will be part of the implementation/pilot teams. In the afternoon DBT meeting, with \nthe smaller leadership group, staff were encouraged to think about who should be involved in the \nroll-out and on the pilot units. Staff were also encouraged to formulate the goals for DBT \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 10 of 35\n \nimplementation including: behaviors to increase, behaviors to decrease, and how will we know \nwhen these things are changing and how we will gauge this.  \n \nThe DBT Core Leadership team met again on August 19 and 26, 2020. On August 19, in the \nmorning, Dr. Chapin presented to the large roll-out group of staff (over 20 staff), on basic learning \nprinciples (reinforcement, punishment, extinction, shaping) along with a brainstorming discussion \nabout how to incorporate these principles into the level system and what different things people \nmight like to see go into this. In the afternoon, the smaller leadership group met with a discussion \non goals, behavior management, point system, and system vision. The focus of the meetings was \ndeveloping strategies for enhancing the living unit structure and behavioral motivation system \nredesign. The team focused on a draft of a new living unit program structure. The purpose of the \nnew living unit program structure was to reduce the idle time youth are experiencing on the living \nunits, implement the DBT model, and enhance/overhaul the behavioral motivation system.  \n \nOn September 2, 2020 the Core Leadership team met and went through the living unit program \ndocument.    Modifications  were  made  based  on  team  feedback  and  four  workgroups  were \ndeveloped to further detail the living unit enhancements. The four workgroups are the following: \nInformation  gathered  from  the  self-assessment  will  assist  the  division  once  they  begin \nimplementing the strategic framework for DBT.  The Monitor is happy to see that progress has \nbeen made with implementation of DBT at LHS/CLS. This is clearly a priority for the Defendants \nthat will have very good outcomes for youth and staff. \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor informed the Court that due to Covid-19, contracting with a mental \nhealth consultant was postponed. However, Defendants have identified a potential consultant.  The \nMonitor continues to strongly recommend that the facility obtain a mental health expert to evaluate \nthe programming, staffing, and services that exist at LHS/CLS  – including for youth with \nsignificant mental health needs - and make recommendations on how to address the issues raised \nand improve treatment and services for youth at LHS/CLS. This needs to be a priority item.   \n \nThe Monitor previously recommended that mental health (PSU) staff be integrated more into \noperations in order to provide much needed support for youth and staff.  The Monitor is happy to \nsee that this has begun.   The Defendants should continue to involve PSU staff, especially \nleadership,  in  making  improvements  at  the  facility  (such  as  improvements  to  incentives, \nconsequences, and working with the OJOR system). The Monitor suggested modifying the mental \nhealth (PSU) and recreational staff work schedules to include more evening and weekend hours, \nespecially given the lack of sufficient other structured activities during those times. There are no \ngroups or programming involving PSU on the weekends.  The Monitor continues to recommend \nthat scheduling of PSU be reconsidered (rotate staff if need be, alternating weekends, etc.) or if \nthis is not possible, then hire additional PSU staff to work nights and weekends.  Weekends are \nwhen there is the most idle time and need for additional meaningful programming.  Adding \nweekend programming will also have a positive impact on reducing incidents of violence and other \nbehavioral incidents related to boredom and lack of activities. There really is a missed opportunity \nfor PSU involvement during this period and particularly during Covid-19 when engagement with \nfamily, staff, and other youth are reduced.  \n \nThe CARE team continues to have a very positive impact.  The CARE Team expanded their \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 11 of 35\n \ncoverage over the last few months.  Defendants continue to develop the team in order to maximize \nthe  effectiveness  of  our  CARE  Team  to  prevent,  de-escalate,  and  resolve  youth  incidents. \nFeedback from staff is encouraged as CLS/LHS continue to develop the CARE Team and as they \ngreatly expand this resource for youth and staff.  Defendants are working on documentation and \ndata to analyze the use and effectiveness of the CARE team.  \nStaff wellness remains an important issue and one that continues to impact the overall culture and \natmosphere.  While the Monitor senses that staff are feeling better to some degree, their overall \nwellbeing and anxiety remains high. Staff are very frustrated by a lack of incentives and/or \nconsequences for poor, disrespectful and/or aggressive behaviors.  Resolving these issues is \ncomplex but achievable through a multi-phase response that involves enhancing the behavior \nmanagement system, increasing meaningful activities, rewards, and incentives and establishing \nclear program achievement goals and consequences.   \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor was unable to assess compliance for Visual Monitoring safety/wellness \nchecks due to difficulties in extrapolating the info from the RFID system.  Defendants have remained \ncommitted to ensuring staff accountability in the completion of Visual Monitoring safety/wellness \nchecks since launching its Quality Assurance Review (QAR) process in August 2019. Initial efforts \nresulted in a 98% accuracy rate through randomized video audits; however, the need for staff to record \nextemporaneous observations at staggered intervals continues to be a need for facility improvement.  \n \nIn an effort to support enhanced accountability and real-time documentation, technology was \nintroduced in January 2020 in order to cultivate a culture of accountability across departments and \nstaff positions.  LHS/CLS has outlined a QAR process for Visual Monitoring that integrates the \nsupport of Correction Unit Supervisors (CUS) transitioning to lead in  supporting staff with \ncoaching or re-training, a competency assessment, and progressive follow-up including formalized \njob instructions prior to potential referral to HR for follow up action.  \nTo help ensure consistency in staff follow-up, a detailed process and additional resources have \nbeen developed for CUS leaders including formal policy and procedural acknowledgements for \nstaff, integrated tracking of staff assigned to posts across shifts and living units, and device training \nbriefs and videos. Correction Unit Supervisors are responsible to review their respective unit’s \ndaily reports to identify any missed or late checks and follow-up with identified staff members.  \n \nThe Defendants are working with the RFID company to develop additional customized \nreporting features allowing for additional intelligence gathering, data analysis, and climate \nmonitoring to assist DJC maintain facility security and prevent serious incidents before they \ncan happen. \n \nAdditional real time data collection and tracking data trends across added facility operations \ncaptured by the Guardian RFID system may include:  \n• confinement time  \n• special status checks for youth on observation  \n• recreational activity  \n• educational attendance  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 12 of 35\n \n• completion of facility security rounds  \n• headcounts  \n• meal distribution  \n \nEnhancing  youth  safety  through  ensuring  visual  monitoring  accuracy  with  the  quality \nassurance pilot process in addition to adding the Guardian RFID dashboard reporting feature \nwill allow DJC to even more efficiently and effectively demonstrate compliance with specific \nprovisions of the consent decree. Additionally, the system will assist to inform management \nin making data-driven decisions while seeking to implement further best practices as they \nrelate to the broader scope of DJC’s juvenile correctional practices as a whole.  \n \nDJC analysts have spent time implementing a process for data sharing throughout the facility \nduring this reporting period. An initial five critical outcome measures consisting of incidents \nresulting in administrative confinement, incidents resulting in the use of physical force, CARE \nTeam utilization, youth on staff assaults or attempted assaults, and youth on youth fights or \nbatteries were identified and are reported on monthly divided out based on the living unit in \nwhich the incident or other outcome metric occurred.  \n \nFacility wide critical outcome measures are tracked on a monthly basis and shared with \nmanagement regarding youth on youth batteries or fights, completed youth on staff assaults, \nincidents resulting in administrative confinement, incidents resulting in the use of force, \nincidents resulting in mechanical restraints, as well as additional data pertaining to the use of \nadministrative confinement and mechanical restraints.  \nAs stated in previous reports, a framework for identified outcome measures was developed to align \nwith PbS national benchmarks.  PbS data collection cycles occur twice annually, and the most \nrecent cycle was in April 2020.  Facility Improvement Plans (“FIP”) have been created after the \nmost recent PbS Coach Site Visit.  As a reminder, PbS is a continuous data-driven improvement \nmodel grounded in research that holds juvenile justice agencies, facilities and residential care \nproviders to the highest standards for operations, programs and services.  The FIPs are the vehicles \nfor jurisdictions to continuously bring about meaningful change. They bridge the gap between \nunderstanding and actions to improve the conditions of confinement at a facility, beginning with \nidentifying the specific outcome measure(s) a facility want to improve.  \n \nBased on advice and direction gained through participation in PbS, DJC has decided to reformulate \na Facility Improvement Planning Committee to further integrate the PbS Facility Improvement \nPlans for each school into our overall daily operations. DJC is seeking to broaden the scope of the \nsteering  committee  to  include  a  multi-disciplinary  team  consisting  of  at  least  one  member \nrepresenting each work area within the facility. The members involved in this workgroup are also \ngoing to be a part of developing and implementing additional quality assurance measures and \ntracking consent decree compliance throughout the facility. The Program and Policy Analyst \npositions working on PbS are also concurrently working to update a pre-existing draft PbS policy.     \n \nThe current CLS and LHS FIP’s have been updated after the April data collection and review \nperiod. LHS’ was updated specifically to emphasize decreasing the use of mechanical and physical \nrestraints.  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 13 of 35\n \nOther in-progress areas identified in the FIP’s during this reporting period include: \n•  Social workers are working to develop growth plans  \n•  Started DBT training for pilot buildings.  \n•  Fun Days & Rope Course for youth incentive activities  \n•  New food menus based on youth input  \n•  Town Halls are being held on a regular basis with Superintendent  \n•  Completed a youth survey regarding the Care Mail they were receiving \n•  HR has been updating staff position descriptions to align with PbS  \nPolicies and Procedures  \n \nThere were no new policies/procedures finalized in this reporting period.  A Policy, Performance-\nbased Standards, Data and Quality Assurance workgroup dedicated to identifying and strategically \nprioritizing  policy  and  procedure  updates  related  to  the  consent  decree  and  PbS  facility \nimprovement plans has started work on revising important division policies and facility procedures \nrelated to those core facility priorities. Below is the work done on policies and procedures for this \nreporting period: \n \nFinalized Draft Prepared for Review  \n900.05.03 - Administrative Confinement  \n300.05.07 - Control of Water Supply to Units  \n \nFunctional Draft during implementation of pilot QA process: \n900.05.01 Visual Monitoring \n \nIdentified Need – Drafting Updates to Current Policy/Procedure  \nMechanical Restraints \nSearches of Youth \nGuardian RFID  \nFacility Searches \nUse of Force \nEmergency Response Unit \n \nIdentified Need – New Drafts in Progress \nQA \nShift Report \nCare Team \nRapid Response Team  \nVoluntary Confinement \nEmergency Confinement \nPerformance-based Standards \n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 14 of 35\n \nAdministrative Code There are no significant updates to the Administrative Code.  Below is a \nstatus on specific Chapters.  \n \nDOC Chapter 373 - scope statement submitted to DOA, approved and published in the Legislative \nReference  Bureau.  DOC  Secretary  approved  rulemaking.  DJC  is  moving  forward  with  the \nrulemaking process.   \nDOC  Chapter  376  -  scope  submitted  to  DOA.

Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nincorporate the Court Order into final policy and procedure –and if this improvement is \nsustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for three days.  If Defendants \nincorporate the Court Order into final policy and procedure –and if this improvement is \nsustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 15 of 35\n \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there are \nsome instances of confinement that do not meet the criteria for Administrative Confinement \n– there is no risk of imminent physical harm - and appear to impermissibly constitute \npunitive confinements. Youth are also given “reflection” time which in some instances \nappears to be punitive in nature. The Monitor recommended creating a policy which clearly \noutlines the criteria for administrative confinement so that staff cannot punitively confine \nyouth.  \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he \nor  she  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During this reporting period, the \nKrueger Program was discontinued and thus all youth were in general population. While the \nfacility should be commended for closing this program, the Monitor feels they do need a plan \nor policy in place to outline how youth will be managed in instances where they represent a \nthreat to their own safety or the safety of others.  Staff voiced concerns that they have no \nidea how to manage these situations since the closure of the Krueger Program. There were \nfewer instances in which administrative confinement was being used for youth who did not \npose a serious risk of imminent physical harm (although there were still some such incidents). \nThe Defendants should be commended for not using AC for any youth in CLS during this \nreporting period.  The use of AC for youth who posed a risk of imminent physical harm was \nhigher for LHS youth this reporting period (June-August). The Monitor suggested during \nthe last site visit on how to document this requirement in policy and in forms as well as made \nsuggestions to place youth in the day room once they no longer pose a serious risk of \nimminent physical harm to others.  \n \nFebruary 2020 \nCLS: 9 uses of AC. Average of 152 Minutes. 1 youth went over four \nhours. \nLHS: 59 uses of AC. Average of 168 minutes. 2 youth over four hours. \n \nMarch 2020 \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 16 of 35\n \nCLS: 7 uses of AC. Average of 175 minutes.  \nLHS: 69 uses of AC. Average of 240 minutes.  \n15 youth over four hours (as high as 1300 minutes) \n \nApril 2020 \nCLS: 3 uses of AC. Average of 142 minutes. 1 youth over four hours \nLHS: 40 uses of AC: Average of 191 minutes. No youth over four hours \n \nMay 2020 \nCLS: 5 uses of AC. Average of 182 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 37 uses of AC: no youth over four hours.  \n \nJune 2020 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC \nLHS: 34 uses of AC. Average of 175 minutes. 3 youth over four hours.  3 \nyouth at exactly four hours. \n \nJuly 2020 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC. \nLHS: 46 uses of AC: Average of 171 minutes. 3 youth over four hours. 2 \nyouth at exactly 4 hours.  \n \nAugust 2020 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC. \nLHS: 101 uses of AC. Average of 132 minutes. 3 youth over 4 hours. 3 \nyouth at four hours. \nDBT groups have not been running because of Covid-19 but youth are receiving weekly \nindividual DBT sessions. The Sex Offender Treatment group was not interrupted and is \ncontinuing. The Monitor suggested that the Defendants retain a mental health expert to \nevaluate the program and make recommendations to, among other things, ensure these \nservices are being provided, including while youth are in AC. The Defendants have engaged \na consultant. Policy and procedure and a quality assurance review process needs to be \nimplemented, and documentation needs to be streamlined. \n \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit.  Majority of checks were completed in compliance with \npolicy and this Court Order.  For checks that were not complete, a detailed plan for \naccountability has been created and should be implemented as soon as possible. \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 17 of 35\n \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were nine (9) youth confined \nfor over four (4) hours this reporting period (see response in previous question). All of the \nconfinements were recommended by PSU.   \nWith  this  said,  Defendants  are  accurately  capturing  confinement  time,  number  total \nplacements,  average  confinement  time  per  month,  and  number  of  days  without  AC \nplacements. Defendants now need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring they \nare following this Court Order, draft policy, and procedure with AC placement criteria, and \ncontinue to QA this data. \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During this reporting period, the \nKrueger living unit was closed and no longer houses a special program unit. Defendants need \nto improve their quality of data and documentation with respect to the “commenced plan” \nand incorporate the Court Order into policy and procedure.  Defendants are close to being \nin substantial compliance.  \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours. Defendants need to improve their quality of data and \ndocumentation with respect to the “commenced plan” and incorporate the Court Order into \npolicy and procedure.  Defendants are close to being in substantial compliance.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 18 of 35\n \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated.  The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. A quality \nassurance mechanism needs to be finalized. \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. The Monitor recommended that Defendants replace the \nexisting room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for \nsecure environments.  The Defendants have completed the renovations in seven living \nunits with a plan for completion of the other cottages by July 2021. The new replacement \nfurniture is consistent with what the Monitor would expect to see in a secure facility and \nshould certainly reduce the opportunity for suicidal incidents within the youth rooms. \nThis is a huge investment by Defendants and shows their commitment to complying with \nthis provision. \nThe Monitor did not observe rooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of \nthe room. Staff can clearly see the youth through the window. Room searches were not \ntaking place due to a change in Covid-19 procedures for the most of this reporting period.  \nThe Monitor recommended that searches continue to be completed and documented in \nthe last report.  Defendants have recently reinstituted searches.  \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor  was  unable assess compliance as to the 30- minute \nsafety/security checks.    Defendants were able to pull data related to 30-minute room \nchecks.  There are some instances of non-compliance.  Defendants have created a very \ndetailed action plan to improve compliance and accountability measures. Defendants need \nto modify their policy and procedure related to safety/welfare checks and hold staff \naccountable when appropriate.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues \nto recommend increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every \n15  minutes  when  youth  are  confined  to  their rooms  as  this  is supported  by  JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 19 of 35\n \nDefendants should be commended for the vast improvement on these safety/welfare \nchecks and for investing in the technology needed. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, hygiene supplies, or  nighttime toilet usage. One youth \ncomplained to counsel about nighttime toilet usage.  If Defendants improve their quality of \ndata and documentation, and incorporate the Court Order into policy and procedure, they \nwill be in substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented but when PSU responded is not documented in a way that makes it \neasy to assess compliance.  Also, since PSU staff are not physically present on weekends and \nsome evening hours outside of the four hours they are required to do, it is difficult for PSU \nstaff to engage youth in a meaningful way during this time.   \n \nThere have been good changes in communication which is critical to youth wellness and \ntreatment. Cerner Electronic Medical System has been tailored for the Wisconsin DOC from \nan electronic charting platform within hospital systems, to fit the needs of Wisconsin DOC. \nBoth HSU and PSU staff utilize Cerner’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to document \nmedical and mental health status updates. This includes documentation of all medical \nencounters, treatment, provider orders, medication administration, etc. As a shared system, \na youth’s assigned PSU clinician has access to relevant medicals records such as medication \ncompliance, lab results, injuries, and medical conditions. EMR aids in communication \nbetween HSU-Psychiatry and referrals for additional treatment. It also aids in tracking \ntreatment outcomes and ensuring that follow-ups, for things such as self-harm/observation \nstatus, are completed in a timely manner.   \n \nWith robust functionality for HSU and PSU, EMR replaced the paper files PSU clinicians \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 20 of 35\n \nused. A record (documentation) is maintained for each youth at CLS/LHS, and they are \nassigned a PSU clinician regardless of having an identified mental-health disorder. All \nencounters with the youth and family are documented in EMR. These encounters may \ninclude  intakes,  psychological  assessments,  individual  therapy,  group  therapy, \nAdministrative Confinement placement reviews, referrals, communication with the family \nor  staff  regarding  the  youth,  documented  refusals  (to  an  offered  treatment  session), \ntreatment  plans,  and  responses  to  treatment  (progress).    In  addition,  PSU  maintains \nBehavior Management Plans that are accessible to all staff within electronic CLS/LHS group \nfolders. This enables a multidisciplinary review of helpful strategies and coping techniques \nthat staff may utilize in assisting a particular youth. \n \nA quality assurance program needs to be developed. As previously stated, the Monitor \nsuggests that the Defendants consider utilizing an expert in order to further develop the \nmental health program/integration at LHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Evaluations are completed and \nwithin 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. There was one instance of \ncontraindication documented during this review period. There is a form “Psychology \nInput for Security Decision” which is where the contraindication is documented and \nthere is a policy (Policy 500.70.04). \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  In the last report, the Monitor was unable assess compliance \nas to the 30- minute safety/security checks.    Defendants were able to pull data related to \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 21 of 35\n \n30-minute room checks during this reporting which the Monitor reviewed on-site.  There \nare some instances of non-compliance.  Defendants have created a very detailed action \nplan to improve compliance and accountability measures. There was no formal discipline \nor “Letters of Expectation” during this reporting period.  PSU staff do visit youth daily \nwhen on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone.  \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model.  \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and utilized. Once Defendants make \nthese improvements, they will be close to substantial compliance. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Social worker visits, mental health \nservices,  and  other  health  services  are  provided  in  general.    Documentation,  quality \nassurance, and  policy and procedure  need to be  improved/completed  in order for the \nMonitor to fully assess compliance.  \n \n \nii.     Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nduring this reporting period. COMPAS is the current system that DJC utilizes for all related \nsocial services notes and encounters with youth and their families. Within COMPAS are tools \nsuch as Risk/Needs Assessments, Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) Scores, Case Plans, \ngroup treatment notes, and youth follow-up notes. All DJC State Agents and staff who have \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 22 of 35\n \nattended COMPAS training are granted access to this information.  \n \nIn order to expand access and enhance support for a youth’s overall wellbeing and skill \ndevelopment, the Youth Growth Plan has been developed as a strength based, youth driven \ntool and process to help a youth prepare for re-entry to the community. All youth develop \nan individualized Youth Growth Plan with their assigned social worker, who works with \nthem to detail SMART goals and action steps. The initial plan is to be completed within 21 \ndays of the youth’s initial Joint Planning and Review Committee (JPRC) meeting. When the \ninitial plan is completed, a copy of it is shared with the youth’s Office of Juvenile Offender \nReview  (OJOR)  Specialist,  County  worker(s)  and/or  State  agent,  and  their \nparent/guardian. A social worker meets with the youth at least once per week to discuss \nprogress they have made in completing action steps to meet their goals. Every time a youth \nhas a JPRC meeting the most recent version of the Youth Growth Plan is reviewed and \ndiscussed.  \n \nThe Youth Growth Plan and the social worker’s notes are also in CLS/LHS groups folders, \nproviding all staff access to the plan and notes. Social workers share created plans with other \nstaff in the Living Unit. Social workers and Unit Managers are encouraged to discuss these \nplans with Youth Counselors during team time meetings.   \n \nYouth’s participation in Skills Streaming is tracked across sessions and reported to the \nyouth’s  Social  Worker  and  OJOR  for  consideration,  but  there  is  an  overall  lack  of \ndocumentation as to specific programming that occurs daily.  \n  \nDBT groups have not been running because of Covid-19 but youth are receiving weekly \nindividual DBT sessions. The Sex Offender Treatment group was not interrupted and is \ncontinuing. The Monitor suggested that the Defendants retain a mental health expert to \nevaluate the program and make recommendations to, among other things, ensure these \nservices are being provided.   \n \niii.          Educational services with the general population to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  In  general  (prior  to  Covid-19) \neducational services for general population occurred in the classrooms in the school area.  \nYouth in the Targeted Intervention Program (“TIP”) attended classes in the school area but \nseparate from the general population. Covid-19 has changed how the educational services are \nbeing provided to youth at LHS/CLS.  On March 24, the schools began providing education \non the units with most education staff working off-site. The schedule has been distributed \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 23 of 35\n \nalong  with  a  training  brief  assisting  with  Chromebooks  and  logging  into  Edgenuity. \nApplicable staff continue to be monitoring e-mail, conducting phone calls, and performing \nZoom/video calls.  The Monitor strongly recommends that educational programming be re-\nevaluated.  The Monitor also recommends that educational services be completed off the unit \nwhen possible. Low population and staffing would allow for this.  The Monitor feels that the \nfacility needs to increase the daily education hours as best possible as this will have a positive \nimpact on meaningful programs and reduce youth idleness.  Additionally, Defendants need \nto ensure that special education is provided while on administrative confinement. \nThe  Defendants  should  further  engage  the  education  expert  to  make  further \nrecommendations that should be implemented, including an assessment of the quality and \nbenefits of the online education system Defendants are using. The Defendants also need to \nfocus on bringing more programming into LHS/CLS, especially programming culturally \nrelevant and specific to the race and genders of the youth who are at the facility. \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  “Out  time”  has  significantly \nimproved over the last year.  In general, youth are out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.  \nexcept for youth in quarantine due to Covid-19 safety measures implemented by Defendants, \nperiods of self-reflection, and any confinement recommended by PSU.  The Monitor regularly \nsaw youth conversing with other youth during out time.  Youth still want more structured \nactivities when they are out of their rooms and feel they do not really do anything, which \ncontinues to be a significant problem and could lead to self-confining.     \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  The Monitor is unable to assess compliance because there is no \nlonger documentation as to whether meals are in or out of room. Youth and staff indicated \nthat most meals take place out of the room.  Documentation needs to be created and policy \nand procedure need to incorporate this section of the Court Order and youth should be \neating out of their rooms unless there is a substantial threat of physical harm. \nvi.           Minimum  \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 24 of 35\n \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving much more than the 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week in a large \nmajority of the time.  If Defendants improve their quality of data and documentation, and \nincorporate  the  Court  Order  into  policy  and  procedure,  they  will  be  in  substantial \ncompliance. \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement. The \nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. However, the process and forms need to be \nenacted and written into policy. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis  more  consistently,  including  when  less  restrictive  means  were  attempted. \nDocumentation needs to continue to be completed and consistently applied to all situations. \nDocumentation, data collection and reliability, and quality assurance needs to continue to \nbe improved. Also, documentation needs to be created that prove a youth was promptly \nprovided with the report upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 25 of 35\n \nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  There needs to be continued focus on training, skills development and coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  eliminated.  \nThere  needs  to  be  continued  focus  on  training,  skills  development  and  coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, but data and documentation show that \nthere have been many uses of mechanical restraints in LHS during this reporting period. \nHowever, there were no uses in CLS.  Defendants need to focus on reducing the use of \nmechanical (as well as physical) restraints.  Defendants need to document and establish that \nthere were not less restrictive means available and quality assurance measures and a final \npolicy and procedure are in place.  The Monitor will note that although there have been \nmany uses of mechanical restraints in LHS, the average is less than 7.5 minutes. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants should be commended \nthat there were zero uses of mechanical restraints in CLS.  However, use of mechanical \nrestraints is higher this reporting period in LHS (August was very high due to a serious \ngroup disturbance).  \n \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 26 of 35\n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \nOctober 2019:     36 uses \nNovember 2019:   21 uses \nDecember 2019:   33 uses \nJanuary 2020:     25 uses \nFebruary 2020:    37 uses \nMarch 2020:     38 uses \nApril 2020:     37 uses  \nMay 2020:    27 uses \nJune 2020:    20 uses \nJuly 2020:                      30 uses \nAugust 2020:    65 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \nOctober 2019:     10 uses \nNovember 2019:   11 uses \nDecember 2019:    5 uses \nJanuary 2020:      8 uses \nFebruary 2020:     2 uses \nMarch 2020:      7 uses \nApril 2020:      6 uses  \nMay 2020:     0 uses \nJune 2020:     0 uses \nJuly 2020:      0 uses \nAugust 2020:                  0 uses \nDocumentation needs to be improved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm \nexisted, and when and how that decision is reviewed. Defendants do have critical outcome \nmeasures for restraints.  Defendants need to continue to work towards reducing the use of \nmechanical restraints, develop better documentation and quality assurance measures. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nii.          Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 27 of 35\n \nrelative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage. However, as noted \nabove, restraints are being used more frequently than they should be. Defendants need \nquality assurance measures and need to continue to focus on reducing the use of restraints.  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With policy revisions and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants will be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. With better documentation, policy \nrevisions, and quality assurance measures, Defendants will be close to achieving substantial \ncompliance with this provision. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With better documentation, policy revisions, and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants will be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation. However, de-escalation training needs to be completed more often \n(regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue to develop this skill. These skills \nare  also  important  to  help  staff  identify  and  prevent  situations  which  might  lead  to \ndisruption or altercations before such incidents occur Proper de-escalation cannot be \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 28 of 35\n \ntrained only once, or even only once a year.  DBT implementation will be very beneficial to \nyouth and staff.  Staff continue to want additional training on de-escalation. \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be left alone in restraints.   Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible and no  later than 2 hours following, PSU staff shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence that youth \nwere placed in mechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes during this reporting period. \nIn fact, the majority of mechanical restraints were less than 20 minutes.  With policy \nrevisions and quality assurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial \ncompliance with this provision.   \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process itself has been \nanalyzed for improvement.  The length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading \nup to the use is now being documented as part of the Incident Debrief process. If Defendants \nmaintain this, they will be close to achieving substantial compliance.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwas one strip search (CLS youth) this reporting period. The strip search conducted was \napproved by PSU for contraband/self-harm reasons and in compliance with this Court \nOrder. The policy for searches needs to be finalized and QA developed. Defendants are very \nclose to being in substantial compliance. \n \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 29 of 35\n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there was \none strip search (CLS youth) this reporting period. The strip search conducted was approved \nby PSU for contraband/self-harm reasons and in compliance with this Court Order. The \npolicy for searches needs to be finalized and QA developed. Defendants are very close to \nbeing in substantial compliance. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwas one strip search (CLS youth) this reporting period. The strip search conducted was \napproved by PSU for contraband/self-harm reasons and in compliance with this Court \nOrder. If documentation and policy revisions are made, substantial compliance will be \nobtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwas one strip search (CLS youth) this reporting period. The strip search conducted was \napproved by PSU for contraband/self-harm reasons and in compliance with this Court \nOrder. If documentation and policy revisions are made, substantial compliance will be \nobtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there was \none strip search (CLS youth) this reporting period. The strip search conducted was approved \nby  PSU  for  contraband/self-harm  reasons  and  in  compliance  with  this  Court  Order. \nDocumentation showed it was completed by an individual of the same gender identity. Policy \nrevisions are made, substantial compliance will be obtained. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 30 of 35\n \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that \nstaff have been trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved.  \n \n4.       Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The  process  for  tracking  and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. With continued practices and QA developed, Defendants will be in \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most staff have been trained  in \nMANDT and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. LHS/CLS secured \nWisconsin Department of Administration grant funding to allow ten (10) instructors to \ncomplete train the trainer trainings and subsequently provide Eight-hour Verbal Judo \ntraining sessions to all staff who work with youth with the goal of reducing risk for injury \nand enhancing staff confidence at effectively de-escalating  conflict or potential violent \nencounters with youth.  \n \nCompetency testing was administered for all staff completing training and the scores from \nthe competency exam were tracked as part of a quality assurance measure underscoring the \nimportance  utilizing  well  trained  de-escalation  techniques.  De-escalation  training  was \nrequested by staff on the Oct 2019 PbS Staff Survey and was well received.  With 5 equal to \nstrongly agree, the average score for “I learned skills I can practice in my work with youth \nat LHS/CLS” was 4.6 and the average score for “I have greater confidence in de-escalating \nconflict with the use of Verbal Judo” was 4.4. DJC certified trainers will continue to provide \nquarterly refresher trainings with practice scenarios to support skill retention and continued \napplication of Verbal Judo skills at the facility going forward. \n \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 31 of 35\n \nThe  Monitor  recommends  increasing  the  training  frequency  for  staff to  increase  their \nexperience and skill levels in managing and de-escalating situations before they result in the \nuse of force, restraint and/or isolation. The use of force review process continues to improve.   \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  understands  that \nchanges had to be made during the pandemic, but inadequate programming and excessive \nidle  time  was  a  problem  before  then  and  continues  to  be  a  problem.  The  Monitor’s \nrecommendations are the same as last report.  Many of the recommendations that were made \nin the February 2018 technical assistance report have been implemented- although there is \nstill far too much idle time. During this reporting period, the following programs occurred: \n \nEnding the Game Human Trafficking Treatment Curriculum \nThree PSU clinicians attended a training on the “Ending the Game” (ETG) curriculum on \nMay  21.  The  training  allows  for  direct-care  service  providers  to  facilitate  the  ETG \ncurriculum with victims of commercial sexual exploitation. ETG focuses on intervention, not \nprevention meaning that each lesson anticipates and validates the experiences of trafficking \nsurvivors and provides a safe place for them to process these experiences together. The ETF \ntreatment curriculum is being used specific to female youth at CLS that have experienced \ntrafficking or are at high-risk of being trafficked. So far, the girls have been very receptive \nto the curriculum.  \n \nRopes Course \nThe Ropes Challenge Course officially re-open operations this summer. The LHS/CLS ropes \nand challenge course uses physical challenges and a series of problem-solving events to \ncompel our youth to reach new levels of dealing with high stress situations. Many situations \ncreate the necessity for team problem solving, working together and cohesiveness to fulfill a \ngiven task. The goal is cooperation rather than competition in which the simple act of trying \nmakes each person a winner. \n \nIn June, DJC completed the process of developing certified facilitators for the course at the \nschools. Any previously certified facilitators were required to submit an email indicating \ntheir continued interest and were required to attend recertification training. New staff who \nwere interested in becoming a facilitator needed to be willing to participate in the Ropes \nCourse along with the youth and attempt each skill on all of the apparatuses. Training took \nplace the week of July 22 and satisfied the 40-hour training requirement necessary for full \ncertification of facilitators.  \n  \nSummer Games Alternative \nIn lieu of summer games this year, a group of educational staff will be hosting a series of \nactivity days. Time will be scheduled for each individual living unit. All youth and staff \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 32 of 35\n \nwithin the living unit are encouraged and welcome to attend and participate.  \n \nThe first activity was a “lawn games” style event. Youth had the opportunity to participate \nin various activities (table tennis, bag toss, Can Jam, etc.) with raffle tickets presented for \nparticipation. A handful of small prizes were drawn at the end of the games.  \n \nYouth Council Adaptations Due to COVID-19 \nDue to health concerns related to COVID-19, the CLS/LHS Youth Council has been unable \nto meet in person for their monthly meetings. Instead, staff distributed a “Youth Council \nCommunication Slip” to all units that all youth are encouraged to use to send ideas topics \nand questions to be addressed by the youth council.  \n \nYouth ideas are documented, discussed, and always considered. Not all suggestions are \nfeasible or ultimately implemented, but many ideas that have stemmed from the youth \ncouncil have in fact been implemented and continue to contribute to the facility environment \nin a positive way.  Ideas youth can propose through the “Youth Council Communication \nSlip” include: \n  \n•  Suggested items to be added to canteen or property \n•  Ideas for incentive activities and the daily schedule \n•  Food Service menu options \n•  Movies to add to the movie library  \n \nYouth Haircuts \nBeginning on June 3, 2020 haircuts for youth at the schools were resumed and scheduled. \nWith high levels of expected interest, the haircut roster will be created and followed in order \nto accomplish as many as possible during any given session. WEDC COVID-19 Hair Salon \nguidelines have been followed to keep everyone safe during the process. Youth must wear a \nface mask that goes behind the ears, preferably the disposable face masks that were provided \nthrough canteen.  (Youth commented that they would like different stylists as their haircuts \ndid not meet their expectations.) \n \nHoop It Up  \n3-on-3 Basketball Tournaments were held August 15 and 20, 2020. \n   \nCLS Outdoor Mural / Graffiti Board Incentive \nOn July 29 maintenance installed a “graffiti board” behind Wells living unit. The idea behind \nthe boards will be to provide youth with an artwork incentive and for them to be able to \ndisplay their artwork for their peers and staff at the facility. Eventually every unit that is \noccupied will have a space to display their artwork either behind their unit or at the ball \nfield. A procedure is currently being developed for this new incentive which  considers \nparameters like how the winners will earn the incentive, requiring the youth earning the \nincentive to submit a proposed sketch of their painting to the unit manager prior to painting \non the board and how long the artwork will be displayed before a new incentive earner is \nselected.  (There  were  very  few  instances  of  graffiti  on  the  units  which  is  a  huge \nimprovement). \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 33 of 35\n \nAlthough there were new activities for youth during this reporting period, there is still a \nsignificant and excessive amount of idle time.  Now that youth are basically out of their rooms \nfrom  8  a.m.  to  8  p.m.,  there  is  a  need  for  more  activities/programming.  These \nactivities/programming should be in addition to school, not as a substitute for education.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and \nvolunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for youth.  There has been \nan activities committee established. Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured \nprogram and activity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours. As mentioned previously, \nincreasing education hours, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED, can \ngreatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development strategies \nthrough meaningful education and vocational programming.   \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants should continue to focus \non training and developing staff in order for them to feel safe and actively engage with youth.  \nEven though education had to change due to the pandemic, there is an urgent need to address \nthe teacher vacancy rate. A plan needs to be developed that will provide mandated education \nto youth on a daily basis.  \n \nThe average day population continues to decline (60s).  There continues to be a significant \nreduction in population even though there were new admissions. An analysis should be \ncompleted to understand how the population was reduced and determine how the Agency can \nsustain this reduction.  \n \nAs stated in previous reports, this might include expediting the OJOR process and evaluating \nyouth  for  placement  under  community  supervision,  including  intensive  community \nsupervision, as permitted by state law.  Doing so would likely also facilitate keeping youth \ncloser to their home communities, and closer to more programming and culturally relevant \nservices. Defendants need to continue to work towards developing smaller, geographically \nlocated Type 1 facilities and also to evaluate whether there are alternative kinds of facilities \nand/or intensive community services to which youth could be released. There does not seem \nto be any more progress made as this section. This needs to be a priority or Defendants will \nnot be able to come into substantial compliance with this Court Order.  \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 34 of 35\n \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There are no new updates at the \ntime  of  this  report.    As  previously  reported,  DOC  has  identified  sections  of  the \nAdministrative  Code  that  need  to  be  modified,  but  significant  revisions  have  not  yet \noccurred. Defendants need to continue drafting interim policies for LHS/CLS while also \ndeveloping final Code revisions. If there is not significant movement on the amendments to \nadministrative code, Defendants will be in non-compliance in the next report. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  has  been  a  vast \nimprovement in meeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after  an \nincident in majority of cases.  When it has been determined lesser means could have been \nused, there is a corrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the \nplans are completed (QA component). A framework for other QA measures relating to the \nconsent decree was being created but has not been completed. \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this  settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout this report, \ndata driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and to \nimprove the quality of life for youth and staff.  The Monitor remains confident that the \nDefendants will create a competent quality assurance program especially with the addition \nof the new RFID system, the new Superintendent, and dedicated personnel. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 120   Filed: 10/27/20   Page 35 of 35\n \n \nCONCLUSION \nOverall, the facility was impeccably clean and organized with significantly reduced graffiti. The \nCARE Team model is being implemented and performance measures have been created.  The CARE \nTeam is very successful in de-escalating youth. The Monitor is very pleased with how the CARE \nteam has been expanded and integrated into the day to day operations. The Defendants’ commitment \nto implementing DBT should be commended and the Monitor looks forward to seeing progress in \nthis area and its impact on youth and staff.  \n \nThe Monitor remains very concerned over the continuing lack of adequate and meaningful \nactivities and programming for youth, especially though not only on weekends, which leads to \nextreme boredom and can result in anti-social behavior. The Monitor has repeatedly raised this \nissue in reports, yet it remains a serious problem. The facility would benefit from an increased focus \non reducing idleness and increasing meaningful activities, particularly during weekends and evening \nhours.  The Defendants need to figure out how to get youth off of the unit more.  This is even more \nimportant during the changes to daily life due to Covid-19.  The facility should continue to work on \nimproving the behavior management system, continue with their progress in implementing DBT, \nproviding improved and increased youth incentives that will help in reducing many behavioral \nincidents  and  reduce  the  high  number  of  self-requested  confinements  and  program  refusals.  \nContinued efforts need to be made to further engage the educational expert, reduce teacher vacancies, \nand increase educational time and quality. Regular training in de-escalation and physical restraint \ntechniques need to continue to occur. Policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be \ndeveloped as well as administrative code. Continued implementation of the new quality assurance \nprogram needs to remain a primary goal.   \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n35 \n ",

The State routinely subjects these youth to unlawful solitary \nconfinement, mechanical restraints and pepper spraying. Prior to state and federal raids on the \nfacility at the end of 2015, staff also regularly physically abused youth in the facility.  Currently, \nWisconsin’s juvenile corrections officials lock up approximately 15 to 20% percent or more of \nthe facilities’ young residents in solitary confinement cells for 22 or 23 hours per day.  Many of \nthese children are forced to spend their only free hour of time per day outside of a solitary \nconfinement cell in handcuffs and chained to a table.  Officers also repeatedly and excessively \nuse Bear Mace and other pepper sprays against the youth, causing them excruciating pain and \nimpairing their breathing.  These practices constitute serious violations of the children’s \nconstitutional rights, including their rights to substantive due process, as guaranteed by the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and their right to be free from cruel \nand unusual punishment, as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  Plaintiffs J.J., K.D., C.M., and R.N. bring this civil rights class action lawsuit, on \ntheir own behalf and on behalf of all other children who are or will be incarcerated at Lincoln \nHills and Copper Lake, to seek injunctive relief against these inhumane practices.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This action is brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, because Defendants, and each of \nthem, acting under color of state law, have deprived Plaintiffs, and the members of the class of \npersons they represent, of rights secured under the United States Constitution.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 3 of 40\n2.  This action arises under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution.  Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this \naction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and 42 U.S.C. § 1343 (civil rights \njurisdiction).   \n3.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the \nevents giving rise to the dispute occurred in this district and Defendants reside in this district.   \nPLAINTIFFS \n4.

Litscher is Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of \nCorrections (“DOC”), the Wisconsin state agency designated to oversee correctional facilities in \nthe State of Wisconsin including Type 1 Juvenile Correctional Facilities.  Defendant Litscher is \nsued in his official capacity.  As Secretary of DOC, Defendant Litscher is in charge of the \nadministration and supervision of DOC, and is ultimately responsible for the administration and \nsupervision of the Lincoln Hills School for Boys (“LHS”) and the Copper Lake School for Girls \n(“CLS”). \n9.  Defendant John D. Paquin is the Administrator of the Division of Juvenile \nCorrections.  Defendant Paquin is sued in his official capacity.  As Administrator of the Division \nof Juvenile Corrections, Defendant Paquin is in charge of the administration and supervision of \njuvenile corrections within DOC, and is responsible for the administration and supervision of \nLHS and CLS.   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 5 of 40\n10.  Defendant Wendy A. Peterson is the Superintendent of LHS and CLS and is sued \nin her official capacity.  As Superintendent, Defendant Peterson is also responsible for ensuring \nthat all legal responsibilities delegated to LHS and CLS, as set forth in state statutes, state policy, \nand/or governmental rules and regulations, are appropriately met. \n11.  Defendant Brian Gustke is the Director of Security at LHS and CLS and is sued in \nhis official capacity.  As Director of Security, Defendant Gustke is responsible for the security \nand discipline of inmates at LHS and CLS. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Wisconsin Youth Prisons \n12.  Lincoln Hills School for Boys (LHS) and Copper Lake School for Girls (CLS) are \nlocated on a single property in the town of Irma in Lincoln County, Wisconsin.  The LHS/CLS \nfacility is a “secured juvenile corrections institution” operated by the Wisconsin DOC and is also \nreferred to as Type 1 juvenile correctional facility. \n13.  A Type 1 juvenile correctional facility uses physical security mechanisms such as \nfences, barbed wire, and locked doors, in addition to control and surveillance by staff members, \nto restrict the liberty of youth committed to the facility by the court.  \n14.  The Wisconsin Juvenile Code, Chapter 938, Wis. Stats., provides the legal \nframework for children charged with a crime under the general rubric of delinquency \nproceedings.  Wisconsin Statutes § 938.34 lists a multitude of different programs, activities or \nplacements a court might order, and refers to them as “[t]he dispositions under this section.” \nSection 938.34(4m) permits a juvenile court to order an adjudged delinquent to a “secured \ncorrectional facility” under the supervision of the DOC. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 6 of 40\n15.  Pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes § 938.505(1), the DOC has “the right and duty to \nprotect, train, discipline, treat, and confine the juvenile and to provide food, shelter, legal \nservices, education, and ordinary medical and dental care for the juvenile, subject to the rights, \nduties, and responsibilities of the guardian of the juvenile….” \n16.  An adjudication of delinquency is not the same as a criminal conviction.  The \nprocedural protections available to juveniles are different from the protections available to \nadults, and the primary goal of delinquency proceedings is the rehabilitation and treatment of the \njuvenile.  See, e.g., Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(f) (juvenile code’s objectives include “respond[ing] to \na juvenile offender’s needs for care and treatment, consistent with the prevention of delinquency, \neach juvenile’s best interest, and protection of the public, by allowing the court to utilize the \nmost effective dispositional option”); Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(c) (objectives also include \n“development of competency in the juvenile offender, so that he or she is more capable of living \nproductively and responsibly in the community”). \n17.  Juveniles may receive a correctional placement at LHS/CLS under Wis. Stat. § \n938.34(4m), and such placements typically extend for one or two years.  Additionally, juveniles \nwho are adjudicated delinquent for certain serious offenses may receive a Serious Juvenile \nOffender (SJO) disposition order, which includes an initial placement in LHS or CLS.  Most SJO \norders extend for five years, although for the most serious offenses the order may extend until \nthe juvenile reaches 25 years of age.  See Wis. Stat. §§ 938.34(4h) & 938.538. \n18.  In addition to juveniles who are placed at LHS and CLS pursuant to dispositional \norders, boys and girls under the age of 18 who have been waived into adult court and have been \nconvicted of felonies may begin serving some or all of their adult sentences at LHS or CLS. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 7 of 40\n19.  Prior to 2011, DOC operated additional secured juvenile correction institutions.  \nTo address the declining juvenile correctional population, the State of Wisconsin consolidated \njuvenile correctional operations by closing two facilities in southern Wisconsin, Ethan Allen \nSchool for Boys and Southern Oaks Girls School.  As of June 27, 2011, all youth from these \nfacilities had been transferred to Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools. \n20.  On information and belief, approximately 145 boys and 20 girls are currently \nbeing held at the LHS/CLS facility.  \n21.  On information and belief, most of the youth held at LHS and CLS are African-\nAmerican. \n22.  On information and belief, most of the youth held at LHS and CLS come from \nMilwaukee—215 miles and 3½ hours away. \n23.  On information and belief, a substantial percentage of the youth held at LHS and \nCLS have a history of childhood trauma, mental illness, cognitive impairments, or \ndevelopmental disabilities. \nLHS and CLS Hold 15-20% or More of Incarcerated Youth in Solitary Confinement \n24.  By policy and practice, Defendants routinely use solitary confinement to \ndiscipline and punish boys and girls at LHS and CLS for violating institutional rules.  At any \ngiven time, approximately 15 to 20%—or more—of the population of LHS and CLS is held in \nsolitary confinement, and an even larger percentage of the youth have been subjected to solitary \nconfinement at one point or another during their incarceration at LHS and CLS. \n25.  The DOC uses the terms “restrictive housing,” “close confinement,” “modified \nconfinement,” “administrative confinement,” “segregation” or “security” to refer to its practice \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 8 of 40\nof solitary confinement: confining a child alone in a locked cell for 22-23 hours per day for \npunishment or for discipline or for asserted security reasons.       \n26.  LHS operates two segregation buildings: the “Krueger unit” and the “Roosevelt \nunit.”  Each unit has two wings, and each wing consists of a corridor with about a dozen solitary \nconfinement cells per wing.  Between the wings is a guard station, offices, a small kitchen, and a \ncommon area with several metal tables. \n27.  CLS has a smaller population and does not have a separate segregation unit.  \nInstead, one wing of CLS’s “Wells unit” is used for youth held in solitary confinement.  \n28.  According to the most recent data supplied by DOC, on October 25, 2016, there \nwere 167 youth incarcerated at LHS and CLS.  Of that number, 28 youth, or nearly 17% of the \npopulation, were being held in solitary confinement on that day. \n29.  DOC data also show that, at any given time, the percentage of the LHS/CLS \npopulation being held in solitary confinement is between about 15 and 20%—and sometimes \nmore.   \n30.  A cell in the segregation units is approximately seven by ten feet.  The cell is \nentered through a large metal door which swings out.  The door has a small glass window about \nnose height and one or two slots through which food trays are passed.  Youth extend their \nforearms through the door slot before and after being placed in the cell so that the guards may \nlock or unlock the handcuffs they must wear when they are out of their cells.  The single window \nto the outside is covered with bars.  \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 9 of 40\n31.  The typical segregation cell layout is depicted below (not to scale): \n \n32.  The windows in the doors of cells in the Krueger unit have a cover which can be \nclosed.  From time to time, guards in Krueger will close those covers so a youth cannot see out \nof his cell into the corridor. \n33.  A cell in the LHS segregation units has a mattress on the floor or on a frame \napproximately three inches above the floor.  There is a combination metal sink and toilet in the \ncell.  Segregation cells at CLS are similar, but some have no sink or toilet in the cell, instead \ncontaining only a mattress.  The cells have no other furnishings.  There is no mirror or anything \nelse on the walls.  The cells have no desk or chair; youth sit on either the toilet or their mattress \nfor 22 or 23 hours per day.  Many of the cells have no call button to request attention from staff, \nso youth must scream or cover the surveillance cameras in their rooms to get attention. \n34.  A light in the segregation cell stays lit 24 hours per day.  The light is dimmed \nfrom approximately 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. but is not turned off. \n35.  The segregation cells are dirty and smell like sweat and urine. \n36.  Defendants often sentence youth to solitary confinement even for infractions that \ndo not pose a serious threat to safety, such as disrespecting staff, refusing to lock into a cell, or \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 10 of 40\n“running.”  On information and belief, Defendants often sentence youth to solitary confinement \nfor periods of 30 or 60 days for a variety of offenses—especially when youth have been \ndisciplined previously, or for fighting regardless of whether the altercation was likely to or did \nresult in injury.  Even when youth are charged with relatively minor rule infractions, they often \nspend up to 14 days in segregation while they await the issuance of a conduct report and a \nhearing, and then frequently get a few additional days from the hearing examiner as punishment. \n37.  Other than a book or two, a toothbrush, and limited bedding and clothing, youth \nin solitary are permitted no other personal belongings, educational materials, writing or drawing \nutensils, computers, games, or toys.  In general, a youth can only have one book at a time in his \nor her cell, which the youth can choose from a book cart in the segregation unit. Many youth are \nnot permitted to have even paper in their cells.  \n38.  Boys receive only a small amount of toilet paper and must request more when \nthey need it. Boys also may not flush their toilets themselves, but must ask the guards to turn the \ntoilet on to allow them to flush it.  Because the girls’ solitary cells do not have a sink or toilet, \nthe girls must push a call button and ask guards to be escorted to the bathroom.  Guards \nsometimes take a long time to respond to requests to use the bathroom.    \n39.  Defendants also significantly limit the education youth held in solitary \nconfinement receive.  In the general population, the youth typically receive four to five hours of \neducation Monday-Friday.  In solitary confinement, Defendants’ pattern and practice is to reduce \nthis educational programming to a single hour outside the cell with a teacher who comes to the \nsegregation unit and meets with about three youth at a time.  During this time, they may be \nlocked to a desk in the classroom.   \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 11 of 40\n40.  Defendants do not permit boys held in solitary confinement to receive phone calls \nfor the first twenty days in security status.  After twenty days, a boy can have a short phone call \nwith his family. \n41.  According to Wisconsin Administrative Code § DOC 373.03(3) (for disciplinary \nsolitary confinement) and § DOC 374.03(4) (for administrative solitary confinement), youth in \nsegregation should have one hour of time out of the cell each day for exercise.  However, the \nstaff has a pattern and practice of frequently taking away “out time” for minor infractions.   \n42.  Even those youth permitted “out time” are frequently kept in mechanical \nrestraints during the limited time they are allowed out of their cells.  Known as being “on the \nbelt,” youth are handcuffed and the handcuffs are attached to a canvas belt encircling the youth’s \nwaist.  By policy and practice, LHS keeps all new male arrivals at the segregation unit “on the \nbelt” regardless of the reason the youth was sent to segregation.  Upon information and belief, at \nCLS, girls deemed to have exhibited some form of violent behavior are placed “on the belt” \nduring their hour out of cell while in solitary confinement.   \n43.  On information and belief, most youth in segregation are “on the belt” while out \nof their cells for the duration or a large portion of their time in solitary confinement.  DOC’s \nregulations expressly permit the use of restraints as a matter of course for juveniles in solitary \nconfinement.  Wisconsin Administrative Code § DOC 376.09 governs use of mechanical \nrestraints (including “handcuffs with restraining belt or chain”) and authorizes use on “a youth \nwho is in security status while the youth is outside the place of confinement.” \n44.  If a youth is “on the belt,” the youth spends his or her “out time” chained to a \ntable in the central area of the segregation unit in front of the guard station.  Depending on the \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 12 of 40\nnumber of youth currently in the security units, there might be two or three youth chained to \ntables for the same hour.   \n45.  For the girls at CLS in segregation, the hour of “out time” includes their shower, a \nperiod of time of room cleaning, and perhaps 15 minutes of exercise before they are locked back \nin their cells. \n46.  Staff in the security units review a youth’s continued status on the belt once a \nweek.  If the staff decide that the youth has been on good behavior, the youth may be allowed out \nof his or her cell without being in restraints.       \n47.  If the youth is “off the belt,” the youth goes outside during his or her one hour of \n“out time.”  “Outside” means that the youth is allowed, usually alone, into an outdoor caged area \npaved with concrete.   \n48.  Youth who are “on the belt” remain in restraints during their hour of education \nand are not allowed to have writing instruments in their cells.  \n49.  In addition, when Defendants put youth into segregation, they revoke access to \nthe very programs which might help and rehabilitate the youth, such as Aggression Replacement \nTraining (ART) and the Juvenile Cognitive Intervention Program (Phases I and II).  If a youth \nmisses more than a few sessions of any such program because he or she is in solitary \nconfinement, Defendants require the youth to start the program over from the beginning. \n50.  Failure to complete these programs also results in additional punitive \nconsequences.  Defendants’ Office of Juvenile Offender Review (OJOR) considers failure to \ncomplete these programs a justification to deny a transfer out of LHS or CLS to a step down \nfacility or to deny early release.   \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 13 of 40\nSolitary Confinement Causes Serious Damage to Incarcerated Youth \n51.  Solitary confinement is particularly damaging to youth, who are still developing \nphysically, psychologically, and socially. \n52.  Youth in segregation face a significant risk of serious mental harm.  Solitary \nconfinement negatively impacts juveniles by perpetuating, worsening, or precipitating mental \nhealth concerns, including but not limited to post-traumatic stress disorders, psychosis, anxiety \ndisorders, major depression, hyper-vigilance, agitation, general lack of trust, suicidal ideation, \nsuicidal intent, self-mutilation, and suicidal behavior.   \n53.  These mental health concerns can cause long-term harm.  Solitary confinement \ncan lead to chronic conditions like depression, which, in teenagers, can manifest as anger or as \nself-harm.  In addition, children who experience depression and anxiety in their teenage years are \nat higher risk of presenting with these diagnoses again.  Symptoms associated with depression, \nsuch as low self-esteem, insomnia, inattention, low energy, fatigue, weight loss, and feelings of \nhopelessness can similarly persist into adulthood.  There is a 10 to 15% mortality rate associated \nwith depression, and solitary confinement increases the risk of suicide substantially compared to \nthe risk in the general population.  \n54.  Solitary confinement of youth can also lead to long-term erosion of trust with \nadults, resulting in paranoia, anger, and hatred.  Juveniles emerging from solitary have trouble \nforming the therapeutic relationships necessary to address the mental health concerns resulting \nfrom solitary confinement.  \n55.  The risk of harm from solitary is made worse by the disproportionately high \nincidence of preexisting trauma and mental health concerns among juveniles in the criminal \njustice system.  Research shows that more than 60% of the youth in correctional settings have an \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 14 of 40\nunderlying major mental illness.  Stress from isolation can compound past trauma and exacerbate \nmental illnesses and disabilities.  \n56.  For those youth with a history of trauma, mental illnesses, or developmental \ndisabilities, the risk of harm is especially great.  They already have weakened adaptive \nmechanisms, are at a higher risk for further mental health complications, are more susceptible to \nsignificant trauma from social isolation, and are more likely to suffer long-lasting consequences \nfrom the trauma of isolation than those without mental illnesses or disabilities.  \n57.  Not only is it harmful to deprive a youth of meaningful social interaction or \nmental stimulation, it also is counterproductive to the goals of ensuring safety, security, and good \norder.  Research shows that segregating youth results in increased agitation and an increased risk \nof misbehavior.  Facilities that have reduced their reliance on disciplinary isolation and instead \nhave adopted more appropriate techniques for managing juveniles have seen reductions in rates \nof violence and misbehavior.  Most of these facilities allow for short-term separation—measured \nin hours, not days, weeks, or months (as is the case in LHS/CLS)—and then only as a last resort \nwhen other options fail to defuse situations that pose an acute risk of harm to the juvenile or \nothers.  \n58.  In a series of Eighth Amendment cases involving the death penalty and life \nwithout parole sentences, the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution requires that children \nnot be punished like adults without first accounting for the unique traits that make them children.  \n59.  A number of professional organizations and institutions have echoed the Supreme \nCourt’s principle that incarcerated children cannot be treated like adults.  The National \nCommission on Correctional Health Care (“NCCHC”), for example, issued a statement \nestablishing that juveniles should not be placed in solitary confinement for any duration; the \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 15 of 40\nstatement highlighted juveniles’ particular vulnerability to adverse reactions to isolation.  The \nWorld Health Organization (“WHO”), the United Nations, and other international bodies have \nalso recognized that solitary confinement is particularly harmful to a child’s psychological well-\nbeing and cognitive development.  Acknowledging the high risk of mental illness as well as the \nhigher rates of suicide and self-harm for youth in solitary confinement, the United Nation’s \n(U.N.) Special Rapporteur on Torture, in a 2015 report, condemned solitary confinement of \nchildren for any duration, calling it torture.  \n60.  Similarly, in 1999, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of \nthe United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) commissioned “the first comprehensive effort \nto determine the scope and distribution of suicides by youth in our public and private juvenile \nfacilities throughout the country.”  The study found that fifty percent of victims were in isolation \nat the time of their suicide, and sixty-two percent of victims had a history of isolation, noting \n“rates of suicidal behavior appeared to be higher for youth who were isolated from their peers or \nassigned to single room housing.”  Lindsey M. Hayes, Nat’l Ctr. on Inst. & Alternatives, \nJuvenile Suicide in Confinement: A National Survey 42 (2004); see also Steven H. Rosenbaum, \nChief, Special Litig. Section, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Remarks before the Fourteenth Annual \nNational Juvenile Corrections and Detention Forum (May 16, 1999) (“The use of extended \nisolation as a method of behavior control, for example, is an import from the adult system that \nhas proven both harmful and counterproductive when applied to juveniles.  It too often leads to \nincreased incidents of depression and self-mutilation among isolated juveniles, while also \nexacerbating their behavior problems.  We know that the use of prolonged isolation leads to \nincreased, not decreased, acting out, particularly among juveniles with mental illness.”)   \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 16 of 40\n61.  National and international standards governing corrections and juvenile justice \nuniformly condemn the use of solitary confinement in juvenile facilities and provide that where \nsegregation is necessary in certain acutely dangerous situations, it should be as brief as possible.  \n62.  The USDOJ’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Standards \nfor the Administration of Juvenile Justice (“JJDPA Standards”) provide that no juvenile should \nbe placed in room confinement for more than twenty-four hours.  Standards for the Admin. of \nJuvenile Justice § 4.52 (Nat’l Advisory Committee for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention 1980).  \n63.  The Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI), which has developed the \nmost widely recognized set of national best practices on the use of solitary confinement with \njuvenile populations, provides that solitary confinement can never be used for purposes of \npunishment or discipline and must be limited to periods of less than 4 hours. \n64.  Having recognized in a 2012 report that “[n]owhere is the damaging impact of \nincarceration on vulnerable children more obvious than when it involves solitary confinement,” \nthe USDOJ subsequently recommended that the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in \nfederal prisons be prohibited, and President Obama adopted that recommendation in 2016.  \n65.  The American Medical Association (“AMA”), the American Academy of Child \nand Adolescent Psychiatry, and the NCCHC all have called on correctional facilities to halt the \nuse of solitary confinement of juveniles for disciplinary purposes. \n66.  The international community has also condemned the placement of children in \nsolitary confinement.  International law prohibits the use of isolation as a disciplinary tool.  \nSpecifically, the U.N.’s Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty declare \nthat “all disciplinary measures constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment shall be \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 17 of 40\nstrictly prohibited, including corporal punishment, placement in a dark cell, closed or solitary \nconfinement or any other punishment that may compromise the physical or mental health of the \njuvenile concerned.”  G.A. Res. 45/113, Annex ¶ 67 (Dec. 14, 1990).  \n67.  Furthermore, long-term solitary confinement can be a form of psychological \ntorture, which international law strictly prohibits.  See, e.g., United Nations Convention Against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, G.A. Res. 39/46 \n(Dec. 10, 1984); see also Atul Gawande, Hellhole, The New Yorker, Mar. 30, 2009. \n68.  National and state standards and guidelines also recognize that it is essential for \nyouth confined in juvenile justice facilities to have a meaningful opportunity to exercise every \nday.  Standards set by various governmental and non-governmental entities, such as OJJDP, the \nNCCHC, the American Bar Association and the Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators \n(“CJCA”), make it clear that juveniles must have at least one hour per day of actual, strenuous, \nlarge-muscle exercise, with many recommending two or more hours per day, for both physical \nand mental health needs.  These standards also make it clear that keeping a child on the belt and \nhandcuffed to a table does not constitute “exercise.” \n69.  Use of restraints is known to cause both physical and psychological harm. See \nJohnson, Being Restrained: A study of power and powerlessness¸ 19 ISSUES IN MENTAL HEALTH \nNURSING 191, 196-203 (1998); Singh, Singh, Davis, Latham & Ayers, Reconsidering the Use of \nSeclusion and Restraints in Inpatient Child and Adult Psychiatry, 8 J. OF CHILD & FAM. STUD. \n243, 244 (1999). \n70.  The practice of putting youth “on the belt” in restraints for weeks and months at a \ntime violates recognized national and international standards. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 18 of 40\n71.  The Institute of Judicial Administration - ABA Standards for Juvenile Justice, \nStandards Relating to Corrections Administration, provide: \n7.8 Limitations on restraints and weapons.  \nA. Mechanical restraints. Given the small size of programs, it should not be \nnecessary to use mechanical restraints within the facility. The program director \nmay authorize the use of mechanical restraints during transportation only. \n72.  Article 64 of the U.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their \nLiberty provides:  “Instruments of restraint and force can only be used in exceptional cases, \nwhere all other control methods have been exhausted and failed. . . . They should not cause \nhumiliation or degradation, and should be used restrictively and only for the shortest possible \nperiod of time.”  G.A. Res. 45/113, U.N. GAOR, 45th Sess., Supp. No. 49A, art. 64, U.N. Doc. \nA/45/49 (1990). \n73.  The U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (adopted by \nthe First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, \nheld at Geneva in 1955, and approved by the Economic and Social Council by its resolutions 663 \nC (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977), similarly state: \n33. Instruments of restraint, such as handcuffs, chains, irons and straitjackets, \nshall never be applied as a punishment. Furthermore, chains or irons shall not be \nused as restraints.  \n \nOther instruments of restraint shall not be used except in the following \ncircumstances:  \n \n(a) As a precaution against escape during a transfer, provided that they shall be \nremoved when the prisoner appears before a judicial or administrative authority;  \n \n(b) On medical grounds by direction of the medical officer;  \n \n(c) By order of the director, if other methods of control fail, in order to prevent a \nprisoner from injuring himself or others or from damaging property; in such \ninstances the director shall at once consult the medical officer and report to the \nhigher administrative authority. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 19 of 40\nDefendants Are Aware or Should Be Aware of the Risks of Solitary Confinement and \nRestraints, But Have Deliberately Chosen to Ignore Those Risks \n74.  Defendants know or should be aware of the risks of solitary confinement for \nyouth.  President Obama’s actions to prohibit solitary confinement of juveniles in federal \ncustody—and the research on which the prohibition was based—were widely reported in the \nmedia. \n75.  DOC officials are familiar with NCCHC policies and statements as a result of \ntheir efforts to achieve NCCHC accreditation of their facilities, and so should be aware of the \nNCCHC’s policy position advocating a ban on solitary confinement of juveniles. \n76.  On October 25, 2016, Defendant Litscher received correspondence advising him \nof the position of the AMA that solitary confinement of juveniles should be banned and of the \nObama administration’s prohibition of solitary confinement of federal juvenile prisoners.  \n77.  Defendants nonetheless continue to subject numerous youth at LHS and CLS to \nextended periods of solitary confinement, with deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of \nserious harm it creates. \n78.  Similarly, Defendants are or should be aware of the harm to juveniles caused by \nthe use of restraints, such as being handcuffed to a waist belt and tethered to a table.  The \ninternational law standards have been in place and research on the harm of restraints has been \navailable for decades, and it is obvious that shackling a child to a table for the only hour he or \nshe is allowed out of her cell is demeaning, psychologically harmful, and prevents essential \nlarge-muscle exercise. \n79.  Defendants nonetheless continue to routinely restrain youth in solitary \nconfinement by placing them “on the belt” for most or significant portions of their stays in \nsolitary, with deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of harm such restraints create. \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 20 of 40\nThe Plaintiffs Have Been Subjected To Excessive and Painful Pepper Spraying \n80.  In addition to solitary confinement, Defendants have a pattern and practice of \nroutinely using pepper spray to control the behavior of the youth in their custody, both while in \nthe general population and in solitary confinement. \n81.  Guards at LHS and CLS have a pattern and practice of using pepper spray \nunnecessarily and unreasonably on youth for minor non-violent infractions, such as refusing to \ngo into their rooms, refusing to leave their rooms, covering up the cameras in the segregation \nunit, and failing to follow commands.  In fact, Defendants’ policy expressly permits use of \npepper spray to “enforce a DOC rule, a posted policy or procedure or an order of staff member,” \neven without any risk of harm to staff or youth or danger to the security of the institution.  DOC \nDJC Policy & Procedure 300.05.05 (9-28-2016). \n82.  According to records maintained by the Defendants, guards at LHS and CLS have \nused pepper spray on the youth in their care at least 198 times in the period January through \nOctober 2016. \n83.  Guards at LHS and CLS use several different forms of pepper spray on youth in \ntheir custody, including “Bear Mace,” which is marketed as being able to protect hikers from \ncharging bears.  Other types of pepper spray in use at LHS and CLS include Phantom and Ghost.  \nSome pepper sprays are used to create a cloud which will fill the youth’s cell.  Others are \nsprayed directly at the face or body of a youth.      \n84.  Oleoresin capsicum (“OC”), the active ingredient in pepper spray, causes intense \nburning, coughing, and temporary blindness. \n85.  After youth are pepper sprayed, they are routinely locked into a cage in a shower.  \nThe effects of the spray are temporarily worsened by exposure to water and spread to sensitive \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 21 of 40\nareas such as the groin, causing intense pain.  To avoid this acute increase in pain, some youth \nchoose not to turn on the shower, but as a result the spray remains on their skin, prolonging the \nduration of their pain. \n86.  After guards use pepper spray on youth in solitary confinement, the guards \nremove all of the youth’s clothes and provide only a paper or cloth gown.   \n87.  After guards use pepper spray on youth in the segregation units, the guards \nremove the regular mattress from the cells, providing only a rubber security mat in its place.  \n88.  Youth at CLS and LHS have described being pepper sprayed as “feeling like you \nwere hit a hundred times.”  The effects of the spray can last for days, and are reactivated by \nwater even days later, such as when the child washes his or her face.     \n89.  The JDAI standards require juvenile justice facilities to strictly prohibit the use of \nchemical agents.  Juvenile Detention Facility Assessment - Standards Instrument (2014 Update) \nat 104. \n90.  The Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators  has also declared that \npepper spray use is both harmful and counter-productive:  \n[Pepper spray’s] use has been shunned by juvenile correctional agencies because \nof the harm it causes to youths and the negative impact on staff-youth \nrelationships, the key to successful juvenile rehabilitative programming. Very few \nstates authorize its use and in the states that allow its use in policy, most prohibit \nthe use except as a last resort and with many conditions and few facilities put it \ninto practice. \nPepper Spray in Juvenile Facilities, CJCA, available at http://cjca.net/attachments/ \narticle/172/ CJCA.Issue.Brief.OCSpray.pdf.  \nDefendants Are Aware or Should Be Aware of the Risks of Harm Posed by Pepper Spray \nand Have Deliberately Chosen to Ignore Those Risks \n91.  Defendants know or should be aware of the risk of harm to juveniles from using \npepper spray and are aware that it is generally not necessary to manage juvenile misbehavior. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 22 of 40\n92.  On information and belief, Defendants are members of the CJCA, see Agency \nDirectory, CJCA, http://cjca.net/index.php/resources/agency-directory (last visited Jan. 20, \n2017), an organization that has condemned the use of pepper spray in juvenile correctional \nfacilities. \n93.  Defendants nonetheless, as a matter of both practice and policy, continue to use \npepper spray extensively.  Indeed, Defendants’ current policy, DOC 305.05.05 (part I.H.), far \nfrom confining use of pepper spray to a last resort, expressly permits the use of pepper spray “to \nenforce a DOC rule, a posted policy or procedure or an order of staff member.”     \nThe Named Plaintiffs Have Repeatedly Been and are Likely in the Future To Be Subjected \nto Solitary Confinement, Mechanical Restraints and Pepper Spray \nPlaintiff J.J. \n94.  Plaintiff J.J. is an African American boy from the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  \nHe was first committed to LHS in 2015 at the age of 15.  He was initially given a one-year \ncorrectional placement, which was extended for an additional year. \n95.  J.J. has spent most of his time at Lincoln Hills in solitary confinement; he has \nbeen sent to solitary on approximately ten separate occasions for a variety of reasons.  Because \nof his time in solitary confinement, J.J. has been limited in the amount of schooling he has been \nable to receive and has not been able to complete programs designed for his rehabilitation.     \n96.  According to J.J., the guards in the segregation units “treat us like dogs, in cages, \ncausing us more trauma.” \n97.  J.J. believes that the guards intentionally provoke him and trigger him to react.   \n98.  J.J. has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n99.  When in solitary confinement, J.J. has been “on the belt” for most of the time he \nis allowed out of his cell.  In addition, Defendants have frequently taken away J.J.’s out time.   \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 23 of 40\n100.  J.J. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with symptoms that are frequently \ncaused by solitary confinement.  When he is in solitary confinement, he has trouble sleeping, he \nfeels anxious and is easily irritated by minor things, like being ignored, and he is increasingly \nprone to anger.  He has had episodes of sadness and restlessness while in solitary.  \n101.  J.J. was in solitary confinement as of January 13, 2017, and was not scheduled to \nbe released until January 21, 2017.  He reasonably fears that he will be returned to solitary \nconfinement again at LHS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n102.  LHS staff have also pepper-sprayed J.J. five or six times, including shooting the \nburning spray directly in his face.  For example, on one occasion in 2016, J.J. was pepper-\nsprayed as guards were attempting to take him to segregation.  After being pepper sprayed, the \nguards threw him into the prison van, where he was left in a cloud of mace.  \n103.  In another incident in July 2015, J.J. asked for a supervisor and refused to go back \ninto his cell in segregation until he talked to a supervisor about his shower.  Several guards \narrived and surrounded him in a circle and told him to get on the ground.  He did not.  The \nguards were preparing to pepper spray J.J. when he bolted for his cell.  Although there was no \nthreat of injury to anyone, the guards pepper-sprayed J.J. as he ran past and into his cell.     \n104.  J.J. reasonably fears that he will again be subjected to the use of pepper spray by \nLHS staff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n105.  J.J. has filed grievances and appeals regarding Defendants’ use of solitary \nconfinement and pepper spray pursuant to Defendants’ inmate complaint procedures and \nexhausted his available administrative remedies. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 24 of 40\nPlaintiff K.D. \n106.  Plaintiff K.D. is an African American girl from the City of Milwaukee, \nWisconsin.  She was first committed to CLS in July 2016 at the age of 14 with a one-year \ndispositional order.   \n107.  Since she has been at CLS, K.D. has been placed in solitary confinement on three \nseparate occasions.  Her alleged infractions included being loud and being disruptive, for which \nshe was sent to solitary confinement for periods ranging from three to nine days. \n108.  K.D. has been diagnosed with ADHD. \n109.  K.D. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with symptoms that are frequently \ncaused by solitary confinement.  She experienced anxiety, sadness, hopelessness, restlessness, \nand finds that solitary confinement makes her increasingly irritated and angry.  Her sadness and \nhopelessness were so profound she had suicidal thoughts. \n110.  While Defendants were holding K.D. in solitary confinement, they used so much \npepper spray on another girl in solitary confinement that spray filled the corridor.  The cloud of \npepper spray made K.D., and, on information and belief, other girls in the wing, cough and gag, \nand burned their throats.  Although the guards used masks to protect themselves from the impact \nof the spray, they offered no protection to any of the youth in that wing, including K.D. \n111.  K.D. reasonably fears that she will be returned to solitary confinement again at \nCLS, if she is not granted injunctive relief. \n112.  K.D. reasonably fears that she will again be subjected to pepper spray by CLS \nstaff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 25 of 40\n113.  K.D. has filed grievances and appeals regarding Defendants’ use of solitary \nconfinement and pepper spray pursuant to Defendants’ inmate complaint procedures and \nexhausted her available administrative remedies. \nPlaintiff C.M. \n114.   Plaintiff C.M. is an African American boy from the City of Milwaukee, \nWisconsin.  He was committed to LHS on November 16, 2016, and will be held there until he \nturns 18 in May, 2017. \n115.  In his first six weeks at LHS, C.M. spent more than two weeks in solitary \nconfinement for two separate incidents. \n116.  Neither incident involved any violence or threat to security.   \n117.  On his first confinement in solitary, C.M. was released after seven days.  He had \nnever received any written notice of charges against him or any type of due process hearing to \njustify this punishment.  Defendants told him they were releasing him because no disciplinary \nconduct report had ever been prepared. \n118.  Despite the fact that C.M. had not been involved in any violent incident or threat, \nhe was initially placed “on the belt” for multiple days, due to the LHS policy and practice of \nplacing all new arrivals in segregation on the belt. \n119.  C.M. was taken to solitary the second time shortly before Christmas, 2016.  The \nstaff supervisor told C.M. that this time a conduct report would actually be prepared.  He was \nreleased on or about December 29, 2016, without having received written notice of the charges \nagainst him or a due process hearing, although he was told orally he was found guilty of the \nmisconduct.  \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 26 of 40\n120.  C.M. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with symptoms that are frequently \ncaused by solitary confinement.  He was sad because he could not speak with his mother.  He felt \nanxious and was unable to sleep.  He was irritable and annoyed by the noise in the unit.  He felt \ntreated like an animal: cuffed to come out of the cell, cuffed to shower, cuffed everywhere he \nwent.  His hair started falling out. \n121.  C.M. has been in solitary confinement and reasonably fears that he will be kept in \nsolitary confinement or returned to solitary confinement again at LHS if he is not granted \ninjunctive relief. \n122.  C.M. has filed grievances regarding Defendants’ use of solitary confinement \npursuant to Defendants’ inmate complaint procedures and exhausted his available administrative \nremedies. \nPlaintiff R.N. \n123.  Plaintiff R.N. is a 14-year-old African-American boy from Milwaukee County.  \nHe arrived at LHS in April, 2016, only two months after his 14th birthday. \n124.  Between April 2016 and December 2016, R.N. estimates he spent only two weeks \nout of solitary confinement.  As a result he received extremely limited educational programming \nand virtually no rehabilitative programming during his time at LHS. \n125.  R.N. has been pepper-sprayed many times by staff at LHS.  Each time he has \nsuffered an intense burning sensation over all the affected areas of his body. \n126.  After pepper-spraying R.N. in the solitary confinement unit, the staff would \nremove R.N.’s mattress from his cell and replace it with only a hard rubber security mat.  On one \noccasion, he was forced to sleep four consecutive nights on just the security mat.  On another \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 27 of 40\noccasion, the staff did not even provide a security mat, but forced R.N. to try to sleep on the cold \nbed frame.  \n127.  R.N. has been diagnosed with ADHD. \n128.  R.N. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with symptoms that are frequently \ncaused by solitary confinement.  R.N. has been on suicide watch.  In one incident, he reached an \nelectrical cord attached to a fan near his door, pulled it through the food tray slot, and wrapped it \naround his neck.  Guards responding to this behavior initially pulled on the cord, leaving marks \non R.N.’s neck, then fogged his room with pepper spray.   \n129.  On December 7, 2016, R.N. was transferred to MJTC for diagnosis and treatment \nof mental health concerns.      \n130.  R.N. reasonably fears that he may be returned to LHS and that he will be returned \nto solitary confinement again at LHS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n131.  R.N. reasonably fears that he may be returned to LHS and that he will again be \nsubjected to the use of pepper spray by LHS staff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n132.  R.N. has filed grievances regarding Defendants’ use of solitary confinement and \npepper spray pursuant to Defendants’ inmate complaint procedures and exhausted his available \nadministrative remedies. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n133.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all members of the class of \npersons who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated at LHS or CLS (the “Class”).   \n134.  Plaintiffs seek class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(2).  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 28 of 40\n135.  The Class consists of all youth currently incarcerated at LHS and CLS and any \nyouth who are incarcerated there in the future.  The exact number of inmates currently in the \nClass is not known to Plaintiffs with certainty, particularly because the number of Class \nmembers fluctuates.  On information and belief, the number of current Class members is \napproximately 165 (145 boys at LHS and 20 girls at CLS).  In addition to Class members \ncurrently held at LHS and CLS, the Class consists of an unknown number of youth who will be \nincarcerated in those facilities in the future and, absent injunctive relief, subjected to the same \ntreatment as youth currently incarcerated.  \n136.  The individual Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the \nClass, because they have all been subjected to solitary confinement, restraints and/or the \nexcessive use of pepper spray, and/or to the threat of being subjected to solitary confinement, \nrestraints, or pepper spray in the future.  Plaintiffs and all members of the Class have similarly \nsuffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising from Defendants’ actions and inaction.   \n137.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class.  These \ncommon legal and factual questions include:     \na.  Whether Defendants’ policy and practice of placing youth in solitary confinement \nfor punitive or disciplinary purposes and for a period longer than a few hours \nviolates the Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution.   \nb.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices of using mechanical restraints \nviolates the Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution.  \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 29 of 40\nc.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices of using pepper spray violate the \nEighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \nd.  Whether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek.  \n138.  By routinely confining substantial numbers of youth in solitary confinement for \nrelatively minor infractions and other disciplinary or punitive purposes, and by routinely using \npepper spray and restraints on youth to control behavior, Defendants have acted or refused to act \non grounds generally applicable to the entire Class.  \n139.  The claims asserted herein are capable of repetition while evading review.  There \nis a continuing and substantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and \ninjunctive relief in favor of the Plaintiffs and the Class.  \n140.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b)(2), \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, because Plaintiffs and other members of the Class seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and all of the above factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present.  \n141.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause individual litigation of these claims would be impracticable, and individual litigation \nwould be unduly burdensome to the courts.   \n142.  The named Plaintiffs, their representatives, and Class counsel will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests of the Class.  The named Plaintiffs and their representatives \nhave no interests in this matter that are antagonistic to other Class Members.  Class counsel have \nmany years of experience in civil rights and class action litigation.  \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 30 of 40\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Defendants’ Use of Solitary Confinement Violates the Fourteenth Amendment \nRight to Rehabilitation \n143.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 142 above are incorporated herein. \n144.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the \nsubstantive due process rights of the Plaintiffs, juvenile prisoners at Lincoln Hills and Copper \nLake, including a right to a rehabilitative environment and rehabilitative treatment. \n145.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of use of solitary confinement, \ndescribed above, which interferes with Plaintiffs’ rehabilitation and harms Plaintiffs emotionally, \npsychologically, physically and educationally.   \n146.  This use of solitary confinement deprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due \nprocess right to rehabilitative treatment and a rehabilitative environment, in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n147.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law.   \n148.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein. \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury. Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to harm Plaintiffs and other class members by \ndepriving them of rehabilitation, in violation of their substantive due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nCount II: Defendants’ Use of Restraints Violates the Fourteenth Amendment Right to \nRehabilitation \n149.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 148 above are incorporated herein. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 31 of 40\n150.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the \nsubstantive due process rights of the Plaintiffs, juvenile prisoners at Lincoln Hills and Copper \nLake, including a right to a rehabilitative environment and rehabilitative treatment. \n151.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of use of restraints, including \nplacing juveniles “on the belt” and tethering them to tables and desks whenever they are out of \ntheir cells in solitary confinement, as described above, which interferes with their rehabilitation \nand harms Plaintiffs emotionally, psychologically, physically and educationally.   \n152.  This use of restraints deprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due process right to \nrehabilitative treatment and a rehabilitative environment, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n153.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law.   \n154.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein. \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury. Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to harm Plaintiffs and other class members by \ndepriving them of rehabilitation, in violation of their substantive due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nCount III: Defendants’ Use of Restraints Constitutes Excessive Use of Force in Violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment \n155.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 154 above are incorporated herein. \n156.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process guarantee prohibits \njuvenile prison officials from using objectively unreasonable force against the juvenile prisoners \nin their custody. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 32 of 40\n157.  As described above, Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of excessive use \nof mechanical restraints, including placing juveniles “on the belt” and tethering them to tables \nand desks whenever they are out of their cells in solitary confinement.  \n158.  Defendants’ use of restraints is intentional and objectively unreasonable, and thus \ndeprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due process rights, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. This excessive use of restraints is not necessary to achieve any legitimate \npenological purpose and creates a substantial risk of serious emotional, psychological and \nphysical harm to Plaintiffs. \n159.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law.   \n160.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein.  \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.  Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to subject Plaintiffs and other class members to \nobjectively unreasonable force, in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nCount IV: Defendants’ Use of Pepper Spray Constitutes Excessive Use of Force in \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n161.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 160 above are incorporated herein. \n162.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process guarantee prohibits \njuvenile prison officials from using objectively unreasonable force against the juvenile prisoners \nin their custody. \n163.  As described above, Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of excessive use \nof pepper spray.  \n164.  Defendants’ use of pepper spray is intentional and objectively unreasonable, and \nthus deprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due process rights, in violation of the Fourteenth \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 33 of 40\nAmendment. This use of pepper spray is not necessary to achieve any legitimate penological \npurpose and creates a substantial risk of serious emotional, psychological and physical harm to \nPlaintiffs. \n165.

By failing to protect Plaintiffs, Defendants have deprived them of their \nsubstantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n172.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law. \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 34 of 40\n173.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein. \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.  Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to fail to protect the Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers from excessive force, in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nCount VI: Defendants’ Use of Solitary Confinement Violates the Eighth Amendment \n174.

The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids state actors to \nimpose cruel and unusual punishment on convicted prisoners, including acting (or failing to act) \nwith deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to prisoners’ health or safety. \n176.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of routine use of solitary \nconfinement of juvenile prisoners at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake.  As described above, \nDefendants’ practice of solitary confinement subjects Plaintiffs to, among other harmful \nconditions: 22-23 hours per day in a single cell—for days, weeks or months at a time—locked \nbehind a solid metal door, with no furniture other than a low bed and a combination toilet/sink, \nwith constant illumination, even at night, and with extremely limited access personal property; \nshackling the hands of juveniles in solitary confinement to a waist belt during the limited times \nthey are out of their cells for days and sometimes weeks at a time; lack of access to educational \nand rehabilitative programming while in solitary confinement; and lack of access to meaningful \nexercise and social interaction.  This solitary confinement creates a substantial risk of serious \nemotional, psychological and physical harm to Plaintiffs. \n177.  Defendants use solitary confinement against juvenile prisoners with deliberate \nindifference, in that they are or should be aware of the substantial risk of serious harm to the \nPlaintiffs caused by excessive use of solitary confinement but continue to subject Plaintiffs to \nsuch confinement and have failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the harm. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 35 of 40\n178.

Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of routine and excessive use of \nrestraints, including placing juveniles “on the belt” and tethering them to tables and desks \nwhenever they are out of their cells in solitary confinement.

Defendants use mechanical restraints against juvenile prisoners with deliberate \nindifference, in that they are or should be aware of the substantial risk of serious harm to the \nPlaintiffs caused by excessive use of restraints but continue to subject Plaintiffs to it and have \nfailed to take reasonable steps to prevent the harm. \n185.  By routinely and excessively using mechanical restraints, Defendants have \nsubjected Plaintiffs to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eight Amendment. \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 1   Filed: 01/23/17   Page 36 of 40\n186.

The State of Wisconsin operates the Lincoln Hills School for Boys and the \nCopper Lake School for Girls, which incarcerate approximately 150-200 youth who are as young \nas 14 years old, in remote northern Wisconsin.  The State routinely subjects these youth to \nunlawful solitary confinement, mechanical restraints, pepper spraying, and strip searches.  Prior \nto state and federal raids on the facility at the end of 2015, staff also regularly physically abused \nyouth in the facility.  Currently, Wisconsin’s juvenile corrections officials lock up approximately \n15 to 20% or more of the facility’s young residents in solitary confinement cells for 22-23 hours \nper day.  Many of these children are placed in handcuffs and chained to a table during the only \nhour each day that they are allowed out of their cells.  Officers also repeatedly and excessively \nuse pepper spray against the youth, causing them excruciating pain and impairing their breathing.  \nOfficers frequently strip search children at the facility, forcing them to remove all their clothing, \ninspecting their naked bodies and making them squat and cough; these strip searches occur when \nthe child arrives at the facility, each time a family member visits, any time a child is sent to \nsolitary confinement and during “shake downs” of living units.  All of these practices constitute \nserious violations of the children’s constitutional rights, including their rights to substantive due \nprocess, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and their \nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs J.J., K.D., C.M., R.N., M.S., A.V., M.R., S.K. and A.P. \nbring this civil rights class action lawsuit, on their own behalf and on behalf of all other children \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 3 of 52\nwho are or will be incarcerated at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, to seek injunctive relief \nagainst these inhumane practices.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.

Defendant Litscher is \nsued in his official capacity.  As Secretary of DOC, Defendant Litscher is in charge of the \nadministration and supervision of DOC, and is ultimately responsible for the administration and \nsupervision of the Lincoln Hills School for Boys (“LHS”) and the Copper Lake School for Girls \n(“CLS”). \n15.  Defendant John D. Paquin is the Administrator of the Division of Juvenile \nCorrections of the DOC.  Defendant Paquin is sued in his official capacity.  As Administrator of \nthe Division of Juvenile Corrections, Defendant Paquin is in charge of the administration and \nsupervision of juvenile corrections within DOC, and is responsible for the administration and \nsupervision of LHS and CLS.   \n16.  Defendant Wendy A. Peterson is the Superintendent of LHS and CLS and is sued \nin her official capacity.  As Superintendent, Defendant Peterson is also responsible for ensuring \nthat all legal responsibilities delegated to LHS and CLS, as set forth in state statutes, state policy, \nand/or governmental rules and regulations, are appropriately met. \n17.  Defendant Brian Gustke is the Director of Security at LHS and CLS and is sued in \nhis official capacity.  As Director of Security, Defendant Gustke is responsible for the security \nand discipline of inmates at LHS and CLS. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Wisconsin Youth Prisons \n18.  Lincoln Hills School for Boys (LHS) and Copper Lake School for Girls (CLS) are \nlocated on a single property in the town of Irma in Lincoln County, Wisconsin.  The LHS/CLS \nfacility is a “secured juvenile corrections institution” operated by the Wisconsin DOC and is also \nreferred to as a Type 1 juvenile correctional facility. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 7 of 52\n19.  A Type 1 juvenile correctional facility uses physical security mechanisms such as \nfences, barbed wire, and locked doors, in addition to control and surveillance by staff members, \nto restrict the liberty of youth committed to the facility by the court.  \n20.  The Wisconsin Juvenile Code, Chapter 938, Wis. Stats., provides the legal \nframework for children charged with a crime under the general rubric of delinquency \nproceedings.  Wisconsin Stat. § 938.34 lists a multitude of different programs, activities, and \nplacements a court might order, and refers to them as “[t]he dispositions under this section.”  \nSection 938.34(4m) permits a juvenile court to order an adjudged delinquent to a “secured \ncorrectional facility” under the supervision of the DOC. \n21.  Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 938.505(1), the DOC has “the right and duty to protect, \ntrain, discipline, treat, and confine the juvenile and to provide food, shelter, legal services, \neducation, and ordinary medical and dental care for the juvenile, subject to the rights, duties, and \nresponsibilities of the guardian of the juvenile….” \n22.  An adjudication of delinquency is not the same as a criminal conviction.  The \nprocedural protections available to juveniles are different from the protections available to \nadults, and the primary goal of delinquency proceedings is the rehabilitation and treatment of the \njuvenile.  See, e.g., Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(f) (juvenile code’s objectives include “respond[ing] to \na juvenile offender’s needs for care and treatment, consistent with the prevention of delinquency, \neach juvenile’s best interest, and protection of the public, by allowing the court to utilize the \nmost effective dispositional option”); Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(c) (objectives also include \n“development of competency in the juvenile offender, so that he or she is more capable of living \nproductively and responsibly in the community”). \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 8 of 52\n23.  Juveniles may receive a correctional placement at LHS/CLS under Wis. Stat. § \n938.34(4m), and such placements typically extend for one or two years.  Additionally, juveniles \nwho are adjudicated delinquent for certain serious offenses may receive a Serious Juvenile \nOffender (SJO) disposition order, which includes an initial placement in LHS or CLS.  Most SJO \norders extend for five years, although the order may extend until the juvenile reaches 25 years of \nage for the most serious offenses.  See Wis. Stat. §§ 938.34(4h) & 938.538. \n24.  In addition to juveniles who are placed at LHS/CLS pursuant to dispositional \norders, boys and girls under the age of 18 who have been waived into adult court and have been \nconvicted of felonies may begin serving some or all of their adult sentences at LHS or CLS. \n25.  Prior to 2011, DOC operated additional secured juvenile correction institutions.  \nTo address the declining juvenile correctional population, the State of Wisconsin consolidated \njuvenile correctional operations by closing two facilities in southern Wisconsin, Ethan Allen \nSchool for Boys and Southern Oaks Girls School.  As of June 27, 2011, all youth from these \nfacilities had been transferred to LHS and CLS. \n26.  On information and belief, approximately 155 boys and 22 girls are currently \nbeing held at the LHS/CLS facility.  \n27.  On information and belief, most of the youth held at LHS and CLS are African-\nAmerican. \n28.  On information and belief, most of the youth held at LHS and CLS come from \nMilwaukee—215 miles and 3½ hours away. \n29.  On information and belief, a substantial percentage of the youth held at LHS and \nCLS have a history of childhood trauma, mental illness, cognitive impairments, or \ndevelopmental disabilities. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 9 of 52\nLHS and CLS Hold 15-20% or More of Incarcerated Youth in Solitary Confinement \n30.  By policy and practice, Defendants routinely use solitary confinement to \ndiscipline and punish boys and girls at LHS and CLS for violating institutional rules.  At any \ngiven time, approximately 15 to 20%—or more—of the population of LHS and CLS is held in \nsolitary confinement, and an even larger percentage of the youth have been subjected to solitary \nconfinement at one point or another during their incarceration at LHS and CLS. The DOC uses \nthe terms “restrictive housing,” “close confinement,” “modified confinement,” “administrative \nconfinement,” “segregation” or “security” to refer to its practice of solitary confinement: \nconfining a child alone in a locked cell for 22-23 hours per day for punishment or for discipline \nor for asserted security reasons.       \n31.  LHS operates two segregation buildings: the “Krueger unit” and the “Roosevelt \nunit.”  Each unit has two wings, and each wing consists of a corridor with approximately 12 \nsolitary confinement cells per wing.  Between the wings is a guard station, offices, a small \nkitchen, and a common area with several metal tables. \n32.  CLS has a smaller population and does not have a separate segregation building.  \nInstead, one wing of CLS’s “Wells unit” is used for youth held in solitary confinement.  \n33.  According to the most recent data supplied by DOC, on October 25, 2016, there \nwere 167 youth incarcerated at LHS and CLS.  Of that number, 28 youth, or nearly 17% of the \npopulation, were being held in solitary confinement on that day.  \n34.  DOC data also show that, at any given time, the percentage of the LHS/CLS \npopulation being held in solitary confinement is between about 15 and 20%—and sometimes \nmore.  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 10 of 52\n35.  A cell in the segregation units is approximately seven by ten feet.  The cell is \nentered through a large swinging (rather than sliding) metal door.  The door has a small glass \nwindow a few feet above the floor, and one or two slots through which food trays are passed.  \nYouth extend their forearms through the door slot before and after being placed in the cell so that \nthe guards may lock or unlock the handcuffs they must wear when they are out of their cells.  \nThe single window to the outside may be covered with bars.  \n36.  The typical segregation cell is depicted below (not to scale), except that not all \ncells have a sink/toilet and in some cells the door swings in, not out: \n \n37.  The windows in the doors of cells in the Krueger unit have a cover which can be \nclosed.  From time to time, guards in Krueger will close those covers so a youth cannot see out \nof his cell into the corridor. \n38.  A cell in the LHS segregation units has a mattress on the floor or on a frame \napproximately three inches above the floor.  There is a combination metal sink and toilet in some \nof the cells, although in some or all of the “low hall” segregation cells there is no sink or toilet.  \nSegregation cells at CLS are similar, but have no sink or toilet in the cell, instead containing only \na mattress.  The cells have no other furnishings.  There is no mirror or anything else on the walls.  \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 11 of 52\nThe cells have no desk or chair; youth sit on either the toilet (if there is one) or their mattress for \n22 or 23 hours per day.  Many of the cells have no call button to request attention from staff, so \nyouth must scream or cover the surveillance cameras in their rooms to get attention. \n39.  A light in the segregation cell stays lit 24 hours per day.  The light is dimmed \nfrom approximately 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. but is not turned off. \n40.  The segregation cells are often dirty and smell like sweat and urine. \n41.  Defendants often sentence youth to solitary confinement even for infractions that \ndo not pose a serious threat to safety, such as disrespecting staff, refusing to lock into a cell, or \nrunning.   \n42.  On information and belief, Defendants often sentence youth to solitary \nconfinement for periods of 30 or 60 days for a variety of offenses—especially when youth have \nbeen disciplined previously, or for fighting regardless of whether the altercation was likely to or \ndid result in injury.   \n43.  Even when youth are charged with relatively minor rule infractions, they often \nspend up to 14 days in segregation while they await the issuance of a conduct report and a \nhearing, and then frequently get a few additional days from the hearing examiner as punishment. \n44.  Youth in solitary confinement are permitted almost no belongings. Some may \nhave a book or two which they can choose from a book cart in the segregation unit (except for \nyouth on “book restriction”), a toothbrush (which is usually a sponge on a stick), possibly a cup, \nand limited bedding and clothing.  Upon information and belief, youth in solitary are not allowed \nto have other personal belongings, educational materials, writing or drawing utensils, computers, \ngames, or toys, and in many cases cannot even have paper in their cells.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 12 of 52\n45.  Boys who are in solitary cells with toilets receive only a small amount of toilet \npaper and must request more when they need it. Boys in those cells also may not flush their \ntoilets themselves, but must ask the guards to turn the toilet on to allow them to flush it.   \n46.  Some of the boys are confined in cells with no sinks or toilets; none of the girls’ \ncells have sinks or toilets. All of these youth must push a call button and ask guards to be \nescorted to the bathroom.  Guards sometimes take a long time to respond to requests to use the \nbathroom, which has caused some of the youth to have accidents or to have to use items such as \na cup instead of a toilet.    \n47.  Defendants also significantly limit the amount of education youth receive in \nsolitary confinement.  In the general population, the youth typically receive four to five hours of \neducation Monday-Friday.  In solitary confinement, Defendants’ policy and practice is to reduce \nthis educational programming to approximately one hour outside the cell with a teacher who \ncomes to the segregation unit and meets with about three youth at a time.  During this time, they \nmay be in restraints and handcuffed to a desk in the classroom.  There are also many days when \nno teacher comes and the youth do not receive any education. \n48.  In addition, when Defendants put youth into segregation, Defendants revoke \naccess to the very programs which might help to rehabilitate the youth, such as Aggression \nReplacement Training (ART) and the Juvenile Cognitive Intervention Program (Phases I and II).  \nIf a youth misses more than a few sessions of any such program because he or she is in solitary \nconfinement, Defendants require the youth to start the program over from the beginning.  Failure \nto complete these programs also results in additional punitive consequences.  Defendants’ Office \nof Juvenile Offender Review (OJOR) considers failure to complete these programs a justification \nto deny a transfer out of LHS or CLS to a step-down facility or to deny early release.   \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 13 of 52\n49.  Defendants do not permit boys held in solitary confinement to receive phone calls \nfor the first 20 days in security status.  After 20 days, a boy can have a short phone call with his \nfamily. \n50.  According to Wisconsin Administrative Code § DOC 373.03(3) (for disciplinary \nsolitary confinement) and § DOC 374.03(4) (for administrative solitary confinement), youth in \nsegregation should have one hour of time out of the cell each day for exercise.  However, the \nstaff has a pattern and practice of frequently taking away this “out time” for minor infractions.  \n51.  Even those youth permitted “out time” are frequently kept in mechanical \nrestraints during the limited time they are allowed out of their cells.  Known as being “on the \nbelt,” youth are handcuffed to a canvas belt encircling the youth’s waist.  These youth are \nfrequently kept “on the belt” even during “exercise” time, although recently Defendants have at \ntimes allowed some youth who are otherwise “on the belt” short periods of time “off the belt” to \nexercise. \n52.  By policy and practice, LHS keeps most or all new male arrivals at the \nsegregation unit “on the belt” regardless of the reason the youth was sent to segregation.  At \nCLS, some girls in solitary confinement are placed “on the belt” during out of cell time. On \ninformation and belief, most youth in segregation are “on the belt” while out of their cells for the \nduration or a large portion of their time in solitary confinement.  On information and belief, most \nyouth in segregation are “on the belt” while out of their cells for the duration or a large portion of \ntheir time in solitary confinement. \n53.  DOC’s regulations expressly permit the use of restraints as a matter of course for \njuveniles in solitary confinement.  Wisconsin Administrative Code § DOC 376.09 governs use of \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 14 of 52\nmechanical restraints (including “handcuffs with restraining belt or chain”) and authorizes use on \n“a youth who is in security status while the youth is outside the place of confinement.” \n54.  If a youth is “on the belt,” the youth spends his or her “out time” chained to a \ntable in the central area of the segregation unit in front of the guard station.  Depending on the \nnumber of youth currently in the security units, there might be two or three youth chained to \ntables for the same hour, or the youth may be alone. For the girls at CLS in segregation, if they \nreceive out time, the hour of “out time” includes their shower, a period of time of room cleaning, \nand a limited amount of exercise before they are locked back in their cells.  If a girl has to go to \nhealth services or any other visit, that counts against her out time. On information and belief, \nrecently Defendants have occasionally allowed girls in solitary to receive a small amount of \nadditional out time, up to about three hours on those days. \n55.  Staff in the security units review a youth’s continued status on the belt once a \nweek.  If the staff decide that the youth has been on good behavior, the youth may be allowed out \nof his or her cell without being in restraints.       \n56.  Boys “off the belt,” may go outside during their one hour of “out time.”  \n“Outside” means that the boy is allowed, usually alone, into an outdoor caged area paved with \nconcrete.  Girls who are not on the belt usually remain indoors during their out time and may use \nan exercise machine. \n57.  Youth who are “on the belt” remain in restraints and chained to a desk or table \nduring their hour of education, and they are not allowed to have writing instruments in their cells. \n58.  Youth on the belt are also handcuffed to a table or desk during any visits they \nreceive.  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 15 of 52\n59.  On information and belief, youth on the belt are also locked into the shower stall \nwhen they are permitted to shower. \nSolitary Confinement Causes Serious Damage to Incarcerated Youth \n60.  Solitary confinement is particularly damaging to youth, who are still developing \nphysically, psychologically, cognitively, and socially. \n61.  Youth in segregation face a significant risk of serious emotional and \npsychological harm.  Solitary confinement negatively impacts juveniles by perpetuating, \nworsening, or precipitating mental health concerns, including but not limited to post-traumatic \nstress disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, major depression, hyper-vigilance, agitation, \ngeneral lack of trust, suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, self-mutilation, and suicidal behavior.   \n62.  These mental health concerns can cause long-term harm.  Solitary confinement \ncan lead to chronic conditions like depression which, in teenagers, can manifest as anger and/or \nas self-harm.  In addition, children who experience depression and anxiety in their teenage years \nare at higher risk of presenting with these diagnoses again.  Symptoms associated with \ndepression, such as low self-esteem, insomnia, inattention, low energy, fatigue, weight loss, and \nfeelings of hopelessness can similarly persist into adulthood.  There is a 10 to 15% mortality rate \nassociated with depression, and solitary confinement increases the risk of suicide substantially \ncompared to the risk in the general population.  \n63.  Solitary confinement of youth can also lead to long-term erosion of trust with \nadults, resulting in paranoia, anger, and hatred.  Juveniles emerging from solitary have trouble \nforming the therapeutic relationships necessary to address the mental health concerns resulting \nfrom solitary confinement.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 16 of 52\n64.  The risk of harm from solitary confinement is made worse by the \ndisproportionately high incidence of preexisting trauma and mental health concerns among \njuveniles in the justice system.  Research shows that more than 60% of the youth in correctional \nsettings have an underlying major mental illness.  Stress from isolation can compound past \ntrauma and exacerbate mental illnesses and disabilities.  \n65.  For those youth with a history of trauma, mental illnesses, or developmental \ndisabilities, the risk of harm from solitary confinement is especially great.  They already have \nweakened adaptive mechanisms, are at a higher risk for further mental health complications, are \nmore susceptible to significant trauma from social isolation, and are more likely to suffer long-\nlasting consequences from the trauma of isolation than those without mental illnesses or \ndisabilities.  \n66.  Not only is it harmful to deprive a youth of meaningful social interaction or \nmental stimulation, it also is counterproductive to the goals of ensuring safety, security, and good \norder.  Research shows that segregating youth results in increased agitation and an increased risk \nof misbehavior.  Facilities that have reduced their reliance on disciplinary isolation and instead \nhave adopted more appropriate techniques for managing juveniles have seen reductions in rates \nof violence and misbehavior.  Most of these facilities allow for no more than very short-term \nseparation—measured in hours, not days, weeks, or months (as is the case in LHS/CLS)—and \nthen only as a last resort when other options fail to defuse situations that pose an acute risk of \nharm to the juvenile or others.  \n67.  In a series of Eighth Amendment cases involving the death penalty and life \nwithout parole sentences, the Supreme Court has held that the distinctive developmental \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 17 of 52\nattributes of adolescence preclude punishing children in the same manner and to the same extent \nas adults under the Constitution.  \n68.  A number of professional organizations and institutions have echoed the Supreme \nCourt’s principle that children involved in the justice system, and particularly those who are \nincarcerated, cannot be treated like adults.  The National Commission on Correctional Health \nCare (“NCCHC”), for example, issued a statement establishing that juveniles should not be \nplaced in solitary confinement for any duration; the statement highlighted juveniles’ particular \nvulnerability to the adverse consequences of isolation.  The World Health Organization \n(“WHO”), the United Nations, and other international bodies have also recognized that solitary \nconfinement is particularly harmful to a child’s psychological well-being and cognitive \ndevelopment.  Acknowledging the high risk of mental illness as well as the higher rates of \nsuicide and self-harm for youth in solitary confinement, the United Nation’s (U.N.) Special \nRapporteur on Torture, in a 2015 report, condemned solitary confinement of children for any \nduration, calling it torture.  \n69.  Similarly, in 1999, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of \nthe United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) commissioned “the first comprehensive effort \nto determine the scope and distribution of suicides by youth in our public and private juvenile \nfacilities throughout the country.”  The study found that fifty percent of victims were in isolation \nat the time of their suicide, and sixty-two percent of victims had a history of isolation, noting \n“rates of suicidal behavior appeared to be higher for youth who were isolated from their peers or \nassigned to single room housing.”  Lindsey M. Hayes, Nat’l Ctr. on Inst. & Alternatives, \nJuvenile Suicide in Confinement: A National Survey 42 (2004); see also Steven H. Rosenbaum, \nChief, Special Litig. Section, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Remarks before the Fourteenth Annual \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 18 of 52\nNational Juvenile Corrections and Detention Forum (May 16, 1999) (“The use of extended \nisolation as a method of behavior control, for example, is an import from the adult system that \nhas proven both harmful and counterproductive when applied to juveniles.  It too often leads to \nincreased incidents of depression and self-mutilation among isolated juveniles, while also \nexacerbating their behavior problems.  We know that the use of prolonged isolation leads to \nincreased, not decreased, acting out, particularly among juveniles with mental illness.”)   \n70.  National and international standards governing corrections and juvenile justice \nuniformly condemn the use of solitary confinement in juvenile facilities and provide that where \nsegregation is necessary in certain acutely dangerous situations, it should be as brief as possible.  \n71.  The USDOJ’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Standards \nfor the Administration of Juvenile Justice (“JJDPA Standards”) provide that no juvenile should \nbe placed in room confinement for more than twenty-four hours.  Standards for the Admin. of \nJuvenile Justice § 4.52 (Nat’l Advisory Committee for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention 1980).  \n72.  The Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI), which has developed the \nmost widely recognized set of national best practices on the use of solitary confinement with \njuvenile populations, provides that solitary confinement can never be used for purposes of \npunishment or discipline and must be limited to periods of less than four hours. \n73.  Having recognized in a 2012 report that “[n]owhere is the damaging impact of \nincarceration on vulnerable children more obvious than when it involves solitary confinement,” \nthe USDOJ subsequently recommended that the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in \nfederal prisons be prohibited, and President Obama adopted that recommendation in January \n2016.  \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 19 of 52\n74.  The American Medical Association (“AMA”), the American Academy of Child \nand Adolescent Psychiatry, and the NCCHC all have called on correctional facilities to halt the \nuse of solitary confinement of juveniles for disciplinary purposes. \n75.  The international community has also condemned the placement of children in \nsolitary confinement.  International law prohibits the use of isolation as a disciplinary tool.  \nSpecifically, the U.N.’s Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty declare \nthat “all disciplinary measures constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment shall be \nstrictly prohibited, including corporal punishment, placement in a dark cell, closed or solitary \nconfinement or any other punishment that may compromise the physical or mental health of the \njuvenile concerned.”  G.A. Res. 45/113, Annex ¶ 67 (Dec. 14, 1990).  \n76.  Furthermore, long-term solitary confinement can be a form of psychological \ntorture, which international law strictly prohibits.  See, e.g., United Nations Convention Against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, G.A. Res. 39/46 \n(Dec. 10, 1984); see also Atul Gawande, Hellhole, The New Yorker, Mar. 30, 2009. \n77.  National and state standards and guidelines also recognize that it is essential for \nyouth confined in juvenile justice facilities to have a meaningful opportunity to exercise every \nday.  Standards set by various governmental and non-governmental entities, such as OJJDP, the \nNCCHC, the American Bar Association and the Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators \n(“CJCA”), make it clear that juveniles must have at least one hour per day of actual, strenuous, \nlarge-muscle exercise, with many recommending two or more hours per day, for both physical \nand mental health needs.  These standards also make it clear that keeping a child “on the belt” \nand handcuffed to a table does not constitute “exercise.” \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 20 of 52\n78.  Use of restraints is known to cause both physical and psychological harm. See \nJohnson, Being Restrained: A study of power and powerlessness¸ 19 ISSUES IN MENTAL HEALTH \nNURSING 191, 196-203 (1998); Singh, Singh, Davis, Latham & Ayers, Reconsidering the Use of \nSeclusion and Restraints in Inpatient Child and Adult Psychiatry, 8 J. OF CHILD & FAM. STUD. \n243, 244 (1999). \n79.  The practice of putting youth “on the belt” in restraints for weeks and months at a \ntime violates recognized national and international standards. \n80.  The Institute of Judicial Administration - ABA Standards for Juvenile Justice, \nStandards Relating to Corrections Administration, provide: \n7.8 Limitations on restraints and weapons.  \nA. Mechanical restraints. Given the small size of programs, it should not be \nnecessary to use mechanical restraints within the facility. The program director \nmay authorize the use of mechanical restraints during transportation only. \n81.  Article 64 of the U.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their \nLiberty provides: “Instruments of restraint and force can only be used in exceptional cases, \nwhere all other control methods have been exhausted and failed. . . . They should not cause \nhumiliation or degradation, and should be used restrictively and only for the shortest possible \nperiod of time.”  G.A. Res. 45/113, U.N.

Defendants know or should be aware of the risks of solitary confinement for \nyouth.  For example, President Obama’s actions to prohibit solitary confinement of juveniles in \nfederal custody—and the research on which the prohibition was based—were widely reported in \nthe media. \n84.  DOC officials are familiar with NCCHC policies and statements as a result of \ntheir efforts to achieve NCCHC accreditation of their facilities, and so are or should be aware of \nthe NCCHC’s policy position advocating a ban on solitary confinement of juveniles. \n85.  On or about October 25, 2016, Defendant Litscher received correspondence \nadvising him of the position of the AMA that solitary confinement of juveniles should be banned \nand of the Obama administration’s prohibition of solitary confinement of federal juvenile \nprisoners.  \n86.  Defendants nonetheless continue to subject numerous youth at LHS and CLS to \nextended periods of solitary confinement, with deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of \nserious harm it creates. \n87.  Similarly, Defendants are or should be aware of the harm to juveniles caused by \nthe use of restraints, such as being handcuffed to a waist belt and tethered to a table.  The \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 22 of 52\ninternational law standards have been in place and research on the harm of restraints has been \navailable for decades, and it is obvious that shackling a child to a table for the only time he or \nshe is allowed out of her cell is demeaning, psychologically harmful, and prevents essential \nlarge-muscle exercise. \n88.  Defendants nonetheless continue to routinely restrain youth in solitary \nconfinement by placing them “on the belt” for most or significant portions of their stays in \nsolitary, with deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of harm such restraints create. \nThe Plaintiffs Have Been Subjected To Excessive and Painful Pepper Spraying \n89.  In addition to solitary confinement, Defendants have a pattern and practice of \nroutinely using pepper spray to control the behavior of the youth in their custody, both while in \nthe general population and in solitary confinement. \n90.  Guards at LHS and CLS have a pattern and practice of using pepper spray \nunnecessarily and unreasonably on youth for non-violent infractions, such as refusing to go into \ntheir rooms, refusing to leave their rooms, covering up the cameras in the segregation unit, and \nfailing to follow commands.   \n91.  Defendants’ policy expressly permits use of pepper spray to “enforce a DOC rule, \na posted policy or procedure or an order of staff member,” even without any risk of harm to staff \nor youth or danger to the security of the institution.  DOC DJC Policy & Procedure 300.05.05 (9-\n28-2016). \n92.  According to records maintained by the Defendants, guards at LHS and CLS used \npepper spray on the youth in their care at least 198 times in the period January through October \n2016. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 23 of 52\n93.  Guards at LHS and CLS use multiple forms of pepper spray on youth in their \ncustody. Some pepper sprays are used to create a cloud which will fill the youth’s cell.  Others \nare sprayed directly at the face or body of a youth.     \n94.  Oleoresin capsicum (“OC”), the active ingredient in pepper spray, causes intense \nburning, coughing, and temporary blindness. \n95.  After youth are pepper sprayed, they are routinely locked into a cage in a shower.  \nThe effects of the spray are temporarily worsened by exposure to water and spread to sensitive \nareas such as the groin, causing intense pain.  To avoid this acute increase in pain, some youth \nchoose not to turn on the shower, but as a result the spray remains on their skin, prolonging the \nduration of their pain. \n96.  After guards use pepper spray on youth in solitary confinement, the guards \nremove all of the youth’s clothes and provide only a paper or cloth gown.   \n97.  After guards use pepper spray on youth in solitary confinement, the guards \nremove the regular mattress from the cells, providing only a rubber security mat in its place.  \n98.  Youth at CLS and LHS have described being pepper-sprayed as “feeling like you \nwere hit a hundred times.”  The effects of the spray can last for days, and are reactivated by \nwater even days later, such as when the child washes his or her face.     \n99.  The guards often use so much pepper spray that it fills the air and gets under \ndoors and into other cells on the wing, causing other youth pain, coughing, and other symptoms. \nWhile the guards at times don protective gear before they pepper spray a youth, they do not \nprovide protective gear for any of the youth, not even for those who are not the target of the \npepper spray but are nevertheless exposed to the spray due to their proximity. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 24 of 52\n100.  The JDAI standards require juvenile justice facilities to strictly prohibit the use of \nchemical agents.  Juvenile Detention Facility Assessment - Standards Instrument (2014 Update) \nat 104. \n101.  The Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators has also declared that pepper \nspray use is both harmful and counter-productive:  \n[Pepper spray’s] use has been shunned by juvenile correctional agencies because \nof the harm it causes to youths and the negative impact on staff-youth \nrelationships, the key to successful juvenile rehabilitative programming. Very few \nstates authorize its use and in the states that allow its use in policy, most prohibit \nthe use except as a last resort and with many conditions and few facilities put it \ninto practice. \nPepper Spray in Juvenile Facilities, CJCA, available at http://cjca.net/attachments/article/172/ \nCJCA.Issue.Brief.OCSpray.pdf.  \nDefendants Are Aware or Should Be Aware of the Risks of Harm Posed by Pepper Spray \nand Have Deliberately Chosen to Ignore Those Risks \n102.  Defendants know or should be aware of the risk of harm to juveniles from using \npepper spray and are aware that it is generally not necessary to manage juvenile misbehavior. \n103.  On information and belief, Defendants are members of the CJCA, see Agency \nDirectory, CJCA, http://cjca.net/index.php/resources/agency-directory (last visited April 12, \n2017), an organization that has condemned the use of pepper spray in juvenile correctional \nfacilities. Defendants nonetheless, as a matter of both practice and policy, continue to use pepper \nspray extensively  \nThe Plaintiffs Have Been Subjected To Excessive and Degrading Strip Searches \n104.  Defendants routinely subject youth at LHS and CLS to strip searches. Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants strip search all youth upon arrival at the facility, even when \nthey are being transported from another secure facility; when Defendants take them to solitary; \nafter family visits; and for other reasons.   \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 25 of 52\n105.  Defendants conduct these strip searches even though, upon information and \nbelief, all youth and visitors must pass through a metal detector upon entry into the prison. \n106.  When Defendants strip search youth, they require youth to take off all their \nclothes, run their hands through their hair, move their private parts, and squat and cough. At \ntimes Defendants have required youth taken to solitary confinement cells to remain squatting \nnaked until Defendants lock the door.  \n107.  Defendants sometimes strip search youth where other persons can see them. In the \nLHS solitary confinement wings, Defendants have strip searched youth where boys across the \nhall could see the youth being strip searched. In CLS, Defendants have strip searched youth in a \nroom that has a mirror, so that people outside the room could see the girl being strip searched, \nand in a room with a camera that records video viewable by guards, including male guards. \n108.  Strip searches are dehumanizing, humiliating, and harmful for children and \nadolescents. Teenagers, who are experiencing puberty and tend to be more self-conscious of their \nbodies than those in other age groups, are particularly vulnerable to the harms of strip searches. \n109.  Due to adolescents’ heightened concern for privacy, children in this age group \nmay experience a strip search as a form of sexual abuse. The inherent power differential between \nan adult authority figure and a child makes it more likely that a child will experience a strip \nsearch as an aggressive act. \n110.  Researchers have concluded that strip searches can lead children to experience \nyears of anxiety, depression, loss of concentration, sleep disturbances, difficulty performing in \nschool, phobic reactions, and lasting emotional scars. \n111.  The risk of lasting harm from strip searches is particularly acute for youth in the \njuvenile justice system, many of whom arrive burdened with histories of exposure to traumatic \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 26 of 52\nevents, compounding the psychological damage from strip searches and rendering it even more \ndevastating. Conservative estimates suggest that three out of four children in the juvenile justice \nsystem have suffered from childhood trauma.  \n112.  The compounding effects of re-traumatization through strip searches can cause \nlasting harm to children, disrupting critical aspects of brain and personality development and \nleading to long-term health consequences. \n113.  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has \ncondemned strip searches of children, concluding that “[s]trip searches of youths have the \npotential to cause lasting and severe psychological harm.” Br. of American Academy of Child \nand Adolescent Psychiatry, J.B. v. Fassnacht, 801 F.3d 336 (3d Cir. 2015) (cert. denied).  \nThe Named Plaintiffs Have Repeatedly Been and Are Likely in the Future To Be Subjected \nto Solitary Confinement, Mechanical Restraints, Pepper Spray and Strip Searches \nPlaintiff J.J. \n114.  Plaintiff J.J. is an African American boy from the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  \nHe was first committed to LHS in 2015 at the age of 15.  He was initially given a one-year \ncorrectional placement, which was extended for an additional year. \n115.  J.J. spent most of his time at Lincoln Hills in solitary confinement; he has been \nsent to solitary on approximately ten separate occasions for a variety of reasons.  Because of his \ntime in solitary confinement, J.J. has been limited in the amount of schooling he has been able to \nreceive and has not been able to complete programs designed for his rehabilitation.     \n116.  According to J.J., the guards in the segregation units “treat us like dogs, in cages, \ncausing us more trauma.” \n117.  J.J. believes that the guards intentionally provoke him and trigger him to react.   \n118.  J.J. has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 27 of 52\n119.  When in solitary confinement, J.J. was “on the belt” for most of the time he was \nallowed out of his cell.  In addition, Defendants have frequently taken away J.J.’s out time.   \n120.  J.J. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with symptoms that are frequently \ncaused by solitary confinement.  When he was in solitary confinement, he had trouble sleeping, \nhe felt anxious and was easily irritated by minor things, like being ignored, and he was \nincreasingly prone to anger.  He had episodes of sadness and restlessness while in solitary.  \n121.  Although J.J. is no longer at LHS, he remains in custody at Milwaukee County \nJuvenile Detention Facility, has other pending charges, and reasonably fears that he may be \nreturned to LHS.  He reasonably fears that he will be returned to solitary confinement again and \nput on the belt again at LHS, in the absence of injunctive relief. \n122.  LHS staff also pepper-sprayed J.J. five or six times, including shooting the \nburning spray directly in his face.  For example, on one occasion in 2016, J.J. was pepper-\nsprayed as guards were attempting to take him to segregation.  After being pepper sprayed, the \nguards threw him into the prison van, where he was left in a cloud of the spray.  \n123.  In another incident in July 2015, J.J. asked for a supervisor and refused to go back \ninto his cell in segregation until he talked to a supervisor about his shower.  Several guards \narrived and surrounded him in a circle and told him to get on the ground.  He did not.  The \nguards were preparing to pepper spray J.J. when he bolted for his cell.  Although there was no \nthreat of injury to anyone, the guards pepper-sprayed J.J. as he ran past and into his cell. \n124.  Guards at LHS also repeatedly strip searched J.J. after every family visit, each \ntime he was taken to solitary confinement, and when guards did a “shake down” of his housing \nunit.  Guards forced him to remove all of his clothing, inspected behind his ears and his genitals \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 28 of 52\nand made him squat and cough.  Although the strip searches usually occurred out of the sight of \nother youth, they occasionally happened within sight of other youth.       \n125.  Although J.J. is not currently at LHS, he remains in custody at the Milwaukee \nCounty Juvenile Detention Facility and has other pending charges and reasonably fears that he \nmay be returned to LHS. J.J. reasonably fears that he will again be subjected to solitary \nconfinement, strip searches and the use of pepper spray by LHS staff in the absence of injunctive \nrelief. \n126.  J.J. has exhausted his available administrative remedies. \nPlaintiff K.D. \n127.  Plaintiff K.D. is an African American girl from the City of Milwaukee, \nWisconsin.  She was first committed to CLS in July 2016 at the age of 14.   \n128.  While at CLS, K.D. was placed in solitary confinement on four separate \noccasions.  Her alleged infractions included being loud and being disruptive and allegedly taking \na tube of fabric paint from the art room, for which she was sent to solitary confinement for \nperiods ranging from about two to nine days. \n129.  K.D. has been diagnosed with ADHD. \n130.  K.D. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with symptoms that are frequently \ncaused by solitary confinement.  She experienced anxiety, sadness, hopelessness, restlessness, \nand finds that solitary confinement makes her increasingly irritated and angry.  Her sadness and \nhopelessness were so profound that she had suicidal thoughts. \n131.  While Defendants were holding K.D. in solitary confinement, they used so much \npepper spray on another girl in solitary confinement that spray filled the corridor.  The cloud of \npepper spray made K.D., and, on information and belief, other girls in the wing, cough and gag, \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 29 of 52\nand burned their throats.  Although the guards used masks to protect themselves from the impact \nof the spray, they offered no protection to any of the youth in that wing, including K.D. \n132.  KD was also repeatedly strip searched, including on one occasion when her unit \nwas searched for contraband and then hours later when she was put into solitary confinement for \nallegedly taking a tube of fabric paint from the art room.  \n133.  Although K.D. was released from CLS on or about March 15, 2017, she remains \nunder supervision and could be sent back to CLS for violating the terms of her supervision. She \nreasonably fears that she will again be subject to solitary confinement, pepper spray and strip \nsearches at CLS, if she is not granted injunctive relief.   \n134.  K.D. has exhausted her available administrative remedies. \nPlaintiff C.M. \n135.  Plaintiff C.M. is an African American boy from the City of Milwaukee, \nWisconsin.  He was committed to LHS in November 2016 at the age of 17. \n136.  In his first six weeks at LHS, C.M. spent close to two weeks in solitary \nconfinement for two separate incidents. \n137.  Neither incident involved any violence or threat to security.   \n138.  On his first confinement in solitary, C.M. was released after seven days.  He never \nreceived any written notice of charges against him or any type of due process hearing to justify \nthis punishment.  Defendants told him they were releasing him because no disciplinary conduct \nreport had ever been prepared. \n139.  Although C.M. had not been involved in any violent incident or threat of violence, \nhe was initially placed “on the belt” for multiple days, due to the LHS policy and practice of \nplacing all new arrivals in segregation on the belt. \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 30 of 52\n140.  C.M. was taken to solitary the second time shortly before Christmas, 2016.  The \nstaff supervisor told C.M. that this time a conduct report would actually be prepared.  He was \nreleased on or about December 29, 2016, without having received written notice of the charges \nagainst him or a due process hearing, although he was told orally he was found guilty of the \nmisconduct.  \n141.  C.M. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with those frequently caused by \nsolitary confinement.  He was sad because he could not speak with his mother.  He felt anxious \nand was unable to sleep.  He was irritable and annoyed by the noise in the unit.  He felt treated \nlike an animal: cuffed to come out of the cell, cuffed to shower, cuffed everywhere he went.  His \nhair started falling out. \n142.  C.M. has been in solitary confinement and reasonably fears that he will be kept in \nsolitary confinement or returned to solitary confinement again at LHS if he is not granted \ninjunctive relief. \n143.  C.M. has exhausted his available administrative remedies. \nPlaintiff R.N. \n144.  Plaintiff R.N. is an African American boy from the City of Milwaukee, \nWisconsin.   He arrived at LHS in April, 2016, just two months after his 14th birthday. \n145.  Between April 2016 and December 2016, or a period of approximately eight \nmonths, R.N. estimates that he spent only two weeks out of solitary confinement.  As a result, he \nreceived extremely limited educational programming and virtually no rehabilitative \nprogramming during his time at LHS. \n146.  R.N. was pepper-sprayed many times by staff at LHS.  Each time he has suffered \nan intense burning sensation over all the affected areas of his body. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 31 of 52\n147.  After pepper-spraying R.N. in the solitary confinement unit, the staff would \nremove R.N.’s mattress from his cell and replace it with only a hard rubber security mat.  On one \noccasion, he was forced to sleep four consecutive nights on just the security mat.  On another \noccasion, the staff did not even provide a security mat, but forced R.N. to try to sleep on the cold \nbed frame.  \n148.  R.N. has been diagnosed with ADHD. \n149.  R.N. exhibits symptoms that are consistent with those frequently caused by \nsolitary confinement.  At LHS, R.N. has been on suicide watch.  In one incident at LHS, he \nreached an electrical cord attached to a fan near his door, pulled it through the food tray slot, and \nwrapped it around his neck.  Upon realizing what R.N. had done, the guards responding to his \nbehavior initially pulled on the cord, leaving marks on R.N.’s neck, and then fogged his room \nwith pepper spray.   \n150.  On December 7, 2016, Defendants transferred R.N. to MJTC for diagnosis and \ntreatment of mental health concerns.      \n151.  R.N. reasonably fears that he may be returned to LHS and that he will be returned \nto solitary confinement again at LHS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n152.  R.N. reasonably fears that he may be returned to LHS and that he will again be \nsubjected to the use of strip searches, physical restraints and pepper spray by LHS staff in the \nabsence of injunctive relief. \n153.  R.N. has exhausted his available administrative remedies. \nPlaintiff M.S. \n154.  Plaintiff M.S. is a Native American boy from Marathon County, Wisconsin.  He \narrived at LHS in August 2016 at about the time he turned 16. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 32 of 52\n155.  During his time at LHS, M.S. spent about a month in solitary confinement for \nviolating LHS rules.  He did not get a conduct report until about a week after he was sent to \nsolitary.  A few days later he had a hearing and was sentenced to 20 more days in solitary. \n156.  Although M.S. was placed in “low hall,” a security unit for youth who are doing \nwell, on some days Defendants put him “on the belt.” \n157.  Being in solitary made M.S. feel anxious, depressed, and degraded. \n158.  M.S. has also been exposed to pepper spray.  When he first went into solitary, the \nguards gave him a blanket that must have still had pepper spray on it, because his faced burned \nwhen it rubbed the blanket.  On another occasion the guards used so much pepper spray on \nsomeone in the hallway that the spray came into his cell and took hours to clear away, making \nhim cough and making his eyes water and his nose run.  \n159.  M.S. has also been repeatedly strip searched at LHS.  Among other incidents, \nwhen the guards took him to solitary they went into the cell with him, strip searched him, and \nmade him remain squatting naked until they left the cell and closed the door.  Another time, \nwhen doing a “shake down” of his general population housing unit looking for contraband, the \nguards took the youth living on the unit into the bathroom and strip searched them two at a time.   \n160.  M.S. reasonably fears that he will be returned to solitary confinement again at \nLHS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n161.  M.S. reasonably fears that he will be again be put “on the belt” in the absence of \ninjunctive relief. \n162.  M.S. reasonably fears that he will again be subjected or exposed to pepper spray \nby LHS staff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 33 of 52\n163.  M.S. reasonably fears that he will again be strip searched in the absence of \ninjunctive relief. \n164.  M.S. has exhausted his available administrative remedies.  \nPlaintiff A.V. \n165.  Plaintiff A.V. is a Latino boy from the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He arrived \nat LHS in May 2016 at the age of 16. \n166.  During his time at LHS, A.V. has been sent to solitary confinement about four or \nfive times—once because he was accused of stealing a muffin—and has spent more than a month \nin solitary confinement.  On several of these occasions he did not get a conduct report for close \nto a week after the guards put him in solitary, and he did not get a hearing for several days after \nthat. \n167.  A.V. was “on the belt” during most of his time in solitary confinement.  He was \nkept on the belt whenever he left his cell for “out time,” for school, and for medical \nappointments. \n168.  Being in solitary made A.V. feel depressed and sleepless, and he got emotional \nfrom being there. \n169.  A.V. has also been exposed to pepper spray about four times, when the guards \nwere spraying other youth.  The spray made him feel like his body and eyes were burning, and \nmade him nauseated, light-headed, and short of breath.  The solitary cells also had pepper spray \nresidue in them that burned his skin.  \n170.  A.V. has also been repeatedly strip searched at LHS.  He has been strip searched \nwhen the guards took him to solitary, after family visits, and during “shake downs” looking for \ncontraband in the general population unit. \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 34 of 52\n171.  A.V. reasonably fears that he will be returned to solitary confinement again at \nLHS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n172.  A.V. reasonably fears that he will be again be put “on the belt” in the absence of \ninjunctive relief. \n173.  A.V. reasonably fears that he will again be subjected or exposed to pepper spray \nby LHS staff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n174.  A.V. reasonably fears that he will again be strip searched in the absence of \ninjunctive relief. \n175.  A.V. has exhausted his available administrative remedies. \nPlaintiff M.R. \n176.  Plaintiff M.R. is an African American boy from the City of Kenosha, Wisconsin.  \nHe has been in LHS several times beginning in 2014 when he was 14 or 15, and has been \ncontinuously in LHS since 2016. \n177.  M.R. has been in solitary confinement continuously, or almost continuously, since \nlate October 2016.  He is repeatedly given new charges, so his sentence to solitary is repeatedly \nextended. He has been in solitary confinement for so long that he is starting to feel that it is \nnormal to live that way, with 22 or 23 hours a day in a cell that has almost nothing more than a \nmattress in it. \n178.  M.R. also has been “on the belt” during most of his time in solitary confinement.  \nHe is kept “on the belt” whenever he leaves his cell for “out time,” for time with a teacher, and \nfor any visits, including legal visits.  Recently the guards have started making the handcuffs of \nthe belt tighter around his wrists, and using a shorter “leash” to attach the cuffs to the belt around \nhis waist. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 35 of 52\n179.  M.R. has been pepper sprayed so many times he can’t count them.  He has been \npepper sprayed for many reasons, even at times for not going into his cell, for covering up the \ncamera, to make him get into the shower, or because staff said M.R. was going to harm himself. \n180.  On information and belief, M.R. has been diagnosed with depression and mood \nswings.  Being in solitary at times makes M.R. feel depressed and like he wants to go to the \nMendota Juvenile Treatment Center.  Other times solitary makes him feel angry.  Still other \ntimes he is so bored that even being pepper sprayed feels like something to fill part of his day.  \n181.  After he is pepper sprayed, the guards have put M.R. into a shower cage, given \nhim a paper or cloth gown instead of his clothing, and replaced the mattress in his cell with a \nhard rubber mat. \n182.  M.R. has also been repeatedly strip searched at LHS.  For example, he was strip \nsearched when he arrived at LHS, when the guards took him to solitary and after he was pepper \nsprayed. He has been strip searched where other youth in the wing could see him. \n183.  M.R. reasonably fears that he will remain in or be returned to solitary \nconfinement again at LHS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n184.  M.R. reasonably fears that he will remain on or again be put “on the belt” in the \nabsence of injunctive relief. \n185.  M.R. reasonably fears that he will again be subjected or exposed to pepper spray \nby LHS staff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n186.  M.R. reasonably fears that he will again be strip searched in the absence of \ninjunctive relief.  \n187.  M.R. has exhausted his available administrative remedies.  \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 36 of 52\nPlaintiff S.K. \n188.  Plaintiff S.K. is a biracial girl from Winnebago County, Wisconsin.  She has been \nin CLS several times since 2015, when she was about 15.  Most recently she has been in CLS \nsince about July 2016.  \n189.  Plaintiff S.K. has been in solitary several times at CLS, including about 34 days in \nand around May 2016, and a total of about two weeks since she returned to CLS in July 2016.  \nShe has been put in solitary for such reasons as passing notes in the general population unit and \nfor being accused of having stolen gummy worms in her cell, among other reasons. \n190.  When she was in solitary confinement, S.K. seldom had any educational \nprogramming. \n191.  Being in solitary made S.K. feel depressed. \n192.  S.K. has also been exposed to pepper spray, when the guards sprayed another girl \nin the unit with so much pepper spray that it got into S.K.’s cell and made her cough.   \n193.  S.K. has also been repeatedly strip searched at CLS.  At times she has been strip \nsearched in a room with a mirror that meant someone walking outside the room could see her, \nand in a room with a camera that guards—including male guards—could use to view her.  On \none occasion a guard had a body camera activated during the strip search.  \n194.  S.K. reasonably fears that she will be returned to solitary confinement again at \nCLS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n195.  S.K. reasonably fears that she will again be subjected or exposed to pepper spray \nby CLS staff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n196.  S.K. reasonably fears that she will again be strip searched in the absence of \ninjunctive relief. \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 37 of 52\n197.  S.K. has exhausted her available administrative remedies.  \nPlaintiff A.P. \n198.  Plaintiff A.P. is a 15 year old Caucasian girl from Washington County, \nWisconsin. She has been at CLS since about July 2016.  \n199.  Plaintiff A.P. has often been in solitary confinement at CLS, for a total of many \nweeks of isolation. She has been put in solitary confinement, or her time in solitary has been \nextended, for reasons including cursing at staff or putting a sandwich on someone’s window.  At \nother times she was put in solitary for observation (“OBS”). \n200.  When she was in solitary confinement, A.P. often was denied “out time” and \nspent many days without any educational programming.  On most days she was in her solitary \nconfinement cell for 22 or 23 hours a day; occasionally she was allowed out for up to three \nhours. \n201.  A.P. was “on the belt” in solitary, once for about five days and once for a week.  \nDuring the time she was on the belt she did not have school, and she was chained to a table the \nwhole time she was out of her cell.  During that time, when she showered the shower was \npadlocked.  \n202.  Being in solitary made A.P. feel angry and negative, and sometimes it made her \nwant to hurt herself.  She could also hear other girls banging their heads in their cells for long \nperiods of time. \n203.  A.P. has also been threatened with and exposed to pepper spray.  In general \npopulation, the guards threatened to pepper spray her when she did not want to go to her room, \nbut instead took her to solitary confinement and put her “on the belt.”  Another time, the guards \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 38 of 52\npepper sprayed a girl in A.P.’s wing in solitary with so much spray it got under A.P.’s door and \nmade her cough up blood; the guards would not let her have her inhaler.  \n204.  A.P. has also been repeatedly strip searched at CLS, including when she was \ntaken to solitary, after family visits, and if someone reported something missing.  Having the \nguards stare at her naked body makes her feel dirty.  \n205.  A.P. reasonably fears that she will be returned to solitary confinement again at \nCLS in the absence of injunctive relief. \n206.  A.P. reasonably fears that she will be put “on the belt” again at CLS in the \nabsence of injunctive relief. \n207.  A.P. reasonably fears that she will again be subjected or exposed to pepper spray \nby CLS staff in the absence of injunctive relief. \n208.  A.P. reasonably fears that she will again be strip searched in the absence of \ninjunctive relief. \n209.  A.P. has exhausted her available administrative remedies.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n210.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all members of the class of \npersons who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated at LHS or CLS (the “Class”).   \n211.  Plaintiffs seek class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(2).  \n212.  The Class consists of all youth currently incarcerated at LHS and CLS and any \nyouth who are incarcerated there in the future.  The exact number of inmates currently in the \nClass is not known to Plaintiffs with certainty, particularly because the number of Class \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 39 of 52\nmembers fluctuates.  On information and belief, the number of current Class members is \napproximately 165 (145 boys at LHS and 20 girls at CLS).  In addition to Class members \ncurrently held at LHS and CLS, the Class consists of an unknown number of youth who will be \nincarcerated in those facilities in the future and, absent injunctive relief, subjected to the same \ntreatment as youth currently incarcerated.  \n213.  The individual Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the \nClass, because they have all been subjected to solitary confinement, restraints, the excessive use \nof pepper spray, strip searches, and/or to the threat of being subjected to solitary confinement, \nrestraints, pepper spray, or strip searches in the future.  Plaintiffs and all members of the Class \nhave similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising from Defendants’ actions \nand inaction.   \n214.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class.  These \ncommon legal and factual questions include:     \na.  Whether Defendants’ policy and practice of placing youth in solitary confinement for \npunitive or disciplinary purposes and for a period any longer than a few hours violates \nthe Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.   \nb.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices of using mechanical restraints violates the \nEighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \nc.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices of using pepper spray violate the Eighth \nand/or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \nd.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices of strip searching violate the Fourth \nand/or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 40 of 52\ne.  Whether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek.  \n215.  By confining substantial numbers of youth in solitary confinement for relatively \nminor infractions and for other disciplinary or punitive purposes, by routinely using restraints on \nyouth to control behavior, by using pepper spray on youth to control behavior, and by strip \nsearching youth, Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nentire Class.  \n216.  The claims asserted herein are capable of repetition while evading review.  There \nis a continuing and substantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and \ninjunctive relief in favor of the Plaintiffs and the Class.  \n217.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b)(2), \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, because Plaintiffs and other members of the Class seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and all of the above factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present.  \n218.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause individual litigation of these claims would be impracticable, and individual litigation \nwould be unduly burdensome to the courts.   \n219.  The named Plaintiffs, their representatives, and Class counsel will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests of the Class.  The named Plaintiffs and their representatives \nhave no interests in this matter that are antagonistic to other Class Members.  Class counsel have \nmany years of experience in civil rights and class action litigation.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Defendants’ Use of Solitary Confinement  \nViolates the Fourteenth Amendment Right to Rehabilitation \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 41 of 52\n \n220.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 220 above are incorporated herein. \n221.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the \nsubstantive due process rights of the Plaintiffs, juvenile prisoners at Lincoln Hills and Copper \nLake, including a right to a rehabilitative environment and rehabilitative treatment. \n222.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of using solitary confinement, \ndescribed above, which interferes with Plaintiffs’ rehabilitation and harms Plaintiffs emotionally, \npsychologically, physically and educationally.   \n223.  This use of solitary confinement deprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due \nprocess right to rehabilitative treatment and a rehabilitative environment, in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n224.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law.   \n225.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein. \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury. Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to harm Plaintiffs and other class members by \ndepriving them of rehabilitation, in violation of their substantive due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nCount II: Defendants’ Use of Restraints  \nViolates the Fourteenth Amendment Right to Rehabilitation \n \n226.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 225 above are incorporated herein. \n227.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the \nsubstantive due process rights of the Plaintiffs, juvenile prisoners at Lincoln Hills and Copper \nLake, including a right to a rehabilitative environment and rehabilitative treatment. \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 42 of 52\n228.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of use of restraints, including \nplacing juveniles “on the belt” and tethering them to tables and desks whenever they are out of \ntheir cells in solitary confinement, as described above, which interferes with their rehabilitation \nand harms Plaintiffs emotionally, psychologically, physically and educationally.   \n229.  This use of restraints deprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due process right to \nrehabilitative treatment and a rehabilitative environment, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n230.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law.   \n231.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein. \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury. Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to harm Plaintiffs and other class members by \ndepriving them of rehabilitation, in violation of their substantive due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nCount III: Defendants’ Use of Restraints Constitutes Excessive Use of Force in  \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n \n232.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 231 above are incorporated herein. \n233.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process guarantee prohibits \njuvenile prison officials from using objectively unreasonable force against the juvenile prisoners \nin their custody. \n234.  As described above, Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of excessive use \nof mechanical restraints, including placing juveniles “on the belt” and tethering them to tables \nand desks whenever they are out of their cells in solitary confinement.  \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 43 of 52\n235.  Defendants’ use of restraints is intentional and objectively unreasonable, and thus \ndeprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due process rights, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. This excessive use of restraints is not necessary to achieve any legitimate purpose \nand creates a substantial risk of serious emotional, psychological and physical harm to Plaintiffs. \n236.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law.   \n237.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein.  \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.  Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to subject Plaintiffs and other class members to \nobjectively unreasonable force, in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nCount IV: Defendants’ Use of Pepper Spray Constitutes Excessive Use of Force in \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n238.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 237 above are incorporated herein. \n239.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process guarantee prohibits \njuvenile prison officials from using objectively unreasonable force against the juvenile prisoners \nin their custody. \n240.  As described above, Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of excessive use \nof pepper spray.  \n241.  Defendants’ use of pepper spray is intentional and objectively unreasonable, and \nthus deprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due process rights, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. This use of pepper spray is not necessary to achieve any legitimate purpose and \ncreates a substantial risk of serious emotional, psychological and physical harm to Plaintiffs. \n242.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law.   \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 44 of 52\n243.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein.  \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.  Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to subject Plaintiffs and other class members to \nobjectively unreasonable force, in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nCount V: Defendants’ Failure to Protect Juveniles from Pepper Spray and Restraints \nViolates the Fourteenth Amendment \n244.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 243 above are incorporated herein. \n245.  The substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment requires juvenile prison officials to take reasonable measures to prevent the \nexcessive use of force against juvenile prisoners in the officials’ care. \n246.  Defendants know that security staff at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake have a \npolicy, pattern or practice of use of pepper spray and use of restraints and that such use creates a \nsubstantial risk that juvenile prisoners will be seriously harmed. \n247.  Defendants have failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the excessive use \nof pepper spray and restraints by security staff at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake.   \n248.  By failing to protect Plaintiffs, Defendants have deprived them of their \nsubstantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n249.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law. \n250.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein. \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.  Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to fail to protect the Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers from excessive force, in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 45 of 52\nCount VI: Defendants’ Use of Solitary Confinement Violates the Eighth Amendment \n251.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 250 above are incorporated herein. \n252.  The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids state actors to \nimpose cruel and unusual punishment on convicted prisoners, including acting (or failing to act) \nwith deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to prisoners’ health or safety. \n253.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of routinely using solitary \nconfinement for juvenile prisoners at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake.  As described above, \nDefendants’ practice of solitary confinement subjects Plaintiffs to, among other harmful \nconditions: 22-23 hours per day in a single, small and bare cell—for days, weeks or months at a \ntime—locked behind a solid metal door, with no furniture other than a low bed and a \ncombination toilet/sink, with constant illumination, even at night, and with extremely limited \naccess to personal property; shackling the hands of juveniles in solitary confinement to a waist \nbelt during the limited times they are out of their cells for days and sometimes weeks at a time; \nlack of access to educational and rehabilitative programming while in solitary confinement; and \nlack of access to meaningful exercise and social interaction.  This solitary confinement creates a \nsubstantial risk of serious emotional, psychological and physical harm to Plaintiffs. \n254.  Defendants use solitary confinement against juvenile prisoners with deliberate \nindifference, in that they are or should be aware of the substantial risk of serious harm to the \nPlaintiffs caused by use of solitary confinement for disciplinary or punitive purposes, but \ncontinue to subject Plaintiffs to such confinement and have failed to take reasonable steps to \nprevent the harm. \n255.  By imposing solitary confinement, Defendants have subjected Plaintiffs to cruel \nand unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \n45 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 46 of 52\n256.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law. \n257.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein.  \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury. Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to subject the Plaintiffs and other Class \nmembers to a substantial risk of serious harm, in violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \nCount VII: Defendants’ Use of Restraints Violates the Eighth Amendment \n258.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 257 above are incorporated herein. \n259.  The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids state actors to \nimpose cruel and unusual punishment on convicted prisoners, including acting (or failing to act) \nwith deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to prisoners’ health or safety. \n260.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of routine and excessive use of \nrestraints, including placing juveniles “on the belt” and tethering them to tables and desks \nwhenever they are out of their cells in solitary confinement.  This excessive use of restraints \ncreates a substantial risk of serious emotional, psychological and physical harm to Plaintiffs. \n261.  Defendants use mechanical restraints against juvenile prisoners with deliberate \nindifference, in that they are or should be aware of the substantial risk of serious harm to the \nPlaintiffs caused by excessive use of restraints but continue to subject Plaintiffs to it and have \nfailed to take reasonable steps to prevent the harm. \n262.  By routinely and excessively using mechanical restraints, Defendants have \nsubjected Plaintiffs to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eight Amendment. \n263.  Defendants, all state employees, have acted or failed to act and are continuing to \nact or fail to act under color of state law. \n46 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 13   Filed: 04/17/17   Page 47 of 52\n264.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described herein.  \nThe relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury. Unless \nenjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to subject the Plaintiffs and other Class \nmembers to a substantial risk of serious harm, in violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \nCount VIII: Defendants’ Use of Restraints Constitutes Excessive Force in  \nViolation of the Eighth Amendment \n \n265.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 264 above are incorporated herein. \n266.  The Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment forbids state \nactors to use excessive force against convicted prisoners. \n267.  Defendants have a policy, pattern or practice of excessive and unnecessary use of \nrestraints, including placing juveniles “on the belt” and tethering them to tables and desks \nwhenever they are out of their cells in solitary confinement.  This excessive use of restraints is \nnot necessary to achieve any legitimate penological purpose and creates a substantial risk of \nserious emotional, psychological and physical harm to Plaintiffs.  \n268.  Defendants’ use of restraints is intentional, and Defendants know or should know \nthat such restraints are unnecessary to and ineffective in maintaining or restoring security or \ndiscipline, and thus has the purpose and effect of harming Plaintiffs without a legitimate \npenological purpose.   \n269.  By the routine and excessive use of restraints, Defendants have subjected \nPlaintiffs to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \n270.

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n TWELFTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Eleventh Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on November 15, 2021. The \nMonitor’s  twelfth  report  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree, \nimplementation  of  recommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and \ncomment on any observations and/or updates since the eleventh site visit which took place on \nOctober 14, 2021. \nSITE VISIT  \nThe twelfth site visit by the Monitor took place on January 13 and 14, 2022.  Due to the continuing \npandemic, the Monitor limited onsite time to one day and a half (1.5 days) and completed necessary \ninterviews/information gathering via in-person and virtual meetings prior to and after the site visit. \nThe Monitor reviewed materials provided by the parties prior to and after the site visit for the \nreporting period ending December 31, 2021. Materials included but were not limited to: use of \nforce videos, video footage of units and safety and security checks, COVID-19 related memos, \ndirectives  and  plans,  programming  materials,  discipline  documents,  investigations,  PREA \ninvestigations, various staff memos, daily shift reports, policies, all of the monthly data submitted \nto the parties per this Court Order (October, November, and December 2021), updated unit rules, \nwork rules, meeting notes, employee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint \ndocumentation, incident reports, PbS data, and other housing documentation.  The Monitoring \nteam was on site during this site visit. Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted approximately eight (8) youth \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 2 of 45\n \ninterviews virtually before and after the site visit.  The Monitor toured LHS/CLS and interviewed \nyouth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to the majority of youth and staff present \nand available during the site visit. Approximately thirty-nine youth (39) youth and twenty-seven \n(27) staff were interviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.   \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction \n \nAll of the COVID-19 modifications (health screenings, intake process, and quarantine process) \nwere still in place during this reporting period. The COVID-19 precautions have remained \nconsistent with the CDC’s guidance for congregate settings.  There have been six (6) youth \nCOVID-19 cases and thirty-three (33) staff cases. This marks a substantial increase in staff positive \ncases from the last report. COVID-19 vaccinations continue to be offered to every youth and staff \nmeeting the CDC guidelines.  Defendants need to continue to require staff to where masks. \n \nThe total LHS/CLS population continues to remain low, ranging in mid to high forties (40s) on \naverage for this reporting period.  The overall atmosphere was pretty consistent from the last visit \nwhich was positive overall.  There continues to be concern regarding programming, use of force, \nuse of mechanical restraints, youth self-confining, quality and quantity of education, and other \nissues. However, overall, youth and staff morale were good and there has been progress in some \nareas of the consent decree from the last site visit (detailed throughout the report).   \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, most units, school, and many other areas were clean and orderly. \nDefendants completed renovating Douglass Living Unit, which is otherwise unoccupied, into a \nrecreation space including the addition of a ping pong table, air hockey, electronic darts, and a \nvariety of board games.  The Unit looks amazing with many recreational activities available for \nyouth. Staff and youth are enjoying the space. Defendants added materials and supplies to the \nkitchen for youth to engage in baking and cooking. The youth told the Monitor how much they \nlove cooking and are enjoying the new recreation space.  \nDefendants continue with the following projects: \n(1)  The installation of new windows and window frames in each of the twelve (12) living \nunits. Youth continue to break/damage windows. The new windows and frames include \nspecialized glass that can withstand significant duress without failing. This effort will \nimprove the environment and lighting as well as safety while reducing the need to regularly \nreplace broken windows.  \n(2) Lighting upgrade project by submitting project documents for final approval and funding. \nThis project will change the lighting in youth rooms, unit dayrooms, and emergency \nlighting. As stated in the last report, this will significantly improve the atmosphere on the \nunit.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 3 of 45\n \n(3) Additional fixed cameras throughout the facility including both internal and external \ncameras. Over the next couple of years, this project will result in the installation of over \n100 new cameras that will increase both safety and accountability throughout the facility. \n(4) Pursuing the replacement of boilers in the remaining living units. Along with heating \nboilers, the potable water heaters and exhaust fans are being considered for replacement as \nwell.  \n(5) Received approval to pursue electrical upgrades in the greenhouse. This upgrade will allow \nfor additional functionality in the greenhouse and address aging electrical issues.  \n(6) Enhanced the Music Arts Initiative by adding additional computer, software, and hardware \ncomponents. \n(7) Upgraded the electrical in the revamped welding shop. The electrical upgrade will allow \nyouth to train and practice their newly learned skills on newer, more modern welders. In \naddition to the general electrical upgrade the lighting will also be enhanced in the updated \nspace.  \nThe Monitor recommended in the last report that the Defendants should continue to focus on the \nsensory rooms on the units as this can be a place for youth to relax and cool down when needed. \nThe  sensory  rooms  on  the  units  have  vastly  improved  from  the  last  site  visit  with  added \ncomfortable seating  and decor.  The Defendants should be commended for their continuing \ncommitment to improve the physical plant which improves the daily lives for staff and youth. The \nMonitor will continue to update the Court on physical plant improvements that increase the safety \nand quality of life for youth and staff.   \nEducation Observations \nThe school general areas and classrooms were spotless. Due to the timing of the site visit, the \nMonitor was not able to observe youth in the classrooms. However, the Monitor viewed random \nvideo during the reporting period and observed students actively participating in class and teachers \nteaching  various  curriculum.    The  Monitor  also  observed  youth  having  class  on  their  unit \n(discussed more below). The Monitor was able to meet the new education Director and discussed \nhis plans for the education program.  \nAs detailed in the last report, Defendants completed a competitive bid process and awarded a \ncontract  to  three  consultants  to  evaluate  the  educational  programming  at  LHS/CLS.  The \nconsultants are national experts and have been selected to evaluate key educational areas including:  \n•  Operations  \n•  Curriculum and Instruction  \n•  Academic Assessments  \n•  Special Education  \n•  Human Capital  \n•  Technology Integration  \n•  Transition  \nEvaluation work commenced on November 30, 2021 and a full final report is expected sometime \nin the first half of 2022.   \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 4 of 45\n \nThe Monitor recommended in the last report that the girls’ classrooms should be painted a brighter \ncolor and have more of a classroom feel.  The CLS youth picked the colors for the classrooms and \nthe Defendants have painted the rooms.  The classrooms are not in use yet as the furniture, décor, \netc. still need to be finished.  The Monitor looks forward to seeing the finished classroom. The \nCLS youth are excited to use these rooms.  \nAny youth in COVID-19 quarantine and youth in the High-Risk Unit (“HRU”) Program (Krueger \nUnit) continue to have education in the unit and not at the school.  The Monitor continues to \nrecommend that the frequency of music, art, and recreation needs to increase.  The quality of the \nmusic program is second to none and all youth would benefit from the program not just during the \nschool day but on weekends when there is the most idle time.   \nPbS data shows that educational hours for October 2021 decreased slightly from the April 2021 \ndata collection period, dropping to 4.43 hours per day at LHS (weekdays) compared to 4.93 hours \nin April, and dropping to 4.20 hours per day at CLS (weekdays) from 5.32 hours during the April \ndata cycle.   \nThe Krueger Unit education hours improved and increased during the October cycle and are only \nslightly below the other units.  Krueger recorded 4.18 hours of education compared to 4.45 hours \nfor the other units. During tours of the units, the Monitor observed on-unit education taking place \nin the Roosevelt dayroom area.  There were four (4) youth participating in the remote learning \nclass.  The dayroom area was extremely loud and distracting due to other youth in the area.  It did \nnot appear that the youth were receiving a quality remote learning experience given the distraction \nfrom the other youth. The Monitor looks forward to progress made with the new educational \nleadership and consultants. \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit.  The living units \nwere generally clean. Overall, the units and youth rooms were not as clean as the last visit.  Youth \nwere also more spirited/less calm than the last site visit.  \nThere were more than adequate staffing levels on each of the living units.  The unit populations \nranged from six (6) to eleven (11) youth.  Staff were less engaged with the youth than during the \nlast site visit, however the tour of the living units happened when youth were either about to leave \nthe unit or youth were returning to the unit. Staff were mainly positioned in their offices or on the \nperimeter of the room. The Monitor wanted to confirm whether this was a regular occurrence or \ncoincidental based on the timing. The Monitor reviewed video during the reporting period to view \nday room activities, staff placement and staff engagement.  There were many instances in which \nstaff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables and areas with youth, which was \npositive. The youth-staff relationship in general seems positive and several youth told the Monitor \nthat they liked the staff.   The body language and tone were positive from both youth and staff in \ngeneral.   All the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and willingly communicated \nwith the monitoring team.  The Monitoring team had an opportunity to talk to most of the youth \npresent in the day rooms.  There were more youth in their rooms (self-directed) than the last site \nvisit.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 5 of 45\n \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed in the Wells Unit.  There were twelve (12) youth total \nin CLS.  The King unit was not used for youth to sleep in, but youth were on the unit for \nprogramming during the waking hours. There were three staff members on each unit. Wells unit \nwas clean in general, but the King unit was not.  The youth rooms on CLS were quite messy which \nis not typical of CLS.  Two (2) youth were confined to their rooms due to being in medical isolation \nand one (1) youth self-confined because she stated she did not feel safe.  The girls were not calm \nlike they usually tend to be. The CLS youth had complaints for the monitoring team as detailed \nbelow. \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, Addams, Curtis, Miller, Hughes, and Rogers were empty units \nduring this site visit. The boys were housed on Krueger, Black Elk, Dubois, and Roosevelt. As \npreviously mentioned, the Douglass unit is the new recreation unit. All units had more than \nadequate  staffing.  Youth  were  getting  back  from  school,  participating  in  DBT  group,  on \ntelephones, watching television, playing video games, in their rooms sleeping, or cleaning.   \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor discussed the “Hughes Program.” The “Hughes Program” was \nimplemented on March 30, 2021 and is considered the “High Risk” Unit. The program continues \nto be housed in the Krueger unit. For the purposes of this report, the unit will be referred to as High \nRisk Unit (“HRU”).  HRU Program is modified programming for youth who engage in physically \naggressive behavior, present a danger to others, and/or exhibited behavior that caused a major \ndisruption to the facility.  After the last site visit, the monitoring team offered suggestions to \nimproving  the  program  and  provided  examples  of  similar  programs  that  can  potentially  be \nincorporated within the structure of current program to enhance the overall impact and improve \nservices and outcomes.   The Defendants implemented some of these suggestions and are still \nrevising the program.  Youth housed on HRU unit have a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by \nPSU in order to specifically address their behavior.  Youth placed in this program are evaluated by \na multi-disciplinary team in conjunction with their weekly Growth Team.   The Superintendent (or \ndesignee) have to approve placement onto this unit. The youth are split into groups, but the unit \nremains open and are out of their rooms 8 A.M .to 8 P.M. like other units.  The Monitor will keep \nthe Court apprised of further modifications made to HRU.  \n \nReview of the unit activity logs comparing data between units, indicates that the HRU program is \nproviding the same average hours of education, programs, and out of room opportunities as the \nother general population units, with the exception of recreation time.  HRU youth are receiving \napproximately 12.10 hours per day of out of room activities, including education, programs, \nrecreation, and leisure time, compares to approximately 12.50 hours per day for youth assigned to \nother units.   \n \nIn general, youth and staff attitudes were not as positive as during the last site visit, but overall were \ngenerally good. The Monitor continues to stress the need for more structured and meaningful \nactivities as youth idleness remains a concern, particularly on weekends. Enhancing weekend \nactivities and programs will help reduce the risk of youth engaging in anti-social behaviors when \nthey have little else to do like excessive horseplay, destroying property, and running around \nunauthorized  areas.    During  previous  site  visits,  the  Monitor  recommended  creating  and \nimplementing a daily schedule to help with youth boredom and create opportunity for structured, \nmeaningful programming and activities.  The Monitor was provided an example of a daily schedule \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 6 of 45\n \nbut was told it has not been fully utilized as of the site visit.  \n \nWhen looking at the PbS daily activity summary logs from the October data collection cycle, both \nLHS and CLS are averaging about 8.0 hours per day of “leisure activity” on weekends (down from \n9.5 hours in April 2021), but still very high.  It is also notable that the average leisure time hours \nincreased slightly during weekdays, rising to about 3.50 hours per day, compared to about 2.75 hours \nper day Monday-Friday during the April data cycle. This could be a result of renewed operational \nchallenges resulting from the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The “leisure activities” are long \nperiods of time that are unstructured, mainly occurring in the dayroom areas.  These are the periods \nin which most incidents of violence occur (PbS data reflects that 95% of all incidents occur on the \nliving units).  Of the 359 incidents recorded at LHS and CLS during the October data cycle, 31%, \noccurred on a weekend. This is an improvement from the April data cycle which reflected 42% if \nincidents occurring during the weekends. The incident report data also indicates that 117 incidents, \nor 33%, occurred between the hours of 8 A.M. and 10 A.M. (weekdays and weekends included). \nThis too improved from the April data cycle. The Monitor also notes that the majority of incidents \nat CLS occur on Mondays and Fridays, with 3P.M. recording the greatest number of incidents. There \nneeds to be a focus on creating a daily schedule that provides for structured and meaningful activities \nand accountability in order to minimize the incidents of youth acting out. \n \n(Note: PbS Incident is: an event or crisis that may compromise the safety and security of staff and \nresidents and requires staff response and written documentation. Such events occur within the \nfacility (although they may be precipitated by events outside the facility) and may involve staff, \nyouth, or others. Examples include assault, escapes, evacuations, vehicular accidents, abuse, \ndisturbances, or riots. Incident also refers to situations of environmental risk, such as broken \nglass, blocked emergency exits, etc. Some incidents may be resolved without injury to staff or \nresidents. However, some incidents may result in injury, the use of restraint(s), and/or the filing of \nmisconduct charges that may result in punitive sanctions to youth or disciplinary action to staff.) \n \nReview of the PbS incident report data over the last three years reveals significant declines in the \nnumber of reportable incidents.  The 359 reported during the October 2021 data collection cycle are \nthe fewest number of incidents reported dating back to October 2019.   \n \nOctober 2021 – 359 Incidents Reported \nApril 2021 – 606 Incidents Reported \nOctober 2020 – 709 Incidents Reported \nApril 2020 – 1,040 Incidents reported \nOctober 2019 – 819 Incidents Reported \n \nWhile these are remarkable improvements that reflect an overall reduction in incidents of violence, \nthe Monitor also notes that the reductions correlate directly with the reduced population of the \nfacilities.  The reduced incidents are most likely a reflection of the lower population as well as \nimproved  facility  operations  and  other  changes  reflected  within  the  scope  of  the  settlement \nagreement. \n \nDefendants had the following holiday programming this reporting period: \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 7 of 45\n \n(1) Christmas Pageant-  The facility  chaplain assembled a Virtual Christmas Pageant on \nPowerPoint. The slides include pictures of the youth dressed up in costume telling the \nChristmas  Story.  This  PowerPoint  was  saved  and  shared  with  the  youth  upon  its \ncompletion.  \n \n(2) Christmas Caroling Contest- A Christmas Caroling Contest for youth at LHS/CLS was \nheld on December 21, 2021. HSU staff traveled to each living unit to listen to everyone’s \nfavorite Christmas song “Jingle Bells” performed by the youth as a group.  Those who \nparticipated each received a small bag of candy, provided by HSU. HSU then picked the \nGrand Prize Winner. The winning unit music got to choose a meal from three restaurants.  \n \n(3) Wreath making November 22, 23, and 24, 2021- The nine (9) girls and sixteen (16) boys \nwho participated in the wreath making project were awarded points for their behavior and \nparticipation. \n \n(4) CEA-W Creativity Contest- The CEA-W creativity contest was offered to students and \nsubmissions were being accepted through December 30, 2021. Any CLS/LHS youth are \neligible to submit a sample of creative writing and/or original artwork for consideration.  \n \nDefendants  now  have  the  welding  programs  on  weekends  which  is  a  positive  change  and \nrecommended by the Monitor.  Youth are enjoying this weekend program. There is still a need for \nmore structured and meaningful activities as youth idleness remains a concern, particularly on \nweekends.  There also was in increase in self-confinement both in the data and observations during \nthe site visit.  During previous site visits, the Monitor has repeatedly and continually recommended \ncreating and implementing a daily schedule to help with youth boredom and create opportunity for \nstructured activities.  A schedule has not been put in place to date.  A schedule is needed in order to \nimprove accountability and minimize the incidents of youth acting out. Improving the behavior \nmanagement system, improving the rewards and incentives, and developing engaging programming \nwill have a positive impact on the overall behavior and atmosphere. \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately  thirty-nine  (39)  youth  were  interviewed  during  the  site  visit  (formally  and \ninformally) by the Monitoring team and approximately eight (8) youth were interviewed prior and \nafter the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel.  There was only one request to talk to Plaintiffs’ counsel \nwhile the Monitor was onsite talking with youth, and counsel followed up on that request. \n \nIn the previous site visit, youth did not have any complaints. During this site visit, some of the LHS \nyouth complained to the monitoring team about the food, being bored, having no consistency in \nrules, the facility not being as clean, and staff not wearing masks at all or improperly.  A couple of \nthe youth on CLS had similar complaints as the LHS youth but also complained about wanting more \nfemale staff on the unit, a particular staff member that made them feel uncomfortable, and not having \nthe same opportunities as the boys.  Youth had good things to say as well such as feeling safe, having \nsome good staff that engage with them, liking the recreation unit and music program.   \n \nYouth did complain to Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to  and after the site visit (during this reporting period) \nabout staff not wearing masks and being confused about how to progress through the levels of \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 8 of 45\n \nprogramming (CLS and LHS), CLS youth not feeling safe (number of girls increased and there were \nmore fights and tension), girls running from staff while outside, use of force and restraints, using AC \ntoo often and for unwarranted reasons.  Additionally, youth on the High-Risk Unit felt that they \ncould not move through the levels quickly enough.  The Monitor observed all staff wearing masks \nappropriately during the site visit, but while reviewing random videos, the Monitor observed several \nstaff not wearing masks at all or not wearing them correctly (over their nose and mouth), as the youth \nhad indicated.  Given the high rates of COVID-19 among staff and the ease with which Omicron \nspreads, it is imperative that staff protect  youth by wearing their masks properly and at all times. \nThe Monitor also reviewed several use of force videos/mechanical restraint usage and the use of \nforce/restraints observed were appropriate. \n \nThe Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more meaningful/structured \nprogramming and activities. It is clear that when staff engage with youth, youth respond positively.   \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that the Defendants should take advantage of the reduced \npopulation by having the available staff in plan, prepare, and develop programs for youth. The \nDefendants need to focus on gender and culturally competent programming.  \n \nThere is no significant update from the last site visit as it relates to the status of the LHS/CLS \nclosure.  Legislature has not approved locations or funding for new facilities.  Defendants continue \nto analyze if the site of a current minimum- security adult DOC facility in Milwaukee is suitable \nfor a new juvenile facility.  There needs to be significant movement on complying with the \nrequirements to close LHS and move youth closer to locations where needed, culturally and gender \ncompetent programs and services are more widely available.  Further, moving the facility would \nfacilitate family visits, which are generally important and necessary for youth. In addition, the lack \nof alternative facilities adversely affects those girls who are in need of significant, sustained mental \nhealth treatment at a level not available in CLS. \n \nStaffing  \n \nKey Positions hired during this reporting period are as follows:  \n•  Juvenile Education Director \n•  Corrections Program Supervisors (2) \n•  Special Education Teachers (2) \n•  Psychology Associate \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has increased very slightly from the last reporting period \n(see below).  There are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS.  Approximately 153 of these \npositions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  The \nteacher vacancy rate is slightly higher than last reporting period (11 vacancies), or 44% of \npositions.  There is the same number of social worker vacancies, which at 57% is very high.  This \nis a critical role that should be made a recruiting priority.  The Monitor encourages continuing to \nrecruit teachers despite the reduced population and challenges with COVID-19.  Recruiting is still \na  challenge  due  to  the  location  of  the  facility,  overall  teacher  shortages,  relatively  low \ncompensation, location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS will close, and the year-\nround school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue.   \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 9 of 45\n \n \n  \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \n   May 31, 2021  September 30, 2021  December 31, 2021 \n       \n  Youth   36% (41 out of 115)  30% (41 out of 115)  38% (44 out of 115) \n \nCounselor \n \nYouth  19% (7 out of 37.5)  19% (7 out of 37.5)  13 % (5 out of 37.5) \n  Counselor \nAdv. \n  Teacher  32% (8 out of 25)  40% (10 out of 25)  44% (11 out of 25) \nSocial Worker  36% (5 out of 14)  57% (8 out of 14)  57% (8 out of 14) \n \nYouth Counselor vacancies have increased during this reporting period, but Youth Counselor \nAdvanced vacancies have decreased from 19% to 13%.   Staffing levels remain adequate and meet \nlegal requirements based on the reduced population that exists at LHS/CLS. The Defendants \nshould continue to monitor employee leaves and scheduling to ensure staff are not overly mandated \nto work overtime.  \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over twenty-seven (27) staff. Staff morale seemed good overall, \nhowever staff were less engaged with youth during this site visit. However, the timing of the visit \nmight have contributed to that because the youth were just returning from school or on their way \nto school/off unit programming. A review of video over the reporting period showed staff regularly \nengaging with youth. A few staff felt that the consequences for youth were not sufficient. A few \nstaff said that things are better than a year ago and a few said things are the same as a year ago, \nbut none said they were worse.  Several staff stated that they liked their jobs and felt safe.  Another \nstaff loved working with youth in the new recreation center.  The continued implementation of \nDBT and other best practices will improve safety for staff and youth.   \nThe PbS data for October 2021 reveals a decrease in staff fear for safety concerns as well as an \nincrease in staff perceptions regarding how dangerous the facility is based on input taken from the \nStaff Climate Surveys.  Overall, fear for safety has improved, but remains well above the national \nfield average and will continue to need to be addressed.  Both of these outcome measures reflect \nimprovements in the fear for safety concerns over the previous data collection cycles. However, \ngiven the fact that fear for safety remains high in comparison to the national field average, this \nremains a concern for staff, youth, and the Monitor. \nFear for safety indicators at LHS improved, dropping from 76.79% in April 2021 to 52.17% in \nOctober and improving from 86.84% in April to 50% in October at CLS.  Both also represent \nimprovement over the October 2020 data cycle as well.  However, both of these indicators remain \nsignificantly above the national field average of 22.77%.  This data certainly supports the staff and \nyouth feedback that was provided to the Monitor during the site visit.  The facility may want to \nconsider making fear for safety and staff wellness a target for the next Facility Improvement Plan \n(FIP).  These are very typical outcomes for facilities going through these types of reform efforts. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 10 of 45\n \n•  Note:  The Monitor notes that the facility only completed or received (23) total staff climate \nsurveys and 8 additional surveys were recorded as “do not agree to participate”.  The low \nresponse rate may well affect the data regarding staff perceptions.   The Monitor would \nencourage the facility to work towards surveying all staff and youth during the next data \ncollection cycle to see if these indicators change significantly with a higher response rate.  \nStaff must trust the anonymity of the process as well as believe that real change will occur \nas a result of their participation.  The facilities should ensure that they follow the PbS climate \nsurvey scripts and that facility leadership is open and transparent with the outcomes and \nsurvey results in order to build trust in the process. \nDefendants continue to work on increasing staff morale but still have much more work to do.  \nDefendants have done the following to increase staff morale during this reporting period: \n \n•  The Crisis Intervention Response Team (“CIRT”) Coordinator position hired during last \nreporting period has been working with DJC Administration to implement a comprehensive \nmulticomponent approach to crisis intervention, also referred to as critical incident stress \nmanagement at the schools.  The CIRT provides peer to peer support regarding secondary \ntrauma and critical incidents that occur at the schools. DJC’s CIRT team is implementing \nstrategies that can help reduce stress and compassion fatigue, as well as foster resilience \nwithin the work environment amongst peers. \n•  Monthly lottery of a gift card has continued to be offered as an incentive for regular \nattendance and extra hours worked that qualify staff to win. (Note these gift cards are not \nfunded by state funds, funded by personal contributions to support this staff recognition \neffort). Staff have the ability to be entered into this lottery twice monthly based on set \ncriteria.  \n•  Employee of the Month winners continue to be named every month. Winners are awarded \na prime parking spot and names are displayed in the upstairs entry hall.  \n•  Two new vending machines were added downstairs and two were added upstairs.  \n•  There is Winter Greenhouse sale.  \n•  Various holiday events. \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information.  A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible.  \nYouth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”) Update/ Dialectical Behavior Therapy (“DBT”) \n \nDJC is continuing in the next phase of participation with YICPM.  The Defendants continue to \nwork with Dr. Chapin on Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (“DBT”) as a behavior management \nsystem. DJC continued to develop foundational supports for staff to effectively provide programs \nand services focused on DBT treatment-informed best practices throughout the System of Care.  \nIn October, DBT Skills Groups and the weekly DBT Skill Highlights (shared with leaders and \nstaff) finished covering the first cycle of all of the DBT curriculum which includes Walking the \nMiddle Path, Mindfulness, Crisis Survival, Distress Tolerance, and Emotional Regulation skills. \nThe second cycle of DBT then began in late October with youth revisiting group expectations, \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 11 of 45\n \nidentifying values, and setting goals prior to engaging in continued mindfulness practice, with \nfacilitators supporting youth to more actively engage and sometimes lead activities. Meanwhile, \nMorning  Mindfulness  in  the  school  has  continued  to  bolster  the  youth’s  practice  with \nmultidisciplinary support.  \nIn consultation with Dr. Chapin, the pre-treatment curriculum was designed to prepare youth in \nintake to successfully enter into their Unit’s assigned groups. As of November, pre-treatment \nefforts have benefited from having a Treatment Specialist dedicated to Krueger as well as the \nsupport of the new Krueger Corrections Program Supervisor (“CPS”) who was a prior PSU \nassociate) and the new social services CPS. During pre-treatment, youth have been learning about \nthe goals and expectations of group, structure of lessons, dialectics, options for solving any \nproblem, validation, behavior chain analysis and the skills of mindfulness. In addition, as of \nDecember, the System of Care (“SoC”) Stage Progression framework was updated to allow intake \nyouth the opportunity to begin earning Program Points towards Stage Progression for their active \nengagement in pre-treatment, mindfulness, intake educational assessments and facility orientation.  \nThe core executive leadership team focused on holding SoC/DBT meetings with Dr. Chapin to \ndiscuss strategic priorities in alignment with DBT practices and organizational needs.  A Behavior \nChain Analysis (BCA) workgroup was established in partnership with PSU and Dr. Chapin to \nprovide BCA updates, develop a Help Sheet to guide youth, and outline a plan for staff and \nsupervisor training to enhance BCA practice as a key DBT intervention option. A Noncompliant \nConditions  and  Violations  workgroup  also  developed  to  draft  the  business  process  for \ndocumenting responses to noncompliant behavior within J-Tracker. The Monitoring team had the \nopportunity to meet with Dr. Chapin during the site visit and review a potential egregious behavior \nprotocol and recommended changes to that protocol.  Once DBT is fully integrated into the \nprogramming, if done appropriately, and with a race/equity lens, there should be significant \nimprovement in many facets of the daily operations of LHS/CLS. The Monitor looks forward to \nDBT being fully and properly integrated into the daily life of youth and staff. \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nDuring this reporting period, CLS/LHS hired a Program and Policy Analyst-Advanced focused on \nthe ongoing Quality Assurance (“QA”) implementation efforts surrounding the consent decree and \nother important functions in the school and facility system of care updates.  \nSince October, the QA staff has worked to create a database that allows speedy retrieval and \nanalysis of J- Tracker data. There is work left to be done building out the databases functionality \nand reporting capabilities, but in the initial phases of the ongoing project, the databases ability to \nassist incident debrief analysis has given management staff reviewing incidents more consistently \naccurate and timely reports.  \nThe database allows the user to easily defragment information from the debrief form and run user-\nspecific reports and graphs. When these reports are finalized, the more rapid turnaround ability for \ntracking progress has moved the facility closer than in the past to retrieval of timely and relevant \ndata reports that can reliably assist management in making data driven decisions for the facility.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 12 of 45\n \nIn an effort to align PbS data collection efforts with our ongoing quality assurance framework, \ndefinitions are being standardized into policy, J-Tracker, and  Guardian. Previously a youth \ncounselor entering an incident in J-Tracker would have a different array of confinement categories \nfrom a youth counselor on the unit using a handheld device.  \nThe confinement categories available to staff tracking confinement on the units with the handheld, \nare now matched exactly with the confinement categories in J-Tracker. Aligning the terminology \nand definitions for confinement between J-Tracker and Guardian is one example of how multi-\ndisciplinary committees of DJC staff continue to work to establish collaborative communication \nstrategies that can work to bridge different data collection platforms and improve data quality. \nAgain, tremendous improvements have been made in data collection and in the quality assurance \nprogram. \nPbS Facility Improvement Plan (“FIP”): \nPbS Data Quality – In previous reports, some issues were identified as to the quality of the data \nentered for some outcome measures, including outcomes measuring around daily activity durations.  \nThrough the review of the data reports, the Monitor is pleased to report that those issues continue \nto appear to have been resolved and the data appears to be much more accurate.  With the improved \ndata collection, there is a better sense of the progress being made.  Before the Monitor begins to \noutline areas for improvement, it is important to recognize the efforts and positive steps forward in \nregard to the quality of the PbS data and the overall progress in many of the outcome measures.  It \nis important to remember that PbS is a “continuous facility improvement program,” therefore \noverall progress is measured over the period of years and numerous data collection cycles.  PbS is \na snapshot taken twice a year, during the April and October data collection cycles and, therefore, \nmay not match the three (3) month data cycle covered during this reporting period.  The overall \noutcomes for each may or may not differ depending upon variables. The trendline of the outcome \nmeasures is what is most important as it reflects the direction of the facility over time.  The October \ndata clearly shows some positive progress trends moving in the right direction for many of the \noutcome measures with some having moved in a negative direction.  This is expected given the \ncomplex operational changes occurring within the culture and atmosphere of the facility.  \nA thorough and in-depth review was conducted of the October 2021 PbS data collection for both \nLHS and CLS.  During the review, outcome measure data clarification and input was sought from \nboth the facility PbS State and Site Coordinators and the assigned PbS Coach.  As a result of the \nreview, the following highlights and outcomes are noted: It is also important to note that the October \n2021 data collection took place as the facility was again managing operational challenges resulting \nfrom the pandemic, which certainly made facility operations much more challenging, particularly \naround the issue of reducing “operational” room confinement and leisure time activities.  As \nmentioned previously in this report, the issue around youth idleness, behavior accountability, and \nstaff wellness and fear for safety remains a concern and is reflected in many of the outcome \nmeasures.  \nWith all that said, there are a couple of outcome measures that warrant attention.  First and foremost \nis what is unquestionably a continued high rate of “self-requested” confinement.  This remains an \nissue from previous data cycles and continues into the October 2021 cycle with some progress of \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 13 of 45\n \nimprovement being recognized. The data reflects 530 incidents of confinement use during the \nmonth of October 2021 (389 @ LHS and 141 @ CLS).  Of these, there were a total of 427 for self-\nrequested confinement, representing 81% of all confinement for the facility during the month.    It \nshould be noted that the facility has instituted a procedure in which youth refusing to participate in \nschool or other programs are not locked in their rooms, the doors remain unlocked and youth may \nexit at any point to participate in programs.  On one hand, this is a positive as very little confinement \nis a result of behavior issues.  On the other hand, it is also a reflection of the culture, atmosphere \nand environment which results in such self-selected confinement.  Focusing on improvement on \nthese particular areas of confinement will certainly have an immediate and positive impact on \nreducing overall confinement numbers.  \nAdditionally, the previous reports discussed that the unit activity record for the Krueger Unit \nreflected that youth were spending approximately 20.64 hours per day in their rooms (10.5 hours \nreflected as sleeping time and 10.14 hours reflected as “in sleeping rooms,” room confinement).  \nThe activity log for the Krueger Unit also did not reflect any hours for education.   This issue seems \nto  have  been  resolved.   The  April  and  October  2021  data  shows  Krueger  youth  spending \napproximately 11.00 hours in their rooms for “sleeping” time and 0.50 hours in their rooms for \nother reasons.  Education hours for Krueger youth increased to approximately 4.18 hours per day \n(weekdays) and leisure activity time decreased to 3.82 hours per day. This represents a larger \nportion of their day that is spent in more meaningful activities such as education. While the \nMonitor recognizes these improvements, it is necessary for the facility to provide more meaningful \nprograms and activities to youth during the leisure time periods, particularly on weekends. \n \nFinally, the Monitor encourages the facility to continue closely reviewing all of the PbS data and \noutcome measures with staff at all levels as a means to better understand the impacts generated \nfrom the many changes occurring within the facility.  The Monitor recommended that agency and \nfacility leadership should make it a point to review the PbS data with staff at all levels, perhaps \nduring monthly all staff briefing meetings.  The Monitor is happy to see that the Superintendent’s \nTown Hall meetings have included the PbS site coordinator after each data collection cycle \nbeginning with April 2021. This has helped disseminate relevant statistics and progress points from \nthe FIP’s, answer staff’s questions about PbS, and identify opportunities for improving the data \ncollection process. Additionally, the PbS Facility Improvement Plan Committee comprising of \nmembers from a multi-disciplinary team that encompasses all the facility departments has met \nmonthly during the reporting period sharing data collection improvement strategies and significant \noutcomes from past month’s data collection cycles. \nThis is an opportunity to show the positive outcomes being achieved through the various changes \nand efforts to reduce incidents of violence, confinement, and use of restraint. Much work remains \nto be done.  The data shows fluctuating trend lines, some moving in the right direction, while others \nare not. These fluctuating trends can and should be expected as staff and youth adjust to the ever-\nchanging behavior response techniques and the skill level of staff in utilizing various training, de-\nescalation  techniques, and, as discussed  earlier,  in the full  implementation of  the behavior \nmanagement system.  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 14 of 45\n \nAs discussed in the previous Monitor’s report, many PbS indicators, particularly the ones singled \nout in our facility improvement plan action steps have trended in a positive direction as compared \nto previous collection cycles and against the national averages produced by PbS.  After the April \n2022 data cycle reports and surveys are finalized in mid-May, a new round of PbS data will provide \nDJC with a clearer picture as to whether progress on these Orders has been sustained or if there \nare any other metric indicators that will need addressing. The Monitor will continue to update the \nCourt when the next PbS data becomes available.  \nPbS Critical Outcome Measures Review \n \nUse of Restraint Outcome Measures - Both LHS and CLS show “0” incidents of use of chemical \nagents (Order 6) during the October 2021 data collection cycle, which is commendable and per the \nSettlement Agreement.  The rates of physical restraint use (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use per \n100-person days of confinement) at LHS and CLS declined during this data cycle but remains above \nthe national average, as does the rate of mechanical restraint (Order 4 – Mechanical Restraint use \nper 100-person days of confinement) usage incidents.  Both facilities experienced the lowest \nmechanical restraint usage during this period compared to prior data collection cycles and this \npoints to a changing and positive culture in how staff are responding to youth behaviors.  However, \nphysical restraint usage, especially at CLS, remains high and does tend to confirm the youths’ \ncomplaints that staff frequently go “hands on.” In addition, there is a relatively high rate of youth \ninjury by staff in CLS, which also seems to support these concerns.  During the month of October \n2021, CLS recorded 11 youth injuries during the application of physical or mechanical restraints.  \nThis is well above the national average.  \n \nAs mentioned earlier, PbS is a continuous facility improvement process which involves complex \noperational issues.  The following two charts reveal that overall, the trends lines for both physical \nand mechanical restraint use has returned to the average levels from the October 2020 spike, and \nnow appear to be trending the right direction.  It is normal to see fluctuation in this type of data and \nthe October spike is most certainly related to temporary operational changes that were in place as a \nresult of the pandemic.   Improvement in reducing youth idleness with meaningful programs and \nactivities along with an improved behavior management program, can have a significant impact \non these outcome measures.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 15 of 45\n \nUse of physical and mechanical restraint at LHS is now below the national field average but \nremains high at CLS. \n \nOrder 03 \nPhysical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \nLHS: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 16 of 45\n \nCLS: \n \n \n \n(Note: PbS defines Physical Restraints as facility authorized and trained holds used by staff to \nsubdue an otherwise uncontrollable youth in order to prevent the youth from injuring him or \nherself, or others.)   \n \nOrder 04 \nMechanical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \nLHS: \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 17 of 45\n \nCLS: \n \n \n(Note:  PbS  defines  Mechanical  Restraints  as  Mechanical  Devices  used  to  prevent  an \nuncontrollable youth from injuring him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints may only be \nused for short periods of time and must be used under medical supervision.) \nThe previous Monitoring reports discussed issues around the reduced use of the Care Teams which \nhad resulted in a higher number of restraint-usage incidents.  Given the positive reductions in the \nuse of physical and mechanical restraints during this PbS cycle, it appears the heightened focus on \nCare Teams has had a positive impact.  Care Teams are designed precisely to reduce the need for \nthe use of restraints and have been effectively shown to work at facilities across the country and \nhave been shown to be effective at LHS and CLS as well.  \nIsolation, Room Confinement and Segregation Measures – Overall, the PbS outcome measures \naround isolation and room confinement remained unchanged from the  April 2021 PbS data \ncollection cycle, reflecting that 93.22% (down from April) of room confinements are terminated in \nunder eight hours at CLS and 96.55% at LHS (increase over April), although the LHS rate was \nslightly improved from the April 2021 rate.  Slightly fewer incidents of room confinement are \nterminated in under four hours at CLS, 91.43%, while the same rate holds at LHS at 96.55%. These \nare both very commendable achievements, and both are better than the national field averages for \nthese outcome measures.  Order 13 – Isolation, room confinement use for reasons other than \nbehavior reflects decreases at both LHS and CLS for this data period over prior reporting periods, \nthis may be a result of recent changes limiting the use of “observation status” confinements.  This \nissue needs to be reviewed more thoroughly to better understand the overall impact and duration \ndata of these confinements as the data continues to reflect higher use than the national field average. \nIt should also be noted as to the improved outcomes and reduced rates of initial room confinement \nplacements during the October data cycle. Both facilities showed reduced incidents of confinement \npractices, with LHS remaining at the national field average.    \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 18 of 45\n \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, segregation/special management unit use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \nLHS: \n \n \n \n \nCLS: \n \n \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 19 of 45\n \nOrder 13 \nIsolation, room confinement use for reasons not related to behavior per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \nLHS: \n \n \n \nCLS: \n \n \n \n(Note:  PbS defines confinement as any instance when a youth is separated from the youth \npopulation and placed in a room or cell alone for 15 minutes or longer. Youths are considered to \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 20 of 45\n \nbe confined from  the moment they are separated from others until they  have rejoined the \npopulation. Youths may be transferred to a designated unit for confinement (e.g., a segregation \ndorm or program separation unit). Confinement may occur in locked or unlocked rooms but cannot \noccur in large dormitories. Any instance of confinement of 15 minutes or more is a reportable PbS \nincident event.) \nAs discussed earlier in this report, there remains an issue around Order 13 – Isolation, Room \nConfinement for reasons not related to behavior.  These appear to primarily be incidents where \nyouth are refusing to participate in programs and education. As you can see from the following \nchart, self-requested involves 92% of the non-behavior related confinement incidents at LHS and \n55% of confinement incidents at CLS.  While the use of room confinement for “self-requested” \ndeclined from the October 2020 data cycle, it still remains a very high percentage of confinement \nusage.  This continues to be a reflection from the overall behavior management system and lack of \nappropriate use of incentives and rewards.  Youth continue to refuse to go to school and elect to \nremain in their rooms and often simply watch TV all day.  Facility staff need to focus on youth \nengagement or re-engagement strategies as well as the behavior management system in order to get \nyouth to participate in programs. The use of room confinement for “mental health” related issues \ndecreased significantly at CLS during the month of October, decreasing from 38 incidents in April \n2021, to just 4 this period.  This represents just 3% of the room confinements at CLS.

Based on some of the outcomes highlighted in this report, it appears many of the FIP action \nsteps taken during this reporting period have had a positive impact. \nIt is further recommended that the agency, facility and the PbS team members spend considerable \ntime  reviewing  the  PbS  Blueprint  Domains,  particularly  those  domains  focused  on  Order; \nPrograming, and Safety. Much can be learned from review of these outcome domains and the data \nassociated with them, in particular those focused on youth and staff relationships.   \nPolicies and Procedures/Administrative Code Update \n \nA mechanical restraint procedure has been drafted encompassing all the requirements in the \nconsent decree in addition to incorporating quality assurance measures consistent with those \noutlined in the Room Confinement procedure passed in March 2021. The procedure being codified \nwill allow the policy and procedure committee to work with management and supervisory staff to \npoint to clear expectations for both process and documentation through incident reporting related \nto youth confinement and use of force.  \nThe DJC Policy Committee also held its recurring monthly meeting in October and November to \nreview the following additional policies. \n500.30.3- Optometry Services \n300.11.04 - Telephone Use  \n100.05.02 - Transporting Youth  \nOther policy projects include a systematic review of all divisional policies and facility procedures \nas the documents themselves are moved into an OnBase software system that will ensure all staff \nare accessing and reading DJC policies and procedures. The system will also help track policy \nacknowledgments, assisting with the coaching, training, and follow up components of the facilities \nquality assurance framework.  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 28 of 45\n \nWhile transferring the documents, the policies are under review for updates and sign off from the \ncurrent DJC administration. This project as a whole will result in revised and up to date policies \nand  procedures,  uniform  and  easier  access  to  policy  documents  for  staff,  and  automated \ndocumentation for staff policy acknowledgment.  \nAdministrative Code Revisions Update  \nDJC staff and committees continue working to revise both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter \n373 forward.  \nThe amended scope statement for 373 was approved by the Governor on December 10, 2021. The \nscope was then approved by the Secretary January 10, 2022, allowing the committee to move \nforward with drafting the rule. The draft has since been completed and is currently being reviewed \nby DOC attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel.  \nDefendants  need  to  continue  to  aggressively  work  towards  completing  the  respective \nAdministrative Code sections. \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Data does not indicate that youth \nare being confined for seven days or for punitive reasons. Defendants have and continue to \nre-examine the use of observation status and administrative confinement to ensure that staff \nare not using this as a form of punitive confinement.  If sustained, Defendants will be close \nto being in substantial compliance. \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that most \nyouth are being confined for three days or for punitive reasons. Defendants have and \ncontinue to re-examine the use of observation status and administrative confinement to \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 29 of 45\n \nensure that staff are not using this as a form of punitive confinement.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of observation status and \nadministrative confinement has decreased during this reporting period. Defendants have \nand continue to re-examine the use of observation status and administrative confinement to \nensure that staff are not using this as a form of punitive confinement.   The Monitor \npreviously recommended establishing clear criteria for administrative confinement so that \nstaff cannot punitively confine youth and cannot confine youth for more than 24 hours if \nthey do not pose an imminent danger of harm to themselves. The Defendants have made \nsignificant improvement in this area, but it needs to be continually reviewed to ensure \ncompliance with this Court Order.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The use of AC was higher for CLS \n(previous three-month period) but significantly lower for LHS youth this reporting period.  \nThere were no youths confined over four (4) hours in LHS for any of the months in this \nreporting period and for two months for CLS.  The Monitor reviewed documentation of \n“intensive mental health services”  provided to youth in confinement.   Defendants are \ncontinuing to assess how they can more effectively provide intensive mental health services \nfor youth.   \n \nJuly 2021 \nCLS: 13 uses of A.C. Average 130 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 80 uses of A.C. Average of 166 minutes. 6 youth over four hours.  \n         \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 30 of 45\n \nAugust 2021 \nCLS: 20 uses of A.C.

No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 49 uses of A.C. Average of 187 minutes. Six (6) youth over four hours.  \n \nOctober 2021 \nCLS: 45 uses of A.C. Average 147 minutes. Three (3) youth over four hours. \nLHS: 37 uses of A.C. Average of 136 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n         \nNovember 2021 \nCLS: 32 uses of A.C. Average 157 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 47 uses of A.C. Average of 135 minutes. No youth over four hours.   \n \n \nDecember 2021 \nCLS: 16 uses of A.C. Average 125 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 20 uses of A.C. Average of 163 minutes. No youth over four hours.   \n  \nThe Monitor was able to able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was \nreadily available during this site visit.  99.43% of checks were completed within 30 \nminutes. The Monitor reviewed video footage for random days and times and there \nwere no instances in which staff did not complete the checks in compliance with \npolicy.  Staff should be commended for their diligence in ensuring youth safety while \nin their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were four (4) youth confined \nfor over four (4) hours during this reporting period (CLS- October 2021) (see response in \nprevious question). All extended confinements were recommended by PSU.   \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring any form of room \nconfinement is compliant with this Court Order, draft policy and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.   \n \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 31 of 45\n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were no transfers as a result \nof extended placements in administrative confinement.  \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 is utilized.  The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. Discussion \nand clarification have occurred surrounding observation status during this reporting period.  \nCurrently, only youth who are in imminent risk of serious self-harm to themselves/risk of \nself-harm will be placed in observation status.  The Monitor will continue to review and \nmonitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 32 of 45\n \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed on renovated units.   \nYouth rooms were messier than the previous site visit.  Many rooms had several blankets, \nsheets, and other items that could pose a safety risk due to the volume of items in the \nrooms and inability to see the beds, floors, and desks.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants are very close to substantial \ncompliance.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. Defendants have \nimproved their documentation and data collection.  \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented.  Clinicians are on-site for a minimum of 6 hours each Saturday and \nSunday and the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth. The Defendants \nhave  hired  new  PSU  staff  and  are  working  on  expanding  on-site  treatment  time  on \nweekends.   The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the hours in which they \nare physically present on weekends and evening hours in order to engage youth in a \nmeaningful way during this time.   \n \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 33 of 45\n \nA quality assurance program needs to be further developed. The Monitor suggests that the \nDefendants move quicker on retaining a mental health consultant to further develop the \nmental health program/integration at LHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental  \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation/data shows that \nevaluations are completed and within 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. \nThere were no instances of contraindication documented during this review period. QA \nneeds to be implemented and sustained.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants are over 99% compliant \nwith meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe.  Quality assurance \nmeasures are in place and when necessary, formal investigations occur.  There were three \n(3) Letters of Expectations and two (2) formal job instructions given to staff who did not \ncomplete safety/security checks per policy during this reporting period.  The Monitor \nobserved safety/wellness checks being completed on various days/times during this reporting \nperiod and observed no instances in which staff did not make visual contact with youth. PSU \nstaff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The Monitor \ncontinues to encourage more on-site time on evenings and weekends.  \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 34 of 45\n \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons.  Forms and processes for documenting any \npotential property restrictions have been created and utilized. Defendants are close to \nreaching substantial compliance. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general. The primary clinician consults \nwith the on-call clinician and with the SYC/YC/CPS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the \nyouth plan addresses the issues at hand and how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. \nA PSU clinician follows up in the absence of the primary clinician and/or the crisis clinician. \nPSU collaborates with the SYC and direct staff. The social worker and youths’ meeting \nschedules are individualized. The social worker works with the youth to identify availability \nif an AC placement occurs during regularly scheduled meeting. The vacancy rate for social \nworkers continues to be high and should be a priority in hiring.  Social workers are critical \nto quality of care and services for the youth and effective re-entry planning.   \nDocumentation, quality assurance, and policy and procedure need to be improved/completed \nas it relates to social work, mental health, and other health services. Defendants need to \nensure there is accountability with respect to the services provided by the social workers, \nmental and healthcare workers.   \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. During the pandemic, Defendants \nmoved to smaller-group based treatment to youth where group participation was provided \non the units. This continues. Treatment programming for youth never ceased due to COVID-\n19 precautions, but the size of the groups was modified to accommodate safe social distancing \nmeasures and keep youth who shared a living unit assignment in groups with one another. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 35 of 45\n \nBeginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group treatment \nsessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule.  The Monitor \ncontinues to encourage these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as possible. \n  \nOnly youth who are actively in AC status due to posing a serious risk of imminent physical \nharm to others would potentially miss a treatment group.  \n  \nDefendants need  to  continue  to  focus  (document  and  QA)  on providing  rehabilitative \nprogramming that was scheduled/in process before placement in room confinement. Youth \ncomplained to Plaintiffs’ counsel that school closures were affecting their ability to progress \nthrough the stages. Defendants need to ensure that any missed/rescheduled treatment groups \ndo not negatively impact a youth’s progress. \n \n  \niii.         Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Classes now occur in the school \nbuilding except for HRU youth on Steps 1 and 2, new intakes due to quarantine, youth in \nmedical isolation, youth who are in 5- or 10-minute observation status, or AC. As stated \npreviously in this report, the PbS education data shows youth are receiving about 4.43 hours \nper day (weekdays) of education at LHS and 4.20 hours per day (weekdays) of education at \nCLS.  Both reflect reductions in education hours.   \n \nEvaluation work with the education consultants started November 20, 2021. Staff are \nworking on gathering the extensive documentation needed to be reviewed by the consultants.  \nDefendants need  to  ensure  that  special  education  is  provided  while  on  administrative \nconfinement and observation status and overall educational hours should increase.  The \nMonitor continues to suggest that Defendants should provide more art, music, woodworking, \nthe greenhouse, welding, and sewing and other types of programs to youth in the evening \nand on weekends. Also, it would be ideal for social workers to work with you outside of the \nschool day in order to have less scheduling issues and would help with any idle time after \nschool.  The Defendants should continue to focus on bringing more programming into \nLHS/CLS, especially culturally and gender relevant programs. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 36 of 45\n \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. In general, youth are out of their \nrooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.  except for youth in isolation due to Covid-19 safety measures \nimplemented  by  Defendants,  any  confinement  required,  or  any  self-confinement.    The \nMonitor regularly saw youth conversing with other youth during out time. The sensory rooms \nare much better than last time and have a more inviting, calming décor.    There were no \ninstances of youth being confined in their rooms based on behavior during this site visit. \nHowever, there were more instances of self-confinement.  Defendants need to attempt to get \nat the root cause of why youth are choosing to stay in their room.   \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were three (3) documented \ninstances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on substantial \nthreat of physical harm.  Defendants are able to track when youth eat meals in room and \nbased on reports, the three instances were justified as the youth posed an immediate and \nsubstantial threat. Defendants are close to being in substantial compliance.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  on \nadministrative confinement are receiving much more than the 3 hours of “out time” per day \nor 30 hours per week. (As stated earlier in the report, PbS definition of “room confinement” \ndoes include confinement for purposes of observation, even when ordered by PSU.)  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement. The \nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 37 of 45\n \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. Policy has been completed. Defendants are close \nto being in substantial compliance. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \nconsistently, including when less restrictive means were attempted. Documentation, data \ncollection and reliability, and quality assurance (with video review) needs to continue to be \nimproved. Also, documentation needs to be created that prove a youth was promptly \nprovided with the report upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.   \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.   \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 38 of 45\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  \nThe Monitor did not personally see any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit and \ndata and documentation show that there was a decrease in the use of mechanical restraints \n/other restraints during this reporting period. Also, it is important to note that the only \nmechanical restraints used during this period were handcuffs.  Defendants need to continue \nfocusing on reducing the use of mechanical (as well as physical) restraints.   \nAs discussed in previous sections of this report, the use of both physical and mechanical \nrestraints trended downward during the two 2021 data collection cycles.  Reducing youth \nidleness  with  meaningful  programs  and  activities  along  with  an  improved  behavior \nmanagement  program,  can  continue  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  these  outcome \nmeasures. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Below is the number of mechanical \nrestraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \n   \nJuly 2021:    33 uses \nAugust 2021:    11 uses \nSeptember 2021:  12 uses \nOctober 2021:      6 uses \nNovember 2021:    9 uses \nDecember 2021:     2 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \n   \nJuly 2021:     3 uses \nAugust 2021:     6 uses \nSeptember 2021:   7 uses \nOctober 2021:               13 uses \nNovember 2021:             12 uses \nDecember 2021:     0 uses \nDocumentation needs to be improved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm \nexisted, and when and how that decision is reviewed. Defendants should note why the acts in \nquestion required a specific type of use of force, such as explaining why measure utilizing \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 39 of 45\n \nless force would have been insufficient in a specific situation. The review process should \nconsider the nuances in different situations.  Defendants have excellent critical outcome \nmeasures for restraints.  Defendants need to continue to work towards reducing the use of \nmechanical restraints and quality assurance measures. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were  no uses of ankle \nrestraints or the wrap during this reporting period.  Defendants need to develop policy and \nprocedure, training, and QA measures and ensure PSU staff order these types of restraints.  \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage. Defendants have \ncreated quality assurance measures. Defendants need to continue to focus on reducing the \nuse of restraints.  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.    Defendants  need  to  continue \nfocusing on reducing the use of mechanical restraints.  Defendants need to continue to \nmonitor and assess the use of restraints and duration.   \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 40 of 45\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of \nyouth being restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staff have received training in \nphysical  force,  restraints,  and  trained  in  proper  de-escalation.  The  Defendants  are \nincreasing  the  frequency  of  these  trainings  (regular,  informal,  refreshers).  DBT \nimplementation will be very beneficial to youth and staff. Defendants have made DBT a \npriority and are continuing to train staff. \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be left  alone  in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were two (2) instances of \nyouth being placed in mechanical restraints over 45 minutes. For instances in which \nDefendants placed mechanical restraints on youth, the appropriate personnel authorized \nthe use of the mechanical restraints.  PSU approved and followed up within two (2) hours.  \nDefendants are working on a QA process for this section.  Defendants also need to ensure \ntherapeutic interventions occur.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented  as  part  of  the  Incident  Debrief  process.  Defendants  need  to  continue \ndeveloping the behavior management program, actively engage with youth, and develop \nengaging and meaningful programming in order to reduce the use of mechanical restraints. \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 41 of 45\n \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nin this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been finalized. \nA Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all supervisors to \noutline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under which a strip search \nmay be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search.  \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.   \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.   \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nduring this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.   \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 42 of 45\n \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nconducted this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records reviewed \nindicate that all staff have been trained in trauma informed care. There no strip searches \nthis period.  \n \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nduring  this  reporting  period.  Documentation  has  improved.  Policy  and  procedure/QA \ndeveloped. PSU is consulted, and it is documented. \n \n4.       Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants  are focusing on de-\nescalation skills.  Staff have been trained in MANDT and other training which includes de-\nescalation skills training. De-escalation training/modeling continues to occur. \n \nThe Monitor observed several instances of de-escalation in review of video footage.  Staff are \nmore comfortable utilizing these skills, but continued focus, training, and review need to \noccur.  Defendants should include cultural diversity issues as part of crisis management \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 43 of 45\n \ntraining and procedures. Knowing these issues and how they are communicated is critical to \nsuccessful behavior management.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Programming needs improvement \n(as discussed throughout this report) and idleness remains high but improved.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth.  Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \nto  further  reduce  youth  idleness  hours.  Increasing  education  hours  and  vocational \nprogramming, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED, can greatly assist \nin reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development strategies.  \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018 \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants should continue to focus on hiring, training and developing staff and evaluating \ntheir hiring process. As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that \nimpacts the overall culture, atmosphere and environment of the facility.  Staff wellness has \na direct impact on the relationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of \nviolence, use of restraint, and the use of isolation and confinement.   \n \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.   Defendants need to create an \nexpedited timeline for finalizing all regulations and submitting them for approval. \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 44 of 45\n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in the \nvast majority of cases. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority of cases.  \nWhen it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a corrective action \nplan  developed  but  follow  up  needs  to  occur to  ensure  the plans  are  completed  (QA \ncomponent).  More thorough reviews occurred this reporting period.  \n            \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout previous  \nreports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and \nto improve the quality of life for youth and staff.  Defendants have created a competent \nquality assurance program and have made substantial progress in developing daily data to \nreview that will automatically be available in order to make real time operational decisions. \nThe Monitoring team will continue to work with the superintendent to establish performance \ngoals, analyzing data, and creation of corrective action plans. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThere was progress made in several initiatives such as a strong, committed leadership team, overall \nincreased educational hours being provided to youth compared to prior reporting periods, the \nquality  assurance  program,  training/implementing  DBT,  incorporating  PSU  more  into  daily \noperations, the creation of the new recreation center, and continued in-person education on and off \nthe units. \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 131   Filed: 02/02/22   Page 45 of 45\n \n \nThe facility would continue to benefit from an increased focus on reducing idleness, particularly \nduring weekends and evening hours.  There are several very good programs with positive outcomes \nfor youth (music, art, gardening, welding, etc.) that should be expanded.  The Defendants should \ncontinue to move youth off of their home units as much as possible and outside when weather permits.  \nThe Defendants should continue to work on improving the behavior management system, continue \nwith their progress in implementing DBT, providing improved youth incentives that will help in \nreducing many behavioral incidents, and bringing gender and culturally relevant programming to \nLHS/CLS.  Defendants should continue to expand the influence and impact of CARE Teams would \nalso improve critical outcome measures around the use of restraint practices, staff wellness, youth \naccountability and in reducing use of any form of room confinement. This is particularly true for \nCLS, which continues to show a high rate in the use of physical and mechanical restraints, while \ntrending in the right direction.  Continued efforts need to be made to further engage the educational \nand  mental  health  experts,  reduce  teacher  vacancies,  increase  educational  time  and  quality. \nContinued  training  in  de-escalation  and  assessment,  evaluation,  and  review  of  use  of  force \ncontinuum need  to occur.   Applicable administrative code needs to be finalized and approved. Staff \nwellness needs to continue to be a priority. Lastly, as the Monitor continues to state in reports to the \nCourt, there needs to be a focus on moving youth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s).   \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n \n45 \n ",

The Monitor’s \nFourteenth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates since the thirteenth site visit which took place on May 5, 2022. \nSITE VISIT \nThe fourteenth site visit by the Monitor took place on July 28 and 29, 2022. The Monitor and \nPlaintiffs’ counsel were onsite for two days and completed necessary interviews and information \ngathering via in-person and virtual meetings prior to, during and after the site visit. The Monitor \nreviewed materials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit for the reporting \nperiod ending July 31, 2022 (April, May, June, and July). Materials included but were not limited \nto: use of force videos, video footage of units, video of safety and security checks, programming \nmaterials, discipline documents, investigations, PREA investigations, various staff memos, daily \nshift reports, policies, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order, work \nrules, meeting notes, employee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint \ndocumentation, incident reports, and other housing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted \napproximately twenty (20) youth interviews before and during the site visit.  The Monitor toured \nLHS/CLS and interviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to many of \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 2 of 47\n \nyouth and staff present and available during the site visit. Approximately fifty-three youth (53) \nyouth and thirty-four (34) staff were interviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.  \nOVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, CONDITIONS, AND ATMOSPHERE \nIntroduction \n \nThe total LHS/CLS population has steadily increased during this reporting period up to the high \n70s on average.  At the time of the site visit, the population was at 80 youth (one off site) and in \nmid-August (outside this reporting period) the population was 85 youth. It is important to note that \nthe population level is continuing to trend upward and has significantly increased over recent \nmonths. This appears to be a trend that will continue into the foreseeable future.  While the \npopulation increase is a concern, the issue is compounded by the serious staffing situation (that \nstill exists) of vacancies, turnover, various employee leaves, and overtime required to maintain \nsufficient staffing levels. Typically, the Monitor reports that there are more than adequate staffing \nlevels on each of the living units. This is the second time the Monitor reports that there are \ninadequate staffing levels on the living units, which presents very significant problems for youth \nand staff. The current staffing situation is having a profound negative impact on daily operations, \nleading to adjustments to the daily schedules to maintain effective staffing ratios for  youth \nsupervision and resulting in operational room confinement of youth (youth confined to their rooms \ndue to inadequate staffing levels not behavior based), change in educational settings, overall \nprogramming, reduced recreation, and increased idle time.  Despite these challenges, leadership, \nand staff at LHS/CLS  continued to remain positive  during the site visit  and committed to \nimproving conditions of confinement for youth and staff. The Monitor is concerned about the \neffect the high levels of room confinement are having on youth mental health, education and \ngeneral wellbeing. Youth complained about not getting enough recreation or exercise (particularly \ngoing outside) and not receiving phone calls/Zoom visits, being on modified programming, \nproperty restrictions while on administrative confinement, quality and quantity of education, and \nyouth being confined in their rooms with nothing to do.  A more detailed interview summary is \nbelow. \n \nCOVID protocols have not changed during the reporting period.  The Department of Juvenile \nCorrections (DJC) continues to apply COVID protocols consistent with CDC and DHS guidelines \nand recommendations for congregate settings. Monitoring the facility and surrounding community \ntransmission levels continue.  As of April 1, 2022, Wisconsin Department of Corrections’ (DOC) \ninstitutions and facilities like DJC’s no longer require masks for youth or staff in twenty-four-hour \nfacilities in congruence with many other local, state, and national jurisdictions.  There was a \nsignificant reduction in COVID positive cases this reporting period to four (4) youth and fifteen \n(15) staff.  \n \nOutside of this reporting period, Defendants report that operational confinement has been reduced, \neducational setting has resumed in the school area, and a new behavioral motivation system is \nbeing implemented that should have a positive impact on youth and staff.  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 3 of 47\n \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, school, and many other areas were clean and orderly. Living \nunits and youth rooms in general were cleaner than on the previous site visit.  \nDefendants continue with the following physical plant improvements: \n•  Continued the installation of new windows and window frames in each of the living units \nby completing Curtis and beginning work in Black Elk. The new windows and frames \ninclude specialized glass that can withstand significant duress without failing. This is \nexpected to significantly improve safety and reduce the cost of replacements in addition to \nassisting the lighting project achieve the goal of an improved dayroom environment.  \n \n•  Completed the lighting upgrade project throughout the facility by completing all units on \ngrounds. This project has had a significant positive impact on the lighting and feel of the \nyouth rooms and dayrooms, all while actually improving energy efficiency. \n•  Continued implementing additional fixed cameras throughout the facility including both \ninternal and external cameras by completing Addams, Hughes, Rogers, Miller, Wells, \nSchool and the Administration Building during the reporting period. Additional cameras \nwere procured during the reporting period. DOC and external contractors are continuing to \ninstall additional cameras in critical areas such as the front vestibule and other spots where \nincidents can tend to occur. Overall the additional number and quality of cameras are \nenhancing views and expanding into areas that were previously blind spots.  \n•  Continued to enhance the Music Arts Initiative by adding additional computer, software, \nand hardware components. There are also additional Apple work spaces for digital art and \ncontent creation. Two youth have submitted original works to the 2022 PbS Kid Got Talent \nAwards Contest. Thanks in part to this initiative, but mostly due to the youth’s talent and \nhard work, two DJC youth were nominated as finalists for a solo vocal original titled “Need \nNone” and the duo original song “In the Night”. \n•  Continued work on an electrical upgrade for the greenhouse which allows the greenhouse \nto accommodate more youth programming and yield additional and varied projects, plants, \nand produce. Completed the electrical upgrade to the welding room that will facilitate more \nwelding stations, better equipment, and better lighting for the welding program.  \n•  Completed construction of an outdoor visitation area that will allow for youth and families \nto have visits outside. The area can also be used by youth and staff to engage with during \nrecreation or leisure time. In addition, DJC began planning space for and purchasing video \nphones for youth that will provide youth and their families to seamlessly conduct video \nvisitation anytime the youth are on these phones. Importantly, youth calls will remain free, \njust with the added option of video conferencing.  \n \n•  Upgraded eyewash stations, sinks, and faucets installed in both HSU stations, the larger \nHSU office in the Administration building, and the HSU station on the CLS side.  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 4 of 47\n \n•  Ordered bottle filling units to replace the current bubblers on the youth units. These are \nscheduled to be installed before the end of Summer 2022. \nThe Defendants should be commended for their continuing commitment to improve the physical \nplant which improves the daily lives for staff and youth. The Monitor will continue to update the \nCourt on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and \nstaff.  \nEducation Observations \nThe physical appearance of the school areas and classrooms were beautiful as usual. Youth were \nnot observed in the classrooms this visit as education was being completed on the units due to \nstaffing issues.  When short staffing leads to periods of operational confinement school is then \nprovided on the unit through a combination of direct instruction, workbooks, learning packets, and \nEdgenuity. Youth complained that they do not like this format and are not learning as well as they \nwere when education took place in the school area and all in-person with teachers present in every \nclass. Youth complained that while there might be a teacher on unit, it often is not the teacher who \nteaches the subject the youth is working on and thus the teacher often cannot assist them.   \nAs  mentioned  in  previous  reports,  Defendants  engaged  three  consultants  to  evaluate  the \neducational programming at  LHS/CLS. The consultants are national experts and have been \nselected to evaluate key educational areas including:  \n•  Operations  \n•  Curriculum and Instruction  \n•  Academic Assessments  \n•  Special Education  \n•  Human Capital  \n•  Technology Integration  \n•  Transition  \nThe education consultant’s report is in the process of being finalized and will be provided to the \nMonitor as soon as that final version is available.  Defendants have successfully hired five \nadditional teachers during the reporting period however, the principal resigned. Staffing the school \nremains critical to increasing the quantity and quality of education for youth.  Hopefully, the \nincreased staff and recommendations by the consultants improves the quality and quantity of \neducation—especially special education (“SPED”).  \n \nThe school also made a number of other improvements during the reporting period while \nawaiting the final report. Examples include:  \n \n•  Posting a competitive job posting in search of regular substitute teachers in order to \neliminate or reduce the need for teachers to substitute teach in classes that are not their core \nsubject.  This will assist youth and staff to maintain more consistent schedules.  \n•  Placing greater emphasis on STAR reading and math testing and using more in-depth \nanalysis of the results to support students. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 5 of 47\n \n•  Adding a reading teacher and placing to identify and provide additional support to students \nwho are behind in reading.  \n•  Requiring teachers to submit two engagement lesson plans outside of assigning Edgenuity \nper class and using guided notes for youth assignments in Edgenuity. If the student achieves \nless than the lessons benchmark, guided notes allow a teacher to assist the youth in \nreviewing the information in the lesson and retest.  \n•  Ensuring students who have graduated are provided vocational opportunities.  \n \nThe education department at CLS/LHS continues to record special education (“SPED”) resources \nprovided in the youth attendance record in Infinite Campus. Make-up SPED sessions and a \nstudent’s progress toward their IEP’s are captured on the attendance roster in Infinite Campus as \nwell. Additionally, the school psychologist maintains a resource delivery tracking document, \ntracking any additional SPED resources provided. During this reporting period, a set of protocols \nhave been developed between school and administration managers to identify the parameters for \nproviding education resources during or after any form of confinement when it is known to have \ninterrupted their scheduled SPED resource time or general education time. The Monitor reviewed \nvideo on random days and times and saw SPED teachers engaged with youth on the units on \nseveral  occasions.  Recommendations  from  the  consultant’s  report  will  also  help  guide  the \neducation department with regard to the provision of SPED resources to youth once the report and \nits recommendations are final.   The Monitor is happy to report that in mid-August, youth were \nable to have more classes in the school area.  The Monitor hopes that this continues. The Monitor \ncontinues to recommend that the frequency of music, art, and recreation needs to increase and “out \nof the box” ideas need to be implemented whenever youth are in operational confinement.  \nPbS data shows that educational hours increased significantly during the April 2022 data collection \nperiod at both LHS and CLS. LHS increased their education hours from 3.75 hours in October \n2021 to 5.08 hours in April 2022.  CLS increased education hours from 3.84 hours to 5.14 over \nthe same data collection periods. These increases represent a more normalized education program \ncompared to previous reporting periods.  However, it is important to note that operational \nconfinement due to the staffing shortages did not occur until after the April collection site. \nTherefore, education hours for May, June, and July most likely would not have been at this level.  \nHowever, with education resuming in the school area in August and new educators, the Monitor \nhopes that educational hours will continue to increase.   \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel visited each cottage that youth were housed in during \nthe site visit. Overall, the units and youth rooms were cleaner than during the last visit. Youth were \nextremely respectful and had more of a positive during the site visit than the site visit in April. \nMany  of  the  youth  concerns  dealt  with  increases  in  confinement  and  with  conditions  in \nconfinement. \nThe unit populations ranged from five (5) (CLS unit) to fifteen (15) (LHS) youth, which creates \nsignificantly higher staffing ratios. Defendants are trying to have supervisory staff, mental health \nand other staff regularly come to the units to increase staff presence. This is becoming increasingly \ndifficult as the population continues to increase, and staffing numbers continue to decrease. Staff \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 6 of 47\n \nwere engaged with youth during this site visit. Staff attitudes were more positive than the Monitor \nexpected considering the day-to-day challenges they face currently.  The Monitor reviewed video \nduring the reporting period to view day room activities and in every instance (45 video reviews) \nstaff were engaged with youth when they were out of their rooms doing a variety of things such as \neating, arts and crafts, groups, helping with school work, recreation, Grandparent program visits, \nand conversing.   On review of video, staff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables \nwith youth, which mirrored what was observed during this site visit. The body language and tone \nwere positive from staff and youth. All the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful \nand willingly communicated with the monitoring team but had some complaints- although not nearly \nas many as last site visit.  The youth did make several complaints to Plaintiffs’ counsel which are \ndescribed below. The Monitoring team had an opportunity to talk to most of the youth present in \nthe day rooms.   \n \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed in the Wells and King Units. There were thirteen (13) \nyouth total in CLS. CLS units and youth rooms were cleaner than at the last site visit.  The five (5) \nyouth on King were all in their rooms. One youth was on quarantine because she had recently \nentered the unit, and so the hours she was allowed out of her room was different than that of the \nother girls on King. Because she did not want to leave her room during her out time hour, which \noccurred while the Monitor was on the unit, all youth were confined to their rooms.  Additionally, \nthere were two teachers on units doing nothing because there were no youth to teach.  Adjustments \nshould have been made so that there was not wasted opportunity to have teacher led instruction and \nreduce confinement time.  There were three (3) youth out of their rooms on Wells. PSU staff were \ndoing rounds and a teacher was on the unit giving instruction. The youth expressed to the Monitor \nhow much they liked their teacher. However, the youth on Wells complained about use of force, \nbathroom monitoring, and discipline to Plaintiff’s counsel.  \nWith respect to the LHS units, Addams, Black Elk, and Curtis were empty units during this site \nvisit. The LHS youth were housed on Krueger, Rogers, Hughes, Miller, and Roosevelt. As \npreviously mentioned, the Douglass unit is the new recreation unit. None of the units had adequate \ndirect-care staffing (although Defendants attempted to supplement with other classifications of \nstaff and there were staff who were doing “on the job training”). Youth were doing education on \nthe units or in their rooms, confined to rooms, on telephones, watching television, engaging with \nPSU staff, cleaning, outside for recreation, or sitting in day room conversing with other youth \n(excluding youth who were in their rooms and/or in the high-risk unit programming).   \n \nThe Krueger and Wells living units operated as the Skills Development Programs (SDP) at LHS \nand CLS respectively during this reporting period. The Krueger and Wells units are considered the \n“High Risk” Units. The SDP is modified programming for youth who have engaged in physically \naggressive behavior, have presented a danger to others, and/or exhibited behavior that caused a \nmajor disruption to the facility.  \n \nThe SDP ran on a three-group schedule seven days per week beginning in April 2022, however \nthis was transitioned to two-groups in July when further review of the program deemed that certain \nyouth may not have received at least three (3) hours per day/30 hours per week of out-time when \na combination of administrative and operational confinement occurred for the same youth on the \nsame day.  The Krueger and Wells SDP units offer school on the unit through a combination of \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 7 of 47\n \ndirect instruction, workbooks, learning packets, and Edgenuity.  \n \nDBT is provided to youth in the SDP incorporating individualized planning along with the in-\nperson group work already assigned to youth in the SDP so that they are engaging in DBT skills \nand receiving feedback on a daily basis. Youth assigned to the SDP have a “Supplemental Youth \nPlan” created by PSU in order to specifically address their behavior. Youth placed in this program \nare evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in conjunction with their weekly Growth Team. \n \nDuring this reporting period, based on suggestions from the previous Monitor’s report and \nfeedback from youth in the SDP, the process has been updated to ensure that data regarding a \nyouth’s progression through the SDP is saved electronically and made available to the youth’s \nteam of providers. This is done as a means of providing additional context to those working with \nthe youth to aide in developing intervention strategies that help the youth identify skill practice \nopportunities and ultimately return successfully to regular programming and progression through \nthe wider System of Care. \n \nWhen looking at the PbS daily activity summary logs from the April 2022 data collection cycle, both \nLHS and CLS were averaging about 6.00 hours per day of “leisure activity” on weekends, compared \nto about 3.00 hours per day Monday-Friday.  The “leisure activities” are long periods of time that \nare unstructured, mainly occurring in the dayroom areas.  These are the periods in which most \nincidents of violence occur (PbS data reflects that 90% of all incidents occur on the living units).  Of \nthese, 51 incidents or 37%, occurred on a weekend.  It should be noted that there were many fewer \noverall incidents reported during the April 2022 data collection cycle than during previous \nreporting periods. This is most likely a result of increased education and other activities. For the \ncurrent reporting period there were 137 (122 LHS and 15 CLS) incidents.  However, it should be \nnoted that the April data reporting period cannot necessarily be considered a true reflection for this \nentire reporting period because operations were much different in April than they were in May-\nJuly. Consequently, after April youth were confined to their rooms more frequently and for \nsignificantly longer periods of time, therefore more recent data will need to be analyzed to \ndetermine the overall impact on incidents of violence.  The Defendants have not been able to follow \nthe daily schedule due to staffing shortages.  There needs to be a focus on creating and following a \ndaily schedule that provides for structured and meaningful activities and accountability in order to \nminimize the incidents of youth acting out and ensuring staff are adhering to the schedule absent an \nemergency. \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately  fifty-three  (53)  youth  were  interviewed  during  the  site  visit  (formally  and \ninformally) by the Monitoring team and approximately twenty (20) youth were interviewed prior \nand during the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel. There were many requests to talk to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel. Plaintiffs’ counsel followed up on these requests during the site visit and after. \n \nIn general, youth attitudes were more positive this site visit based on the Monitor’s interaction with \nyouth. Based on conversations with youth, they seem nervous about the new behavior motivation \nsystem, are bored, do not like being confined so much, want to do more recreation and go to the \nschool for education. It is important Defendants continually communicate the new behavior \nmotivation program and explain all of the steps so that youth have a clearer understanding of how \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 8 of 47\n \nit works and what the expectations are of youth and staff.  The Monitor believes this new system of \ncare will have a positive impact on the culture of the facility and focus on youth’s positive behavior.  \nThis also allows youth to start on the same level.  Staff attitudes continue to remain positive. The \nMonitor continues to stress the need for more structured and meaningful activities as youth idleness \nremains a significant concern, particularly on weekends and while staff availability is limited. While \nDefendants operationally confine, there needs to be additional resources available to youth and \nmore in-room activities to engage youth. As mentioned, with summer coming to an end, there are \nmore staff available as of August which will hopefully result in youth spending more time out of \ntheir room, off units, and in the school area.  \n \nYouth did complain to Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to and during the site visit (during this reporting \nperiod of April-July). Specifically, youth complained about operational confinement (being in their \nrooms most of the day with nothing to do), all of the room confinement causing them stress, and \noperational room confinement causing them to have less access to phone calls and visits. Youth also \ncomplained about never getting off of their units and having to have education in their rooms or on \nthe unit. Youth stated that they do not get to go to the gym for recreation, music studio, or the activity \nunit for recreation, and some youth in both CLS and LHS complained about having little or no \noutdoor exercise. Youth on SDP complained about not being able to have the same property as other \nyouth.    Youth  complained  about  being  in  operational  confinement  and  then  administrative \nconfinement which resulted in some youth being confined for long periods of time. When this issue \nwas presented to Defendants, they began to review and track instances where administrative \nconfinement may have overlapped with operational confinement to determine the amount of \nconfinement time for the youth in order to accurately reflect confinement time. Youth complained \nabout being on PAUSE (which means they cannot progress through the behavior motivation system). \nThe girls complained about certain staff which Defendants will be looking into. Youth complained \nabout being on AC a lot (which is reflected in the data) and complained about an increase in uses of \nforce—particularly with the CLS youth. Youth also complained about the grievance process – \nspecifically, that this process is unclear and that there  is no clear resolution to any formal \ngrievances/complaints that they file with staff. Youth had more varied and detailed complaints to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel than to the Monitoring team while onsite.  \n  \nDuring rounds of the units, the Monitor observed that most youth were in good spirits and engaged \nin some type of program or activity.  Even those confined to their rooms were in most cases working \non education through the Edgenuity tablets.  However, numerous youths complained that they are \nnot learning anything through Edgenuity and stated they would much rather have in-person learning \nin the school.  Youth had mixed feelings about the modified or split halls program.  Many indicated \nthat they do not like the additional time in their rooms but did state that they feel safer as a result.  \nYouth asked for additional incentives and rewards to have in their rooms to help occupy their time, \nsuch as the small wall mounted basketball hoops, yoga mats, books, stress balls, etc.  \n \nMany youths also stated to the Monitor that the food was good and that they prefer being at LHS/CLS \nover some of the county detention facilities (many of which are currently also overcrowded and/or \nlargely on lockdown).  They stated even with the modified program, they are getting more out of \nroom time than they did at some of the detention facilities.  \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 9 of 47\n \nThe Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more meaningful/structured \nprogramming and activities. It is clear that when staff engage with youth, youth respond positively. \nThe Monitor has witnessed numerous occasions where staff are actively engaged with youth and \nthese opportunities build positive and respectful relationships that help reduce incidents of violence \nand promote a more therapeutic and trusting environment. This is also evident in that when there are \nstaffing shortages and less opportunity for staff engagement with youth and more confinement, there \nis an increase in complaints and increased behavior incidents. The Defendants need to continue to \nfocus on gender-specific and culturally competent programming. However, first Defendants need \nto continue developing a plan to safety manage LHS/CLS during this challenging time.  \n \nAs previously reported, on April 8, 2022, the Governor signed legislation that called for roughly \n$42 million to build a new Type 1 juvenile correctional facility in Milwaukee County. This is a \nstep towards the closure of Copper Lake and Lincoln Hills schools.  Several more steps in the \nprocess remain, including some that will require significant preparation and/or approvals from \nother state and local agencies. While the signing of the legislation represents a step forward, the \ncompletion of a new Type 1 facility and the subsequent closure of CLS/LHS will still take \nconsiderable time.  In the Monitor’s experience, this is a long process and potentially could take \nseveral years.  As previously  mentioned,  moving  youth closer to locations where  necessary \ncultural- and gender-competent programs and services are more widely available, and where \nfamily visits can be more easily accessible, will have a positive impact on youth and will allow for \na larger pool of applicants to fill critical roles.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nFor the second time, the Monitor observed firsthand the lack of available staff at LHS/CLS. \nLHS/CLS was in a staffing crisis during this reporting period. Staff vacancies and leaves continue \nto be high during this reporting period at LHS/CLS and across DOC. DJC knows that its staff are \nthe best assets towards making the programs and initiatives underway in the schools and living \nunits a success, and importantly, that staffing shortages increase the burden on those who work to \nmaintain a safe and healthy environment for youth and staff. Defendants are working diligently to \ntry to attract and retain staff for these critical roles and have truly created significant incentives for \nnew and existing employees in order to help with attracting new talent and retaining current staff.  \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage is similar from the last reporting period (see below). There \nare 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS. Approximately 138 of these positions are “direct-\ncare” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”). The teacher vacancy rate \nis lower than last reporting period (5 vacancies), or 26% of positions which is a huge improvement \nand will greatly assist with providing increased quality and quantity of education for youth. There \nis the higher number of social worker vacancies, which at 75% is very high. This is a critical role \nthat should be made a recruiting priority. Recruiting in general is still a challenge due to the \nlocation of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS will close, and for educators, the year-\nround school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue.  Even with the added incentives, there is \na still difficulty in hiring many classifications of staff. \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 10 of 47\n \n                                                                                                                                                            YCTYCAPoeoooodauusuuvcnitnt.hth shise eo e rlnl oo rr   V 313 aD692c% %ea%cn  ( (ec(48m7y1  o b oRouueuta   rt  t ot   oe3off  1f% 2 3,15 72 1)a.0 55s2)) 1  o f  V424a108cM%%%an   a(((cr461yc4 1o h  Rouo 3utua  1ttot  e,ofo   2ff3%  010220)3 a2 8)s  )  of V422a006c %%%aJn  u ((c(65l4yy  3oo  R3uu o1tta u  ,oot te2f fo   031%f29 012)) 0a   8s )o f \nSocial Worker  36% (5 out of 14)  67% (8 out of 12)  75% (9 out of 12) \n \n \nYouth Counselor and Youth Counselor Adv. position vacancies have remained consistent during \nthis reporting period however, employee leave usage and the continued increase in the youth \npopulation has added to the staffing crisis resulting in facility operational challenges, the continued \nneed for “split” halls, heightened fear for safety, and poor staff wellness (as reported in PbS data). \nDefendants are going to have to consider some non-traditional staffing options in order safely \nmaintain the facility. This will most certainly include operational adjustments that limit the number \nof youths out at any given time to ensure proper staffing ratios, thus increasing operational room \nconfinement.  Youth  seem  to  understand  operational  confinement  now.    From  the  youths’ \nperspective though, it does not matter whether or not it is operational – they are being confined to \ntheir rooms for long periods of time, even when they have not misbehaved. This can make youth \nmore upset/oppositional. The Monitor is recommending a staffing assessment for the direct care \npositions and posts be completed and made suggestions to have other classifications trained similar \nto the direct care positions in order to meet PREA requirements so that they may be considered \nfull time, direct-care staff and factored into the staffing ratios.  The Monitor will continue to work \nwith Defendants on this and other issues. \n \nIn order to recruit and retain direct care, as of this reporting period, YC’s and YCA’s are now \noffered $10 per hour more than was being offered as of January 1, 2022. In addition, DOC/DJC \nhas taken an across the board approach to filling staff vacancies which have persisted over the \nreporting period. DJC knows that its staff are the division’s best asset towards making the programs \nand initiatives underway in the schools and living units a success, and importantly, that staffing \nshortages increase the burden on those who work to maintain a safe and healthy environment for \nyouth and staff. Specific efforts to recruit staff during this reporting period participated in by the \nHR staff at the facility included: \n \n•  Attended the Northcentral Technical College School of Health Job Fair \n•  Attended the Midstate Technical College virtual career fair \n•  Attended the Wisconsin Rapids Job Fair \n•  Attended the Medford High School Job Fair \n•  Attended the Rhinelander High School Job Fair  \n•  Attended the Merrill High School Job Fair \n•  Attended the National Guard Job Fair \n•  Attended the Wausau Job Center Hiring Event \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 11 of 47\n \n•  Attended the Wausau Job Center Walk-In Interviews \n•  Attended the Rhinelander Job Center Walk-In Interviews \n•  Attended the Price County Job Fair \n \nOther recruitment efforts occurring during the reporting period involved HR at the facility worked \nwith central office HR personnel and the communications office on getting up billboard advertising \nfor  employment.  HR  also  received  approval  for  (5)  0.6  FTE  Youth  Counselor \npositions. Historically, DJC hasn’t offered any part-time positions amongst YCs, but there were \ninquiries on the part of prospective employees that warranted DJC getting approval for the \npositions to fill should there be interest. Finally, HR at the facility and DJC Administration worked \nwith central office HR to clarify and enact a process change to hiring that may allow DJC to make \nmore timely offers of employment to probable candidates.  \n  \nKey Positions hired during this reporting period (April-July) are as follows:  \n•  Three Treatment Specialist 2 \n•  Five Teachers  \n•  Six Youth Counselors \n•  One Supervising Youth Counselor 2 \n•  One Supervising Youth Counselor 1 \n•  One Program & Policy Analyst Adv (PbS & Policies) \n•  One Payroll & Benefits Specialist \n•  One Recreation intern \n•  One Treatment intern \n•  Two Recreation Leader Sr. \n•  Two Psychological Associates \n \nThe struggle to hire licensed/certified social workers continues. DJC has not been able to hire a \nsocial worker since 2018. The DOC had raised the minimum pay for social workers, but this has \nnot helped in LHS/CLS garnering any applicants even after the increase.  Many social services \nagencies have moved towards hiring case managers that do not require a state certification/license, \nand unfortunately LHS has also moved in this direction due to the inability to recruit and retain \nsocial workers.   \n \nDJC recently hired three Treatment Specialist 2’s, one new hire, one who promoted from a YC \nposition, and one who promoted from a Social Worker position. These individuals have been \nobserving DBT Groups, co-facilitating DBT Groups, and learning case management duties.  They \nare also currently in the process of receiving detailed DBT Training from DBT consultant Dr. \nChapin in facilitating skills groups. The plan continues to be to have two either Treatment \nSpecialists or Social Workers assigned to each unit.  These individuals will together facilitate that \nunit’s DBT Skills Groups and provide all case management services for the youth in the unit.  \n \nDJC continues to work on hiring more Treatment Specialist 2’s and is also starting of the process \nof hiring Treatment Specialist 1’s.  Whereas the TS2’s will work Monday-Friday during normal \nworking hours, TS1’s would primarily work during the evening and weekend hours. This will \nallow the facility to expand the treatment services tremendously.          \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 12 of 47\n \n \nDJC  and  facility  leadership  conducted  surveys  of  staff  and  subsequent  planning  regarding \nschedules that could help mitigate staff shortages and reduce overall mandated overtime ordering \nof staff during the reporting period.  The Monitor will report on the outcomes in the next report.   \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over thirty-four (34) staff. Staff morale seemed good overall despite \nthe obvious shortages at the time of the site visit. A review of video over the reporting period \nshowed staff regularly engaging with youth. Several staff were extremely friendly and engaged \nand stated that they liked their jobs. In several cases, newer staff stated that they “loved” their jobs. \nOne OJT staff member was observed having a very positive interaction with a youth in his room \nwho had his door window covered.  The staff member was overheard asking the youth to uncover \nhis window.  The youth asked why, and the staff member replied stating, “because I care about \nyou and I want to make sure you are safe.” The youth uncovered his window and said thank you.  \nThe PbS data for April 2022 reveals an increase in staff fear for safety concerns as well as an \nincrease in staff perceptions regarding how dangerous the facility is based on input taken from the \nStaff Climate Surveys.  Both of these outcome measures reflect increases in fear for safety concerns \nover the previous October data collection cycle. Fear for safety indicators at LHS was at 69.49% \nand at 83.33% at CLS.  Both are increases from the October 2021 data cycle.  Both indicators are \nalso significantly above the national field average of 24.81%.   \nAlso, interesting, is that many staff stated that they too dislike the modified program and feel the \nyouth need more time out of their rooms and more meaningful activities to engage in.  However, \nthey also understood the need for the modified  program and felt it was providing a safer \nenvironment. While the PbS fear for safety outcome in April reflected a higher fear for safety, the \nfears seemed to have reduced since the data collection period.  \n \nIn order to improve conditions of confinement for youth and staff which will improve overall \nculture, DJC has worked extensively to develop its new System of Care (behavior motivation \nprogram) which will be implemented in August 2022.  Various staff have visited other states to \nmake  informed  decisions  about  operations  that  would  provide  fidelity  to  the  system.  That \nexperience helped determine that team-based assignments have wielded good results in other \nfacilities and is something DJC wants to replicate at the CLS/LHS. This model involves a focus \non positive youth outcomes and an improved behavior motivation program which also focuses on \na youth’s progress in their education and treatment plans.  \n \nThe goal of the pilot for the new system of care was to develop a team atmosphere amongst groups \nof living units, consistent post assignments, and to reduce overall ordering. Given current staffing \nlevels it was not possible to match each team with a single unit, so those teams were set into four \ncategories:  LHS  General  Population;  LHS  Skills  Development  and  Intake;  CLS  Skills \nDevelopment & General Population; and RRT/Control/School Patrol. Some auxiliary posts such \nas Care Team, Recreation and Visitation that were evenly distributed to balance out the teams.  \n \nThe LHS General Population units and the CLS/LHS Skills Development units will have two \nprimary YCA’s and four primary YC’s. King & Roosevelt will have four primary YC’s. The Wells \nYCA will become Wells/King. The keys within the RRT/Control group will remain at the time \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 13 of 47\n \nthey currently are. Within the General Population team and both the LHS/CLS Skills Development \nteams: \n \n•  YC’s who are working 0630 - 1830 transitioning to 0800 - 2000.  \n•  YC’s who are working 1830 - 0630 transitioning to 2000 - 0800.  \n•  YC’s who are working 1030 - 2230 transitioning to 0800 – 2000. \n•  YC’s who are working 1430 - 0230 transitioning to 1600 – 0400 mid-shift or 2000 – 0800.  \n•  YCA’s would transition to 0800 – 2000. \n \nProvided this information, staff were asked to respond to a survey regarding their general opinions \nof the team approach and as well as some of the specific impacts it may have. The staff survey \nshowed a strong preference to move towards this new scheduling format. \n \nSome logistical considerations requiring additional preparation to accommodate the new schedule \nwas completed in June 2022 before it was announced on July 8, 2022 that the new schedule would \nbe implemented at the facility beginning Monday, August 1, 2022. The Monitor is very supportive \nof this new system of care. Also, by seeking staff input on the new system of care and respective \nscheduling, this will create buy in and improve staff morale as staff helped shape the new program.  \nMost staff seemed to feel as if the overall atmosphere was improving but stated that they continue \nto have no control or adequate consequences for youth behaviors. Staff were aware of the new \nbehavior motivation program/system of care and seemed excited for the change. Staff felt that the \nnew BMP would provide them with the needed incentives, rewards, and consequences to more \neffectively manage youth behaviors.  The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to several mental \nhealth staff and they were very knowledgeable about the various programming and knew the youth \nand expressed how much they liked working with the youth.  It was very nice to see such optimism \nfrom the staff.   The continued implementation of DBT and other best practices will improve safety \nfor staff and youth.  \nDefendants continue to work on increasing staff morale but still have much more work to do. This \nis even more critical during a time where there is not enough staff and staff are getting mandated to \nwork overtime regularly. Defendants have done the following to increase staff morale during this \nreporting period: \n \nCritical Incident Response Team \nOn July 13, 2022, DJC LHS/CLS Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) held their first quarterly \nrefresher training since they were initially trained in March. CIRT aims to foster resilience in staff \nand promote physical and mental well-being after critical incidents wherein normal coping skills \nmay be overwhelmed.  CIRT meets with staff one on one or in a group setting to formally process \nthoughts and emotions staff may be experiencing after a critical incident. The day included \nrefreshing group intervention skills with critical incident scenarios, policy and procedure review, \ndiscussion on ways to improve the CIRT program and the importance of self-care. The team met \noffsite at the Northwoods Veterans Post in Merrill. The day concluded with team building \nexercises to strengthen team cohesion.  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 14 of 47\n \nCommittee Assigned to Safety and Health (CASH) \nOn  April  14,  2022,  the  CASH  committee  hid  candy  filled  Easter  eggs  throughout  the \nadministrative building for staff as they were reporting for shift.  \n \nOn April 21, 2022, the spring-cleaning contest winners were announced. This was a weeklong \ncleaning contest in the units to promote a healthy working environment for both youth and staff \nand both were encouraged to participate with the winning youth units receiving rewards or special \nevents.  \n \nMay 2, 2022 through May 6, 2022 was correctional employee appreciation week. The facility put \non a full week of treats and recognition culminating in the length of service award ceremony which \ngives special recognition to employee who reach five-year milestones in their state employment.   \n \nOn May 24, 2022, brats, burgers, chips, punch and desserts for a Memorial Day cookout.  \n \nOn May 31, 2022, the CIRT coordinator put out a staff wellness, safety, and appreciation survey \nto all staff. The survey was open through June and the CIRT coordinator is tabulating results from \nthe survey with management in order to help establish what the attitudes and needs of staff are, \nand how best to improve operations as well as address staff concerns.   \n \nOn July 20, 2022, for the Pie-in-the-Face fundraiser, select staff put themselves forward to receive \na pie in the face should they garner the most support in the form of donations. The money raised \nhelped fund the CASH committee which plans staff gatherings and events like the ones listed in \nthis section. Staff who ended up receiving a Pie-to-the-Face were the Administrator, Deputy \nSuperintendent, Safety Director, Scheduling SYC, and the Buildings and Groups Supervisor. The \nevent was very successful raising just over $500 that will help fund further staff wellness efforts.  \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information. A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible. \nFear for safety continues to be a major concern and one that impacts the overall culture and \natmosphere of the facility. Improving staff wellness will certainly have a positive impact on the \noverall atmosphere and reduce turnover, which will then provide an opportunity to decrease the \nvacancy rate, reduce employee leaves and improve staffing ratios. \nFacility Improvement Plan (“FIP”) Progress \nA thorough and in-depth review was conducted of the April 2021 PbS data collection for both LHS \nand CLS.  During the review, outcome measure data clarification and input was sought from both \nthe facility PbS State and Site Coordinators and the assigned PbS Coach.  As a result of the review, \nthe following highlights and outcomes are noted: \n \nLHS has one FIP open, #1012, which is focused on outcome measures Order 03 – Physical Restraint \nUse; Order 04 – Mechanical Restraint Use; and Order 13 – Isolation and Room Confinement Use.  \nThis FIP has been open since January 2021.  Each of the outcome measures are rated as improved \nand are below the original goals set by the FIP.  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 15 of 47\n \n \n \nOutcome Measure  Original Value  Current Value  Average Value  Goal \nOrder 03 Physical restraint use \nper 100 person-days of youth  92.00  43.00  18.10  69.00   \nconfinement. \nOrder 04 Mechanical restraint \n \nuse per 100 person-days of youth  41.00  17.00  11.25  30.00 \nconfinement. \nOrder 13 Isolation, room \nconfinement use for reasons not   \n679.00  24.00  54.85  340.00 \nrelated to behavior per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \nCLS has two FIP’s currently open, #1009 which focuses on outcome measures Order 08 – Isolation \nand Room Confinement.

Since this is a new FIP, no progress has yet been \nmade.  \n \n  \n \nOutcome Measure  Original Value  Current Value  Average Value  Goal \nHealth 02 Percent of youths presented \nfor admission who had a health intake   \n67%  67%  93%  75% \nscreening completed by trained or \nqualified staff in one hour or less. \nHealth 05 Percent of youths presented \nfor admission who had an intake \n \nscreening completed by trained or  67%  67%  87%  75% \nqualified staff in one hour or less from \nthe time of admission. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 16 of 47\n \n \nOutcome Measure  Original Value  Current Value  Average Value  Goal \nHealth 07 Percent of youths presented \nfor admission whose health \n \nassessments were completed by trained  83%  83%  89%  89% \nor qualified staff 6 months prior to or \nwithin 7 days from admission.  \n \nWith all that said, there are a couple of outcome measures that warrant discussion.  First and \nforemost, is what was unquestionably a high rate of “self-requested” confinement during previous \ndata collection cycles.  Prior data reflected 715 incidents of confinement use during the month of \nApril 2021 (610 @ LHS and 105 @ CLS).  Of these, there were a total of 621 for self-requested \nconfinement, representing 87% of all confinement for the facility during the month.  The outcome \nmeasures related to self-requested or program refusals improved drastically over the course of \nseveral collection cycles. The April 2022 data shows (156) incident of confinement use at LHS, \nwith only (24) of those being recorded as self-requested or program refusals. Similarly, CLS also \nshows dramatic improvement in overall confinement use having reported only (18) incidents, with \nonly (4) having been the result of self-request or program refusal.   \nAdditionally, the previous reports discussed that the unit activity record for the Krueger Unit \nreflected that youth were spending approximately 20.64 hours per day in their rooms (10.5 hours \nreflected as sleeping time and 10.14 hours reflected as “in sleeping rooms,” room confinement).  \nThe activity log for the Krueger Unit also did not reflect any hours for education.   This issue has \nbeen resolved.  The April 2022 data shows Krueger youth spending approximately 11.90 hours in \ntheir rooms for “sleeping” time and 0.0 hours in their rooms for other reasons.  Education hours \nfor Krueger youth increased to approximately 5.11 hours per day (weekdays) and leisure activity \ntime decreased to 2.83 hours per day (weekdays). This represents a larger portion of their day that \nis spent in more meaningful activities such as education.  \nWhile the Monitor recognizes these improvements, it is necessary for the facility to provide more \nmeaningful programs  and activities to youth during  weekend hours.  Leisure time  activities \nincreases during the weekends in all the units, to as much as 6.39 hours. Reducing and replacing \nleisure time with more meaningful activities will have a positive impact on reducing incidents of \nviolence occurring over the weekend periods.  \nFinally, the Monitor encourages the facility to closely review all of the PbS data and outcome \nmeasures as a means to better understand the impacts generated from the many changes occurring \nwithin the facility.  Agency and facility leadership should make it a point to review the PbS data \nwith staff at all levels, perhaps during monthly all staff briefing meetings.  This is an opportunity \nto show the positive outcomes being achieved through the various changes and efforts to reduce \nincidents of violence, confinement, and use of restraint. Much work remains to be done.  The data \nshows fluctuating trend lines, some moving in the right direction, while others are not. These \nfluctuating trends can and should be expected as staff and youth adjust to the ever-changing \nbehavior response techniques and the skill level of staff in utilizing various training, de-escalation \ntechniques, and, as discussed earlier, in the full implementation of the behavior motivation system.  \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 17 of 47\n \n \nPbS Critical Outcome Measures Review \n \nUse of Restraint Outcome Measures - Both LHS and CLS show “0” incidents of use of chemical \nagents (Order 6) since the October 2019 data collection cycle, which is commendable and per the \nSettlement Agreement.  The rates of physical restraint use (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use per \n100-person days of confinement) at LHS increased during this data cycle and is well above the \nnational field average, as does the rate of mechanical restraint (Order 4 – Mechanical Restraint use \nper 100-person days of confinement) usage incidents.  CLS’ use of physical restraints saw a \nsubstantial decline during the April 2022 data cycle, as did the use of mechanical restraints, which \nfell below the national field average for the first time. \n \nAs mentioned earlier, PbS is a continuous facility improvement process which involves complex \noperational issues.  The following two charts reveal that overall, the trends lines for both physical \nand mechanical restraint use has returned to the average levels from the October 2020 spike, and \nnow appear to be trending the right direction.  It is normal to see fluctuations in this type of data \nand the October 2020 spike is most certainly related to temporary operational changes that were in \nplace as a result of the pandemic.   Improvement in reducing youth idleness with meaningful \nprograms and activities along with an improved behavior motivation program, and continued staff \ntraining, can have a significant impact on these outcome measures.  \n \n \nOrder 03 \nPhysical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note: PbS defines Physical Restraints as facility authorized and trained holds used by staff to \nsubdue an otherwise uncontrollable youth in order to prevent the youth from injuring him or \nherself, or others.)   \n \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 18 of 47\n \nOrder 04 \nMechanical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note:  PbS  defines  Mechanical  Restraints  as  Mechanical  Devices  used  to  prevent  an \nuncontrollable youth from injuring him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints may only be \nused for short periods of time and must be used under medical supervision.) \nThe previous Monitoring reports discussed issues around the reduced use of the Care Teams which \nhad resulted in a higher number of restraint-usage incidents.  The overall trends for Outcomes 3 and \n4 continue to show positive improvements, even with the noted increases above at LHS. Given the \noverall positive reductions in the use of physical and mechanical restraints during this PbS cycle, it \nappears the heightened focus on Care Teams has had a positive impact.  Care Teams are designed \nprecisely to reduce the need for the use of restraints and have been effectively shown to work at \nfacilities across the country and have been shown to be effective at LHS and CLS as well. The \nAgency and facility should continue to expand the use of the Care Team concept and ensure that \ndirect care staff are training to properly use the Care Team as a de-escalation and use of restraint \navoidance response.  It is critical that direct care staff develop skills around total awareness in order \nto recognize the early signs of pending behavior and incidents in order to engage the Care Team \nmembers at the earliest possible opportunity.  This in turn increases the opportunities for de-\nescalation and resolution of situations without the use of restraint. Care Team members should not \nbe involved in the use of physical restraint of a youth except in exceptional situations and only to \nprotect the safety and welfare of others as this is counterproductive to the concept and does not \npermit the youth to begin de-escalating if they believe the Care Team member may still use physical \nforce against them.  \nThe Defendants should continue to implement the core principles of the Care Team model by utilizing \nan agency strategic plan process that involves additional staff training in de-escalation techniques; \ninclude Care Team deployment information in shift debriefings in order to review the process and \nprovide on-going situational training for staff;  implement a Care Team response incident report that \nalso reflects the outcome of the response in order to better track outcomes from Care Team \ndeployments; implement the S.O.D.A.S model (Situation, Options, Disadvantages, Advantages, \nSolution) into the Care Team model; and, finally, the facility leadership team should incorporate \ndaily/weekly review of all use of force/restraint incidents to evaluate if and when the Care Team \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 19 of 47\n \nshould have been activated to help de-escalate a situation.  This should be used as a staff training and \nawareness process to help staff build new skills and to help change their mindsets in how they first \nreact to certain types of youth behaviors. \nIsolation, Room Confinement and Segregation Measures – Overall, there are fluctuations in the PbS \noutcome measures around isolation and room confinement for the April 2022 cycle, reflecting that \n100% of room confinements are terminated in under eight (8) hours at CLS and 99.24% at LHS.  \nCLS also shows 100% of confinements ending in under four (4) hours, with approximately 84.09% \nending in under four (4) hours at LHS.   Order 13 – Isolation, room confinement use for reasons \nother than behavior reflects decreases at both LHS and CLS for this data period over prior reporting \nperiods. In fact, both facilities were below the national field averages for this outcome measure. \nIt should also be noted as to the improved outcomes and reduced rates of initial room confinement \nplacements during the April data cycle. Both facilities showed reduced incidents of confinement \npractices, with LHS dropping below the national field average for incidents of confinement NOT \nrelated to behavior (i.e., operational confinement).  It should also be noted that while operational \nconfinement was reduced during the April data collection period, more recent operational practices \nresulting from the staffing challenges have substantially increased operational confinement.   \n \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, segregation/special management unit use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note:  PbS defines confinement as any instance when a youth is separated from the youth \npopulation and placed in a room or cell alone for 15 minutes or longer. Youths are considered to \nbe confined from  the moment they are separated from others until they  have rejoined the \npopulation. Youths may be transferred to a designated unit for confinement (e.g., a segregation \ndorm or program separation unit). Confinement may occur in locked or unlocked rooms but cannot \noccur in large dormitories. Any instance of confinement of 15 minutes or more is a reportable PbS \nincident event.) \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 20 of 47\n \nOrder 13 \nIsolation, room confinement use for reasons not related to behavior per 100 person-days of youth confinement.  \n \n \nBoth LHS and CLS have very dramatically reduced incidents of self-separation and program \nrefusals to levels below and better than the national field averages.  \n \nWhy confinement was used    Lincoln Hills    Copper Lake \nValue  Count  Percent  Count  Percent \nSelf-requested  24  15%  4  22% \nMental Health  NA  NA  3  17% \nProtect other youths or staff  125  80%  8  44% \nGive youth time to cool off  NA  NA  1  6% \nConsequences of rule violations  4  3%  NA  NA \nOther response to behavior  2  1%  NA  NA \nProtect property  1  1%  NA  NA \n \nThe PbS Incident reporting data for April 2022 reflects the following important data points: \n➢  93% of the incidents occurring at CLS occurred in the living unit. \n➢  66% of restraints used at CLS involved the same two youth. \n➢  Zero incidents of injuries to youth from suicidal behaviors were reported at CLS. \n➢  80% of the fights/assaults at CLS involved the same two youth. \n➢  85% of the incidents occurring at LHS occurred in the living units. \n➢  31% of the incidents occurred in the DuBois Unit (32 total incidents). \n➢  29% of incidents occurred in the Black Elk Unit (30 incidents). \n➢  29% of incidents occurred in the Krueger Unit (30 incidents). \n➢  38% of the recorded incidents at LHS occurred on a Saturday or Sunday when there is \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 21 of 47\n \nsignificantly less activity.  \n➢  14 youth at LHS were responsible for 100% of the incidents of violence (assaults and fights). \n \nSafety 06 \nSuicidal behavior with injury by youths per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \nCLS continues to have zero incidents of suicidal behaviors resulting in injury for the last three \nreporting cycles.

Much can be learned from review of these outcome domains and the data \nassociated with them, in particular those focused on youth and staff relationships.   \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nThe Program and Policy Analyst-Advanced focused on the ongoing Quality Assurance (“QA”) \nimplementation efforts surrounding the consent decree and other important functions in the school \nand facility system of care updates.  \nDefendants began using the newly digitized use of force review form b in May 2022.  The process \nstill  requires  incident  review  for  all  physical  restraint  uses,  but  it  includes  the  additional \nrequirement that any incidents involving the use of mechanical restraints be automatically assigned \nthe additional facility level use of force review. The J-Tracker use of force form retains all relevant \nfields of information from the prior department form, but also includes questions specific to \nmechanical restraints. Finally, it serves as at least a retrospective confirmation/communication \nbetween the reviewer and the youth’s clinician ensuring PSU was either present at the time of the \nincident or responded within the two-hour timeframe when mechanical restraints exceed 45 \nminutes. \n \nCritical information is now readily available to the leadership which so that they can make \nproactive, data driven decisions that increases the safety of youth and staff.  Again, continuous \nimprovements have been made in data collection and in the quality assurance program. \n \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 28 of 47\n \nPolicies and Procedures/Administrative Code Update \nThe DJC Policy Committee continues to review and update policies of note to the facility.  \nIn the April meeting the committee reviewed the following policies:  \n \n1) 100.01.07 - Division Representation in Court Appearances  \n2) 500.00.04 - Reporting Health concerns to on call nursing staff  \n3) 500.70.03 - On Call Mental Health Services \n \nIn the June meeting the committee reviewed the following policies: \n \n1) 300.07.02 - Post orders  \n2) 300.03.01 - On Grounds While Off Duty  \n3) 100.04.08 - Joint Planning and Review Conferences  \n4) 300.05.02 - Security Devices \n \nThe process for youth notes in J-Tracker has also been written into a draft procedure being \nreviewed by facility administration. The Youth Notes procedure codifies the requirement that \nyouth receive services while in confinement and outlines the monthly and quarterly CQI processes \nthat will support adherence to documentation standards. Similarly, the Incident Debrief procedure \nseeks to further define process and standards for notifications, justification, and documentation \nsurrounding AC placements.  \n \nOther policy projects include continuing to work on moving all divisional policies and facility \nprocedures to an OnBase software system that will ensure all staff are accessing, reading, and \nacknowledging DJC policies and procedures. The DJC team is currently working with IT to test \nthe system before publication of the policies to OnBase. While transferring the documents, all the \npolicies are under review for updates for signature. This process also includes checking policy \nreferences including those that may reference Administrative Code 373 or 376 to ensure that they \nare reviewed to match the changes updated in code. With the addition of a new Program and Policy \nAnalyst at the facility, a procedure committee has been created and will be meeting on a monthly \nbasis.   \n \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and \nDOC Chapter 373 forward. Revisions to the draft of Chapter 373 is being worked on by DJC’s \nAdministrative Code committee. Chapter 376 final draft has been completed by the committee. \nCurrently the economic impact statement is being completed by the Division of Management \nServices. Once that is finalize Chapter 376 will move to the external review portion. Defendants \nneed to continue to aggressively work towards completing the respective Administrative Code \nsections. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 29 of 47\n \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nyouth are being confined for seven days for any reason.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nyouth are being confined for three days for any reason. \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Defendants need to continue to \nexamine use of all forms of confinement and review incidents to ensure that staff are not \nusing  any  form  of  confinement  as  punitive  confinement.  The  Monitor  previously \nrecommended establishing clear criteria for all confinement so that staff cannot punitively \nconfine youth and cannot confine youth for more than 24 hours if they do not pose an \nimminent danger of harm to themselves.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to  \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 30 of 47\n \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of AC was significantly \nhigher for both CLS and LHS youth this reporting period. There were twenty (20) youths \nconfined over four (4) hours in this reporting period. The number of AC placements for LHS \nand CLS is trending down in July.  Defendants need to continue to assess how they can more \neffectively provide intensive mental health services for youth \n.\n \nJanuary 2022 \nCLS: 25 uses of A.C. Average 124 minutes. Three (3) youth over four hours. \nLHS: 21 uses of A.C. Average of 170 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours.  \n  \nFebruary 2022 \nCLS: 15 uses of A.C. Average 139 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 19 uses of A.C. Average of 138 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nMarch 2022 \nCLS: 17 uses of A.C. Average 132 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 59 uses of A.C. Average of 138 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours.  \n \nApril 2022 \nCLS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 160 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 92 uses of A.C. Average of 154 minutes. 14 youth over four hours.  \n \nMay 2022 \nCLS: 27 uses of A.C. Average 122 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours. \nLHS: 33 uses of A.C. Average of 145 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n  \nJune 2022 \nCLS: 60 uses of A.C. Average 145 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 59 uses of A.C. Average of 184 minutes. Five (5) over four hours.  \n \nJuly 2022 \nCLS: 35 uses of A.C. Average 132 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 17 uses of A.C. Average of 138 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit. 98.61% of checks were completed within 30 minutes. The \nMonitor reviewed video footage for random days and times and Defendants were 100% \ncompliance with completing the checks in accordance to policy. Staff did an outstanding job \nand should be commended for their diligence in ensuring youth safety while in their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 31 of 47\n \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \npose a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  twenty  (20)  youth \nconfined for over four (4) hours during this reporting period (see response in previous \nquestion). Some extended confinements were not recommended by PSU. Also, one youth was \nconfined for 13.75 hours pending transfer to MJTC.  \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring any form of room \nconfinement is compliant with this Court Order, draft policy, and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) transfers as a \nresult  of  extended  placement  in  administrative  confinement.  In  one  instance,  after \nconsultation with PSU, it was determined that the youth would transfer to MJTC. As a result, \nthe youth was maintained on AC status pending transfer to MJTC. However, in the other \ninstance, administration, not PSU, made the decision to keep a youth in extended AC pending \nhis transfer to jail. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to 8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.  \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one instance in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 32 of 47\n \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 is being utilized. The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. Only \nyouth who are in imminent risk of serious self-harm to themselves/risk of self-harm will be \nplaced in observation status. The Monitor will continue to review and monitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed on renovated units. Youth rooms \nwere relatively clean overall. The directive issued in February changing how property is \ndispersed continues to have an impact.   \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants are very close to substantial \ncompliance.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, regular hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. The \nMonitor reviewed random video footage of living units in evening hours and observed several \ninstances in which youth were given access to the toilet upon request. Defendants have \nimproved their documentation and data collection. However, youth in Krueger and Wells \ndid complain to Plaintiff’s counsel about not being able to use their own toiletries and \ncomplained about toilet/shower facilities.  \n \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 33 of 47\n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible. PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification. The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented. Clinicians are on-site for a minimum of 6 hours each Saturday and \nSunday and the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth. The Defendants \nhave hired 3 treatment specialists and 1 psychology associate. There is no change to PSU \non-site schedule.   The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the hours in which \nthey are physically present on weekends and evening hours in order to engage youth in a \nmeaningful way during this time.  As stated in the narrative, several PSU staff were present \non the units working with youth and talking with youth who were in their rooms.  \n \nDefendants are continually overhauling the system of care and DBT based treatment model. \nDefendants continue to engage the DBT consultant. Treatment is going to be even more \ncritical as the population continues to increase and the Defendants are operationally \nconfining. \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental  \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  In  general,  documentation/data \nshows that evaluations are completed (if there is not already a mental health evaluation) \nwithin 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. The Monitor is told youth on \noperational confinement are being seen by PSU and evaluated for contraindication, but the \nMonitor has not seen documentation for youth on operational confinement and whether they \nare evaluated for contraindication.  There was one instance of contraindication documented \nduring this review period. Defendants need to ensure that they are meeting the criteria in \nthis  section  and  document  any  and  all  room  confinement  including  operational  room \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 34 of 47\n \nconfinement. Youth who are placed in their room for operational confinement should QA \nneeds to be implemented and sustained.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose. Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants are over 98% compliant \nwith meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe. Quality assurance \nmeasures are in place and when necessary, formal investigations occur. There wasn’t data \navailable to assess whether there were any formal job instructions for not completing safety \nand security checks.  The Monitor observed safety/wellness checks being completed on \nvarious days/times on every unit during this reporting period and observed no instances in \nwhich staff did not make visual contact with youth per policy- 100% of the checks were \ncompliant. \n \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time on evenings and weekends. Examples of \nthe crisis intervention techniques used with youth when confined can be viewed/verified in \nthe PSU On-Call and/or PSU Clinician notation box on the J-Tracker Incident Debrief \ncustom form. Examples of crisis intervention techniques include but are not limited to: \nvalidation, practice of DBT skills, processing of the incident, mediation, assistance problem-\nsolving, fostering perspective-taking, Behavior Chain Analysis (formal and informal), plans \nto address conflict/safety/skills practice, in the moment coaching skills, time away from \nstressors, body scans, mindfulness, increase insight, encourage self-reflection. The Monitor \nhas reviewed these documents.  Youth did complain to Plaintiffs’ counsel about quality and \nquantity of mental health services.  \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 35 of 47\n \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth continue to complain about \nproperty restrictions while in the SDP. Staff confirmed that there are property restrictions \nfor youth while they are in the SDPs. This is an area that Defendants need to re-examine. \nYouth in SDP do not get the same property as youth in general population which is not \nconsistent with this required provision. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general.  It is difficult to assess whether \nthese services are being provided while youth are in operational room confinement because \nDefendants do not track operational room confinement time per youth during this reporting \nperiod. The Monitor saw social workers, mental health and health services being provided \nto youth during the site visit and in random video review. The primary clinician consults \nwith the on-call clinician and with the SYC/YC/CPS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the \nyouth plan addresses the issues at hand and how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. \nA PSU clinician follows up in the absence of the primary clinician and/or the crisis clinician. \nThe vacancy rate for social workers continues to be extremely high. Social workers are \ncritical to quality of care and services for the youth and effective re-entry planning.  \nThe struggle to hire licensed/certified social workers continues. DJC has not been able to \nhire a social worker since 2018. The DOC had raised the minimum pay for social workers, \nbut this hasn’t proved to help LHS/CLS garner any applicants even after the increase.  Many \nsocial services agencies have moved towards hiring case managers that do not require a state \ncertification/license, unfortunately LHS has also moved in this direction due to their inability \nto recruit and retain social workers.   \n \nDJC recently hired three Treatment Specialist 2’s. These individuals have been observing \nDBT Groups, co-facilitating DBT Groups, and learning our case management duties.  They \nare also currently in the process of receiving detailed DBT Training from DBT consultant \nDr.  Chapin  in  facilitating  skills  groups.  The  plan  continues  to  be  to  have  two  either \nTreatment Specialists or Social Workers assigned to each unit.  These individuals will \ntogether facilitate that unit’s DBT Skills Groups and provide all case management services \nfor the youth in the unit.  \n \nDJC continues to work on hiring more Treatment Specialist 2’s and is also starting of the \nprocess of hiring Treatment Specialist 1’s.  Whereas the TS2’s will work Monday-Friday \nduring normal working hours, TS1’s would primarily work during the evening and weekend \nhours. This will allow the facility to expand the treatment services.          \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 36 of 47\n \n \nDocumentation, quality assurance, and policy and procedure need to be improved/completed \nas it relates to social work, mental health, and other health services. Defendants need to \nensure there is accountability with respect to the services provided by the social workers, \nmental and healthcare workers.  \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. During the pandemic, Defendants \nmoved to smaller group-based treatment to youth where group participation was provided \non the units. This continues. Treatment programming for youth never ceased due to COVID-\n19 precautions, but the size of the groups was modified to accommodate safe social distancing \nmeasures and keep youth who shared a living unit assignment in groups with one another. \nBeginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group treatment \nsessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule. The  Monitor \ncontinues to encourage these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as possible.  \n   \nDefendants need  to  continue  to  focus  (document  and  QA)  on providing  rehabilitative \nprogramming  that  was  scheduled/in  process  before  placement  in  room  confinement \nincluding operational confinement. Defendants need to ensure that any missed/rescheduled \ntreatment groups do not negatively impact a youth’s progress. \n \n  \niii.         Educational services with  the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices. Defendants shall ensure special education services \nfor all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Staffing  challenges  have  led  to \nchanges in education this reporting period. For most of this reporting period, youth were not \ngoing to the school area for class.  Youth were on their units utilizing packets or on their \ncomputers  completing education,  which youth  consistently noted  was  considerably  more \ndifficult.  Youth did computer and packet-based work alone in their rooms when they were \nbeing operationally confined.   \n \nThe education consultants completed their site visit and are preparing their report which \nincluded  recommendations.    The  Monitor  has  not  seen  the  final  report  or  specific \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 37 of 47\n \nrecommendations.  However, Defendants have committed to make best efforts for improving \neducation for all youth, but especially in special education.  \n \nAs stated previously in this report, the PbS education data from April 2022 – before the \nsignificant confinement changes in this reporting period – shows youth are receiving about \n5.08 hours per day (weekdays) of education at LHS and 5.14 hours per day (weekdays) of \neducation at CLS.   \n \nThe  Monitor  continues  to  suggest  that  Defendants  should  provide  more  art,  music, \nwoodworking, the greenhouse, welding, and sewing and other types of programs to youth in \nthe evening and on weekends Defendants have enhanced many of these programming (as \n.\ndetailed in the physical plant improvement section), but during this reporting period, youth \nwere unable to access many of these programs due to staffing issues. Also, it would be ideal \nfor social workers to work with youth outside of the school day in order to have less \nscheduling issues and would help with any idle time after school (consultants agreed).   The \nMonitor understands that with the staffing challenges and movement freezes, these types of \nprogramming are difficult to continue. However, Defendants need to think of other activities \nto do while on the unit when it is necessary to keep youth on their units for safety reasons.  \nThis is especially true for youth who are operationally confined who have nothing to do for \nseveral hours a day.  Defendants have begun asking youth and staff for ideas of activities \nwhile  in  their  rooms.    The  Monitor  hopes  some  of  the  suggestions  are  implemented.  \nHowever, The Defendants should continue to focus on bringing more programming into \nLHS/CLS, especially culturally and gender relevant programs. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Prior to the staffing issues, youth \nwere regularly out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. However, this is not the case during \nthe  time  Defendants  operationally  confined  youth  due  to  staffing  challenges. Youth  in \noperational  confinement,  isolation  due  to  Covid-19  safety  measures,  any  confinement \nrequired, and youth working on the BIP do not/are not permitted to talk to peers or \nparticipate in regular social interaction. Additionally, youth are not going to the school area \nfor education unless staffing levels allow.  Youth did complain about not getting exercise or \nrecreational activities. The Monitor regularly saw youth conversing with other youth during \nout time when the youth were on the units in the day room.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 38 of 47\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were twenty-nine (29) \ndocumented instances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on \nsubstantial threat of physical harm during this reporting period. Defendants are able to \ntrack when youth eat meals in room and based on reports that the Monitor reviewed, the \ninstances were justified as the youth posed an immediate and substantial threat. This is a \nsignificant increase from last reporting period.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Due  to  staffing  challenges \n(operational confinement) Defendants admit that there are instances where youth were not \ngetting out three (3) hours per day or thirty (30) hours per week.  Defendants do not track \nthis on an individual basis, so the Monitor cannot determine how many youths are not getting \nat least 3 hours of out-time per day or 30 hours per week.  Defendants did indicate they are \nworking on a plan to meet the minimum of 3-hour per day and 30-hour per week of out-time. \nThe Monitor will note that beginning in August (outside of this reporting period) youth are \nbeing operationally confined less due to the plan created to reduce confinement.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals. Within one hour of a youth's placement in \nroom confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement The \n.\nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. Policy has been completed.  Youth who are \nconfined due to staffing issues are not given these notifications of rights.  \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 39 of 47\n \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \nconsistently except in cases of operational confinement, including when less restrictive \nmeans  were  attempted.  Documentation,  data  collection  and  reliability,  and  quality \nassurance (with video review) needs to continue but has significantly improved. Also, \ndocumentation needs to be created that prove a youth was promptly provided with the \nreport upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan. Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The Monitor did not personally \nsee any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, however, data and documentation \nshow  that  there  was  an  increase  in  use  of  mechanical  restraints  for  LHS  and  CLS. \nDefendants need to continue focusing on reducing the use of mechanical (as well as physical) \nrestraints.  \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 40 of 47\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Below is the number of mechanical \nrestraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \n   \nDecember 2021:     2 uses \nJanuary 2022:      3 uses \nFebruary 2022:       6 uses \nMarch 2022:                12 uses   \nApril 2022:    17 uses \nMay 2022:      9 uses \nJun 2022:                         8 uses (1- 83 minutes) \nJuly 2022:    13 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \n   \nDecember 2021:     0 uses \nJanuary 2022:      5 uses \nFebruary 2022:       6 uses  \nMarch 2022:      4 uses \nApril 2022:      2 uses \nMay 2022:    12 uses \nJun 2022:                       15 uses (1-57 minutes) \nJuly 2022:      6 uses \n \n \nIn addition to the Mechanical Restraints policy being signed into practice, DJC worked to \ndigitize its current use of force review forms and incorporate them into J-Tracker in order \nto create efficiency, new sources of data for the facility training supervisor, and most \nimportantly,  to  implement  a  strict  process  for  reviewing  mechanical  restraint  use. \nDefendants should continue to work on reducing the use of mechanical restraints and \ncontinue to monitor.  \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two uses of restraints \nother than handcuffs during this reporting period.  One was a belt restraint and the other \nwas a leg restraint. PSU was present during these two incidents, but PSU did not order \nthese restraints to prevent self-harm. Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, \ntraining, and QA measures and ensure PSU staff order these types of restraints.  \n \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 41 of 47\n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage. Defendants have \ncreated quality assurance measures (see response above).  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used. Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Defendants  need  to  continue \nfocusing on reducing the use of mechanical restraints. Defendants need to continue to \nmonitor and assess the use of restraints and duration. The Monitor has not observed \nmechanical restraints used for punishment/discipline on site visits, review of video, or \ndocumentation reviewed. \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staff have received training in \nphysical  force,  restraints,  and  trained  in  proper  de-escalation.  The  Defendants  are \nincreasing  the  frequency  of  these  trainings  (regular,  informal,  refreshers).  DBT \nimplementation will be very beneficial to youth and staff. Defendants have made DBT a \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 42 of 47\n \npriority and are continuing to train staff and continue working with the DBT consultant. \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit. No youth shall be left alone in restraints. Any use of mechanical \nrestraints  in  excess  of  45  minutes  must  be  approved  by  the \nsuperintendent, security director or designee and approved by PSU \nstaff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as possible \nand no later than 2 hours following, PSU staff shall evaluate and \nprovide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (2) instance of a youth \nbeing  placed  in  mechanical  restraints  over  45  minutes.  The  appropriate  personnel \nauthorized the use of the mechanical restraints. PSU approved and followed up within two \n(2) hours. Defendants have created a QA process for this section. Defendants also need to \nensure therapeutic interventions occur.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented  as  part  of  the  Incident  Debrief  process.  Defendants  need  to  continue \ndeveloping the behavior motivation program, actively engage with youth, and develop \nengaging and meaningful programming in order to reduce the use of mechanical restraints. \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possess drugs or weapons that could not \nbe discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nin this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been finalized. \nA Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all supervisors to \noutline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under which a strip search \nmay be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search.  \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 43 of 47\n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause. Less intrusive searches, including using \na metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top \nor other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is conducted, \nunless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth that less \nintrusive  searches,  which  may  include  physical  contact,  would  cause \ngreater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nduring this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nconducted this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records reviewed \nindicate that all staff have been trained in trauma informed care. There no strip searches \nthis period.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 44 of 47\n \nduring  this  reporting  period.  Documentation  has  improved.  Policy  and  procedure/QA \ndeveloped. PSU is consulted, and it is documented. \n \n4.       Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants need to continue to focus \non de-escalation skills.  De-escalation training/modeling continues to occur.  \n \nThe Monitor observed several instances of de-escalation in review of video footage. Staff are \nmore comfortable utilizing these skills and regularly use these skills in each instance.  \nDefendants should include cultural diversity issues as part of crisis management training \nand  procedures.  Knowing  these  issues  and  how  they  are  communicated  is  critical  to \nsuccessful behavior motivation.  \n \nDefendants will be implementing a new behavior motivation program in August 2022 (see \nnarrative section of this report for details).  The Monitor believes the new program will have \na significant impact on all aspects of daily life for youth and staff.   \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Programming needs improvement \n(as discussed throughout this report) and idleness—which was already high especially during \ntimes of staff shortages. The newly implemented schedule would have helped but on many \ndays, scheduled programming did not occur due to the staffing issues.  Once staffing is no \nlonger an issue, Defendants need to fully implement the program as planned.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth. Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 45 of 47\n \nto further reduce youth idleness hours. Defendants need to create in-room activities for youth \nwhile they are being operationally confined.  Increasing education hours and vocational \nprogramming, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED and who therefore \nhave even fewer activities, especially if on Krueger, can greatly assist in reducing idleness \ntime and provide positive youth development strategies.  \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018, \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale, \nbut the staffing crisis has curtailed any progress in this area. Defendants have implemented \nseveral initiatives to increase recruiting and retention however, these initiatives are not \nresulting in increased available staff to a level that is needed to improve conditions of \nconfinement and to be in substantial compliance with this Court Order during this reporting \nperiod. The Monitor recommends that a formal staffing assessment be completed.  The \nMonitor/SME can complete the staffing assessment if requested.  A staffing assessment will \nprovide the jurisdiction with an updated analysis of FTE’s needed to properly maintain \nmandatory posts for each facility as well as identify any specific needs based on facility \ndesigns, populations, and staffing ratio needs based on incidents of violence and other unique \ncircumstances to each facility. Staffing assessments also take into consideration the average \nleave usage for all types of leave used on an annual basis, to include vacations, sick leave, \nWorker’s Compensation, FMLA, and leave associated with annual training.  Ensuring that \neach facility has the appropriate number of FTE’s to effectively manage the facility also has \na direct impact on staff wellness and reducing fear for safety concerns.   As stated in previous \nreports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts the overall culture, atmosphere, and \nenvironment of the facility. Staff wellness has a direct impact on the relationship between \nyouth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, use of restraint, reduces employee \nleave/vacancies, and the use of isolation and confinement.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments  to  administrative  code.  Defendants  will  make  all  reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  \n \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 \n45 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 46 of 47\n \nand DOC Chapter 373 forward. Revisions to the draft of Chapter 373 is being worked on by \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee. Chapter 376 final draft has been completed by the \ncommittee. Currently, the economic impact statement is being completed by the Division of \nManagement Services. Once that is finalize Chapter 376 will move to the external review \nportion.  \n \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process. Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent. Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in the \nvast majority of cases absent weekends. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in \nmajority of cases. When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is \na corrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). Defendants continue to make improvement in the area of \nquality assurance.   \n            \nB.          Quality assurance. The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout previous \nreports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and \nto improve the quality of life for youth and staff. Defendants have created an exceptional \nquality assurance program and have made substantial progress in developing daily data to \nreview that will automatically be available in order to make real time operational decisions. \nThe Monitoring team will continue to work with the superintendent to establish performance \ngoals, analyzing data, and creation of corrective action plans. \n46 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 135   Filed: 09/09/22   Page 47 of 47\n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Defendants are seeing a significant increase in the average daily population at LHS/CLS \ncombined with a significant staffing crisis which is resulting in youth being confined to their \nrooms, education occurring on the units, daily schedules not being implemented, reduced outdoor \nrecreation time, and increase in youth idleness.  Although the Monitor notes that outside of this \nreporting period,  the data for August thus far  shows a significant reduction in operational \nconfinement, education resumed in the school area, and there is an increase in recreation time.  The \nnew system of care/behavior motivation program was implemented in August which will have a \npositive impact on conditions of confinement for youth.  \n \nWhile operational confinement is not ideal, given the staffing crisis during this reporting period, it \ndoes appear to be necessary in many instances.  Resolving the staffing concerns and completing a \nstaffing assessment will help ensure proper staffing needs and coverage for posts based on facility \nunique criteria and incident of violence rates.  Until the staffing crisis is resolved, Defendants will \nhave difficulty in continuing their progress with many of the areas of this Consent Decree.  \n \nLastly, as the Monitor continues to state in reports to the Court, there needs to be a focus on moving \nyouth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s).  \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n47 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n SIXTEENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Fifteenth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on December 6, 2022. The Monitor’s \nsixteenth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates since the fifteenth site visit which took place on October 27, 2022. \nSITE VISIT \nThe sixteenth site visit by the Monitor took place on February 9, 2023. The Monitor and Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel were onsite for one day and completed necessary interviews and information gathering via \nin-person and virtual meetings prior to, during and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit for the reporting period \nending January 31, 2023 (November 2022, December 2022, and January 2023).  Materials \nincluded but were not limited to: use of force videos, video footage of units, video of safety and \nsecurity checks, programming materials, investigations, various staff video footage of the school \narea, video footage of administrative confinement, memos, daily shift reports, policies, all of the \nmonthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order, work rules, meeting notes, employee \nleave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint documentation, incident reports, and \nother housing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted approximately twelve (12) youth \ninterviews before and during the site visit.  The Monitor toured LHS/CLS and interviewed youth \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 2 of 47\n \nand staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to many of youth and staff present and available \nduring the site visit. Approximately twenty-eight (28) youth and twenty-seven (27) staff were \ninterviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.  \nOVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, CONDITIONS, AND ATMOSPHERE \nIntroduction \n \nThe total LHS/CLS population ranged during this reporting period from 62-75 youths. The \npopulation is much lower compared to the last which was 76 - 85 youths. At the time of the site \nvisit, the population was 61 youths (1 youth off site).  Staffing shortages continue to exist with \nmost days only having 50% of staff.  There continues to be operational confinement (youth \nconfined to their rooms due to inadequate staffing levels, not behavior based) during this reporting \nperiod, albeit less than last reporting period. \n \nAlthough Defendants continue to make significant progress in many of the provisions of this \nAgreement (discussed throughout this report), the staffing shortages, lack of gender, culturally \nrelevant, and structured programming and youth idleness remain. Additionally, quality and quality \nof education needs  improvement and  an increase  in PSU  presence and services should be \nconsidered.  Staffing shortages still exist that impact daily operations, leading to adjustments to \nthe daily schedules to maintain effective staffing ratios for youth supervision and resulting in \noperational room confinement of youth, change in educational settings, overall programming such \nas youth not being able to have outdoor recreation, music and gym time, reduced recreation in \ngeneral, and increased idle time. When there are staffing shortages, there is also a lack of staff \navailable to be CARE team members who are called upon to effectively de-escalate youth in a \nvariety of situations.  Despite these challenges, it is important to note that as of January 31, 2023, \nyouth except those in SDP Levels 1 and 2 are receiving education services in the school.   \n \nAs stated throughout this report, Defendants continue to make significant progress in many of the \nprovisions of this Agreement. The leadership, staff, and youth overall at LHS/CLS continue to \nhave  positive  interactions  with  each  other  and  the  environment  was  very  calm  throughout \nLHS/CLS.  Reduced population levels have enabled for some programming to resume (such as \neducation) due to the increase in staffing ratios. The Monitor hopes that the courts and community \npartners continue to seek alternatives to incarceration (especially since there tends to be an increase \nin population in facilities in the spring and summer), in order to allow for appropriate staffing \nlevels to continue with necessary programming. The Monitor did not encounter a single staff or \nyouth that did not have a positive attitude. The overall operations of LHS/CLS are the best it has \nbeen since the Monitor was appointed.  Staff and leadership’s commitment to youth and to this \nreform effort is evident in every aspect of the operation.  \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, school, and many other areas were clean and orderly. Living \nunits and youth rooms in general were the cleanest the Monitor has observed.  All units and the \nvast majority of youth rooms were clean and organized.  Staff and Youth should be commended \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 3 of 47\n \nfor this improvement.  In conversations with youth, they were very proud of the cleanliness of their \nrooms.  \nDefendants have made or plan to make the following physical plant improvements: \n•  Completed installation of the new youth video phone system in youth living units. Video \nphones  are  now  installed  in  all  youth  living  units  for  youth  to  better  access  and \ncommunicate with their families and community. The system is expected to go live within \nthe next 30 days. Youth are very excited for this phone system. \n \n•  Installed game rooms in each living unit with new Xbox consoles and couch/seating areas \nin each room for youth to use. \n \n•  Began producing music video additions to some of the youth songs created as part of the \nMusic & Arts Initiative (“MAI”). Using new video production software and equipment, \nthe youth are able to produce their own songs from start to finish. Staff and others have \ndonated street clothing for youth to use in the recordings as well. The production quality is \nfirst class, but the most inspirational aspects of the MAI are the result of the talent and \ncreativity on display from the youth at the schools. The Monitor observed videos of two \nyouth and they were very impressive with very moving and emotional messages.  The \nMonitor spoke to the youths who created these videos, and they were very proud of their \nwork. Music is a great outlet for them as it allows them to express their feelings.  The \nMonitor is hopeful that access to the music lab can be utilized on a regular basis. \n  \n•  The Youth Leadership Council (“YLC”) put together requests from youth to improve \nquality  of  life  at  the  schools.  Ideas  stemming  from  the  YLC  meetings  that  were \nimplemented included adding chocolate milk to the menu for youth to have at supper three \ntimes per week. The facility has also moved to replace briefs as far as undergarments, \nmoving instead to a newer supply of boxer per the request of the youth’s representatives to \nthe YLC.  \n \n•  The Monitor and Plaintiffs’ counsel recognized that youth need more activities available \nto them while in their rooms and suggested Defendants ask youth for input. During the \nreporting period, staff solicited input and suggestions from the YLC, then began planning \nand ordering items for youth rooms based on those suggestions. During the week of \nFebruary 6, 2023, staff began attaching a plastic basketball hoop to the wall in all youth \nrooms  with  Velcro  strips  and  providing  all  youth  with  a  foam  ball  and  a  rubber \nfidget/sensory ball along with it. Staff and youth are encouraged to bring suggestions about \ndifferent incentive items than what has been considered and provided to this point, and it \nappears that the facility typically supports looking into and providing reasonable requests. \nThe Monitor observed many youths with the balls that came with the basketball hoop and \nthe stress balls.  Youth told the Monitor that they like both additions.  \n  \n•  Discussed and implemented an incentive-based system during the reporting period to begin \nproviding light covers to youth on February 6, 2023. These will be made available to youth \nwho earn a Behavior Grade of A or higher. These will only be provided in units with wall \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 4 of 47\n \nmounted lights. The facility recognized that many youths prefer a muted light, especially \nat night, and this provides an opportunity for youth to earn this incentive on a weekly basis. \n  \nDefendants should be commended for their continuing commitment to improving the physical \nplant which improves the daily lives for staff and youth. The Monitor will continue to update the \nCourt on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and \nstaff.  \nEducation Observations \nThe physical appearance of the school areas and classrooms were beautiful as usual. The Monitor \nwas happy to see that youth were in class in the school.  Other than youth on stages 1 and 2 of \nKrueger and Wells, youth returned to the school on January 30, 2023. The majority of youth were \nengaged in the classrooms.  Staff repeatedly commented how happy they are that youth are more \nregularly going to the school for education.  \n \nHowever, SDP (Wells and Krueger units) do not have education in the school building unless they \nare on Step 3.  Through video review, the Monitor observed youth in the school area on most days \nin January 2023, but numbers varied during the earlier months of this reporting period.  When \nshort staffing leads to periods of operational confinement, school is then provided on the living \nunit through a combination of direct instruction, workbooks, learning packets, and Edgenuity (an \nonline education program). The problem with this approach is that youth do not have access to live \nin-person instruction and interactions with subject matter teachers are severely limited. Youth \ncontinue to complain that they do not like this format and are not learning as well as they were \nwhen education took place in the school area and all in-person with teachers present in every class \n(not Edgenuity). When youth are on computer restrictions due to accessing inappropriate material \nor intentionally breaking their Chromebooks, their education consists of self-taught lessons in \nworkbooks.  For the youth who get to go to the school building, it is unclear how much live in-\nperson teaching versus computer-based youth receive, but some youth continued to complain to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel about education even once they returned to the school building. Nevertheless, \nmoving back to the classroom with more access to direct teacher-led instruction is a large step \nforward.  \n \nAs  mentioned  in  previous  reports,  Defendants  engaged  three  consultants  to  evaluate  the \neducational programming at  LHS/CLS. The education consultant’s report was finalized and \nreviewed.  The report indicated similar concerns as those raised by the youth, Plaintiffs’ Counsel, \nand the Monitor, including education on the units instead of in the school, overuse of Edgenuity, \nand needed improvements to services and resources for youth with disabilities, with reading \ndifficulties, or with other special education needs. Upon receipt of the consultant’s final report, the \neducation department began evaluating the recommendations in order to prioritize its components \nand develop an implementation strategy that ensures compliance standards are met. The education \ndepartment has continued to work closely in association with CESA-9 with regard to the report’s \nrecommendations specific to SPED resource provision, working to develop strategies that will \nensure compliance with the relevant provisions of the consent decree while also striving to \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 5 of 47\n \ncomplete accompanying educational benchmarks identified in the report not specified there.  \n \nIn addition, youth on the first two steps of the programming at Krueger and Wells (which are at \nleast three weeks long) only have education on the units. This is frequently only with Edgenuity, \nwhich many of the youth do not believe helps them learn.  Further, youth are expected to learn on \ntheir own for the half of each day they are confined to their rooms – something that youth raised \nas a concern to Plaintiffs’ counsel. In addition, while there are some teachers on the units, youth \nonly have access to the teachers outside of their room doors if they come during the half of the day \nwhen the youth are operationally confined to their rooms.   \n  \nDuring the last reporting period, the schools worked to add language to the Teacher Supervisor \nposition description that made direct oversight of special education programming one of that \nposition’s primary responsibilities. This reporting period that recruitment was completed all the \nway through to an accepted offer, however the person accepting the position will not start until \nFebruary 2023 during the next reporting period. CLS graduated one student, holding the most \nrecent graduation ceremony on December 22, 2022. \n  \nHopefully, youth can have education daily in the school and off the living units and Defendants \ncontinue to implement the recommendations of the educational consultants.  \n \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each living unit that youth were housed in during the site visit (Krueger, Wells, \nKing, Hughes, Miller, Rogers, and Roosevelt). Overall, the units and youth rooms, halls, living \nunit area, closets, and bathrooms were much cleaner than during the last visit. Youth were \nrespectful and playful when interacting with the Monitor.  \nThe unit populations ranged from one (1) (one CLS unit) to fourteen (14) (LHS) youth.  The \nMonitor saw staff engaging with youth more often during this site visit. In the last report, the \nMonitor reported that staff did not interact as much with youth because they were very busy trying \nto complete their duties such as meal preparation, movement, safety-welfare checks, counts, and \ncompleting documentation. Staff seemed less stressed and were regularly engaging with youth.  \nStaff attitudes were just as positive as the last site visit.    \nAll the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and willingly communicated with the \nMonitor. The complaints the youth made to the Monitor were not liking the new behavioral \nmotivation program (2 youth) and not liking the food (10 youth). The youth made several complaints \nto Plaintiffs’ counsel which are described below. The Monitor had an opportunity to talk to many of \nthe youth present in the day rooms.  \nSince the time onsite for the Monitoring visit is limited, the Monitor always reviews video of the \nliving units on random days and times to get a better idea of what youth and staff do on the units \nand whether staff are positioned near youth and interacting with youth in a positive way.  The \nMonitor reviewed video during the reporting period (random days and times) to view living units, \nschool, outdoor recreation, and other activities.  In every instance (30 video reviews) staff were \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 6 of 47\n \nengaged with youth when they were out of their rooms doing a variety of activities such as: \n•  Eating with youth at the tables \n•  Watching television with youth \n•  Playing cards with youth (often) \n•  Unit staff helping youth with schoolwork \n•  Youth playing basketball in the gym \n•  DBT Group  \n•  Youth in classrooms \n•  Grandparent program visiting taking place \n•  Youth and staff were in the music lab on several days (LHS/CLS youth) \n•  Youth were observed on telephones,  arts and crafts,  various  recreation,  prepping for \nshowers and meals \n•  Youth and staff were cleaning \n•  Staff processing with youth after a Zoom call \n•  Youth participating in a unit group activity \n•  Medicine pass \nOn review of video, staff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables with youth. The \nbody language and tone were positive from staff and youth in general on video. The Monitor did \nnot observe mental health on unit in any of the videos and the Monitor observed fewer structured \nactivities.  The Defendants do need to work on increasing meaningful and structured programming. \nHopefully, as staffing numbers increase, this will be feasible.  \nDuring this site visit, the CLS youth were housed in the Wells and King Units. There were five (5) \nyouth total in CLS. CLS units and youth rooms were cleaner than at the last site visit.  Two (2) girls \nwere in SDP with one of the youths on Level 3. Youth were in school and in group during the site \nvisit, so the Monitor was only able to speak to one CLS youth.   \nThe LHS youth were housed on Krueger, Rogers, Hughes, Miller, and Roosevelt. At the time of \nthe site visit, the units had adequate direct-care staffing.  All units were extremely clean and \norganized.  Two (2) youths were in their rooms in LHS voluntarily. Six (6) youth were in their \nrooms in operational confinement on Krueger due to the split schedule.  Other youth on the units \nwere standing or sitting, talking, playing cards, cleaning, and/or eating.   Youth were very chatty \nand happy.  \n \nThe Krueger and Wells living units operated as the Skills Development Programs (“SDP”) at LHS \nand CLS respectively during this reporting period. The Krueger and Wells units are considered the \n“High Risk” Units. The SDP is modified programming for youth who have engaged in physically \naggressive behavior, have presented a danger to others, and/or exhibited behavior that caused a \nmajor disruption to the facility.  \n \nAs previously reported, DBT is provided to youth in the SDP incorporating individualized \nplanning along with the in-person group work already assigned to youth in the SDP so that they \nare engaging in DBT skills and receiving feedback on a daily basis. Youth assigned to the SDP \nhave a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by PSU in order to specifically address their behavior. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 7 of 47\n \nYouth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in conjunction with their \nweekly Growth Team. \n \nThe Defendants have not been able to follow the daily schedule on days with staffing shortages.  \nKrueger and Wells SDP continued to operate primarily on a two-group schedule seven days per \nweek throughout the reporting period. However, Wells has operated in one group since January 4, \n2023.  \n \nUnder the current program, youth in SDP have the same property as any other youth on Level D.  \nHowever, youth are confined more, visit the school building less (if not on step 3), have less access \nto personal property and higher end hygienic materials.  The Monitor heard from Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel that the program and property restrictions in Krueger and Wells are consistently two major \ncomplaints youth have.  \n \nThere needs to be a focus on creating additional activities for all youth while operationally \nconfined- even youth in the SDP. The Monitor is happy that Defendants did provide the basketball \nhoop and stress ball to youth on SDP. However, additional activities for youth are especially \nimportant in Krueger and Wells considering these youth are confined twice as much as general \npopulation units. Defendants need to think of alternatives to having two groups for operational \nconfinement on Krueger so that youth are not disproportionally operationally confined. Some \nsuggestions are dividing the unit or having two units operate SDP in LHS.  \n \nAlso, on days when there is adequate staff, Defendants need to focus on following a daily schedule \nthat provides for structured and meaningful activities and accountability (off the unit as much as \npossible) to minimize the incidents of youth acting out and should ensure staff adhere to the schedule \nabsent an emergency.  Defendants also need to continue to focus on the new behavioral motivation \nsystem as it is already having a positive impact on the safety and security of the LHS/CLS. \n \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately twenty-eight (28) youth were interviewed during the site visit (formally and \ninformally) by the Monitor and approximately twelve (12) youth were interviewed extensively \nprior to and during the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel and several more informally during the tour.  \n \nIn  general,  youth  attitudes  were  extremely  positive,  and  youth  were  very  playful  with  the \nMonitoring team. Youth were much more talkative on this site visit.  They told the Monitor that \nthey are excited for the new phones, happy to be going to school, love the music lab, and they liked \nthe staff. As mentioned above, a couple of youth stated they did not like the new behavior \nmotivation system, and several did not like the food. Youth did not complain to the Monitor about \nhaving to be on “split” halls or being bored in their rooms.   \n \nMost youth did tell Plaintiffs’ counsel that things have improved over the last few months except \nfor youth in Krueger and Wells (SDP program). Specifically, youth outside of Krueger and Wells \nstated that they were out of their rooms more frequently, went to school more often, and there were \nfewer uses of force and that things are running more smoothly and safely. One youth told counsel \nabout a staff member using racist words towards him (this is being investigated by Defendants), a \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 8 of 47\n \nfew youths complained about uses of force that they thought was unwarranted and excessive, and \none youth reported that staff grabbed youth by their neck, and that a couple of staff seem to \nantagonize the youth. Many youths complained about the new behavior motivation system, not \nliking Edgenuity and in at least one case not liking school in the school building either, and that \nyouth on SDP were not getting incentives like youth on general population. Youth in Krueger \ncontinue to complain to Plaintiffs’ counsel about not being able to purchase better quality hygiene \nproducts. (It is important to note that none of the youth “purchase” higher hygiene items- they earn \nit through positive behavior). Although these youth do receive hygiene products, this is a persistent \ncomplaint that Defendants could remedy by adjusting the incentives in the program with respect \nto the higher end hygiene products. One CLS youth stated that staff touched her butt during a \nrestraint (whether intentional or accidental is unclear). The Monitor followed up with Defendants \nto see if there were grievances or PREA complaints regarding this and there were none. The \nMonitor did not watch every use of force that occurred during this reporting period, but in the ones \nreviewed, inappropriate touching was not observed. Defendants are investigating. Youth had more \nvaried and detailed complaints to Plaintiffs’ counsel than to the Monitor. \n \nThe Monitor observed inconsistency due to staffing challenges. When there were adequate staffing \nlevels, youth went to school, did recreation outside, were in music lab, in the Douglass recreation \nunit, and spent waking hours out of their rooms.  However, on days on which there were inadequate \nstaffing levels, youth mainly stayed on their unit and were operationally confining. LHS/CLS are \noften operating with only 50% of normal staffing levels.  \n \nIt is important that Defendants continually communicate the details of the new behavior motivation \nprogram and what the expectations are of youth and staff since this is a new program. It will take \ntime to fully implement with fidelity and consistency. Defendants need to make sure through a \nrigorous quality assurance process that the program is being implemented consistently and in \naccordance with training, policy, and procedure.  Defendants should continue to include the youths’ \nvoices for input and development of meaningful incentives and rewards through the youth council.  \nThe Monitor believes this new system of care will have a positive impact on the culture of the \nfacility and focus on youth’s positive behavior in time.  Although the Monitor saw a lot of positive \ninteractions with youth and staff, the Monitor continues to stress the need for more structured and \nmeaningful activities as youth idleness remains a significant concern, particularly on weekends and \nwhile staff availability is limited and when youth are confined in their rooms. While Defendants \noperationally confine, there need to be additional resources available to youth and more in-room \nactivities to engage youth- even for youth on Skills Development Program. The significant hiring \nin the youth counselor classifications and reduced population should provide more available staff \nwhich will result (and has resulted in the last couple of weeks) in youth spending more time out of \ntheir room, off units, and in the school area.  \n  \nDuring rounds of the units, the Monitor observed that most youth were in good spirits. Youth were \nin classrooms, eating lunch, talking on phone, playing cards, talking with each other, visiting with \nFoster Grandparents, and in various Groups.  \n \nThe Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more meaningful/structured \nprogramming and activities. Defendants are in the process of hiring six treatment specialists who \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 9 of 47\n \nwill assist in providing programming to youth. It is clear that when staff engage with youth, youth \nrespond positively. The Defendants need to continue to focus on gender-specific and culturally \ncompetent programming. As discussed later in this report, PbS data for CLS shows there is a need \nto evaluate the current training practices and determine if a need exists for additional gender \nspecific training in order to improve outcomes, particularly within the use of force, fear for safety, \nand de-escalation skills for staff working with the female population. \n \nIn January 2023, City of Milwaukee Common Council and the Mayor have approved the rezoning \nof the proposed site for a new juvenile correctional facility in the northwest part of the city.  Many \nmore remain, including approval to purchase the land for the new location and finalizing the \nbuilding design, before construction can even begin. As a result, completion of a new, Type 1 \njuvenile correctional facility in Milwaukee is still a few years away, and Lincoln Hills/Copper \nLake will not close as a juvenile facility until all youth have been moved to an appropriate \nplacement. Based on current population levels, the Milwaukee potential site will only be able to \nhouse about half of the youth. The Monitor has been made aware that under the Governor’s \nproposed 2023-25 State Capital Budget, an additional $32.6 million for the new Type 1 in \nMilwaukee, another $83 million for the construction of a second Type 1, and $4 million for the \nexploration of a possible site for a third Type 1 facility has been proposed.  \n \nAs previously mentioned, moving youth closer to locations where necessary cultural- and gender-\ncompetent programs and services are more widely available, and where family visits can be more \neasily accessible, will have a positive impact on youth and will allow for a larger pool of applicants \nto fill critical roles.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nOn many days, LHS/CLS had staffing shortages during this reporting period. Staff vacancies and \nleaves continue to be high during this reporting period at LHS/CLS and across DOC. On average, \nLHS/CLS is operating at 50% of staffing levels. Staffing shortages increase the burden on those \nwho work to maintain a safe and healthy environment for youth and staff. Defendants are working \ndiligently to try to attract and retain staff for these critical roles and have truly created significant \nincentives for new and existing employees in order to help with attracting new talent and retaining \ncurrent staff.  \nThe Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advance staffing vacancy percentages are higher than \nduring the last reporting period (see below).  The new youth counselors will have to finish the \nrequisite training thus, this increased staff should have a positive impact at LHS/CLS during the \nnext reporting period. There are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS. Approximately 138 of \nthese positions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”). \nThe teacher vacancy rate is the same as last reporting period (6 vacancies), or 32% of positions \nwhich is not the direction the Monitor hoped for.  With limited educators, Defendants will have \ncontinued difficulty with increasing the quality and quantity of education for youth. Social worker \nvacancies remain high at which at 64%. The percentage reduction this period is only due to the \nfact that Defendants reclassified a social worker position. This is a critical role that should continue \nto be a recruiting priority. Recruiting in general is still a challenge due to the location of LHS/CLS, \nuncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS will close, and for educators, the year-round school calendar \nand thus, hiring needs to continue.  Even with the added incentives, there is a still difficulty in \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 10 of 47\n \nhiring many classifications of staff. \n \n                                                                                                                                                             PYCTYCAooeooodsauuiuuvctntnt.ihh shose e ne rll  oorr   V424a108cM%%%an   a(((cr461yc4 1o h  Rouo 3utua     1ttot  e,ofo   2ff%3  01022 0)3a2 8)s  )  of V223a112Oc%%%acn   t(((oc266by0  ooe  Rouurutt a 3  toot1 eoff,    f21%2 98904)) 2a  )2s   of V233a224Jc%%%aann   (((uc296ay3  oor  Ruuoyttu a 3  toot1 efof,    f12%2 9980)4) 2a  )2s   of \nSocial Worker  67% (8 out of 12)  75% (9 out of 12)  64% (7 out of 11) \n \n \nSpecific efforts to recruit staff during this reporting period included: \n•  Wausau Job Center Walk-In Interviews \n•  Rhinelander Job Center Walk-In Interviews \n•  CLS/LHS specific Billboard  \n•  Current staff sharing job opportunities on social media \n  \nThe struggle to hire licensed/certified social workers continues and the vacancy rate remains high. \nSince the hiring of the CIRT Coordinator at the end of 2021, that position has worked to \nincorporate the combined efforts of CIRT’s aim with that of the Committee Assigned to Safety \nand Health (CASH) Team. The most recent quarterly meeting of LHS/CLS Critical Incident \nResponse Team (CIRT) was held in January. The meeting was aimed at rewarding the CIRT team \nmembers themselves for dedication over the last year steering the implementation of CIRT. The \nfirst half of the meeting addressed staff questions and concerns surrounding CIRT and welcomed \nfour additional staff added as they completed their required critical incident stress management \ntraining  in  December  and  January.  The  added  staff  included  an  additional  mental  health \nprofessional, a supervising youth counselor, a youth counselor and program and policy analyst \nwho will bring attributed to help strengthen the multi-disciplinary team. \n  \nDefendants continue to focus on staff wellness. Below are the employee wellness events occurring \nduring this reporting period: \n•  The Committee Assigned to Safety and Health (CASH) put on staff events throughout the \nreporting period. \n•  On Thanksgiving CASH team members came in and handed out treats at shift changes. \nThere was also a Chili contest followed by a chili dump the last weekend of November and \ninto the beginning of December. This occurred twice on November 30th and December 7th \nfor staff on each key in order to maximize participation. \n•  Leading up to Christmas, the facility held a baking contest and baking sale on two different \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 11 of 47\n \ndays to accommodate both work keys. To spread a little Holiday cheer on the bake sale \ndays staff were able to wear their most fun holiday sweaters. On Christmas Eve and New \nYear’s Eve the CASH committee came in and handed out treats to staff and thanked them \nfor working on the holiday and being away from family. \n•  Finally, on January 16th, CASH held a fan favorite amongst staff serving Mocha Chills \nacross shifts, an iced coffee drink that staff have said they enjoy in feedback to the \ncommittee. \nThe Monitor spoke to over twenty-seven (27) staff. Staff morale seemed very good overall at the \ntime of the site visit. A review of video over the reporting period showed staff regularly engaging \nwith youth. Staff were more talkative this site visit. \nThe PbS data for October 2022 reveals a significant improvement at LHS for fear for safety, \ndropping from 69.4% in April 2022 to 36.11%, slightly above the national average of 25.46%.  CLS \nshowed a slight improvement in reducing fear for safety, improving from 83.33% to 66.67%.  Both \noutcome measures reflect improvements in fear for safety concerns over previous data collection \ncycles.  \nDJC has continued to develop the facilities’ system of care model by developing and implementing \nanother one of its four core components- the behavioral motivation program, which also focuses \non a youth’s progress in their education and treatment plans. This model involves a focus on \npositive youth outcomes and an improved behavior motivation program. As stated in the last \nreport, the goal of the pilot for the new system of care was to develop a team atmosphere amongst \ngroups of living units, consistent post assignments, and to reduce overall ordering. Given current \nstaffing levels it was not possible to match each team with a single unit, so those teams were set \ninto four categories: LHS General Population; LHS Skills Development and Intake; CLS Skills \nDevelopment & General Population; and RRT/Control/School Patrol. Some auxiliary posts such \nas Care Team, Recreation and Visitation that were evenly distributed to balance out the teams. The \nMonitor recommends that this team approach extend to PSU and Education so that each living unit \nhas the same team working with them.  Moving the Supervisors office to the units helped create a \nteam dynamic and add additional support. The Monitor recommends that PSU staff also move to \nthe unit they are assigned in order to increase their support on the units.  When critical staff are \npresent and available on the units, overall safety and quality of life improves. The Monitor watched \nseveral videos of youth refusing to go to their rooms or refusing other staff directives and having \nPSU staff readily available on the unit could have resulted in a positive outcome.  \nThe Monitor is very supportive of this new system of care.   The “one team” approach has proved \nsuccessful in other jurisdictions.  Staff wellness has clearly improved over the last few monitoring \nperiods; however, staff fear for safety issues are higher than the PbS national field averages. \nImprovement in the fear for safety outcome measures is occurring.  CLS fear for safety continues \nto be a major factor.  Additional training for staff on gender specific needs, issues and approaches \nmay provide additional skills that could help reduce incidents of violence and reduce fear for safety \nconcerns.  Additionally, Defendants should analyze the data in CLS to identify the potential \ncontributors to the fear for safety. The Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff \nwellness a major focus moving forward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 12 of 47\n \nchanges to programming, and general information as well as sharing positive outcome measure \ndata. A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible and are properly \ntrained for the environment and youth needs. Improving staff wellness will certainly have a positive \nimpact on the overall atmosphere and reduce turnover, which will then provide an opportunity to \ndecrease the vacancy rate, reduce employee leaves and improve staffing ratios.  \nFacility Improvement Plan (“FIP”) Progress \nA thorough and in-depth review was conducted of the October 2022 PbS data collection for both \nLHS and CLS.  During the review, outcome measure data clarification and input was sought from \nboth the facility PbS State and Site Coordinators.  As a result of the review, the following highlights \nand outcomes are noted: \n \nLHS has one FIP open, #1012, which is focused on outcome measures Order 03 – Physical Restraint \nUse; Order 04 – Mechanical Restraint Use; and Order 13 – Isolation and Room Confinement Use.  \nThis FIP has been open since January 2021.  Each of the outcome measures are rated as improved \nand are below or better than the original goals set by the FIP.  \n \n(Note: The below charts reflect the original values or outcomes of each specific measure when the \nFIP was first developed and only focus on improving the outcomes measures identified within the \nbelow FIP’s.  The “current value” represents the outcomes during the most data collection period, \nin this case October 2022.  The “average value” represents the averages over several data collection \ncycles and since the FIP was first developed.) \n \nLHS FIP #1012: \nOriginal  Current  Average  Status \nOutcome Measure  Goal \nValue  Value  Value \nOrder 03 Physical restraint use per \n92.00  32.00  26.71  69.00 \n100 person-days of youth confinement.   \nOrder 04 Mechanical restraint use per   \n41.00  15.00  18.63 \n100 person-days of youth confinement.  30.00   \nOrder 13 Isolation, room confinement \nuse for reasons not related to behavior \n679.00  7.00  66.37  340.00 \nper  100  person-days  of  youth   \nconfinement. \n \nCLS has two FIP’s currently open, #1009 which focuses on outcome measures Order 08 – Isolation \nand Room Confinement.  This FIP was originally started in January 2019 and is marked as having \nworsened during the October 2022 data period and reflects improvement needed.  \n \nCLS FIP #1009: \nOriginal  Current  Average \nOutcome Measure  Goal  Status \nValue  Value  Value \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 13 of 47\n \nOrder  08  Isolation,  room \nconfinement, \nsegregation/special \n29.00  46.00  8.33  6.00 \nmanagement unit use per 100   \nperson-days  of  youth \nconfinement.  \n \nThe second FIP, #1011, was just recently developed and started July 2022 focusing on outcome \nmeasures Health 02; Health – 05; and Health 07.  As of the October 2022 data period, improvements \nhave been made on outcomes measures 02 and 05. Outcome measure 07 remains above the \nobjective goal. \n \n CLS FIP #1011: \n \nOriginal  Current  Average \nOutcome Measure  Goal  Status \nValue  Value  Value \n \nHealth 02 Percent of youths \npresented  for  admission  who \nhad a health intake screening  67%  100%  87%  75% \n \ncompleted by trained or qualified \nstaff in one hour or less. \nHealth 05 Percent of youths \npresented  for  admission  who \nhad  an  intake  screening \n67%  100%  79%  75% \ncompleted by trained or qualified   \nstaff in one hour or less from the \ntime of admission. \nHealth 07 Percent of youths \npresented for admission whose \nhealth  assessments  were \n83%  80%  90%  89% \ncompleted by trained or qualified   \nstaff 6 months prior to or within 7 \ndays from admission.  \nWith all that said, there are a couple of outcome measures that warrant discussion.  First and \nforemost, is what was unquestionably a high rate of “self-requested” confinement during previous \ndata collection cycles.  Prior data reflected 715 incidents of confinement use during the month of \nApril 2021 (610 @ LHS and 105 @ CLS).  Of these, there were a total of 621 for self-requested \nconfinement, representing 87% of all confinement for the facility during the month.  The outcome \nmeasures related to self-requested, or program refusals improved drastically over the course of \nseveral collection cycles. The April 2022 data shows improvement having reduced to (156) incident \nof confinement use at LHS and only (24) of those being recorded as self-requested or program \nrefusals. Similarly, CLS also shows dramatic improvement in overall confinement use having \nreported only (18) incidents, with only (4) having been the result of self-request or program refusal.  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 14 of 47\n \nDuring the October 2022 collection cycle, these trends continue to improve, falling well below the \nnational field average, having recorded only (79) incidents of isolation/confinement at LHS with \nonly (5) of those having been for program refusal or self-requested.  While the overall incidents of \nisolation/confinement at CLS increased to (48), none of those were recorded for the purposes of \nprogram refusal/self-requested.  \nAdditionally, the previous reports discussed that the unit activity record for the Krueger Unit \nreflected that youth were spending approximately 20.64 hours per day in their rooms (10.5 hours \nreflected as sleeping time and 10.14 hours reflected as “in sleeping rooms,” room confinement).  \nThe activity log for the Krueger Unit also did not reflect any hours for education.   The April 2022 \ndata showed Krueger youth spending approximately 11.90 hours in their rooms for “sleeping” time \nand 0.0 hours in their rooms for other reasons.  Education hours for Krueger youth increased to \napproximately 5.11 hours per day (weekdays) and leisure activity time decreased to 2.83 hours per \nday (weekdays). This represents a larger portion of their day that is spent in more meaningful \nactivities such as education.  However, the Monitor is still concerned with the quality and quantity \nof education and is hopeful that implementing the recommendations of the consultant will have \npositive results.  \nThese positive trends continued during the October 2022 data collection cycle with a couple of \nexceptions.  The time in rooms for “sleeping” increased to 12 hours per day in all units, including \nKrueger.  The education hours for youth on Krueger dropped slightly to 4.39 hours.  Education \nhours seems to have dropped on all units to just above 4.0 hours per day (weekdays). There also \nseems to be a data collection issues involving operational confinement or “in sleeping rooms” as \nno data was reported during the April and October 2022 data cycles even though the facility is \noperating on a split schedule in which some youths are being operationally confined due to staffing \nshortages  and  facility  operational  decisions.  The  Monitor  is  unable  to  verify  operational \nconfinement or quality check the data as it is not being tracked or provided on an individual basis. \nThis issue is further concerning as the facility was previously tracking operational confinement for \npurposes of PbS daily activity data collection. Defendants are developing the means to track \noperational confinement by youth utilizing the RFID System.  Once implemented, the Monitor \nwill be able to verify the operational confinement data.  \nWhile the Monitor recognizes these improvements, it is necessary for the facility to provide more \nmeaningful programs and activities to youth during weekday and weekend hours. While leisure \ntime activities decrease slightly during the weekdays, it remains high making up the bulk of youths’ \ntime out of rooms to as much as 8.50 hours per day weekends and 4.50 hours per day on weekdays. \nThis reflects a slight improvement from April 2022 which reflected 5.87 hours during weekdays \nand approximately 8.85 hours on weekends dedicated to leisure time. Reducing and replacing \nleisure time with more meaningful activities will have a positive impact on reducing incidents of \nviolence occurring during these periods of time. It should be noted that the Monitor believes this \nissue as well as the education hours decline has improved during the weekdays since the October \ndata collection as the facility returned to a full-day school schedule in January 2023. It is critical \nto have meaningful and structured activities at all times, but during the winter months especially \nwhen youth cannot go outside.  \nFinally, the Monitor encourages the facility to closely review all the PbS data and outcome measures \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 15 of 47\n \nas a means to better understand the impacts generated from the many changes occurring within the \nfacility.  Agency and facility leadership should make it a point to review the PbS data with staff at \nall levels, perhaps during monthly all staff briefing meetings or during shift changes on the units.  \nThis is an opportunity to show the positive outcomes being achieved through the various changes \nand efforts to reduce incidents of violence, confinement, and use of restraint. The data shows \nfluctuating trend lines, some moving in the right direction, while others are not. These fluctuating \ntrends can and should be expected as staff and youth adjust to the ever-changing behavior response \ntechniques and the skill level of staff in utilizing various training, de-escalation techniques, and, \nas discussed earlier, in the full implementation of the behavior motivation system.  \n \nPbS Critical Outcome Measures Review \n \nUse of Restraint Outcome Measures - Both LHS and CLS show “0” incidents of use of chemical \nagents (Order 6) since the October 2019 data collection cycle, which is commendable and per the \nSettlement Agreement.  The rates of physical restraint use (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use per \n100-person days of confinement) at LHS decreased during this data cycle to a rate of 1.48 and is \nonly slightly above the national field average rate of 1.24.  The rate of mechanical restraint (Order \n4 – Mechanical Restraint use per 100-person days of confinement) also declined during this rating \nperiod to a rate of 0.69, falling below the national field average rate of 0.86.   \n \nAt CLS, the rates of physical restraint use (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use per 100-person days \nof confinement) increased during this data cycle to a rate of 5.51, which is well above the national \nfield average rate of 1.24.  The rate of mechanical restraint (Order 4 – Mechanical Restraint use per \n100-person days of confinement) also increased significantly during this rating period to a rate of \n3.58, again well above the national field average rate of 0.86.   \n \nAs mentioned earlier, PbS is a continuous facility improvement process which involves complex \noperational issues.  The following two charts reveal that both physical and mechanical restraint use \nat LHS has improved, while the rate has increased significantly at CLS.  Improvement in reducing \nyouth  idleness  with  meaningful  programs  and  activities  along  with  an  improved  behavior \nmotivation program, and continued staff training, has had a significant impact on these outcome \nmeasures  at  LHS.  Assessing  and  providing  additional  training  for  staff  working  at  CLS, \nparticularly focused on gender-specific training, could have a positive impact on reducing and \nultimately improving these outcomes measures for the use of restraints at CLS. Gender specific \ntraining would help staff in responding to behavior issues in a manner that promotes de-escalation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 16 of 47\n \n \nOrder 03 \nPhysical restraint uses per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note: PbS defines Physical Restraints as facility authorized and trained holds used by staff to \nsubdue an otherwise uncontrollable youth in order to prevent the youth from injuring him or \nherself, or others.)   \n \nOrder 04 \nMechanical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n   \n \n(Note:  PbS  defines  Mechanical  Restraints  as  Mechanical  Devices  used  to  prevent  an \nuncontrollable youth from injuring him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints may only be \nused for short periods of time and must be used under medical supervision.) \nThe previous Monitoring reports discussed issues around the reduced use of the Care Teams which \nhad resulted in a higher number of restraint-usage incidents.  The overall trends for Outcomes 3 and \n4 continue to show positive improvements, even with the noted increases above at CLS. Given the \noverall positive reductions in the use of physical and mechanical restraints during this PbS cycle, it \nappears the heightened focus on Care Teams has had a positive impact.  Care Teams are designed \nprecisely to reduce the need for the use of restraints and have been effectively shown to work at \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 17 of 47\n \nfacilities across the country and have been shown to be effective at LHS and CLS as well. The \nAgency and facility should continue to expand the use of the Care Team concept and ensure that \ndirect care staff are training to properly use the Care Team as a de-escalation and use of restraint \navoidance response.  It is critical that direct care staff develop skills around total awareness in order \nto recognize the early signs of pending behavior and incidents in order to engage the Care Team \nmembers at the earliest possible opportunity.  This in turn increases the opportunities for de-\nescalation and resolution of situations without the use of restraint. It is imperative that Care Team \nmembers not be involved in the use of physical restraint of a youth except in exceptional situations \nand only to protect the safety and welfare of others as this is counterproductive to the concept and \ndoes not permit the youth to begin de-escalating if they believe the Care Team member may still \nuse physical force against them. An enhanced CARE Team approach to include building direct care \nstaff skills in de-escalation techniques for the female population would certainly be beneficial in \nreducing the use of restraint practices at CLS.  \nThe Defendants should continue to implement the core principles of the Care Team model by utilizing \nan agency strategic plan process that involves additional staff training in de-escalation techniques; \ninclude Care Team deployment information in shift debriefings in order to review the process and \nprovide on-going situational training for staff;  implement a Care Team response incident report that \nalso reflects the outcome of the response in order to better track outcomes from Care Team \ndeployments; implement the S.O.D.A.S model (Situation, Options, Disadvantages, Advantages, \nSolution) into the Care Team model; and, finally, the facility leadership team should incorporate \ndaily/weekly review of all use of force/restraint incidents to evaluate if and when the Care Team \nshould have been activated to help de-escalate a situation.  This should be used as a staff training and \nawareness process to help staff build new skills and to help change their mindsets in how they first \nreact to certain types of youth behaviors. \nIsolation, Room Confinement and Segregation Measures – Overall, there are fluctuations in the PbS \noutcome measures around isolation and room confinement for the October 2022 cycle, reflecting \nthat 100% of room confinements are terminated in under eight (8) hours at CLS and 87.50% at \nLHS.  CLS also shows 95.65% of confinements ending in under four (4) hours, with approximately \n84.72% ending in under four (4) hours at LHS.   Order 13 – Isolation, room confinement use for \nreasons other than behavior reflects decreases at both LHS and CLS for this data period with CLS \nhaving recorded (2) incidents for a rate of 0.55 and (7) recorded at LHS for a rate of 0.32, both of \nwhich reflect rates much better than the national field average rate of 3.07. \nLHS showed reduced  rates of  behavior related  confinement practices, while CLS showed a \nsubstantial rate increase (see Order 8 Charts below).   Both facilities also show dropping below the \nnational field average for incidents of confinement NOT related to behavior, Order 13 (i.e., \noperational confinement).  However, as previously stated, it should be noted that while operational \nconfinement data shows “0” incidents of operational confinement during both the April and October \ndata collection periods, this data point is misleading as more recent operational practices resulting \nfrom the staffing challenges have substantially increased operational confinement resulting from \nthe “split” schedule.  The facilities are not currently tracking operational confinement in a manner \nsufficient for the Monitor to verify or quality assurance check these data points as necessary for \ncompliance per the Judgment.  \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 18 of 47\n \n \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, segregation/special management unit use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n   \n \n(Note:  PbS defines confinement as any instance when a youth is separated from the youth \npopulation and placed in a room or cell alone for 15 minutes or longer. Youths are considered to \nbe confined from  the moment they are separated from others until they have rejoined the \npopulation. Youths may be transferred to a designated unit for confinement (e.g., a segregation \ndorm or program separation unit). Confinement may occur in locked or unlocked rooms but cannot \noccur in large dormitories. Any instance of confinement of 15 minutes or more is a reportable PbS \nincident event.) \n \nOrder 13 \nIsolation, room confinement use for reasons not related to behavior per 100 person-days of youth confinement.  \n \n   \n \nBoth LHS and CLS have dramatically reduced incidents of self-separation and program refusals to \nlevels well below and better than the national field averages. However, the Monitor has concerns \nregarding the quality of the data for use of confinement for purposes related to Mental Health and \nConsequences for rule violations as the data reflected in PbS reflect only (1) Mental Health related \nplacement at LHS and (0) at CLS during the October 2022 data cycle.

Much can be learned from review of these outcome domains and the data \nassociated with them, in particular those focused on youth and staff relationships.   \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nThe Quality Assurance Program at LHS/CLS is second to none.  When the Monitor first came to \nLHS, she showed leadership examples from several other jurisdictions to use as a potential model.  \nThey have now far exceeded expectations.  DJC has a program that other jurisdictions should \nmodel. Critical information is readily available to the leadership which allows them to make \nproactive, data driven decisions that increases the safety of youth and staff.  Again, continuous \nimprovements have been made in data collection and in the quality assurance program.  \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and \nDOC Chapter 373 forward. The committee has completed another round of revisions to the draft \nof Chapter 376.  This included incorporating aspects that coincide with the new behavioral \nmanagement system and current treatment model.  The Committee is scheduled to meet with DJC \nManagement team for a final review of the chapter, then it will be sent to the Office of Legal \nCounsel and sent to the Secretary for approval.  \n  \nChapter 376 final draft has been completed by DJC’s Administrative Code committee, approved \nby the Secretary, and most recently reviewed by the Legislative Reference Bureau.  The committee \nthen reviewed and incorporated LRB’s feedback, moving the chapter toward public commenting \nperiod. DJC’s advancement of both DOC Chapter 373 and DOC Chapter 376 during the reporting \nperiod represents continued progress moving these two Chapters forward. \n \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 27 of 47\n \nPolicy and Procedure Update \n \nThe DJC Policy Committee continues to review and update policies of note to the facility.  In the \nOctober meeting, the committee reviewed the following policies which will allow for further \nreview of facility procedure in the coming months: \n \n1) 300.02.15 – Youth Property \n2) 300.04.03 – Incentives  \n3) 300.05.24 – Internal and External Communications System for Emergencies  \n  \nWith the assistance of a new Program and Policy Analyst focused on PbS and Policy, the facility \nhas continued to review facility procedures in conjunction with the Division’s policy committee \nprocess. The coordination between the facility and division policy committee will continue to \nexpand throughout this year and this has already allowed for the following procedures to be \nreviewed since the position was filled. \n  \nThe following were reviewed and signed this period: \n  \n900.03.02 - Timesheets \n900.03.03 - Reporting Unscheduled Absences \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nyouth are being confined for seven days for any reason.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nyouth are being confined for three days for any reason.  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 28 of 47\n \n \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Defendants need to continue to \nexamine use of all forms of confinement and review incidents to ensure that staff are not \nusing any form of confinement as punitive confinement.  The Monitor QA’d whether youth \ncame out of their room for administrative confinement at the time indicated in reports. Out \nof fifteen (15) reviews, all youth came out at the time indicated in documentation. This is a \nsignificant improvement from the last reporting period.   Defendants are close to being in \nsubstantial compliance. \n \n2.  Administrative  Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of AC was significantly \nlower for both CLS and LHS (3 month look back). There was one youth confined over four \n(4) hours in this reporting period. Defendants need to continue to assess how they can more \neffectively provide intensive mental health services for youth \n.\n \n \nJuly 2022 \nCLS: 35 uses of A.C. Average 132 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 17 uses of A.C. Average of 138 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nAugust 2022 \nCLS: 43 uses of A.C. Average 144 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 95 uses of A.C. Average of 184 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nSeptember 2022 \nCLS: 33 uses of A.C. Average 144 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 47 uses of A.C. Average of 158 minutes. Two (2) youth over four hours.  \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 29 of 47\n \n \nOctober 2022 \nCLS: 40 uses of A.C. Average 153 minutes. Two (2) youth over four hours. \nLHS: 53 uses of A.C. Average of 307 minutes. Seven (7) youth over four hours.  \n \nNovember 2022 \nCLS: 22 uses of A.C. Average 134 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 19 uses of A.C. Average of 210 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours \n(22 hours). \n \nDecember 2022 \nCLS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 147 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 35 uses of A.C. Average of 172 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nJanuary 2023 \nCLS: 3 uses of A.C. Average 113minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 30 uses of A.C. Average of 151 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit. 98.62%- 99.89% of checks were completed within 30 minutes \nduring this reporting period. The Monitor reviewed video footage for random days and times \n(85  instances)  and  Defendants  were  100%  compliant  with  completing  the  checks  in \naccordance with policy. Staff did an outstanding job and should be commended for their \ndiligence in ensuring youth safety while in their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \npose a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) youth confined \nfor over four (4) hours during this reporting period (see response in previous question). This \nis a significant reduction from the last reporting period. \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring any form of room \nconfinement is compliant with this Court Order, draft  policy and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 30 of 47\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. One (1) youth was placed on \nextended placement in administrative confinement pending transfer out of the facility to \nLincoln County Sheriff’s Department.   \n \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to 8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.  \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  no  youths \nadministratively confined beyond 24 hours.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 is being utilized. The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. Only \nyouth who are in imminent risk of serious self-harm to themselves/risk of self-harm will be \nplaced in observation status. The Monitor will continue to review and monitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor would not deem any \nroom in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety and security \nmeasures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make the rooms \nmore suicide resistant. All youth are housed on renovated units. Youth rooms were the \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 31 of 47\n \ncleanest the Monitor has seen since appointed. The rooms were very organized allowing \nstaff to clearly see into the room, perform room searches more effectively, and ensure to \nthe extent possible that there are no dangerous items in room.   \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever,  based  on  the  language  of  this  section,  Defendants  will  be  in  substantial \ncompliance should this pattern continue.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, regular hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. Some \nyouth complained to Plaintiffs’ counsel (specifically youth on SDP) that they did not receive \nthe higher quality hygiene items that youth in general population can earn through the \nBehavior Motivation System.  The Monitor does recommend that the Defendants reconsider \nthe  inability  for  youth  on  SDP  to  earn  the  higher-level  hygiene  items  since  they  are \noperationally confined much longer than other units. The Monitor reviewed random video \nfootage of living units in evening hours and observed several instances in which youth were \ngiven access to the toilet upon request. Defendants have improved their documentation and \ndata collection.  \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin room confinement, staff shall engage in challenges intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible. PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants continue to properly \ndocument who from PSU was notified, time of notification, and the intervention technique \nutilized with the youth. Examples of the crisis intervention techniques used with youth when \nconfined can include, but are not limited to: processing of the incident, coping ahead/safety \nplans,  in  the  moment  skills  coaching/practice  of  DBT  skills  including  mindfulness, \nrecommitment to goals, validation, time away from stressors or time for reflection/refusing, \nfostering insight, implementation of established Youth Plan, assistance problem-solving, \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 32 of 47\n \nincrease self-awareness/awareness of body sensations as indicators, Behavior Chain Analysis \n(formal  and  informal)  and  Thinking  Report,  encourage  self-reflection/identify \nvulnerabilities,  consistent  redirection/limits,  Behavior  Intervention  Protocol  fostering \ninsight/skill identification/skill practice, and plans to address conflict/safety/skills practice. \n \nClinicians are on-site for 6 hours each Saturday and Sunday. Although Defendants state \nthat the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth, youth interviews and \nvideo reviews do not necessarily reflect this.  The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU \nincrease the hours in which they are physically present on weekends and evening hours in \norder to engage youth in a meaningful way during this time.  Because confinement can \ncreate or exacerbate mental health problems, treatment is going to be even more critical as \nthe population continues to remain higher if the Defendants are operationally confining- \nespecially on Krueger where youth are operationally confined twice as long as other units.  \nThe Monitor also suggests that specific PSU clinicians should work with the same youth in \norder to establish continuity (when possible) and should primarily work on the units. If \npossible, Defendants should consider putting PSU staff offices on the unit like they did with \nthe Supervisors’ offices.  This will reinforce to the youth and staff that they are “one team” \nservicing the youth and could be readily present to mitigate any situations.   \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  In  general,  documentation/data \nshows that evaluations are completed (if there is not already a mental health evaluation) \nwithin 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. The Monitor is told youth on \noperational confinement are being seen by PSU and evaluated for contraindication, but the \nMonitor has not seen documentation for youth on operational confinement and whether they \nare evaluated for contraindication.  Efforts to enhance the facility’s capability to track \nconfinement  data  utilizing  additional  staff  and  technology  resources  has  been  the \nundertaking of an additional program and policy analyst hired at the facility during the \nreporting period. The position was filled by a person with experience working directly with \nyouth as a YC and YCA, which will help bridge the necessary set of expertise and perspective \nin order to both coach and instruct line staff on the use and expectations for Guardian RFID \ndata collection, as well as integrate that data into the existing framework for quality \nassurance existing at the schools.  \n \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 33 of 47\n \nThere  were  no  instances  of  contraindication  documented  during  this  review  period. \nDefendants need to ensure that they are meeting the criteria in this section and document \nany and all room confinement including operational room confinement.  \n \n     e.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant to \n  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log   kept for that \npurpose. Staff who fail to make such checks or who  falsify such records may be \nsubject discipline. Any youth placed in   room confinement for any period \nin excess of 24 hours shall   receive  daily  contact  with  a  mental  health \nprovider. This contact   shall  be  face-to-face  unless,  due  to  staffing \nlimitations, no PSU staff is personally available, in which case it may occur by \nphone or video conferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants were between 98.54%- \n99.55% compliant with meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe. \nQuality assurance measures are in place and when necessary, formal investigations occur. \nThere were no formal job instructions for not completing safety and security checks. The \nMonitor observed safety/wellness checks being completed on various days/times on every \nunit during this reporting period and observed no instances in which staff did not make \nvisual contact with youth per policy- 100% of the checks were compliant. Staff met or \nexceeded the 30-minute timeframe, looked into room, and the intervals were staggered.  \n \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time on evenings and weekends doing groups \nand having one on one sessions with youth. The Monitor also recommends that PSU staff, \nlike Supervisors, have offices on the unit and work with the same youth when possible.  \nUnlike during the last site visit, when the monitor was reviewing unit activity via video on \nrandom days and time, PSU was not observed providing youth with services.  This is not to \nsay that PSU are not providing services, but it seemed less prevalent than last period’s review \nof video.  \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \ne.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 34 of 47\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Youth  continue  to  complain  to \nPlaintiff’s  counsel  about  property  restrictions  while  in  the  SDP.  This  is  an  area  that \nDefendants need to re-examine. The Monitor was happy to see that the youth were provided \nwith the basketball hoops and balls, but Defendants should consider adjusting SDP especially \nbecause youth are in operational confinement twice as long as general population youth. The \nMonitor understands the programming on SDP, but while youth are having to be confined \nthrough no fault of their own- there should be accommodations made. Youth in SDP do not \nget the same property as youth in general population which is not consistent with this \nrequired  provision.  Additionally,  while  youth  are  on  operational  room  confinement, \nregardless of level or being on SDP, the Monitor recommends that youth be provided with \nactivities to do that would encourage physical movement in rooms, arts, crafts, music etc.  \nBased on the Monitor’s recommendation, beginning the end of February 2023, youth on SDP \nwill transition to level “C” from “D” affording youth with better hygiene products and fans. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general.  It is difficult to assess whether \nthese services are being provided while youth are in operational room confinement because \nDefendants do not track operational room confinement time per youth. The vacancy rate for \nsocial workers continues to be extremely high (67%). Social workers are critical to quality \nof care and services for the youth and effective re-entry planning.  \nDefendants need to ensure there is accountability with respect to the services provided by \nthe social workers, mental and healthcare workers.  \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants moved to smaller group-\nbased  treatment  to  youth  where  group  participation  was  provided  on  the  units.  This \ncontinues. Beginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group \ntreatment sessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule. The \nMonitor continues to encourage these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as \npossible. During random video review and during the site visit, the Monitor saw these \nservices being provided.   \n   \nDefendants need  to  continue  to  focus  (document  and  QA)  on providing  rehabilitative \nprogramming  that  was  scheduled/in  process  before  placement  in  room  confinement \nincluding operational confinement. Defendants need to ensure that any missed/rescheduled \ntreatment groups do not negatively impact a youth’s progress. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 35 of 47\n \n \n  \niii.         Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices. Defendants shall ensure special education services \nfor all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. When short staffing leads to periods \nof operational confinement, education is then provided on the unit through a combination of \ndirect instruction, workbooks, learning packets, and Edgenuity. On January 31, 2023, youth \nbegan going down to the school area including SDP youth on Level 3 (SDP youth on Levels \n1 and 2 complete their educational instruction on the living unit). Youth were in school during \nthe site visit and the Monitor saw youth more regularly in school during random video reviews.  \nSome youth also had difficulty learning through Edgenuity. Youth did computer and packet-\nbased work alone in their rooms when they were being operationally confined.  Youth told \ncounsel that they could not meaningfully learn because of these actions and did not like being \non the unit for class. In addition, youth who were put on computer restriction because of \ndamage to their tablets told Plaintiffs’ counsel that they had essentially no education while \nin confinement. \n \nThe  education  consultants  completed  their  report  which  included  recommendations.  \nDefendants are working on implementing many of the recommendations. There needs to be \nmore instruction by teachers and not self-instruction or instruction on Edgenuity, more \nassistance for students with disabilities or reading problems, and mor education in the school \narea which is more representative of a typical educational setting in the community.  \n \nAs stated previously in this report, the PbS education data from October 2022 – before the \nsignificant confinement changes in this reporting period – shows youth are receiving about \n4.16 hours per day (weekdays) of education at LHS and 4.54 hours per day (weekdays) of \neducation at CLS.   \n \nThe  Monitor  continues  to  suggest  that  Defendants  should  provide  more  art,  music, \nwoodworking, the greenhouse, welding, and sewing and other types of programs to youth in \nthe evening and on weekends The Monitor was happy to see during the site visit and through \n.\nrandom video review that during this reporting period, youth were able to access many of \nthese programs when staffing allowed. The youth expressed how much they like these \nactivities to the Monitor.  The Monitor understands that with the staffing challenges and \nmovement  freezes,  these  types  of  programming  are  difficult  to  continue.  However, \nDefendants need to think of other activities to do while on the unit when it is necessary to \nkeep youth on their units for safety reasons.  This is especially true for youth who are \noperationally confined who have nothing to do for the several hours a day.  Defendants have \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 36 of 47\n \nbegun asking youth and staff for ideas of activities while in their rooms.  Defendants provided \nsome of their recommendations such as stress balls and additional art supplies.  However, \nthe Defendants should continue to focus on bringing more programming into LHS/CLS, \nespecially culturally and gender relevant programs. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. When staffing is not an issue, youth \nare regularly out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. However, this is not the case during \nthe  time  Defendants  operationally  confined  youth  due  to  staffing  challenges. Youth  in \noperational  confinement,  isolation  due  to  Covid-19  safety  measures,  any  confinement \nrequired, and youth working on the BIP do not participate in regular social interaction. \nAdditionally, general population youth are not going to the school area for education unless \nstaffing levels allow (although improved in February).  Youth on SDP Levels 1 and 2 do not \ngo to the school area for education area.  Monitor regularly saw youth conversing with other \nyouth during out time when the youth were on the units in the day room.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were eighteen (18) \ndocumented instances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on \nsubstantial threat of physical harm during this reporting period. Defendants are able to \ntrack when youth eat meals in their rooms and based on reports that the Monitor reviewed, \nit appears these instances were justified.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  facility  continues  to \noperationally confine youth on varied dates due to staffing shortages.  However, this necessity \noccurred much less frequently in January-February 2023.  \n \nFor the safety of youth and staff, Krueger and Wells SDP continued to operate primarily on \na two-group schedule seven days per week throughout the reporting period. However, Wells \nhas operated in one group since January 4, 2023. Documentation of the youth who are subject \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 37 of 47\n \nto operational confinement began in May. Since then, DJC has tracked and documented the \nuse of operational confinement and the reason for its necessity. This documentation has been \nmaintained and provided with the materials produced for the 10th of the month reports. \n \nEfforts to enhance the facility’s capability to track confinement data utilizing additional staff \nand technology resources has been the undertaking of an additional program and policy \nanalyst hired at the facility. The position was filled by a person with experience working \ndirectly with youth as a YC and YCA, which will help bridge the necessary set of expertise \nand perspective in order to both coach and instruct line staff on the use and expectations for \nGuardian RFID data collection, as well as integrate that data into the existing framework \nfor quality assurance existing at the schools.  \nDefendants do not track this on an individual basis, so the Monitor cannot determine how \nmany youths are not getting at least 3 hours of out-time per day or 30 hours per week. \nDefendants are tracking groups of youth per unit based on scheduling.  According to their \ndata, only two (2) youth did not receive thirty (30) hours of “out time.”  Once the RFID can \ntrack this on an individual bases, the Monitor will be able to more accurately assess this \nprovision.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals. Within one hour of a youth's placement in \nroom confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. A few forms did not have the box checked \nthat youth were notified of their right within 15 minutes. During the reporting period, the \nquality assurance and policy staff worked to make a series of changes to the DOC forms \nutilized for documenting this provision. In the interim, the DOC-1844 Youth Statement still \nrecords that the youth was informed of their rights to grievance and appeal orally within 15 \nminutes, and on paper within one hour. This provision’s completion is quality assured by \nrequiring the youth’s signature acknowledging receipt of the notifications, or in the event of \nthe youth’s refusal to acknowledge receipt, two staff signatures bearing witness to the youth \nhaving been provided the notification of rights.  \n \nStaff have been working to transition the checkbox denoting that the notification of rights \nwas properly completed, along with the youth’s signature or the signatures of the witness \nupon a youth’s refusal, currently on the DOC-1844 to the DOC-2942 AC Notification of \nRights.  \n \nThe DOC-2942A was developed and moved into J-Tracker operation designed to draw the \nrequired information for the written report directly from the incident debrief form, as soon \nas the SYC overseeing the incident has completed their required fields for a major incident. \nOnce the SYC has completed their required fields, a response assignment can be generated \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 38 of 47\n \nby the SYC to the unit staff where the youth on AC is housed. Upon receipt of the response \nassigned, unit staff are then able to generate the DOC-2942A and deliver it to the youth. \n \nThe new process and forms have been drafted into an updated Incident Debrief procedure. \nNext steps will require finalizing the debrief procedure, then reinforcing the notification of \nrights process update while staff work to operationalize delivery of the required written AC \nsummary report to the youth.  Youth who are confined due to staffing issues are not given \nthese notifications of rights.  \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \nconsistently except in cases of operational confinement, including when less restrictive \nmeans  were  attempted.  Documentation,  data  collection  and  reliability,  and  quality \nassurance (with video review) needs to continue especially for AC. Also, documentation \nneeds to be created that prove a youth was promptly provided with the report upon the \ncompletion of room confinement including operational room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan. Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 39 of 47\n \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    The  Monitor  did  not \npersonally see any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit. Data and documentation \nshow that there was significant decrease in use of mechanical restraints for both LHS and \nCLS. The Monitor reviewed several uses of force videos in which Defendants in the past \nwould use mechanical restraints but did not now.  \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regain control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Below  is  the  number  of \nmechanical restraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \n \nJun 2022:                         8 uses  \nJuly 2022:    13 uses \nAugust 2022                  10 uses \nSeptember 2022:           11 uses   \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \nNovember 2022:               1 use \nDecember 2022:              4 uses \nJanuary 2023:                 3 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \n \nJun 2022:                       15 uses  \nJuly 2022:      6 uses \nAugust 2022                   10 uses \nSeptember 2022:           16 uses  \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \nNovember 2022:    4 uses \nDecember 2022:              2 uses \nJanuary 2023:                  1 use \n \nDefendants have significantly reduced the use of mechanical restraints in both LHS and \nCLS. \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 40 of 47\n \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when  ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE  THIS  REPORTING \nPERIOD. There were zero uses of restraints other than handcuffs during this reporting \nperiod.  Defendants have developed policy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were  zero uses of \nrestraints other than handcuffs during this reporting period.  They were ordered by \nsecurity staff as youth posed an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to \nothers. Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used. Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor has not observed \nmechanical restraints used for punishment/discipline on site visits, review of video, or \ndocumentation  reviewed.    The  mechanical  restraints  policy  and  a  subsequent  facility \nprocedure was finalized April 4, 2022. The Incident Debrief QA process, and the Use of Force \nReview  QA  process  updates  have  overlapped  to  provide  QA  staff,  POSC/MANDT \ninstructors, and facility administration a triple layered system for scrutinizing all uses of \nmechanical restraints.  \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 41 of 47\n \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. All safety staff equipped with \nmechanical restraints are trained specifically in the use of physical force, and restraints, and \non proper de-escalation techniques. Ongoing internal trainings like POSC refreshers are \ndepartment requirements for all safety staff, and that facility has invested to provide \nadditional systems trainings including Mandt and Verbal Judo as examples related to this \nspecific provision.  \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living \nunit.  No  youth  shall  be  left  alone  in  restraints.  Any  use  of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE FOR THIS PERIOD. There \nwere no instances of a youth being placed in mechanical restraints over 45  minutes. \nDefendants have created a QA process for this section. Defendants also need to ensure \ntherapeutic interventions occur when youth are mechanically restrained in excess of 45 \nminutes.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has \nbeen added to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been \nmodified. The length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is \nnow being documented as part of the Incident Debrief process.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 42 of 47\n \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possess drugs or weapons that could not \nbe discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There  were zero (0)  strip \nsearches in this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been \nfinalized. A Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all \nsupervisors to outline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under \nwhich a strip search may be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search.    \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause. Less intrusive searches, including using \na metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top \nor other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is conducted, \nunless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth that less \nintrusive  searches,  which  may  include  physical  contact,  would  cause \ngreater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There  were  zero  (0)  strip \nsearches this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis  reporting  period.  It  was  conducted  in  a  private  area.  QA  has  been  developed. \nContraband was in fact found. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There  were zero (0)  strip \nsearches during this reporting period. No youth was near the youth being strip searched.  \nQA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 43 of 47\n \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nconducted this reporting period. The staff conducting the strip search was the same gender. \nQA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis period the staff conducting the search was trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE. There  were zero (0) strip \nsearches during this reporting period. Staff was aware of the mental health status prior to \nthe search as youth regularly attempts to self-harm. Staff did find contraband that could \nhave  been  used  in self-harm.  Documentation has  improved.  Policy  and  procedure/QA \ndeveloped.  \n \n4.       Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants do provide de-\nescalation training to new and current staff.  All safety staff are trained specifically on proper \nde-escalation  techniques  and  are  provided  with  additional  systems  trainings  including \nMandt and Verbal Judo. In addition to the internal refresher trainings all staff are required \nto maintain their POSC certification. Defendants should continue to focus on de-escalation \nskills.  The Monitor observed many instances in her review of video of staff attempting to de-\n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 44 of 47\n \nescalate youth. Additionally, staff are receiving the new Mandt de-escalation and physical \nintervention training, which once fully implemented, should have a positive impact on further \nreducing the use of restraints. The Mandt verbal de-escalation concepts are invaluable in \ndealing with youth in crisis. The program helps build healthy relationships between direct \ncare staff and youth to better manage behavior and promote a healthy environment. \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Programming needs improvement \n(as discussed throughout this report) and idleness—which was already high especially during \ntimes of staff shortages.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth. Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \nto  further  reduce  youth  idleness  hours.  Defendants need  to  create  additional  in-room \nactivities for youth while they are being operationally confined.   \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018, \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants have implemented several initiatives to increase recruiting and retention. The \nMonitor recommends that a formal staffing assessment be completed.  A staffing assessment \nwill provide the jurisdiction with an updated analysis needed to properly maintain mandatory \nposts  for  each  facility  as  well  as  identify  any  specific  needs  based  on facility  designs, \npopulations,  and  staffing  ratio  needs  based  on  incidents  of  violence  and  other  unique \ncircumstances to each facility. Staffing assessments also take into consideration the average \nleave usage for all types of leave used on an annual basis, to include vacations, sick leave, \nWorker’s Compensation, FMLA, and leave associated with annual training.  Ensuring that \neach facility has the appropriate number of FTE’s to effectively manage the facility also has \na direct impact on staff wellness and reducing fear for safety concerns.   As stated in previous \nreports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts the overall culture, atmosphere, and \nenvironment of the facility. Staff wellness has a direct impact on the relationship between \nyouth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, use of restraint, reduces employee \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 45 of 47\n \nleave/vacancies, and the use of isolation and confinement.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments  to  administrative  code.  Defendants  will  make  all  reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  DJC’s  Administrative  Code \ncommittee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter 373 \nforward. The committee has completed another round of revisions to the draft of Chapter \n376.  This included incorporating aspects that coincide with the new behavioral management \nsystem and current treatment model.  The Committee is scheduled to meet with DJC \nManagement team for a final review of the chapter, then it will be sent to the Office of Legal \nCounsel and sent to the Secretary for approval.  \n \nChapter 376 final draft has been completed by DJC’s Administrative Code committee, \napproved by the Secretary, and most recently reviewed by the Legislative Reference Bureau.  \nThe committee then reviewed and incorporated LRB’s feedback, moving the chapter toward \npublic  commenting  period.  DJC’s  advancement  of  both  DOC  Chapter  373  and  DOC \nChapter 376 during the reporting period represents continued progress moving these two \nChapters forward. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process. Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent. Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in the \nvast majority of cases absent weekends. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in \n45 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 46 of 47\n \nmajority of cases. When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is \na corrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). Defendants QA program is one of the best the Monitor has seen- \nsimply put, it is exceptional.  The QA team should be commended for all the hard work and \ndedication to creating an extremely robust system that has increased the safety for youth and \nstaff by allowing leadership to make proactive decisions and analyze many key data points \non a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.  \n            \nB.           Quality assurance. The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  As  discussed  throughout \nprevious reports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court \nOrder and to improve the quality of life for youth and staff. Defendants have created an \nexceptional quality assurance program and have developed daily data to review that will \nautomatically be available in order to make real time operational decisions.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe population is trending down and is lower than the last reporting period.  Staffing issues remain \nbut have improved due to the reduced population. During most of this reporting period, youth were \nstill being confined to their rooms, education was still occurring on the units on many days, youth \nreceived reduced outdoor recreation time on many days. However, it should be noted that towards \nthe end of the reporting period and into February, most youth went to school (except SDP units \nLevels 1 and 2) and there are/were many days where youth (outside of SDP units) were able to be \nout of their rooms 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. The new system of care/behavior motivation program was \nimplemented in August, and based on a review of data, has already had a positive impact on \nconditions of confinement for youth. The Monitor believes there should be some modifications for \nthe youth on SDP considering they are operationally confined twice as much as the general \npopulation.  The Monitor has been informed that some of the suggested modifications to the \nBehavior Motivation System for SDP youth has been implemented at the end of February 2023.  \n \nWhile operational confinement is not ideal, given the staffing challenges during many days in this \nreporting period, it does appear to be necessary in many instances.  The recommendations of the \neducational consultant should be implemented to improve the quality and quantity of education. It \nis critical that PSU have a bigger presence on the units as this can mitigate any incidents of violence \nand subsequent use of force.   \n \nLastly, as the Monitor continues to state in reports to the Court, there needs to be a focus on moving \nyouth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s) or diverting them from confinement entirely. \nThe Defendants have identified a space for a new facility.  Although the Monitor believes this will \ntake several years, it is a step in the right direction. Overall, the Monitor is very impressed with the \npositive changes and commitment by staff and leadership at LHS/CLS.  \n \n46 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 140   Filed: 03/08/23   Page 47 of 47\n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n \n47 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nFOURTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n  \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Third Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on July 1, 2019. The Monitor’s fourth \nreport  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree,  implementation  of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from  the third site visit which took place May 31, 2019. Any \ndocumentation or updates submitted after the conclusion of the fourth site visit will be addressed \nin the fifth report of the Monitor.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe fourth site visit by the Monitor took place on September 13 through September 15, 2019. The \nMonitor reviewed materials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit. \nMaterials included, but were not limited to: updated Krueger program handbook, grievances, \ncounselor logs, staff memos, daily shift reports, video footage of use of force incidents and activity \non unit, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this court order, unit rules, work rules, \nemployee leave data, employee corrective action reports, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical \nrestraint documentation, incident reports, other housing documentation, self-assessment report and \nsupporting  documentation  including  policy  drafts,  facility  enhancement  report,  and  various \nmeeting minutes. The Parties were present during the site visit. The Monitor took photographs, \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 2 of 28\n \ntoured LHS/CLS, and interviewed youth and staff. Approximately thirty-two (32) youth and \ntwenty-eight (28) staff were interviewed formally and informally by the Parties during this site \nvisit. \nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS \nPhysical Plant \nThe general areas of the facility were very clean and orderly.  The atmosphere was very calm \nthroughout LHS/CLS.  Youth and staff seemed much more relaxed and happy than in previous \nvisits. All of the landscaping has been completed and the outdoor space is very inviting. The \nmajority of the recommendations as to physical plant modifications made in previous Monitor \nreports and the February 2018 technical assistance report have been implemented or are in progress \n(described in more detail throughout this report). The etched glass issue has been resolved by \ninstalling new windows throughout the facility.  Several other physical plant improvements have \nbeen made including, but not limited to, permanently mounted security fans in living units, Hughes \nunit perimeter fence repaired, roof deterrent system in place, new boilers in living units, cottage \nexterior window replacement, and fixing of some drainage issues.  Additional projects not yet \ncompleted are the camera upgrade, electronic rounds tracking system, electrical upgrade, and \ninstalling a new generator.  The Monitor will continue to update the Court on physical plant \nimprovements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and staff.  There is still a \nsignificant amount of graffiti in Addams and Black Elk.  The Monitor gave suggestions for \ntracking, monitoring and accountability for graffiti. Defendants will need to continue to monitor \nand cover graffiti on an ongoing basis. \nPreviously, the Defendants informed the Monitor that there was a bid for painting the interior of \nthe cottages and a youth art program to further decorate the walls with murals and artwork. There \nare several new beautiful murals and art projects that have been completed since the last site visit \nand more are currently underway throughout the facility. Renovations have been completed on \none of the girls’ units (Wells), and the girls are now in the newly renovated unit as of June 6, 2019. \nDubois and Miller are also in the process of being renovated and this will continue throughout the \nfacility.  The renovations to date are exceptional.  \nIn general, youth rooms were cleaner (most beds were made) but the bathrooms remain messy and \ndirty.  However, several maintenance issues that were observed throughout the facility during the \nlast site visit which needed attention such as bathroom leaks, faucets running, and toilets not working, \netc.  have  been  addressed.  The  Monitor  recommended  including  incentives  around  the \nroom/bathroom cleanliness in the new behavioral management system.  Defendants have included \nthis in their behavior management system and Spring and Summer Clean Up contests have occurred, \nand other incentives are planned on a regular basis. Defendants have removed and/or secured items \nthat have been used by youth in disturbances and built barriers around areas containing these objects \nin order to create a safer environment. The Monitor recommended that searches of all buildings be \nconducted to remove excessive objects, materials, equipment, furniture, etc., to enhance the safety \nand security of the units/buildings and to maintain a more orderly and safe environment.  The process \nfor area and personal searches has been updated and is being documented electronically using J-\nTracker. The Monitor previously recommended that Defendants consider replacing existing furniture \nwith furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for secure environments and the secure \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 3 of 28\n \nfurniture has been piloted in a living unit. The Monitor also noted that one or more living units had \nsecurity bars on the exterior windows to prevent such disturbance and reduce the likelihood of a \ndisturbance or escape. Additional security enhancements on Krueger and other areas have been \nimplemented. There is a schedule for the removing of existing furniture and replacement with a goal \ncompletion date of June 2020. \nSchool/Living Units Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage and toured the school on Friday.  The Monitor recommended that \n“split hall” time be eliminated, and youth remain out in the day room during medicine pass, counts, \nand shift change. As of September 3, 2019, the Defendants have ceased doing confinement for these \nreasons throughout LHS/CLS.  Another notable change, which had been implemented starting on \nSept. 3, 2019, was that the units had moved to “open dayrooms” which allowed the youth to be \nout of their rooms from at least 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. This change generally seemed to improve youth \nmorale. \nThere was an awards assembly on Friday thus, the Monitor could not observe youth in school \nduring this site visit. Below, are the Monitor’s observations: \nThe Monitor saw the majority of staff engaging with youth. As stated above, there was an awards \nceremony for the “Summer Games” event that took place (which included all the boys’ units other \nthan Krueger).  Awards were given out for both LHS/CLS youth.  The Monitor observed the \nceremony for LHS youth. The staff were sitting with youth, youth were engaged, and it was a positive \natmosphere with no incidents taking place.  It was evident that this was a joyous event for staff and \nyouth which carried into a positive atmosphere throughout the entire day. Youth attitudes overall \nwere very good during this site visit.  All the improvements in the school area made prior to the last \nsite visit are still evident. The school had positive messages throughout, artwork displayed, names \nof youth on the honor roll were displayed, windows in classrooms were no longer covered so there \nwas a clear unobstructed view which increases safety for staff and youth and the school was very \nclean. The Monitor previously recommended that the Defendants hire an education expert to \ncomplete an assessment of the educational programming at LHS/CLS. The expert was retained and \nprovided initial observations. The expert plans to return in November to further assess the education \ndepartment’s operations and make specific recommendations. The Defendants did move the girls’ \neducational programming out of the main school and into a smaller building in the Copper Lake \nsection of the facility, with far fewer amenities and facilities than in the main school.  The Monitor \nhighly recommended that the girls return to the main school as soon as possible. Defendants have \nindicated they will work towards this goal. In addition, youth on levels 1 and 2 in the Krueger \nProgram continue to attend school in classrooms on their living units. The Educational expert will \nmake recommendations to education and specifically address education for youth on Krueger.  \nAll the girls were back in Wells since the renovation project was completed. Staff were engaged \nwith the youth during free time, the unit was clean, the girls had good attitudes and were very polite \nand somewhat chatty. The safety/welfare checks were completed and up to date and staggered. One \nyouth was voluntarily in her room, but it was not documented. Staff on Wells need to make sure \nthey are logging when youth voluntarily go into and exit their rooms. The Monitor recommended \nthat the Defendants needed to focus on gender specific programming to enhance the programs and \nactivities for the girls’ facility. A Youth In Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”) subject matter \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 4 of 28\n \nexpert provided training to facility staff August 27-30, 2019. Administration should continue to \ntrain and utilize the training in their programming on a regular basis.  Feedback from the training \nwas very positive.  \nWith respect the boys’ cottages, generally, all the youth rooms were cleaner than last visit. The \nMonitor reviewed the safety/wellness documentation and it has greatly improved from the last \nvisit. Documentation complied with policy and procedure in 97% of the logs reviewed in LHS. \nStaff should be commended for the significant improvement in the safety/welfare observations and \ndocumentation. The Monitor made further recommendations to the forms that will make it easier \nfor staff to complete and would require less staffing. In previous reports, the Monitor commented \non staff placement on the unit. During this site visit, staff were placed near the youth and were \nmuch more interactive with the youth. However, now that the youth are all out of their rooms from \n8 A.M. to 8 P.M. (generally speaking), staff need to consider adjusting staff placement on the unit \nto make sure staff are aware of which youth are in the general living space, in their rooms, \nrestrooms, outdoor yard, etc. There were significantly less youth in their rooms during this site \nvisit than any of the previous site visits.  \nIn Krueger, the unit was clean. Youth rooms were messier on Krueger than during the last site \nvisit.  The Monitor observed three youth in their rooms but was told the youth were in the rooms \nat the youths’ request. Other youth were playing basketball, watching television, and making \nphone calls. Staff knew the count on the unit.  \nIn Addams, the living unit was clean and there was a beautiful mural on the wall.  There were no \nyouth on the unit as they were at recreation.  Although the graffiti was removed prior to the last \nvisit, there was significant graffiti in the youth rooms.  The bathroom was very dirty, and the \nfaucets were on slightly. The television was on in the unit despite there being no one on the unit. \nSafety/Welfare checks were unavailable since the youth were not in the cottage. \nIn Black Elk, the unit was clean and calm. There is a lot of graffiti in the rooms as was present \nduring the last site visit. Youth were playing cards, watching television, and braiding hair. Staff \nwere preparing lunch for the youth. Youth were appropriately chatty with the monitoring team and \nstaff. Four youth were in their rooms and the safety/welfare checks were completed and staggered. \nIn Curtis, the general area of the unit was clean and calm. Bathrooms were dirty. All youth were \nout of their rooms. Youth were very chatty.  Youth were watching television, making phone calls, \nand talking with each other. Safety/welfare checks were complete and staggered.  Med passes was \ntaking place and youth were appropriately receiving medication. Some of the youth rooms were \nclean and some were not. Staff were appropriately engaging with youth. \n \nThe Rogers unit was generally clean and youth rooms were generally clean. The bathroom was \nnot clean and had a strong smell of urine. Youth were watching television, playing cards, video \ngames and talking with each other.  One of the youth rooms had a strong smell of urine. Staff \nimmediately addressed this when the Monitor brought this to their attention. A few of the youth \nrooms had personal pictures on their windows. The Monitor informed the staff that the windows \ninto the youth rooms need to be unobstructed and pictures should be placed in another area of the \nroom.  Staff immediately removed the pictures. All youth were out in the day room (no one was \nconfined). Safety/welfare checks were conducted every 30 minutes or less and staggered.  Staff \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 5 of 28\n \nwere appropriately engaging with youth. \n \nIn Hughes, the unit was clean and calm. Youth rooms were generally clean. Youth were on the \ntelephone, talking with each other, and some youth were eating. The nurse was on the unit and \nengaged.  Youth were very chatty and spoke quite positively about LHS.  Youth rooms were \nmessy. Safety/welfare checks were complete and staggered. Staff were appropriately engaging \nwith youth. \n \nThe Roosevelt unit (TIP) was loud and the unit smelled. Some youth were watching television, some \nyouth were outside, were very chatty, and staff were engaged. The glass in the youth rooms has all \nbeen changed out to bigger windows. There were three youth with phone restrictions as confirmed by \nstaff. It is very important that youth have access to the telephone and be able to communicate with \nfamily.  The Monitor suggested that phone usage should not be a restriction unless there is an extreme \ncircumstance.  While  the  Defendants  use  of  phone  restrictions  as  a  sanction  has  decreased \nsignificantly during the reporting period, it is critical that eliminating phone restrictions except in \nextreme circumstances be implemented immediately. \nOnce all of the renovations in the cottages are completed, the Monitor believes this will enhance the \nsafety, well-being, and quality of life for youth and staff. The Monitor looks forward to the continued \nexpansion of the new rooms design throughout LHS and CLS. \n \nStaff and youth continue to make positive comments and have positive attitudes. The Monitor saw \nthe same positive interactions between staff and youth as the last visit.   LHS/CLS continues to have \nless of an institutional feel and the overall atmosphere has vastly improved. There is a significant \nreduction in the number of youth confined.   \n \nAdministration, staff and youth should be commended. There are still complaints from youth, \nhowever. The biggest complaints from youth were regarding the new vendor for canteen, perceived \nunfairness of how the new behavioral point system was applied, being bored due to lack of programs \nand activities, and being put on phone restrictions (which cuts them off from vital support from their \nfamilies).Due to the fact that youth have more time out of their rooms, there needs to be an even \nbigger focus on reducing youth idleness and more structured programming should be put into place.  \n \nStaffing  \nIn August 2019, Defendants hired a new Administrator who will oversee the Division of Juvenile \nCorrections.   Additionally, a new Security Director for LHS/CLS was hired in July 2019.  Direct \ncare staffing vacancy percentage has improved from the last site visit, however, staffing issues \ncontinue to exist at LHS/CLS. There are 311 total positions at LHS/CLS. Approximately 155 of \nthese positions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  \nThere are still a large number of staff on various leaves of absence (FMLA/Workers’ Comp, etc.) \nwhich contributes to the staffing shortages and mandated overtime. The teacher vacancy rate \nremains high but with slight improvement over the last three months. Recruiting is still a challenge. \nThis is directly impacting education for youth. The Monitor looks forward to the educational \nexpert’s assessment/report which will be available after his second site visit. \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 6 of 28\n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of   Vacancy Rate % as  Vacancy Rate % as of \nNovember 28, 2018  March 14, 2019  of May 31, 2019  Sept. 6, 2019 \nYouth   22% (23 of 105)  15% (16 out of 105)  11.5% (12 out of 105)  14% (15 out of 105) \nCounselor \nYouth  18% (9 of 50)  48% (24 out of 50)  50% (25 out of 50)  7% ( 3.5 out of 50) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  39% (11 of 28)  39% (11 of 28)  43% (12 of 28)  36% (10 of 28) \nSocial Worker  14% (2 of 14)  0% (14 of 14)  0% (14 of 14)  21.5% (3 of 14) \n \nIn order to address staffing challenged at LHS/CLS, effective April 28, 2019, security personnel \nbegan  receiving  a  $5.00/hour  add-on  for  worked  hours.  Eligible  employees  are  in  the \nclassifications  of  Correctional  Officer,  Correctional  Sergeant,  Youth  Counselor  and  Youth \nCounselor Advanced.  Additionally, most recent youth counselor academy began in August of \n2019 and has 23 members. This is a considerable increase compared to the academies earlier this \nyear. Prior to the $5.00 add-on, the vacancy rate for the Youth Counselor and Youth Counselor \nAdvance staff was at approximately twenty percent (20%). As of August, that has fallen to ten \npercent (10%) which is an overall decrease of approximately fifty percent (50%).  The Monitor \nalso recommended non-traditional scheduling. LHS/CLS has decided to implement a 12-hour \nschedule starting in November. In the last report, the Monitor recommended that the facility \nconduct a full staffing assessment to include a relief factor analysis looking at all leave types and \nits impact on staffing levels. A staffing assessment has been completed.  The Monitor made \nrecommendations to the staffing analysis.  \nThe Monitor spoke to over twenty-eight (28) staff and the majority of staff seem energetic despite \nworking many double shifts. The vast majority of staff expressed the desire to have more \nprogramming for youth.  The Monitor asked staff their thoughts on the new 12-hour schedule and \nmost staff are fine with the change. In fact, more staff were concerned that they will lose overtime \nonce the schedule changes.  In response to the Monitor’s last report, the administration conducted \nSituational Awareness Training (a POSC update training) focused on alternative techniques to \nprevent and address behavioral problems provided to staff in July and August. The facility plans \nto continue this, and other similar trainings based on staff input going forward. Staff said they \nenjoy interacting with youth and are accepting of the changes that are taking place. Staff did not \nhave a problem with youth no longer being confined during shift changes, medicine pass, or due \nto split hall. Most staff did not have a fear that the elimination of OC Spray was coming. Most \nstaff continue to show more attention to building relationships with youth and in engaging youth \nin a positive manner. \nThe Defendants have implemented many of the recommendations for staff wellness. The Monitor \ncontinues to stress the need to make staff wellness a major focus moving forward. The Monitor saw \nthat there were employees recognized as “Employees of the Month.”  The Monitor also suggested \ncreating a relaxing staff break room especially since they will be working 12-hour shifts starting in \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 7 of 28\n \nNovember.  It is important that the break room is inviting and relaxing and should not have an \ninstitutional  feel.  The  Defendants  should  continue  to  create  policy  driven  staff  recognition \nprograms,  and  tap  into  staff’s  talents,  passions,  and  interests  to bring  into  programming  as \npreviously recommended. \nThere has been improved communication with staff and youth regarding the reform effort (written \nand verbal).  Many of the communications to staff and youth have been written a positive manner, \nalthough there is a need to ensure that new policies and instructions do not focus on the court order \nas reason for changes, but rather emphasize that these changes constitute proper policy and \nprocedure.   As recommended in the technical assistance report, staff are engaged in developing \nprogramming and policy changes and are actively participating in youth and family council \nmeetings. However, staff can further be engaged in these processes.  There is too much unstructured \nfree time throughout LHS/CLS.  The Monitor made recommendations of furthering meaningful \nstaff engagement (groups on canteen issues, creating a newsletter, talent shows etc.)  \nAs part of the agency and facility commitment to improving conditions for both staff and youth, \nthey are continuing to engage in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (YICPM), which was \nexplained in the previous Monitor report.   \nThe Monitor suggested modifying the mental health (PSU) and recreational staff work schedules \nto include more evening and weekend hours. PSU work until at least 8 P.M. during the week and \nare on-call 24/7. The Defendants should continue to involve PSU staff, especially leadership, in \nmaking improvements at the facility (such as improvements to incentives, consequences, and \nworking with the OJOR system.) Currently, there is a PSU staff member who comes in each \nweekend to perform rounds and will report to the facility as needed in addition to the scheduled \nrounds. Recreation staff are working until 9 or 10 P.M. and two new Recreation Leaders were \nhired in July and September. One will focus on art and the other on music.   \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nTo address the need for a quality assurance and improvement program, the Defendants have \ncreated and now filled both QA positions (Quality Assurance Specialist and Program and Policy \nAnalyst). The goal is to continuously assess not only compliance with this court order, but the \nquality and adequacy of the social and recreational programming provided, healthcare, education, \nenvironmental health, safety, and discipline. The Monitor has begun working with the individuals \nselected for these positions.  \nDefendants have created a comprehensive quality assurance program that will greatly increase the \naccuracy and quality of data.   Defendants have developed new systems and review processes.   It \nis clear that the persons responsible for quality assurance are eager to make improvements.   The \nMonitor anticipates a huge improvement in data collection in the months to come.  During each \nsite visit, the Monitor focuses on different aspects of the operation.  During this site visit, the \nMonitor spent a lot of time going over data and discussing how data can be used in different \ncapacities in order to make decisions impacting the lives of youth and staff.  The Monitor made \nsuggestions on forms used that will allow line staff to more easily record data that can then be   \ncollected and analyzed.  The Monitor provided samples of policies which included quality \nassurance   measures.  The Defendants have created a “Quality Assurance Review” process that \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 8 of 28\n \nwill be completed every month.  The Defendants have drafted policy and procedure based on the \nMonitor’s  suggestions.    Additionally,  “Incident  Debrief  Process”  enhancements  have  been \nimplemented and continue to be developed for further improvement. Visual Monitoring, youth \ncomplaints, and CARE Team quality assurance processes have been developed and implemented. \nObservation checks, incident debrief, and searches are the next processes to be piloted. Facility \nProcedures including a QA portion for eight different processes have been drafted and are in the \nfinal stages of internal approval process. \nData recording has improved in safety/security checks, incident reports, use of force reports, \ngrievances, PSU/Medical documentation, mechanical restraints, searches, and meals in and out of \nroom on Krueger.  There needs to be a continued focus on adequacy of data collected and analysis \nof other subjects of the court order.  Defendants need to make this is a priority.  \nThe Monitor has discussed PbS in detail in previous reports, and thus, will not go into detail in this \nfourth report.  Although PbS data collection cycles occur twice annually, in April and October, the \nDefendants are looking into ways to monitor the critical outcome measures on a monthly basis, \npossibly using J-Tracker.  Facility Improvement Plans have been created after PbS Coach Site Visit \nand has been forwarded to the Monitor. \nThe Program and Policy team for the Division of Juvenile Corrections should continue to work with \nthe vendor (J-Tracker) to include other critical measures as described during the site visit and \ncontinue to work towards developing an electronic room check system. A vendor has been awarded \na contract for electronic room checks and additional tracking of other youth activity. \nPolicies and Procedures  \n \nRevisions to policy, procedure and Administrative Codes are occurring but have not been finalized. \nDJC Administrative Rules Committee had its first meeting on May 30, 2019. The process for \namending Administrative Code DOC Chapter 376 began as of September 3, 2019. The process for \namending DOC Chapter 373 will begin after public hearings on the scope statement describing \nchanges are held on September 20. All policies refer to the Administrative Code and thus \nmodifications to the Administrative Code should continue to be a priority. Two previously existing \ndivision policies have draft amendments and six facility procedures have been drafted including a \nQA portion: \n  \nTwo division policies: \n300.05.09 – Searches of Youth \n500.70.04 – Clinical Observation \n \nSix facility procedures: \n900.04.01 – CARE Team \n900.05.01 – Visual Monitoring \n900.05.02 – Mechanical Restraints \n900.05.03 – Administrative Confinement \n900.05.04 – Rapid Response Team \n900.05.05 – Incident Debrief \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 9 of 28\n \n \nInterim policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be developed.  Policies relevant \nto LHS/CLS need to be compliant with the federal court orders and should contain a quality \nassurance section for every policy. Defendants should continue to update policy and procedures \nbecause without updated policies and procedures which include quality assurance measures, \nsubstantial compliance with the court order cannot be achieved.    \nThere  should  be  formalized  training  with  employee  sign  offs  acknowledging  receipt  and \nunderstanding all policies and procedures. Effective proficiency testing for all training classes still \nneeds to be developed. The Monitor will continue to work with the Defendants on policy and \nprocedure. \nYouth Interviews  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and the Monitor conducted several youth interviews. Approximately thirty-two \n(32) youth were interviewed during the site visit (formally and informally). In previous visits, \nseveral youth wanted a more formal discussion with the ACLU attorney and/or Monitor.  There \nwere significantly less requests this visit.  In general, the major complaints from youth were the \nnew canteen vendor, perceived unfairness in how the point system was applied, being cut off from \nthe phone—and therefore often family contact—as a punishment, and the desire to have more \nthings to do. The overwhelming majority said that they were not confined much, if at all, were not \nrestrained, and were not strip searched. A few youths did like when staff did unit and rooms searches.  \nMost youth did not have complaints about staff but there were still a few youths concerned about \nhow some staff members treated them.   Most youth liked the modified behavior management \nprogram. There were a few who discussed certain situations and the Monitor and ACLU looked into \nthe allegations during and after the site visit. Because of the new policies regarding open dayrooms \n(no split out time) and doors on privilege (youth can leave their rooms without permission), \nconfinement due to split halls, counts, shift change, and medication pass is effectively ending \nconfinement outside of administrative confinement. The Monitor believes that has had an overall \npositive impact.   \nMost staff were engaged with youth in a positive manner and were placed in the vicinity of youth. \nAs mentioned, staff positioning probably needs to be reevaluated now that all youth are out of their \nrooms and have more freedom to move about.  \n \nThe Monitor observed (and youth reported) several positive interactions between youth and staff. \nDefendants have implemented more PM programming activities. PSU has also initiated a number of \nadditional groups and expanded the availability of these sessions to youth. Defendants continue to \noffer more programming however, there is still too much idle time especially during the weekend. \nDefendants are and should continue to identify more resources and continue to implement the \nprograms as recommended by the experts retained. Defendants have made significant progress in \nimproving the quality of life for youth and staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree. As previously stated, \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 10 of 28\n \nthere is a challenge with adequacy of data for many areas (documentation, accuracy, consistency, \nand analysis) thus, some sections do not contain a detailed narrative.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand procedure –and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for three days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand  procedure  –  and  if  this  improvement  is  sustained  -  they  will  reach  substantial \ncompliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: There is no evidence in data/reports that indicate youth are being \nsubject to punitive room confinement.  During this reporting period, the Defendants have \nimproved documentation and have issued directives and created procedures to address \nyouth behavior.   If Defendants improve their quality of data and documentation and \nincorporate the court order into policy and procedure – and if this improvement is sustained \n- they will reach substantial compliance. \n \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 11 of 28\n \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he \nor  she  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During the last reporting period, \nthere were instances in which administrative confinement was being used for youth who did \nnot pose a serious risk of imminent physical harm. It also appeared that, rather than \nreleasing youth from confinement as soon as they no longer pose a risk, Defendants were \ngenerally treating four hours as a default minimum period of time for administrative \nconfinement. The Monitor suggested how to document this requirement in policy and in \nforms as well as made suggestions to place youth in the day room once they no longer pose a \nserious  risk  of  imminent  physical  harm  to  others.  Defendants  have  incorporated  the \nMonitor’s suggestions.  Documentation and data from July were utilized in the incident \ndebriefing  and  administrative  confinement  process  which  has  significantly  enhanced \nDefendant’s ability to track administrative confinement placements. Incident Debrief and \nadministrative  confinement  procedures  are  part  of  the  eight  procedures  drafted  and \nundergoing review prior to finalization. The Monitor suggested alternatives to confinement \nfor administrative purposes such as med pass, counts, shift change, and split hall time. As of \nSeptember 3, open dayrooms and doors on privilege have addressed many confinement \nissues  during  these  periods.    During  the  last  site  visit,  generally,  youth  who  were  in \nadministrative confinement were transferred to the Krueger program.  This has changed in \nthat now most youth serve the administrative confinement on their home unit. Some youth \nare serving their confinement on Krueger and are referred to the “Krueger Program.” The \nKrueger Program has been modified based on some of the Monitor’s recommendations, but \nthere is still more refinement that needs to happen.  Although youth have behavioral plans \ndeveloped, the program needs to be improved to include more robust behavioral plans and \nthe plan needs to be revisited with more frequency should a youth not be able to return to \nthe home unit in an appropriate period of time.  The Monitor also suggested that the \nDefendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a youth to move through levels 1 and 2 \nand that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the criteria for referral into the program \nas well as criteria for exiting the program.  Defendants conduct training, improve their \nquality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure \n– and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach substantial compliance. \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 12 of 28\n \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  In a large number of instances, it \ndoes not seem that administrative confinement is being extended. In the instances where \nconfinement has been extended, a mental health associate (PSU) has authorized it. If \nDefendants improve their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court \norder into policy and procedure – and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach \nsubstantial compliance. \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During the last site visit, generally, \nyouth who were in administrative confinement were in the Krueger program.  This has \nchanged in that now most youth serve the administrative confinement on their home unit. \nSome youth are serving their confinement on Krueger and are referred to the “Krueger \nProgram.” The Krueger Program has been modified based on  some of  the Monitor’s \nrecommendations, but there is still more refinement that needs to happen.  Although youth \nhave behavioral plans developed, the program needs to be improved to include more robust \nbehavioral plans and the plan needs to be revisited with more frequency should a youth not \nbe able to return in an appropriate period of time.  The Monitor also suggested that the \nDefendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a youth to move through levels 1 and 2 \nand that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the criteria for referral into the program.  \nDefendants need to improve their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the \ncourt order into policy and procedure and train staff accordingly. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \npm to 8 am.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  is  no  evidence  that \nadministrative confinement has been extended beyond 24 hours, and thus there have not \nbeen  such  transfer  plans  created.  If  Defendants  improve  their  quality  of  data  and \ndocumentation, and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure, they will be in \nsubstantial compliance. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 13 of 28\n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. If Defendants improve their quality \nof data and documentation, and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure, they \nwill be in substantial compliance. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended pol icy. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated on 9/19/18 and the dates contained in the policy has been corrected. \nThe Monitor suggests a more formal training and staff sign off reflecting they read and \nunderstand policy. Additionally, a quality assurance mechanism needs to be finalized.  \n \n  \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. The Monitor recommended that Defendants replace the \nexisting room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for \nsecure  environments.  The  new  replacement  furniture  which  is  in  the  Wells  unit  is \nconsistent with what the Monitor would expect to see in a secure facility and should \ncertainly reduce the opportunity for suicidal incidents within the youth rooms. There is a \nplan in place to make such changes in the rest of LHS/CLS.  \nWith respect to youth rooms, there was some change from the last site visit. Most youth \nrooms had their beds made and were cleaner than last visit. The Monitor did not observe \nrooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of the room. Room searches are \ntaking place more often.  There has been significant improvement on graffiti and etching \non the glass which has improved staff’s ability to clearly see the youth through the \nwindow. Also, on the TIP unit, the Monitor recommended that the windows to be changed \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 14 of 28\n \n(they were very small and pretty high on the door).  These new windows have been \ninstalled.  \nSafety/Welfare  checks  have  significantly  improved  and  are  now  being  done  on  an \nindividual  basis.  Safety/welfare  documentation  show  that  room  checks  are  being \ncompleted at least every 30 minutes and are staggered in the majority of cases. Defendants \nhave provided additional personnel to ensure that the checks are being done in accordance \nto policy and procedure.  There are also regular quality assurance reviews in order to \nincrease compliance.  As previously mentioned in this report, The Monitor has made \nrecommendations to the forms that will simplify the process. The Monitor recognizes that \nan electronic system is being explored by the agency, but this will take some time. \nSafety/welfare checks should continue to be a priority and progress needs to continue to \nbe made. While not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend \nincreasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when \nyouth  are  confined  to  their  rooms  as  this  is  supported  by  JDAI  standards,  PREA \nstandards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. Defendants should \nbe commended for the vast improvement on these safety/welfare checks.   \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain about \naccess to water, hygiene supplies, or night time toilet usage.  This is a huge improvement \nfrom the last visit. If Defendants improve their quality of data and documentation, and \nincorporate the court order into policy and procedure, they will be in substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nbut still needs more improvement.  Time of call to PSU staff is now being documented on \nthe incident report in most instances, but there is room for improvement. This requirement \nshould be included in the development of a quality assurance program. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 15 of 28\n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Monitor  requested  any \ndocumentation  indicating  that  confinement  is  contraindicated  and  there  were  no \ninstances documented during this review period. There is a form “Psychology Input for \nSecurity Decision” which is where the contraindication would be documented and there \nis a policy (Policy 500.70.04). \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Safety/Welfare  checks  have \nsignificantly improved and are now being done on an individual basis. Safety/welfare \ndocumentation show that room checks are being completed at least every 30 minutes and \nare staggered in the majority of cases. Defendants have provided additional personnel to \nensure that the checks are being done in accordance to policy and procedure.  There are \nalso regular quality assurance reviews in order to increase compliance. As previously \nmentioned in this report, The Monitor has made recommendations to the forms that will \nsimplify the process. The Monitor recognizes that an electronic system is being explored \nby the agency, but this will take some time. Safety/welfare checks should continue to be a \npriority and progress needs to continue to be made.  \nDefendants are holding staff accountable for this reporting period as there were  27 \n“Letters  of  Expectation”  and  two  staff  were  formally  disciplined  related  to  visual \nmonitoring. The agency is going to implement an electronic, software-based rounds \nchecking system. PSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and have increased in-person \nhours on the weekend as recommended by the Monitor.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 16 of 28\n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing \nthe frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. Defendants should be commended for the \nvast improvement on these safety/welfare checks.   \n \n \nf.   Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary in \nnature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and implemented.  \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Social  worker  visits,  mental \nhealth services, and other health services are provided.  Once documentation, the quality \nassurance program is finalized, and this requirement is clearly in policy and procedure, \nDefendants will be in substantial compliance.  \n \nii.  Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a lack of documentation as \nto specific programming that occurs daily.  The Monitor anticipates this will change once the \nKrueger Program is updated/modified according to discussions during the site visits. Also, \nthere are occasions where staffing levels do not allow for planned programming. There has \nbeen improvement in available programming, but there is still a lack of other activities for \nyouth to engage in resulting in excessive amounts of idle time. At the visit, it was stated that \nthe OJOR no longer requires specific programming such as ART to be released from LHS \nand that the programming provided in the Krueger program (such as DBT) will suffice, but \nthis needs to be verified, documented and included in policy and procedure. \n \niii.   Educational services with the general population to the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 17 of 28\n \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Educational Services for general \npopulation occur in the classrooms in the school area. Youth in the Targeted Intervention \nProgram (“TIP”) attend classes in the school area but separate from the general population. \nYouth in Krueger do not receive educational services in the school area (except for youth on \nPhase 3) but remain on living units. Additionally, during this reporting period, administration \ndecided to move the girls’ educational services out of the traditional school area and into a \nbuilding  with  far  fewer  amenities  and  facilities  than  the  main  school.  The  Monitor \nrecommends that all youth regardless of status have education in the school area.  The \neducation expert will make further recommendations that should be implemented. The \nDefendants are working on bringing more culturally relevant program into LHS/CLS. \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  “Out  time”  has  significantly \nimproved in the last three weeks of this reporting period. “Split hall” (which means a portion \nof youth are confined to their rooms while others are  out, and they rotate) ceased in \nSeptember. The Monitor regularly saw youth conversing with other youth and staff during \nout time.  In youth interviews, youth stated that they are not really confined to their rooms at \nall.   Youth still want more structured activities when they are out of their rooms and feel they \ndo not really do anything, which, as discussed elsewhere, is a significant problem. The \nKrueger program is out of pilot form, and the leadership has re-evaluated the program to \nensure compliance with the court order and technical assistance report with the Monitor’s \nassistance. More refinement to the Krueger Program needs to occur as discussed during the \nsite visit.  Enhancing programs and meaningful activities for the Krueger program should \nhave a positive impact and allow for youth to return to their home cottages more quickly. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 18 of 28\n \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The majority of meals take place \nout of the room but there are several occasions where youth eat meals in their rooms when \nthere is not an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm. The Monitor did not \nwitness youth eating in their rooms but has reviewed documentation in which youth are \neating meals in their room.  Should a youth eat a meal in their room, the decision by staff \nneeds to be justified, supported by documentation, and instances need to be reviewed by \nfacility administrators. Meals are not documented on living units except Krueger, but they \nneed to be. When reviewing the Krueger documentation, a large number of youth are eating \nin their rooms without evidence of a threat of physical harm. There are less blank entries \n(meaning staff is not documenting whether youth are eating in rooms or not)  than during \nthe last review period.  Policy and procedure needs to incorporate this section of the court \norder and quality assurance measure created. \nvi.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week. This has significantly increased \nsince confinement due to split halls, confinement for shift change, counts, and medicine pass \nhas been discontinued.  Documentation and data collection need to be improved.   \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. It is not clear whether youth are \nbeing told that they can grieve their placements in room confinement at all (or being told \nthey can do so within 15 minutes of placement). There were 109 grievances filed by youth \nduring this reporting period (on a variety of issues, not just placement). This indicates many \nyouths utilize the grievance procedures.  Defendants do have a robust tracking system in \nplace.  Defendants do analyze and have created measures for youth grievances. The quality \nassurance piece needs to ensure grievances are being timely and appropriately addressed \nand  communicated  to  youth.  The  Monitor  made  recommendations  to  forms  which  if \nimplemented, should improve data collection. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 19 of 28\n \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis more consistently. In addition to improved documentation, there are significantly fewer \ninstances of room confinement.  Documentation needs to continue to be completed and \nconsistently applied to all situations, other than sleeping hours, in which youth are confined \nalone in their rooms and the reason for the confinement.  Documentation, data collection \nand  reliability,  and  quality  assurance  needs  to  continue  to  be  improved.  Also, \ndocumentation needs to be created that prove a youth was promptly provided with the \nreport upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC usage has significantly been \nreduced during this reporting period.  The Monitor made several recommendations including \nincreased training, implementing a specialized team, and ensuring incident reviews are \nmeaningful.  Defendants have/will be implementing these recommendations. The CARE \nTeam has been expanded and the specialized team is being created. Defendants should \ncontinue  to do  regular  training  on  de-escalation. Additionally, as  recommended  in  the \ntechnical  assistance  report,  a new  incentive-based  behavior  management  program  that \nfocuses on rewarding positive behavior has been created which will have a direct impact on \nyouth behavior and thus, reduce the need for force of any kind. Continued focus on training, \nskills development and coaching, continued focus on overall atmosphere should have a \npositive impact on the number of incidents requiring this type of intervention.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 20 of 28\n \nThe below graph reflects the combined usage of OC at LHS and CLS in 2019. \n \nLHS/CLS 2019 Combined Chemical Restraint Use  \n12\n10 10\n10\n8 8\n8\n6 5\n4 3 3\n2 1\n0\nJan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug\nLHS/CLS Use 2019\n \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  N/A.    It  was  not  12  months  at  the  time  of  the  site  visit. \nCompliance will be assessed by the Monitor at the time required under this section. \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visits, but logs show there are occasions where \nyouth are placed in mechanical restraints. With better documentation and quality assurance \nmeasures, and final policy and procedure, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial \ncompliance with this provision if they can document and establish that there were not less \nrestrictive means available and quality assurance measures and final policy and procedure \nare in place. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 21 of 28\n \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraints are rarely \nused. Documentation has improved over this reporting period.  Documentation needs to be \nimproved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm and when and how that \nprocess is reviewed. With better documentation and quality assurance measures, Defendants \nmay be close to achieving substantial compliance with this provision. \n \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nii.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative  to  when  restraints  have  been  used  and  rationale  for  usage.    With  better \ndocumentation  and  quality  assurance  measures  and  continuing  to  reduce  the  use  of \nrestraints, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this provision. \n \n iii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 22 of 28\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With better documentation, policy revisions, and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nf.   Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation (13 trainings June-September 2019). However, de-escalation training \nneeds to be completed more often (regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue \nto develop this skill. Proper de-escalation cannot be trained only once, or even only once a \nyear. The Monitor continues to suggest having staff who are very good at de-escalation \nwork with staff who could use a refresher or with new staff especially since a large majority \nare new.  \n \ng.   Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be  left alone in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 23 of 28\n \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process itself is being \nanalyzed for improvement. New data will be available.  The use of mechanical restraints \nhas been significantly curtailed and documentation including the length of time youth \nspend in restraints when the use of mechanical restraints occurs is now being documented \nas part of the Incident Debrief process. If Defendants maintains this, they will be close to \nachieving substantial compliance.  \n \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there are \noccasions where youth are strip searched, albeit at a reduced frequency. In July, there were \nzero strip searches with or without probable cause. Blanket strip searches of youth at intake \nor returning from court has ceased. Hygiene checks have been completely eliminated as of \nAugust 6, 2019.   The policy for searches needs to be finalized. Defendants are close to being \nin substantial compliance. \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation shows that strip \nsearching still occurs but on a much lesser frequency. In July, there were zero strip searches \nwith or without probable cause. Blanket strip searches of youth at intake or returning from \ncourt has ceased. Hygiene checks have been completely eliminated as of August 6, 2019.   The \npolicy for searches needs to be finalized. Defendants are close to being in substantial \ncompliance. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 24 of 28\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved as to how staff are ensuring that unintended individuals cannot view the search \n(detail the area where search is occurring, state that there are no recording devices, and \ndocument who is present in the area, etc.) If documentation and policy revisions are made, \nsubstantial compliance can be obtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved detailing the area where search is conducted and how other youth cannot view the \nyouth being strip searched.  If documentation and policy revisions are made, substantial \ncompliance can be obtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation needs to be improved \nas to which staff conducted the search, that the search is by staff who is of the same gender \nidentity as the youth if the strip search is being conducted by someone other than a medical \nprofessional. The Monitor previously recommended form changes for documentation purposes. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that \nstaff have been trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor is told by direct care \nstaff and PSU is consulted. Documentation needs to be improved.  \n \n4.  Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The  process  for  tracking  and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. With continued practices, Defendants will be in substantial compliance.  \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 25 of 28\n \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most staff have been trained in the \nnew MANDT training and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. The \nMonitor recommends increasing the training frequency for staff to increase their experience \nand skill levels in managing and de-escalating situations before they result in the use of force, \nrestraint and/or isolation. All staff have completed Mandt training in 2018 and it is included \nas a component of the Youth Counselor Academy. All staff are required to attend a Mandt \nrefresher training in 2019. There are multiple sessions available to staff beginning in October \n2019. The use of force review process has improved.  It is more thorough, comprehensive, and \ntimely. Corrective action plans when force was used where it could have been avoided are \nbeing done in most cases. The Monitor recommended in instances where de-escalation was \nsuccessful, those examples should be used as a training tool for other staff including having \nother staff view the videos. \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of id le time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Many of the recommendations that \nwere made in the February 2018 technical assistance report have been implemented such as \nfamily  events,  yoga/Zumba,  increased  tournaments,  more  arts,  and  the  additional \nprogramming listed in the narrative part of the Third Report of the Monitor.  Youth \nadvisory and family councils have been implemented and the Monitor’s recommendations \nhave been incorporated into the process (agendas, minutes, frequency, and increased staff \ninvolvement). Recreation leaders have been hired to focus on art and music. There have been \nmusical instruments purchased.  The Monitor witnessed youth drawing and painting during \nthe site visit.  The Monitor also saw the beautiful murals and art work of the youth and staff. \nThe Health Services Unit (“HSU”) puts on monthly educational activities that youth can \nparticipate,  and  tablets  have  been  ordered  for  youth.  New  PSU  groups  have  been \nimplemented (Mindfulness, Music, Movement, and Movie).  PSU is also doing several groups \nfor the CLS students involving teamwork, leadership, and cooperation. Additionally, a \nweekly schedule of activities has been created as recommended by the Monitor. Although \nthere were more activities for youth during this reporting period, there is still a significant \namount of idle time.  Now that youth are basically out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M., \nthere is a need for more activities/programming. These activities/programming should be \nadded in addition to school, not as a substitute for education.  Also, some of the youth \ncomplained about not having music accessible to them. Perhaps, MP3 players could be more \nwidely dispersed amongst all youth.   \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 26 of 28\n \nAs recommended previously, counselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and \nvolunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for youth. Several staff made \nsuggestions for programming such as art therapy, dog therapy, increased tournaments, job \nreadiness skills, music, balance and restorative justice, and teen court. Many of these \nsuggestions  have  been  implemented.  Administration  needs  to  increase \nmeaningful/structured program and activity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours. \nAs mentioned previously, increasing education hours, including for youth who have obtained \na diploma or HSED, can greatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth \ndevelopment strategies through meaningful education and vocational programming. The \nDefendants have retained a consultant that can assist with developing gender and culturally \nappropriate programming.  \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most of the recommendations made \nin the February 2018 report have been implemented such as conducting a staffing analysis, \nhiring bonuses to obtain new staff, increased wages for current staff, staff recognition, and \nstaff wellness initiatives. There still are major staffing challenges due to various employee \nleaves and teacher vacancies. Job descriptions have been updated to highlight the youth \ncounselor aspect of position instead of “guard” or “corrections” description. Defendants will \nbe moving to a 12-hour shift starting in November with the goal of assisting with the staffing \nissues.  The Monitor encourages the Defendants to closely monitor the impact.  Given the \nlong-standing staffing deficiencies, there is an urgent need to also explore methods for \npromptly reducing youth populations. This might include expediting the OJOR process and \nevaluating  youth  for  placement  under  community  supervision,  including  intensive \ncommunity supervision, as permitted by state law. The Monitor suggests utilizing a strength-\nbased model and ensuring that time spent in units like Krueger is not counted against a youth \nwho comply with the Krueger Program. The average daily population has decreased slightly, \nbut not enough to relieve the staffing issues. \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DOC has identified sections of the \nAdministrative  Code  that  need  to  be  modified,  but  significant  revisions  have  not  yet \noccurred. The process for amending Administrative Code DOC Chapter 376 began as of \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 27 of 28\n \nSeptember 3. The process for amending DOC Chapter 373 will begin after public hearings \non the scope statement describing changes are held on September 20. Interim policies for \nLHS/CLS need to be drafted while waiting for final Code revisions. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There has been an improvement in \nmeeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after an incident. An area of \nimprovement is having staff involved brought together for meaningful discussions. When \nit has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a corrective action plan \ndeveloped now but quality assurance needs to be improved. There is a new QA process \nimplemented for visual monitoring and a framework for other QA measures relating to the \nconsent decree is being created.  \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Critical quality assurance positions \nare now filled and will be assisting in developing a quality assurance program. The Monitor \nreviewed sample performance goals, reviewed PbS in great detail, and made suggestions for \nmonthly performance measures and how to incorporate into policy. The Monitor and the \nQA staff met and discussed various data points and reports. As discussed throughout this \nreport, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and \nto improve the quality of life for youth and staff.  The Monitor is confident that the \nDefendants will create a competent quality assurance program. \n \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 112   Filed: 10/10/19   Page 28 of 28\n \nCONCLUSION \nThere have been significant improvements to the physical plant of LHS/CLS which is providing a \nless institutionalized feel for youth and staff. Staff and youth interactions have significantly changed \nfor the better. The overall atmosphere today has vastly improved from a year ago.  Leadership, staff, \nand youth should be commended because it took a lot of hard work by all to get to the place where \nLHS/CLS is today.  Defendants have more programming for youth than LHS/CLS has ever had \navailable to youth. Confinement time has been substantially reduced. Direct- care staff vacancies have \nbeen reduced.  Critical data/quality assurance positions have been hired. As a result of the progress \nmade, it is clearly evident that these changes are having a positive impact on the overall atmosphere \nand culture of the facility.  \nContinued efforts need to be made with reducing teacher vacancies and increasing educational time \nand quality. Krueger Program needs to be refined. Regular training in de-escalation and physical \nrestraint techniques need to occur. Policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be \ndeveloped. Phone sanctions must cease. Implementing the new quality assurance program needs to \nbe a primary goal.  The physical plant improvements need to continue as scheduled.   \nAlthough there is more work to do, the Monitor is very pleased with the progress made over the last \nyear.  The Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the \nparties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n28 \n ",

LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n EIGHTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Seventh Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on October 27, 2020. The Monitor’s \neighth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the seventh site visit which took place on September 17, 2020.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe eighth site visit by the Monitor took place on December 17, 2020.  Due to the pandemic, the \nMonitor limited onsite time to one day and completed necessary interviews/information gathering \nvia virtual meetings over the following two weeks after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to and after the site visit for the reporting period ending \nNovember 30, 2020. Materials included but were not limited to: Administrative Code drafts, use \nof force videos, COVID-19 related memos, directives and plans, programming materials, project \nplans, grievances, various staff memos, daily shift reports, all of the monthly data submitted to the \nparties per this Court Order (September, October, and November 2020), updated unit rules, work \nrules, meeting notes, employee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint \ndocumentation, incident reports, and other housing documentation.  Again, due to Covid-19 \n(reducing visitors during this time), only the monitoring team was on site during this site visit. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel conducted youth interviews virtually. The Monitor took photographs, toured \nLHS/CLS, and interviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to the majority \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 2 of 53\n \nof youth and staff present and available during the site visit. Approximately fifty-three (53) youth \nand thirty-eight (38) staff were interviewed formally and informally by the Monitor during this \nsite visit.   \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction/COVID-19 Updates \n \nIt is important to note that during the evaluation period, COVID-19, is still impacting the world. \nThe systematic changes to stop the spread of this infectious disease were still in place during this \nsite visit. New admissions continue to take place every two weeks to allow for medical quarantine \nwith medical monitoring.  There is quarantine living space for the girls and boys consistent with \nCDC and Wisconsin public Health guidelines and allow for out-time from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. There \nwere five (5) units in quarantine and eight (8) youth in isolation at the time of the site visit. All \nstaff are required to wear masks as of July 13, 2020. Youth are encouraged to wear masks.  The \nMonitor is happy to report that all staff present wore face coverings properly at all times.  Only a \nfew  youths  wore  masks.  All  staff  and  visitors  entering  the  facilities  are  screened  with  a \nquestionnaire and temperature check prior to being allowed to enter the facilities.  There have been \nCovid-19 positive youth and staff during this reporting period.   \n  \nAll new admissions are placed in a medical quarantine and medical monitoring unit for fourteen \n(14) days. Each of these youth are seen immediately upon intake for a COVID-19 screening, \ntemperature check, and complete health history review/health assessment by qualified nursing \nstaff. Like all existing youth, new youth receive in-person education supplemented by video \nlearning to help recognize and report symptoms of illness and strategies to help reduce the risk of \nspreading COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses.  \nNon-intake living units are placed on quarantine status if there is an identified risk of COVID-19 \nexposure. The unit is placed on medical quarantine and medical monitoring for fourteen (14) days \nfrom the last known date of exposure. As with all new admissions, a COVID-19 screening with \ntemperature check is then completed by professional health staff each day youth are on quarantine \nstatus until cleared on their final day of quarantine. The Safety Director provides living unit \nquarantine updates to all staff in collaboration with the Health Services Supervisor; a log of \nquarantine status and timeframes is also maintained and accessible to all staff in shared electronic \nfiles. In addition to daily COVID-19 screenings conducted for youth on quarantine status, the \nmedical team also conducts COVID-19 screenings at every appointment or encounter and prior to \nyouth kitchen workers reporting to work. All youth screenings are completed by qualified \nhealthcare professionals including Registered Nurses, Advanced Practice Nurse Practitioner, or \nMedical Director.  \nYouth on medical quarantine and medical monitoring continue to receive essential cares and are \nprovided education as the rest of the population. The Monitor is told that the Special Education \nteacher goes to the unit to do resource with the youth directly although it is unclear whether and \nto what extent required special education services are being provided. The physical education \nteacher either goes to the unit or Zooms in to provide the large muscle activities.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 3 of 53\n \nAll youth are highly encouraged to wear face coverings and maintain physical distancing although \nmost do not. Youth are reminded that they need to wear a mask when entering the school and the \nhealth service unit (“HSU”). HSU will supply youth with a mask during medical appointments \nshould they forget to wear one of their facility-supplied masks. In addition, youth can purchase \ngray face coverings from approved property vendors to maintain seven (7) masks, one for each \nday of the week.  \nOver the summer months, two rounds of testing (youth and staff) occurred in partnership with the \nDepartment of Corrections, Department of Health Services and the Wisconsin National Guard. \nYouth who display objective health symptoms consistent with COVID-19, reported subjective \nsymptoms of COVID-19, required off-site surgical procedures, or have transferred to MJTC, have \nhad additional COVID-19 tests. Since March 2020, LHS/CLS has administered 195 youth COVID \ntests with 177 negative and 18 positives. Fourteen (14) of the eighteen (18) youths tested positive \nfor  COVID-19  from  September  to  November  which  coincides  with  increases  experienced \nnationally and across the state of Wisconsin. Due to the continued notable presence of COVID in \nthe state and local communities, LHS/CLS has arranged to conduct more regular COVID testing \nof staff. Testing is required of all staff every two weeks until further notice from the Department \nof Corrections. Consistent with CDC and public health guidelines and recommendations, staff who \nhave previously tested positive for COVID-19 are not required to test again for 12 weeks since the \noriginal positive test unless they develop new symptoms or have been in close contact with another \nperson who has tested positive in the last fourteen (14) days.  \nThe  total  LHS/CLS  population  remains  consistently  in  high  60’s  to  low  70’s.    Program \nmodifications continued due to the pandemic including, but not limited to no in person visitation \n(virtual visitation occurred- although less frequent as of late due to lack of social workers onsite \nand technical difficulties); youth are still e-learning on the units; PSU, teachers, social workers, \nand other staff rotate and conduct services virtually when they could not be done in-person. This \nlack of in person services that the Monitor deems essential is having an impact on youth and direct-\ncare staff alike.  There is a definite change in the overall atmosphere from the last visit.  Staff \ncontinue to be concerned about what they perceive to be the need for negative incentives and \npunishments and the fact that direct-care staff are having to manage not having key support staff \non-site to provide services to youth (teachers/social workers/onsite PSU staff). Staff are clearly \nexhausted, frustrated, and based on PbS data and interviews, fear for their safety.  Overall, there \nhas been very limited improvement and progress in most areas of the consent decree from the last \nsite visit.  While some of the issues are related to the pandemic, the Monitor also feels that some \nof the issues could be alleviated or reduced if additional support staff were on site providing more \nnormalized facility operations, primarily around education, treatment, mental health services, etc.  \nThe normalization of facility operations would go a long way toward reducing incidents of \nviolence and other behavioral issues stemming from the lack of meaningful programs.  It would \nalso provide support to direct care staff and aid in reducing their workloads, stress and anxiety \nlevels, thereby promoting a more positive atmosphere, environment, and interactions between \nyouth and staff. \nPhysical Plant Observations \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, units and many other areas had beautiful holiday decorations \nthroughout. The facility overall looked very festive and staff and youth should be commended for \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 4 of 53\n \nall their efforts.  It was clear to the Monitor that the youth and staff enjoyed the decorating! The \ngrounds and the general areas of the facility were very clean.  On a very positive note- all youth \nare housed on newly renovated units (Wells, Miller, Dubois, Curtis, King, Black Elk, and \nRoosevelt).  Additional projects not yet completed are the camera upgrade, electrical upgrade, and \nremaining three cottage remodels (scheduled to be completed in June 2021).  The Monitor will \ncontinue to update the Court on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality \nof life for youth and staff.   \nEducation Observations \nThe Monitor has significant concerns about the provision of education at the facilities at this time, \nincluding but not limited to: remote learning, the quality of education, and the lack of adequate \nhours of schooling.  In fact, this current format is having a negative impact on overall youth \nbehaviors due to the lack of meaningful education and treatment programs.  This is obviously \nimpacting other outcome measures such as the use of restraints and isolation, increased fights, \nassaults and other behavior incidents that have long-term impacts on issues such as the overall \nfacility climate, safety, and length of stay. Finally, it should be recognized that these issues have a \nmuch more profound impact on youth with disabilities, particularly around education outcomes.  \nThe Monitor did not visit the school area as there were no youth present. As previously mentioned, \non March 24, 2020, the schools began providing education on the units with most education staff \nworking off-site, and this is ongoing.  Youth participate in the four (4) core academic areas, \nphysical  education  and  library  services  (weekly).  Currently,  youth  participate  in  Physical \nEducation, Welding, Construction, Greenhouse, Library and special education services at the \nschool building. Defendants continue to offer in person as well as Zoom special education resource \nsessions  for  all  youth  identified  in  their  IEP’s  as  needing  those  services.  Two  additional \neducational assistants have been hired to support students’ learning through tutoring, facilitating a \ncontinuation of library resources, and providing intake orientations. When the new assistants finish \ntheir training, they will be working to enhance one to one student support services. LHS/CLS \ncontinues to offer HSED (High School Equivalency Degree) as allowed by the Department of \nPublic Instruction in the State of Wisconsin to youth who qualify by reading level, age and \ndocumented credit deficiencies. This program, in addition to the high school diploma program, has \nbeen offered since the facilities inception. Dual credit courses (post-secondary and high school \ncourses) are also offered to youth who are interested and qualify. Some of the challenges that arise \nare the length of stay of youth, student motivation and scheduling challenges. Unfortunately, youth \nand staff are having a difficult time with e-learning and are quite frustrated.  \nFor quarantine units, programming continues as normal with the changes of a special education \nteacher going to the unit as well as physical education taking place on the unit. When a youth is \nplaced on medical isolation, they complete their schoolwork in their room and special education \nservices are made up in the week following.  \n \nThe Monitor was told that the teachers all began Zoom classes in November. There have been \nseveral professional development opportunities provided to staff during this reporting period. The \ngoal is to enhance teachers' skills in providing education in this new learning environment. Some \nteachers are onsite in the school two to four days a week. All the units have Zoom stations set up \nin their day room, staff have been provided Training Briefs to help troubleshoot questions, and the \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 5 of 53\n \nteachers are present remotely to interact with students while they are working on their Edgenuity \ncoursework.   \nAlthough these resources are provided, staff and youth are still struggling with education. The \nMonitor highly recommends a plan be implemented to return youth to the school area as soon as \nreasonably possible. The Monitor encourages the Defendants to bring teachers back in person. \nWhat is very clearly evident, is the educational programming and staffing that is in place is not \nworking.  The Monitor observed youth doing other youth’s homework on the unit, direct-care staff \nare not able to assist youth for the most part, and youth complained about not learning anything \nespecially youth in special education classes.  Direct-care staff are not only having to do their jobs- \nbut they are supposed to be assisting with teaching as well. Although music, art, and recreation \nstill occurred, the frequency needs to increase.    \nOf course, e-learning is not the preferred format for teaching, but during the pandemic, many \nlearning institutions have taken this approach. There are several areas in Wisconsin that have in-\nperson learning.  If schools out in the community can have in person learning, then so could a \nschool  within  an  institution  where  youth  are  not  comingling  with  family,  friends  and  the \ncommunity.  A large number of youth and staff complained and had difficulties with the e-learning \nformat, especially the inability to ask questions and receive real time feedback from teachers. As \neducation in various areas around the country and Wisconsin are moving to a hybrid or full in-\nperson model, LHS/CLS should consider adjusting the education program as well. At a minimum, \nincreased teacher access, such as moving to live e-learning off the units and in the school area, will \ngreatly impact all youth, but especially those with IEPs.  Defendants should recognize that the \nvirtual education platform is insufficient and is not providing youth with adequate education \nopportunities.   \nPbS data shows that educational hours remain lower than the national average at about 3.75 hours \nper day at LHS (weekdays) and 3.84 hours per day at CLS (weekdays). While the October PbS \ndata shows that the average hours of education have remained fairly steady during the pandemic \nand operational changes, the Monitor’s observations during the site visit revealed that the quality \nof the education program is significantly reduced as a result of the “virtual learning” platform \nwhich is occurring on the living units.  In fact, the Monitor observed numerous incidents in which \nyouth were not actually engaged in the learning and were doing other activities such as braiding \nanother youth’s hair and playing games- all during school periods.  The Monitor observed at least \none incident in which a youth was doing the school lesson for another youth while that youth was \nbraiding his hair.  It was interesting to also learn that the neither the unit staff or the teacher who \nwas on the virtual monitor, recognized that this was occurring or took any measures to prevent one \nyouth from doing the school work for another youth.  The overall quality of the education program \nwas lacking prior to Covid-19. Now, under this virtual on unit format, education is inadequate.   \nThe Monitor continues to encourage the Defendants to engage the educational consultant further and \nwork to address the concerns raised – including the need for deeper and more meaningful teacher \ninteraction with youth, enhancing or expanding the daily education hours, and implementing the \nrecommendations  made  by  the  consultant  and  the  Monitor  with  respect  to  staffing  and  the \neducational program for LHS/CLS and support for the direct-care staff.  Lack of educational hours \nand structure is contributing negatively to the environment and PbS reflects a low number of \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 6 of 53\n \neducation hours.   \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit.  All the entrances \ninto the units, the bathrooms, and day rooms were very clean and orderly in general. However, the \nlevel of cleanliness of youth rooms were far worse than any recent visits.  \nThere are adequate staffing levels on the living units. The Monitor saw limited staff engagement \nwith youth.   Youth attitudes overall were not as good during this site visit. Youth in general seemed \nagitated and bored.  All the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and were interested \nin interacting with the monitoring team this visit.   The Monitoring team had an opportunity to talk \nto most of the youth present in the day rooms.   \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed on the Wells cottage (female population is very low \nwith five (5) youth present).  King is being utilized as the female quarantine unit; but no one was \ncurrently housed on the unit. The Wells unit was beautifully decorated and very clean.  The girls \ndid a great job (as usual) making the unit festive.    No one was confined to their room.  Two youth \nwere with treatment specialists.  The rooms on the unit were clean and orderly with beds made. The \nMonitor observed staff in the staff office on the unit.  The staff present knew the youth very well \nand were relatively talkative with the Monitor.  \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, generally, the cottages themselves were very clean. Most units \nwere loud and chaotic. Youth on all units were e-learning or getting ready for lunch. The Monitor \ndid not observe any graffiti anywhere in LHS/CLS.  It is clear that the Defendants are monitoring \nthis closely and have done an exceptional job resolving this issue.  \nIn Black Elk, the entry way, day room, and bathroom were very clean and unit bright.  The Unit \nwas on quarantine.  There were some holiday decorations.  There were fourteen (14) youth on the \nunit and three (3) staff. Youth rooms on this unit were messy.  Youth were e-learning at the time \nof visit and sitting in the day room. Staff were doing rounds and monitoring the day room. \nThe Curtis Unit was very festive, and the youth were very playful and happy. Youth sung a holiday \nsong. Youth were excited about the unit decorating contest (and in fact won).   This was the cleanest \nunit with the cleanest rooms. Ten (10) youth present on unit with three (3) staff. One staff was in \noffice and two staff were standing on the perimeter of the unit. Youth were in the day room watching \ntelevision, doing crafts, and one was doing duty work. Not a single youth was confined.  As in the \nother units, staff here also stated that all of their tools were taken away to manage youth behavior and \nno meaningful incentives exist to help manage behaviors. \nIn Miller, the entryway, day room, and bathroom were relatively clean.  Youth rooms was generally \nclean.  Eleven (11) youth were in the day room and no one was confined. Four (4) staff were working \non the unit. HSU staff were leaving the unit. Youth were in the day room eating lunch. It was \nnoticeable that there were not any cushions on the furniture.  Youth were sitting on wood. Overall, \nthe unit was calm. All the youth talked with the Monitor.  Youth complained about being bored and \nwanting to go to school.  They also complained that they only received forty-five (45) minutes of \noutside time. The facility should work to increase exercise and outdoor time for youth as this would \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 7 of 53\n \nreduce idleness and likely reduce anti-social behaviors. They also stated that they would like the \nping pong table to be fixed.  Staff stated that they did not feel safe and that the boys were becoming \nincreasingly aggressive.  \n \nThe Dubois unit was clean and decorated. Most youth rooms were not clean. Youth did not seem \nhappy on this unit. There were thirteen (13) youth on the unit and three (3) staff on the unit. No one \nwas confined to their rooms. Some youth were doing schoolwork on laptops (virtual class was \nsupposed to happen but there was an issue with the teacher) and other youth were in day room \nchatting. Youth were about to eat lunch. Youth were very chatty with the monitoring team.  \n \nThe Roosevelt unit smelled very badly (perhaps youth cleaned with a dirty mop), but the unit \nlooked clean.  Youth rooms were the messiest of all the units. There was a total of eight (8) youth \nand five (5) staff on unit. Unit was rowdy and lacked control. Youth were not engaged in online \nlearning. Staff seemed very stressed. \n \nAs mentioned in previous reports, more meaningful activities, weekend programs and enhanced \neducational hours would help reduce the risk of youth engaging in anti-social behaviors when they \nhave little else to do (like climbing on roofs, excessive horseplay, destroying property, and running \naround unauthorized areas) – particularly during COVID-19 when so many interactions with other \nyouth, family, staff, and educators are now being done virtually.  In response to needing more \nstructured, gender and culturally relevant programming, Defendants have created and hired a \nProgram Director. The Monitor looks forward to the positive impact this person will have for youth \nand staff.   During previous site visits, the Monitor recommended creating and implementing a daily \nschedule  to  help  with  youth  boredom  and  create  opportunity  for  structured,  meaningful \nprogramming.  The Monitor worked with the Defendants on developing a weekly schedule with \naccountability/quality control measures and this has since been created and implemented. Creating \nand implementing a daily schedule is a good first step. \n \nStaff are very frustrated with what is perceived to be a lack of ways to hold youth accountable as \nwell as a lack of incentives that will foster improved behaviors as youth focus on earning the \nincentives and rewards.  Defendants are developing and implementing a new behavior management \nsystem/implementing DBT and modifying canteen privileges to encourage youth to behave on a \ndaily basis. Improving the behavior management system and improving the rewards and incentives \nwill have a positive impact on the overall behavior and atmosphere issues that are driving the main \nissues that are frustrating both staff and youth. Youth are concerned about these changes so the \nMonitor recommended piloting the implementation on a smaller scale.  Defendants have created \nmore staff-led activities since the last site visit which is an improvement. \nYouth Interviews  \n \nThe Monitor conducted several youth interviews. Approximately fifty-three (53) youth were \ninterviewed during the site visit (formally and informally).  Plaintiffs’ counsel also interviewed \nyouth remotely.  Youth did complain to counsel about use of physical force and restraints, staff being \ntoo quick to use administrative confinement, missing school while they are in administrative \nconfinement, and the inadequacy of virtual schooling, inadequate activities, and reduction in Zoom \ncalls with their families. There were no requests to talk to plaintiffs’ counsel while the Monitor was \nonsite talking with youth.  \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 8 of 53\n \n \nThe youth interviews with the Monitor were all very similar.  Youth complained about education \n(lack of support, special education classes, missing in-person learning, and missing being in the \nschool area), not getting off the units or going outside, not getting Zoom calls with family, staff not \nengaging or caring about them, being bored, and staff restraining and confining when there was not \na need.   \n \nAlthough Defendants have made attempts to create a schedule with staff directed activities, youth \ncomplained that most of the activities were not something they enjoyed.  Youth enjoyed the music \nlab, various contests, basketball games, and anytime they can do something off unit.   Although the \nDefendants are working on improving this, much more must be done to improve programming and \nidleness.  It is clear by the data, shift reports, and youth and staff attitudes, that boredom is taking its \ntoll.   \n \nYouth did not complain about canteen this site visit besides being concerned about future changes \nto the program. LHS/CLS Business Office continues to be responsive to feedback about youth \nneeds and interests as received through youth correspondence and committees.  In collaborative \neffort with HSU, the Business Office added some additional items to the property catalog and \ncanteen monthly to address health and safety for the youth. During this reporting period, property \nitems that were added include: Boxer/Briefs, watches, brushes, and benzoyl peroxide cream. \nAfrican Magic Gro has been procured to be maintained onsite as it has often out of stock from the \ncanteen process. The Canteen menu has also been updated to include playing cards, additional \nhygiene products, and greeting cards.  \n \nThe Business Office is also working directly with the Superintendent and DOC to explore \nadjustments making snack and hygiene items available in alignment with the DBT System of Care \nbehavioral management model and the incentive redesign. The Business Office is putting a plan \nin place to transition to in-house distribution daily of some canteen items, using top selling list \nfrom our youth’s actual sales history for ordering additional canteen items to have on hand at the \nfacility, taking recommendations through youth council and communication forms, adding items \nto canteen menu often based on feedback. Defendants are funding through state funds (to be \nprovided as earned incentives) to have weekly on-hand highly desirable and culturally important \nitems. Defendants’ work on remedying the canteen issues should be commended.  \nDue to lack of clinical support staff and connectivity issues, the facility is not providing as many \nZoom calls (virtual family visits).  This is clearly having a negative impact on behavior and \nincreasing incidents. Many youth and staff complained about this issue. More Zoom calls would \ncertainty go a long way to improving conditions and reducing anxiety.  Several youths said that they \njust want to be able to talk and see their family for the holidays.  The Monitor recommends the \nDefendants resolve the issues with Zoom calls and conduct some of the calls in the visitation area to \n“normalize” visitation, have youth move off of units, and have a change of environment. The \nvisitation area is very beautifully decorated and is not being utilized currently. \nThe Defendants should take advantage of the reduced population and the available staff in planning \nand preparing and developing programs for youth. The Monitor is hopeful that with the new \nProgram Director, gender and culturally competent programming can be brought/introduced (even \nif virtually), to LHS/CLS s an interim measure while Defendants work to move youth closer to \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 9 of 53\n \nlocations where such programs and services are available. \nStaffing  \n \nDuring this reporting period, there have been some key staffing changes.  Key Positions hired from \nSeptember  1,  2020  through  December  20,  2020  are  as  follows:  Safety  Director,  Safety \nAdministrative Captain, Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council- ITW Coordinator, two Recreation \nCoordinators, a Nursing Supervisor for Health Services Units, two Corrections Unit Supervisors, \ntwo Supervising Youth Counselor IIs, two Education Assistants, Facilities Maintenance Specialist- \nAdvanced, and the Corrections Treatment Services Director- (Eff. 12/20/20).   Youth Counselor \nAcademies Classes are underway or scheduled. \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has increased from the last reporting period (see below).  \nThere are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS.  Approximately 153 of these positions are \n“direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  The teacher \nvacancy rate remains high (7 vacancies- same as that last reporting period). Hiring for two \neducational assistants have occurred during this reporting period which is good. The Monitor \nencourages continuing to recruit teachers despite the reduced population and challenges with \nCovid-19.  Recruiting is still a challenge due to the location of the facility, overall teacher \nshortages, relatively low compensation, location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS \nwill close, and the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue.  As previously \nmentioned, the entire educational program at LHS/CLS needs to be evaluated and improved. \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \nJanuary 30, 2020  May 13, 2020  September 19, 2020  December 9, 2020 \n   \nYouth   7% (8 of 115)  8.6% (10 out of 115)  18.2% (21 out of 115  23% (27 out of 115) \n \nCounselor \n \nYouth  15% (5.5 of 37.5)  13% (5 out of 37.5)  12% (4.5 out of 37.5)  13% (5 out of 37.5) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  32% (8 of 25)  32% (8 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25) \nSocial Worker  21 % (3 of 14)  21% (3 out of 14)  21% (3 out of 14)  29% (4 out of 14) \n \nThe Governor approved a meritorious hazard compensation payment for essential front-line state \nworkers in residential facilities that have been experiencing a high number of residents and/or staff \nwith COVID-19. The one-time $1,500 payment will be targeted to employees who are required to \nphysically report to work, regularly tested for COVID-19 because of the risk posed to those in \ntheir care, and the health risks they face in their jobs. Consistent with federal CARES Act \nguidelines and the State’s Discretionary Merit Compensation (DMC) program, a lump sum \nmeritorious payment (for employees with a satisfactory performance evaluation in the past twelve \n(12) months and without discipline within the past twenty-four (24) months) will receive payment \nat the end of the calendar year. New probationary employees will qualify for the program upon \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 10 of 53\n \nsuccessful completion of their probationary period. Hopefully, this assists with retention of staff \nduring a very difficult time.  \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over thirty-eight (38) staff. Staff morale ranged from being \nsomewhat happy (a few) to staff being very angry (some) and stressed and frustrated (majority). \nStaff felt that there were not enough activities for the youth to do, they rarely get off the unit, there \nwere less “tools” available to manage behavior, and youth were acting out a lot more.  Staff are \nfrustrated that some staff do not have to come to work in person and felt that they had to do multiple \npeople’s  jobs.  Management  continues  to  have  “Administrator  Listening  Sessions”  and \n“Superintendent Town Halls.” Majority of staff do not seem to engage with the youth regularly \nbased on staff and youth interviews, Monitor’s tour, reviewing camera footage and video, and PbS \ndata. The Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus \nmoving forward.  \n \nYouth in Custody Practice Model Update/ Dialectical Behavior Therapy \n \nAs part of the agency and facility’s desire to improve conditions for both staff and youth, they are \ncontinuing to engage in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”), which was explained \nin the previous Monitor reports.  The YICPM Core Leadership Team continues to meet and discuss \nimplementation and sustainability of the YICPM model at LHS/CLS. The current focus of the \nCore Leadership Team is the development and implementation of DBT as a behavioral motivation \napproach.  \n \nThe  YICPM  Core  Leadership  Team  continues  to  meet  and  discuss  implementation  and \nsustainability of the YICPM model at LHS/CLS. The current focus of the Core Leadership Team \nis the development and implementation of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (“DBT”) as a behavioral \nmotivation approach  \nOn December 1, 2020, agency leadership conducted a video call with YICPM consultants. The \nfocus of the meeting was to develop modules for the final virtual site visit scheduled for January \n \n13 and 14, 2021.  Georgetown consultants will help develop the framework and action plans to \nsupport management in sustaining cultural changes that will come with implementing DBT as a \nbehavioral motivation System of Care. A panel discussion with one/two direct line workers from \nUtah and Massachusetts will provide helpful context to reinforce efforts. The meeting will also \ninclude an assigned re-reading of related Practice Model chapters and a DJC Roadmap PowerPoint \nwith updates. These plans are designed to support staff in understanding their role as change agents \nand sustaining change as an agency.  \nA DBT Informed System of Care has been identified as vital to the change process. Planning \nactively continues to integrate a comprehensive revamp of a behavioral management approach \ncoupled with DBT- which is based on three key principles:  \nPrinciple 1: Decreasing risk of recidivism   DBT targets and treats multidiagnostic, difficult-to-\ntreat, high risk individuals who engage in life-threatening behaviors toward themselves and others  \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 11 of 53\n \nPrinciple 2: Responsivity – Appropriately matching treatment to learning styles, capabilities and \ndiagnoses of youth. DBT delivers treatment in a group, individual and milieu setting to those in \nwhich research has demonstrated DBT’s effectiveness. \nPrinciple  3:  Criminogenic  needs:  DBT  teaches  emotion  regulation,  problem  solving,  self-\nmanagement,  impulse  control,  interpersonal  skills  and  skills  to  enhance  motivation. This \norganizational priority will bring a shared focus and language to support treatment needs for youth \nat LHS/CLS. Thirty-four (34) staff attended the Superintendent Town Hall on October 6, 2020 in \nwhich an overview of DBT as a System of Care was shared. Question & Answer allowed for \nleadership and staff to identify various considerations that will enhance implementation.  \nOn October 22, 2020, executive leadership engaged the Program and Policy Analyst for increased \ncapacity for project management and quality assurance. A SharePoint platform was developed to \nshare task assignments, calendar highlights, and workgroup developments including incentive \nredesign planning efforts, pro-social point matrix, menu of responses for noncompliant behaviors, \nskill practice reinforcers and a framework for program progression. Leadership reviewed the draft \nDBT program guide to ensure integration of basic learning principles (reinforcement, punishment, \nextinction, and shaping) into the behavioral motivation model.  \nDBT System of Care supports have included the development of a structured schedule with the \nschool day starting at 9 a.m. (in alignment with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation \nto support teens’ circadian rhythm and development) and includes rotation of recreation and staff \ndirected activities on the weeknights. Skills Streaming the Adolescent has also become a key part \nof the new schedule engaging unit-based groups in skill practice that will support DBT efforts. \nThe summer’s transition to Growth Plans with SMART goals for each youth will become a key \ncomponent to support a DBT treatment environment facility wide.  \nThe core leadership group has expanded focus to include planning for staff training, quality and \nassessment.  With  full  commitment  to  implement  a  treatment  paradigm  with  DBT  as  the \nfoundational curriculum across the facility, it was determined that training strategic groupings of \nstaff continuously starting in early 2021 with six (6) half-day trainings over a three-week period \nwill provide clarity for staff and effectively and efficiently move DBT forward. Once staff have \nreceived training, there will be on-going coaching and mentoring  to aid staff in becoming \ncomfortable with DBT.  \nInterdisciplinary engagement has continued to strengthen final preparations for implementation of \nthe DBT System of Care. The Champions group of twenty (20) staff identified in the summer were \nencouraged to share perspective and feedback with leadership after receiving program updates on \nDecember 8th; the input of staff was strategically sought to enhance roll-out plans.  \nContinued planning efforts include the development of tailored Diary Cards for youth to self-assess \nusage of skills and engage in supportive dialogue with his/her Primary Youth Counselor and \nGrowth Team. A pre/post assessment DBT WCCL (Ways of Coping Checklist) was identified as \nan assessment tool to help gauge program outcomes that support youth development of prosocial \nstress management. The incentive committee continues to work with the business office to explore \noptions and processes to provide daily incentives connected to pro-social points. The Quality \ncommittee is working to outline pre-treatment DBT curriculum that can be delivered the first two \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 12 of 53\n \nweeks of a youth’s placement at LHS/CLS to enable youth to readily engage in DBT skills groups \nupon assignment to a living unit. The DBT System of Care will support a modified open-ended \ngroup structure that will align with youth’s engagement in programming, education, and ancillary \nactivities while applying skills for progression towards and in preparation of release. The Monitor \nis encouraged by the progress and commitment made in implementing DBT at LHS/CLS. \nMental Health (PSU) Update \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor informed the Court that due to COVID-19, contracting with a mental \nhealth consultant was postponed. However, Defendants have identified a potential consultant and \nthe Monitor had the opportunity to speak to him in depth with the needs of the youth at LHS/CLS.  \nThe Monitor is optimistic that the Defendants will enter into a contract as soon as possible with \nthe mental health consultant. It is critical that the programming, staffing, and services that exist at \nLHS/CLS can be evaluated – including for youth with significant mental health needs - and \nrecommendations made on how to address the issues raised and improve treatment and services \nfor youth at LHS/CLS.  \n \nThe Monitor previously recommended that mental health (PSU) staff be integrated more into \noperations in order to provide much needed support for youth and staff. Defendants are continuing \nto expand and increase PSU involvement by: \n1) By reinforcing and utilizing all the various roles of the PSU clinicians such as therapist, crisis \nmanager/negotiator, trainer, consultant, collaborator, and program developer when working with \nthe day-to-day operations and staff members. Encouraging and supporting site staff to collaborate \ndirectly with PSU Clinicians rather than only reaching out to the Supervisor. During this period \nPSU Clinicians have been continuing to develop and utilize these roles to engage, train, equip, and \nsupport paraprofessionals and professionals to collaborate on an effective treatment approach \n(decreasing youth noncompliant behavior) and demeanor with the youth.  \n2)  PSU  Clinicians  have  increased  attendance  at  the  multi-disciplinary  meetings,  increased \nattendance at the unit meetings, increased unit presence, increased involvement on subcommittees \nand project committees, and increased involvement in training, increased initiation of collaborative \nmeetings, and increased communication with unit and education staff.  \n3) The PSU Supervisor and one of the PSU clinicians collaborated with Safety Staff to develop an \nintegrated response plan for youth placed on AC. This effort focused on the provision of intensive \nmental health services in collaboration with safety staff to expedite the successful reintegration of \nyouth back into the general population. This plan was tested by PSU and SYC and continually \nimproved across several weeks.  \n4) The PSU Supervisor sent an email and set up a folder where PSU Clinicians share successful \nplans with other PSU Clinicians responding to AC and crises. Clinicians also inform each other \nthrough email.  \n5) The PSU Supervisor and several PSU clinicians collaborated with the Music Art Initiative \n(MAI) Leader, administration, safety, and education to continue integrating mental-health research \nand practice in developing youth centric programming and projects.  \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 13 of 53\n \n6) A number of groups and projects are being implemented and planned as a result of this \nintegration. This initiative is having a positive influence on the youth and staff. Anecdotal and J-\nTracker evidence indicates this program has been successful in enhancing youth pro-social skills. \nThis collaborative effort between PSU and MAI included work with the Volunteer Coordinator to \ndevelop  a  plan  to  recruit  and  train  volunteer  mentors  and  consultants.  Outcome  variables, \nmeasurement tools, and timelines are being developed to measure  the effectiveness of this \nprogramming. A literature review regarding effectiveness of such programming has begun.  \n7) PSU Clinicians have been included in staff-led activities during the late afternoon and evening \nhours.  Four  PSU  clinicians  have  developed  and  collaborated  with  safety,  unit  staff  in  the \ndevelopment and implementation of staff-led activities. PSU clinicians have integrated mental \nhealth research and practices into these activities. It is anticipated that changes in PSU clinician \nschedules initiated this January 2021 will allow more PSU clinicians to participate in evening \nprogramming.  \nAn administrative plan has been approved to return PSU Clinicians on site for one additional day \neach week. This will go into effect on Jan 17, 2021. In anticipation, PSU Clinicians have begun \nplanning for increased involvement on the units in the late afternoon and evening. This is possible \nthrough the schedule design which allowed for two PSU Clinicians on site until 8 P.M. each \nevening.  PSU Clinicians work remotely and through on-call continue to meet the challenges of \ncovering evening and weekend hours.  \nWeekday hours from 8 A.M.-8 P.M. have been covered by on site PSU Clinicians. With on- site \npresence increasing in January 2021, a second PSU clinician will allow for at least one clinician \nto facilitate groups and engage in staff-led activities. Having two PSU Clinicians available until \n8:00 P.M. also allows for one of these Clinicians to remain dedicated to emergency response and \nconsultation. In addition to having two clinicians working until 8:00 P.M. in January, PSU staff \nhas already implemented 3 new treatment groups occurring during weeknights, from 5:30-7:00. \nTwo groups are developed for the young men and focus on fostering conflict resolution and \ncommunication. The other PSU nighttime group has been developed for the young women of CLS \nand focuses on team building. Finally, a fourth nighttime group by a PSU staff member is expected \nto begin in the next week, which is on Street Art. It will be piloted on an LHS unit (Miller) and is \na Music Art Initiative Group.  \nThe  Defendants  should  continue  to  involve  PSU  staff,  especially  leadership,  in  making \nimprovements at the facility (such as improvements to incentives, consequences, and working with \nthe OJOR system). The Monitor suggested modifying the mental health (PSU) and recreational \nstaff work schedules to include more evening and weekend hours, especially given the lack of \nsufficient other structured activities during those times. There are no groups or programming \ninvolving PSU on the weekends currently, however, starting in January 2021, this should improve \nwith the added in-person staff.  The Monitor continues to recommend that scheduling of PSU be \nreconsidered (rotate staff if need be, alternating weekends, etc.) or if this is not possible, then hire \nadditional PSU staff to work nights and weekends to engage with all youth.  Weekends are when \nthere is the most idle time and need for additional meaningful programming.  Adding weekend \nprogramming will also have a positive impact on reducing incidents of violence and other \nbehavioral incidents related to boredom and lack of activities. There really is a missed opportunity \nfor PSU involvement during this period and particularly during COVID-19 when engagement with \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 14 of 53\n \nfamily, staff, and other youth are reduced.  Hopefully, all of these positive changes (to come) will \nresult in an improved atmosphere for youth and staff.  \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \n \nDefendants have remained committed to ensuring staff accountability in the completion of Visual \nMonitoring safety/wellness checks since launching its Quality Assurance Review (QAR) process in \nAugust 2019.  A report was able to be generated in which 98.8% of 30-minute safety/security checks \nwere recorded during this reporting period.   \n \nAs of September 2020, the scope of the Point-in-Time (PiT) Youth: Staff Ratio was expanded to \ninclude a nighttime analysis of coverage in alignment with PREA standards. Since January 2020, \nonly a daytime analysis was completed to inform programming and resource decisions. The PiT \nYouth: Staff Ratio utilizes Unit-assigned safety staff schedules and youth population for one week \neach month. Data has shown that even during the pandemic, LHS/CLS has continued to maintain \ncoverage supportive of daytime and nighttime ratios that enable enhanced programming and safety \nfor youth and staff alike.  During the month of October 2020, a focused effort was made to closely \nreview all incidents, Guardian tracking and programming across LHS and CLS. Data was recorded \ninto PbS software and continues to inform improvement efforts. On November 1, 2020, CARE \nTeam contacts were transitioned into J-Tracker using the Audit/Shift Log. CARE Team members \nare responsible for logging every hard and soft call they have per shift. The electronic log includes \nthe youth and staff involved, Hard/Soft call, type of issue and if it was resolved. Data can be pulled \ndirectly from the log as needed.  As of December 1st, scars and tattoos are being recorded in J-\nTracker upon a youth’s admission to LHS/CLS. As of December 9, 2020, all current youth (except \nfor those in medical isolation and some who have refused to have pictures taken of scars and \ntattoos) are logged and available for reference.  \n \nTo aid in the completion of quality assurance tasks, an extractable format of search data was \ndeveloped. The report format will facilitate review of search criteria as outlined in the functional \npolicy and procedure drafts for searches of youth and facility.  \nData from the debrief reports was also made into an extractable format which will enable point in \ntime review of the requirements for mechanical restraints and AC placements. This will support \nQuality Assurance staff’s ability to facilitate assurance measures (including response assignments \nwithin J-Tracker) with supervisory or professional staff before or after the Safety Director, Deputy \nSuperintendent, or Superintendent formally review the documented incident debrief form.  \nQuality assurance for visual monitoring has continued to be a focus during the reporting period. \nThe process transitioned to engage Corrections Unit Supervisors with oversight of a Supervising \nYouth Counselor II. The process was transitioned from a “grace” period into standardized \ncommunication requiring specific action items. During this time, two new CUSs have started and \na new Treatment Director (who will supervise CUSs) has been hired. These individuals will all \nplay an important role in continued facilitation of quality assurance reviews.  \nThe CUSs have maintained daily Visual Monitoring reports produced by Guardian and have \nutilized  resources  developed  to  clarify  expectations  for  accountability  measures.  Quality \nAssurance staff collaborates with the assigned SYCII to review inquires and track QA emails to \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 15 of 53\n \nstaff, policy acknowledgements, and competency assessments as required. As stated in previous \nreports, a framework for identified outcome measures was developed to align with PbS national \nbenchmarks.  PbS data collection cycles occur twice annually, and the most recent cycle was in \nOctober 2020.  Facility Improvement Plans (“FIP”) have been created after the most recent PbS \nCoach Site Visit.  As a reminder, PbS is a continuous data-driven improvement model grounded in \nresearch that holds juvenile justice agencies, facilities and residential care providers to the highest \nstandards for operations, programs and services.  The FIPs are the vehicles for jurisdictions to \ncontinuously bring about meaningful change. They bridge the gap between understanding and \nactions to improve the conditions of confinement at a facility, beginning with identifying the \nspecific outcome measure(s) a facility want to improve.  \nFacility Improvement Plan (“FIP”) Progress \nFIP Action Steps \nPbS offers a 7-action step tool, driven by a research-informed improvement model, to support and \nguide PbS participating agencies and facilities as they work to achieve both incremental and \nsustainable change. The action steps entered into the PbS website make up the team's concrete plan \nto attain the improvement you are seeking. \n \n1.  Analysis of Performance  \n•  Pinpoint the causes of your outcome performance. \n2.  Creating Buy-In  \n•  Identify how you will engage those whose support you need to improve the targeted \noutcome or area of change. \n3.  Setting Outcome Measure Goal  \n•  Create short, interim & long-term goals that provide benchmarks and a vision to \nwork toward. \n4.  Improvement Process Action Steps  \n•  Develop concrete, measurable actions to address the factors that contributed to your \noutcome performance. \n5.  Interim Measures  \n•  Identify how you will monitor your progress toward your goals to see what is \nworking and adjust your strategies, as necessary. \n6.  Sustaining Performance  \n•  Identify strategies that will support what is working to ensure sustainable change. \n7.  Performance Recognition  \n•  Determine how you will formally and informally recognize staff, youth, and other \nstakeholders for their contribution to the improvement process; celebrate successes! \nThe following FIP’s were selected and developed after the April 2020 data collection cycle based \non input from the PbS Coach and facility outcome measures. The below FIP’s are in the process of \nbeing updated based on the most recent October 2020 data collection cycle.  However, after \nconsultation with the assigned PbS Coach, the agency should consider closing these FIP’s in favor \nof developing a new one focused on improving the culture and relationships between youth and \nstaff.  Any improvement within these context areas would have mutual improvement in many \ncritical outcome measures.  Without improving the overall culture along with improving the mutual \nrespect between youth and staff, that minimal improvement will be seen within the critical outcome \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 16 of 53\n \nmeasures.  Another thought would be to pilot an FIP on culture and relationships at the CLS, on a \nsmaller scale basis to monitor its impact and then transition the FIP to LJH once it is a proven \neffective.  \nCURRENT/OPEN FIP’s: \nLHS Facility Improvement Plan #1010 \nOutcome Measure \nSafety 02 Injuries to youths per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \nSafety 03 Injuries to staff per 100 \nstaff-days of employment. \nSafety 04 Injuries to youths by other \nyouths per 100 person-days of youth \nconfinement. \nSafety 11 Assaults and fights on \nyouth per 100 person-days of youth \nconfinement. \nSafety 12 Assaults on staff per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \nOutcome Measure  Original Value  Current Value  Average Value  Goal   \nOrder 03Physical restraint use per 100 \n45.00  92.00  18.19  30.00 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \nOrder 04Mechanical restraint use per 100 \n35.00  41.00  10.51  20.00 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \nSafety 02Injuries to youths per 100 \n64.00  73.00  14.11  48.00 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \nSafety 03Injuries to staff per 100 staff-\n19.00  33.00  2.76  0.00 \ndays of employment. \n \nSafety 04Injuries to youths by other \nyouths per 100 person-days of youth  17.00  10.00  3.02  0.00 \nconfinement.   \nSafety 11Assaults and fights on youth per \n38.00  21.00  7.77  5.00 \n100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \nSafety 12Assaults on staff per 100 \n9.00  7.00  3.42  0.00 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 17 of 53\n \nCLS Facility Improvement Plan # 1009 \nOutcome Measure \nOrder 08 Isolation, room \nconfinement, segregation/special \nmanagement unit use per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement.  \n \nOutcome Measure  Original Value  Current Value  Average Value  Goal \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, \nsegregation/special  29.00  11.00  2.75  15.00 \n \nmanagement unit use per 100 \nperson-days of youth \nconfinement. \nA thorough and in-depth review was conducted of the October 2020 PbS data collection for both \nLHS and CLS.  During the review, outcome measure data clarification and input was sought from \nboth the facility PbS State and Site Coordinators and the assigned PbS Coach.  As a result of the \nreview, the following highlights and outcomes are noted: \n \nPbS Data Quality – In the previous report, some issues were identified as to the quality of the data \nentered for some outcome measures, including outcomes measuring around daily activity durations.  \nThrough the review of the October data reports, the Monitor is pleased to report that those issues \nappear to have been resolved.  More importantly, the new Guardian RFID system was used to record \nmuch of the data inputted for the daily Unit Log activity data.  This permitted the facility to \naccurately report the daily activity for all youth, including education, facility programs, recreation, \nleisure time, and “in sleeping rooms” (room confinement), and finally sleeping time. Using the \nGuardian RFID system continues to allow for the tracking of daily activity over the entire data \ncollection month and is providing much more accurate data than was previously being collected.  \nWith the improved data collection, we can now get a better sense for the progress being made.  \nBefore the Monitor begins to outline areas for improvement, it is important to recognize the efforts \nand positive steps forward in regard to the quality of the PbS data and the overall progress in many \nof  the  outcome  measures.    It  is  important  to  remember  that  PbS  is  a  “continuous  facility \nimprovement program,” therefore overall progress is measured over the period of years and \nnumerous data collection cycles.  The trendline of the outcome measures is what is most important \nas it reflects the direction of the facility over time.  The October data clearly shows some positive \nprogress trends moving in the right direction for many of the outcome measures with some having \nmoved in a negative direction.  This is expected given the operational changes occurring as a result \nof the pandemic and supports the Monitor’s critical findings and suggested changes around support \nstaff, education, PSU and other issues related to a lack of programming. \nIt is important to note that both the April and October 2020 data collections took place in the middle \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 18 of 53\n \nof the pandemic, which certainly made facility operations much more challenging, particularly \naround the issue of reducing “operational” room confinement.  In these circumstances, the easy \napproach would have been to put youth in their rooms as much as possible to promote social \ndistancing and reduce the risk of infection.  The Monitor is happy to report that this did NOT occur \nat LHS or CLS.  It certainly appears that the facility continues to make every attempt to maintain \nfacility operations as best possible under these challenging conditions.  This is highly commendable \nand reflects the agency and facility leadership commitment to improving conditions of confinement.  \nHowever again, the Monitor feels that more can be done and achieved if support staff were brought \nback into the facility to help normalize daily activities and programs.  \nWith all that said, there are a couple of outcome measures that bear attention.  First and foremost, \nis what is unquestionably a continued high rate of “self-requested” confinement.  This remains an \nissue from the April cycle and continues into the October cycle with little or no improvement. The \ndata reflects 825 incidents of confinement use during the month of October (754 @ LHS and 71 @ \nCLS).  Of these, there were a total of 676 for self-requested confinement, representing 82% of all \nconfinement for the facility during the month.  This represents an overall increase from 76% of all \nconfinement in April 2020.  One area of improvement was within the confinements related to \n“program refusal”. In April, there were 213 incidents (19% of all confinement) where youth \n“declined to participate in program”.  Program refusals typically result in room confinement which \nis a violation of the Court Order.  These two categories alone represent 95% of all confinement for \nthe month of April.  On one hand, this is a positive as very little confinement is a result of behavior \nissues.  On the other hand, it is also a reflection of the culture, atmosphere and environment which \nresults in such self-selected confinement.  Focusing on improvement on these particular areas of \nconfinement will certainly have an immediate and positive impact on reducing overall confinement \nnumbers.  \nIt is also a positive trend that behavioral related confinement only represents 8% of all confinement \n(8% to “protect youth from other youth”, 1% to “give youth time to cool off”).  To illustrate this \npoint differently, at LHS, there were 679 incidents of confinement unrelated to behavior (self-\nrequested, program refusal, medical, and mental health) compared to 74 incidents related to \nbehavior.  Similar disparity is seen at CLS, where there were 60 confinement incidents unrelated to \nbehavior compared to 11 behavior related incidents. Focus on reducing these types of confinement \nthrough improving the overall atmosphere and environment as well as tying program participation \ninto the incentive and rewards program should have a positive effect.  The overall effort of the \nfacility improvement plans as well as the focus issues of the settlement agreement should also have \na positive impact on these issues. \nAdditionally, the previous report discussed that the unit activity record for the Krueger Unit \nreflected that youth were spending approximately 20.64 hours per day in their rooms (10.5 hours \nreflected as sleeping time and 10.14 hours reflected as “in sleeping rooms,” room confinement, \nmuch of which appears to be self-requested or program refusals).  The activity log for the Krueger \nUnit also did not reflect any hours for education.  The Krueger “program” has since been eliminated \nand the unit now operates as a normal general population unit. As such, this issue seems to have \nbeen resolved as youth are spending considerably less time in their rooms.  The April activity log \nfor the Krueger Unit reflects that youth are spending 3.09 hours per day in education programing; \n4.95 hours per day in leisure activity; 2.45 hours per day in operational activity; 10.73 hours per \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 19 of 53\n \nday in rooms for sleeping; 2.50 hours per day in rooms (operational confinement); with the \nremainder of time identified as 0.09 facility programming; and 0.09 recreation. In comparison, the \nOctober data reflects similar outcomes to the April data with a couple of declining outcome \nmeasures, most likely resulting from operational changes related to the pandemic and reduced \nsupport staff on site to conduct education or other treatment programs.  The October data shows \nKrueger youth spending approximately 11.18 hours in their rooms for “sleeping” time and 2.75 \nhours  in  their  rooms  for  other  reasons.    Education  hours  for  Krueger  youth  declined  to \napproximately 1.5 hours per day (weekdays) and leisure activity time increased to 6.78 hours per \nday. This represents a major portion of their day is spent in meaningless activities occurring within \nthe dayroom area.  \nFinally, the Monitor encourages the facility to closely review all of the PbS data and outcome \nmeasures as a means to better understand the impacts generated from the many changes occurring \nwithin the facility.  Agency and facility leadership should make it a point to review the PbS data \nwith staff at all levels, perhaps during monthly all staff briefing meetings.  This is an opportunity \nto show the positive outcomes being achieved through the various changes and efforts to reduce \nincidents of violence, confinement, and use of restraint. As a result, while much work remains to \nbe done, the data clearly shows that many trend lines are moving in the right direction and providing \na safer environment for staff and youth, particularly within outcome measures reflecting fewer \nassaults and injury rates of staff. \n \nUse of Restraint Outcome Measures - Both LHS and CLS show “0” incidents of use of chemical \nagents (Order 6) during the October 2020 data collection cycle, which is commendable and per the \nSettlement Agreement.  However, the rate of physical restraints (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use \nper 100-person days of confinement) at LHS and CLS remains high and significantly above the \nnational average as does the rate of mechanical restraint (Order 4 – Mechanical Restraint use per \n100-person days of confinement) usage incidents.  While the rate of physical and mechanical \nrestraint uses initially declined at LHS, it rose slightly at LHS during the April and again in the \nOctober 2020 data cycles compared to the October 2019 cycle. This is very typical of a facility \ntransitioning from and eliminating the use of OC (pepper spray) as staff develop new skills for de-\nescalation and behavior response techniques.  As mentioned earlier, this is a continuous facility \nimprovement process which involves complex operational issues.  The following two charts reveal \nthat overall, the trends lines for both physical and mechanical restraint use has taken an upward \ntrend and is moving in the wrong direction from previous data collection cycles.  The Monitor feels \nthat this trend from April and October is more reflective of the lack of meaningful education and \nother programs as a result of the operational changes occurring as a result of the pandemic. \n \n \n \n \n \n(Remainder of page intentionally left blank for formatting.) \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 20 of 53\n \n \nOrder 03 \nPhysical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note: PbS defines Physical Restraints as facility authorized and trained holds used by staff to \nsubdue an otherwise uncontrollable youth in order to prevent the youth from injuring him or \nherself, or others.)   \n \nOrder 04 \nMechanical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Remainder of page intentionally left blank for formatting.) \n \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 21 of 53\n \n \n \n(Note:  PbS  defines  Mechanical  Restraints  as  Mechanical  Devices  used  to  prevent  an \nuncontrollable youth from injuring him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints may only be \nused for short periods of time and must be used under medical supervision.) \nThe previous Monitoring report discussed issues around the reduced use of the Care Teams which \nresulted in a higher number of restraint-usage incidents.  Care Teams are designed precisely to \nreduce the need for the use of restraints and have been effectively shown to work at facilities across \nthe country and have been shown to be effective at LHS and CLS as well. The Agency and facility \nshould continue to expand the use of the Care Team concept and ensure that direct care staff are \ntraining to properly use the Care Team as a de-escalation and use of restraint avoidance response.  \nIt is critical that direct care staff develop skills around total awareness in order to recognize the \nearly signs of pending behavior and incidents in order to engage the Care Team members at the \nearliest possible opportunity.  This in turn increases the opportunities for de-escalation and \nresolution of situations with the use of restraint. The Monitor’s review of Care Team deployments \nand video recordings left the impression that the Care Team concept is not being fully implemented \nunder Care Team concepts.  In one incident, the Monitor observed Care Team members resolving \nthe situation through the use of physical restraint/force.  This goes against the Care Team principals.  \nCare Team members should never be involved in the use of physical restraint of a youth.  This is \ncounterproductive to the concept and does not permit the youth to begin de-escalating if they believe \nthe Care Team member may still use physical force against them.  \nThe Department should continue to implement the core principles of the Care Team model by utilizing \nan agency strategic plan process that involves additional staff training in de-escalation techniques; \ninclude Care Team deployment information in shift debriefings in order to review the process and \nprovide on-going situational training for staff;  implement a Care Team response incident report that \nalso reflects the outcome of the response in order to better track outcomes from Care Team \ndeployments; implement the S.O.D.A.S model (Situation, Options, Disadvantages, Advantages, \nSolution) into the Care Team model; and, finally, the facility leadership team should incorporate \ndaily/weekly review of all use of force/restraint incidents to evaluate if and when the Care Team \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 22 of 53\n \nshould have been activated to help de-escalate a situation.  This should be used as a staff training and \nawareness process to help staff build new skills and to help change their mindsets in how they first \nreact to certain types of youth behaviors. \nIsolation, Room Confinement and Segregation Measures – Overall, the PbS outcome measures \naround isolation and room confinement are improved over the October 2019 PbS data collection \ncycle reflecting that 100% of room confinements are terminated in under eight hours, and slightly \nfewer in under four hours, 92.00% at LHS and 100% at CLS. These are both very commendable \nachievements, and both are better than the national field averages for these outcome measures.  \nThese  rates  also  reflect  improvement  from  the  October  2019  rates.  While  these  rates  are \ncommendable, we continue to see a high rate of initial confinements reflected in Order 8, which \nremains significantly higher than the national field average.  Based on the Monitors review, this is \nclearly occurring as a result of the high numbers of self-requested confinements as reported and \nreflected in the PbS data.    \n \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, segregation/special management unit use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \nAs discussed earlier in this report, there remains an issue around Order 13 – Isolation, Room \nConfinement for reasons not related to behavior.  These appear to primarily be incidents where \nyouth are refusing to participate in programs and education. As you can see from the following \nchart, self-requested and declined to participate in programs involves 95% of the non-behavior \nrelated confinement incidents at LHS and 91% of confinement incidents at CLS.  While the use of \nroom confinement for “self-requested” or “program refusal” declined from the April 2020 data \ncycle, it still remains a very high percentage of confinement usage.  This continues to be a reflection \nfrom the overall behavior management system and lack of appropriate use of incentives and \nrewards.  Youth continue to refuse to go to school and elect to remain in their rooms and, in most \ncases, simply watch TV all day.  Furthermore, while the number of confinements for “program \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 23 of 53\n \nrefusal” declined significantly from the April data, 213 incidents in April to just one in October at \nLHS, this was the result of the facility simply changing the reporting data from a “program refusal” \nto “voluntary confinement”.  Overall, LHS and CLS had a combined 1,000+ incidents of program \nand/or self-requested incidents during the April data collection cycle, which reduced to 677 \nincidents during the October cycle. This is misleading data since youth continue to refuse to \nparticipate in programs. Facility staff need to focus on youth engagement or re-engagement \nstrategies as well as the BMS in order to get youth to participate in programs.  \n \nWhy confinement was used    Lincoln Hills    Copper Lake \nValue  Count  Percent  Count  Percent \nSelf-requested  627  83%  49  69% \nDeclined to participate in program  1  0%  0  0% \nMental Health  2  0  11  15% \nProtect other youths or staff  63  8%  7  10% \nGive youth time to cool off  11  1%  4  6% \nMedical  49  6%  0  0% \nThe PbS Incident reporting data for October 2020 reflects the following important data points: \n➢  22% of the incidents occurred in the Rogers Unit; \n➢  21% of incidents occurred in the Miller Unit; \n➢  99% of all incidents occurred within a living unit; \n➢  47% of incidents involved “Other Misconduct.” \n➢  38% of incidents involved “Group Disturbance”. \n➢  Substantial increase in injuries to youth by staff, Safety 5, at CLS. \n \n \nSafety 05 \nInjuries to youths by staff per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 24 of 53\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSafety 06 \nSuicidal behavior with injury by youths per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \nWhile there appears to be a substantial increase in suicidal behavior with injuries, Safety 06, at \nCLS, review of the actual data reveals that the number of incidents has declined over the last three \ndata collection cycles.

(It should be noted that the pandemic and \nrestrictions around visitation impacted these results.  The facility did increase the use of \ntechnology for video visitation, but these appear to have also declined over recent months.) \n➢  Only 7% of youth responded that staff show residents respect and only 4% of youth responded \nthat staff are good role models. This supports the idea and suggestion that the facilities should \nfocus their FIP efforts on improving the overall culture and relationship between youth and \nstaff. \n \nDefendants should continue to pay particular attention to each Facility Improvement Plan as each \nFIP includes a section for comments relating to the implementation status of each action step \ncompleted by the PbS Site Coordinator or assigned staff member. Ongoing FIP review comments \nare entered by Facility Administrators, Agency Directors, and the assigned PbS Coach.  This is an \nexcellent way to for the agency and facility leadership to monitor on-going progress with each of \nthe FIP goals and to provide input, guidance, and direction during the process. \n \nBased on advice and direction gained through participation in PbS, DJC has decided to reformulate \nand expand their Facility Improvement Planning Committee to further integrate the PbS Facility \nImprovement Plans for each school into our overall daily operations. DJC is seeking to broaden \nthe scope of the steering committee to include a multi-disciplinary team consisting of at least one \nmember representing each work area within the facility. The members involved in this workgroup \nare also going to be a part of developing and implementing additional quality assurance measures \nand tracking consent decree compliance throughout the facility. The Program and Policy Analyst \npositions working on PbS are also concurrently working to update a pre-existing draft PbS policy.     \n \nThe PbS Facility Leads participated in the Distance Learning Webinar (DLW) on December 9, \n \n2020 and the PbS Steering Committee met with PbS coach on December 10, 2020 to review the \nfacilities’ performance profile which is developed from data obtained during the October 2020 \nreporting period. The larger PbS Workgroup will be meeting in January to review the current FIP \nand discuss updates and action steps. It is further recommended that the agency, facility and the \nPbS team members spend considerable time reviewing the PbS Blueprint Domains, particularly \nthose domains focused on Order; Programing; and Safety; Much can be learned from review of \nthese outcome domains and the data associated with them, in particular, those focused on youth \nand staff relationships. \nPolicies and Procedures/Administrative Code \n \nThere were no new policies/procedures finalized in this reporting period.  A Policy, Performance-\nbased Standards, Data and Quality Assurance workgroup dedicated to identifying and strategically \nprioritizing  policy  and  procedure  updates  related  to  the  consent  decree  and  PbS  facility \nimprovement plans has started work on revising important division policies and facility procedures \nrelated to those core facility priorities. Below is the work done on Administrative Code and policies \nand procedures for this reporting period: \n \n \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 29 of 53\n \nAdministrative Code  \nDOC Chapter 373 – DJC has continued to move forward with the rulemaking process.  \nDOC Chapter 376 – DJC Administrator Hermes shared draft with the Monitor in December.  \nDOC Chapter 347 – (county facilities) the public hearing occurred on September 9, 2020 and final \napproval is pending. (This is not a DJC Administrative Rule)  \n \nPolicy and Procedure  \nDrafts of the policy and procedures below will be forwarded to the DJC Policy Committee for \nreview in February:  \n900.04.01 – CARE Team  \n300.05.09 Searches of Youth   \n300.05.17 – Searches of Facilities  \n \nNote: The drafting process of Searches of Youth and Searches of Facilities has facilitated training \nenhancements planned for 2021.  \nTraining  \nDJC  certified  trainers  provided  the  first  round  of  multiple  All-Day,  drop-in  refresher \ntrainings/drills with practice scenarios to support skill retention and continued application of \nVerbal Judo skills. The Verbal Judo curriculum was taught to all staff who work with youth \nthrough 8-hour trainings held this summer. Verbal Judo aligns with Professional Communication \nmodule of POSC (Use of Force curriculum)  and fosters staff confidence in effectively de-\nescalating conflict or potential violent encounters with youth.  \nIn  addition  to  MANDT,  Verbal  Judo  provides  another  paradigm  to  teach  complimentary \ntechniques and build de-escalation skills to enhance safety and treatment supportive environments. \nLed  by  PSU’s  Dr.  Schoen,  MANDT  Refresher  trainings  held  during  the  reporting  period \nhighlighted Active Listening as a key skill for de-escalating situations when engaging youth. \nReinforcement of skill will remain a continued focus with the addition of quarterly Verbal Judo \nDrills.  \nA Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all supervisors to outline \nall of the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under which a strip search may be \ncompleted. With support from the Bureau of Training and Development, Quality Assurance and \nTraining staff developed a DJC Searches of Youth Training module on Cornerstone eLearning to \ninclude policy highlights, video demonstration of search technique, and assessment questions that \nwill be assigned to all safety staff in the first months of 2021.  \nSYCs will also coordinate at shift change in-person competency checks in which safety staff will \nneed to demonstrate the use of proper search techniques. Finally, the STOPS acronym (Systematic, \nThorough, Objective, Preventative, and Safe) will be utilized to underscore best practices for \nsearches of youth and facility-wide areas during future training opportunities that will include \nsupport from the Field Training Officers (FTO) Program.  \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 30 of 53\n \nIn partnership with the Training Center in DOC Central Office, trainings directly connected with \naccountability measures for the consent decree (including De- escalation, Trauma Informed Care, \nUse  of  Force,  Searches,  Observation,  and  Visual  Monitoring)  that  are  trained  during  YC \nAcademies will be entered into Cornerstone Training Records separately to streamline reports. \nCurrently  Cornerstone  maintains  record  of  YC  participation  in  a  particular  Academy;  this \nmodification of practice will eliminate the need to cross reference Academy training schedules and \nclass lists for particular core training topics. With greater ease in gathering this information, \naccessibility  and  reference  for  additional  follow-up  needs  will  be  enhanced.  Training  is \nfoundational to supporting staff and maintaining a culture of accountability. Quality Assurance \nstaff  continue  to  work  closely  with  Training  staff  to  bridge  the  natural  connection  for \norganizational improvements.  \nThe Monitoring team had the opportunity to review several use of force videos.  Video review \nshould be conducted regularly in order to teach, coach, and train staff. Defendants need to continue \nto develop the CARE team in order to maximize the effectiveness to prevent, de-escalate, and \nresolve youth incidents.  Based on video observed by the Monitor, leadership should re-evaluate \nthe team to ensure that staff utilized possess and display the skills necessary to de-escalate youth. \nOnly those staff who have a proven ability to de-escalate and have built a trusting and respectful \nrelationship with youth should be CARE team members.  CARE team members should not be \ninvolved in the use of force that they were called upon to de-escalate.  This is contrary to their \npurpose and mission.   \nStaff wellness remains an important issue and one that continues to impact the overall culture and \natmosphere.  Staff’s overall wellbeing and anxiety remains high, as does the staff fear for safety \nlevels.  As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts the overall \nculture, atmosphere and environment of the facility.  Staff wellness has a direct impact on the \nrelationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, use of restraint, \nand the use of isolation and confinement.  It is clear from the Monitor’s interactions with staff \nduring the site visit that staff wellness is an issue.  High levels of anxiety, stress, increased \nworkloads on direct care staff as well as the reduce support staff assistance is having a profound \nimpact on their wellness and, in turn, negatively impacting the overall environment.  \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 31 of 53\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nincorporate the Court Order into final policy and procedure –and if this improvement is \nsustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for three days.  If Defendants \nincorporate the Court Order into final policy and procedure –and if this improvement is \nsustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation and video show that \nthere  are  instances  of  confinement  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  Administrative \nConfinement – there is no risk of imminent physical harm - and appear to impermissibly \nconstitute punitive confinements. The Monitor recommended creating a policy which clearly \noutlines the criteria for administrative confinement so that staff cannot punitively confine \nyouth. If this does not change, Defendants will be in non-compliance in the next report. \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he \nor  she  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.

The Sex Offender Treatment group was not interrupted and is \ncontinuing.    Data  regarding  \"intensive  mental-health  services\"  (IMHS)  is  collected  in \nvarious ways. PSU clinicians document an overview of the intensive mental health services \nin J- Tracker and on EMR. The format of this reporting can be viewed in the attached \nGuidance Document. Due to confidentiality, additional details regarding mental-health \nservices  are  documented  in  EMR  under  case  management.  The  overarching  goal  of \nproviding intensive mental health services is to safely reintegrate the youth back into the \ngeneral population immediately after placing the youth on AC and to maintain youth success \nwhile off AC. The IMHS developed for a youth reintegrating from AC, are repeatedly re-\nevaluated and adjusted as needed.  \n \nPSU clinicians provide intensive mental-health services to each youth on AC through a \ndetailed process outlined in the Guidance document. Currently, all PSU clinicians have been \ntrained in DBT. All YC Academies have included overviews of DBT and facility-wide \ntraining of Skills Groups/Coaching is scheduled to start in the early part of 2021 for DBT \nSystem of Care.  \nA form was developed that SYCs and YCs give to youth as soon as they are placed AC. This \nis called the “Thinking Report and Youth Statement”. This form reflects the elements of a \nchain analysis referred to in the Guidelines. This paperwork is available to the PSU clinician \nfollowing up with the youth during and after AC.  \nEach youth on AC already has a youth plan (previously called Behavioral Management Plan \nBMP) developed collaboratively between PSU and the youth. These plans are preventative \nas they outline youth triggers, self-soothing strategies, and highlight treatment issues. These \nplans also provide input into the development of effective mental-health services to be \nprovided to the youth while in AC. This youth plan is also consulted when developing a \nspecific treatment plan for AC-specific intensive mental health services. It, along with the \nattached  Guidance  document,  guides  the  collaborative  effort  amongst  various  staff  to \nprovide youth with immediate and comprehensive mental-health services while on AC.  \nAll involved staff use the AC flow chart (within the Guidance document) to guide decision \nmaking and action while a youth is on AC. While the SYC notifies PSU soon after the youth \nis  placed  in  AC,  the  SYC  and  YC  may  reference  the  youth  plan  to  incorporate  the \nrecommendations of PSU to de-escalate agitation. As soon as possible, SYC contacts PSU. \nWhen PSU is contacted, the PSU clinician reviews the mental health needs of the youth. This \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 34 of 53\n \naids in the first determination of whether AC is contraindicated. PSU provides immediate \nconsultation and treatment recommendations to the SYC. By the 2-hour mark, the PSU \nclinician begins a risk assessment if the youth is unresponsive to the initial treatment and \nhave not reintegrated back into GP. PSU clinicians collaborate with the Safety staff and \ncontinue to evaluate youth response to services.  \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit.  Majority of checks 98.8% were completed within 30 \nminutes. QA should be developed and completed with use of video to confirm that checks \nwere completed in compliance with policy and this Court Order.   \n \nEfforts have been made, but the Monitor believes staff and youth will benefit from a \nmental health expert to evaluate the program and make recommendations to, among other \nthings, ensure these services are being provided, including while youth are in AC. The \nDefendants have identified a consultant. Policy and procedure and a quality assurance \nreview process needs to be implemented, and documentation needs to be streamlined.   \n \nThe Monitor is very concerned that staff are placing youth in Administrative Confinement \nwhen it is not warranted, and that staff are not evaluating early release based on behavior.  \nIf data continues to reflect this, the Defendants will be in non-compliance.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    There  were  eleven  (11)  youth \nconfined for over four (4) hours this reporting period (see response in previous question). All \nof the confinements were recommended by PSU.  Eight (8) of the eleven (11) extensions were \nrecommended within PSU documentation. In general, the remaining three (3) related to the \ncoordination of follow-up and release.  Intensive treatment provided to the youth included \ncompleting thinking reports, discussing alternative, making safety plans, engaging the youth \nin mediation, reviewing motivations, and reviewing coping strategies.  \nDefendants are accurately capturing confinement time, number total placements, average \nconfinement time per month, and number of days without AC placements. Defendants now \nneed to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring they are following this Court \nOrder, draft policy and procedure with AC placement criteria, and continue to QA this data. \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 35 of 53\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were youth transferred to \nMJTC but there were no transfers as a result of extended placements in administrative \nconfinement. Defendants need to improve their quality of data and documentation with \nrespect  to  the  “commenced  plan”  and  incorporate  the  Court  Order  into  policy  and \nprocedure.   \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours. Defendants need to improve their quality of data and \ndocumentation with respect to the “commenced plan” and incorporate the Court Order into \npolicy and procedure.    \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated.  The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. A quality \nassurance mechanism needs to be finalized. \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 36 of 53\n \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. The Monitor recommended that Defendants replace the \nexisting room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for \nsecure environments.  The new replacement furniture is consistent with what the Monitor \nwould expect to see in a secure facility and should certainly reduce the opportunity for \nsuicidal incidents within the youth rooms. All youth are housed on renovated units.  This \nis a huge investment by Defendants and shows their commitment to complying with this \nprovision but more importantly, creating a safer environment for youth and staff. \nThe Monitor did observe several rooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas \nof the room. Staff can clearly see into youth rooms now that the windows do not have \netching and are not covered by paper/pictures.  Room searches did occur during this \nreporting period.  The Monitor recommended that searches continue to be completed and \ndocumented in the last report.   \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor  was unable assess compliance as to the 30- minute \nsafety/security checks.    Defendants were able to pull data related to 30-minute room \nchecks.    There  are  some  instances  of  non-compliance,  but  vast majority  have  been \ncompleted within 30-minutes.  Defendants have created a very detailed action plan to \nimprove compliance and accountability measures. Defendants need to modify their policy \nand  procedure  related  to  safety/welfare  checks  and  hold  staff  accountable  when \nappropriate.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues \nto recommend increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every \n15  minutes  when  youth  are  confined  to  their rooms  as  this  is supported  by  JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \nDefendants should be commended for the vast improvement on these safety/welfare \nchecks and for investing in the technology needed. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation, and incorporate the Court Order into \npolicy and procedure, they will be close to reaching substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 37 of 53\n \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented (see previous compliance assessment responses). Since PSU staff are \nnot physically present on weekends and some evening hours (outside of the four hours they \nare required to do), PSU staff cannot engage youth in a meaningful way during this time.   \n \nA quality assurance program needs to be developed. As previously stated, the Monitor \nsuggests that the Defendants consider utilizing an expert in order to further develop the \nmental health program/integration at LHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Evaluations are completed and \nwithin  24  hours  after being  placed  in  room  confinement.  There  were  no  instances  of \ncontraindication documented during this review period. PSU clinicians developed a protocol \nfor on-call situations. Each primary PSU clinician reviews the record, assesses the risk and \ndesignates whether the risk is  low, medium, or high. The risk factors considered are \nsupported by the literature on isolation and confinement. This determination is recorded in \nthe mental-health caseload report which is accessible to all of PSU clinicians. The on-call \nPSU clinician uses this risk level determination and considers the input from the SYC placing \nthe youth in confinement to make a determination whether the placement (each time) will be \ndeemed contraindicated.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 38 of 53\n \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants were able to provide \ndata related to 30-minute room checks during this reporting which the Monitor reviewed \non-site (see previous responses for details).  There are some instances of non-compliance.  \nDefendants  have  created  a  very  detailed  action  plan  to  improve  compliance  and \naccountability  measures.  There  were  no  formal  investigations/discipline  relating  to \nSafety/Security  Checks  and/or  COVID-19  in  the  months  of  September,  October,  and \nNovember.  However,  two  staff  were  referred  to  Human  Resources  for  a  Letter  of \nExpectation (which provides formal documentation for the personnel file but is not yet \nofficial discipline) following a third occurrence of a late safety check.  \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone.  \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model.  \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and utilized. Once Defendants make \nthese improvements, they will be close to substantial compliance. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general.  The on-call PSU clinician \ncommunicates to all the PSU clinicians through email that a youth has been placed on AC. \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 39 of 53\n \nThis allows the primary clinician to provide consultation and direction as to how to return \nthe youth to a baseline, self-regulated state. The primary clinician consults with the on-call \nclinician and with the SYC/YC/CUS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the  youth plan \naddresses the issues at hand and how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. A PSU \nclinician follows up in the absence of the primary clinician and/or the crisis clinician. PSU \ncollaborates with the SYC and direct staff. PSU also meets with the youth while they are on \nAC and through a follow-up session. The social worker and youths’ meeting schedules are \nindividualized. Therefore, as is the case with any arising short-term scheduling conflicts (e.g., \ncourt, medical needs, OJOR, AC etc.) the social worker works with the youth to identify \navailability  if  an  AC  placement  occurs  during  regularly  scheduled  meeting.  The  AC \nplacement also provides an opportunity for the social worker and the youth to review AC \nplacement  as  outlined  in  a  new  J-Tracker  form.  With  shared  awareness  around  AC \nplacement,  Social  Workers  are  positioned  to  incorporate  cognitive-behavioral  or \nmotivational interviewing practices in revisiting goals from the Youth Growth Plan.  \nDocumentation,  quality  assurance,  and  policy  and  procedure  need  to  be \nimproved/completed.  \n \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  During  the  pandemic,  various \nchanges have occurred. One of these adaptations resulted in more individualized scheduling \nof treatment; group treatment did not resume until November 16, 2020. Now, as is the case \nwith any arising short-term scheduling conflicts (e.g., court, medical needs, OJOR, AC etc.) \ntreatment staff will identify the next available time to meet with the youth to make-up and \ntailor  the  material  to  support  the  youth  in  successfully  continuing  in  rehabilitative \nprogramming. For example, if a 2-hour placement in AC occurs during regularly scheduled \nSkills Streaming group time, treatment staff will re-engage the youth in making progress in \ntreatment. The placement may allow for tailored cognitive- behavioral processing (with \npotential integration of Carey Guides, BITs, Social Skill, or Thinking Report etc.) between \nthe youth and the treatment facilitator in addition to continuance in standard treatment \ncurriculum.  Defendants need to focus and make certain (document and QA) on providing \nrehabilitative  programming  that  was  scheduled/in  process  before  placement  in  room \nconfinement.  \n \niii.         Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 40 of 53\n \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. In general (prior to COVID-19) \neducational services for general population occurred in the classrooms in the school area.  \nCOVID-19  has  changed  how  the  educational  services  are  being  provided  to  youth  at \nLHS/CLS.  On March 24, the schools began providing education on the units with most \neducation staff working off-site. Staff are learning various Google tools to assist with virtual \nlearning.  Applicable staff continue to be monitoring e-mail, conducting phone calls, and \nperforming  Zoom/video  calls.    The  Monitor  strongly  recommends  that  educational \nprogramming be re-evaluated.  The Monitor also recommends that educational services be \ncompleted off the unit when possible. Low population and staffing would allow for this.  \nThe Monitor feels that the facility needs to increase the daily education hours as best \npossible as this will have a positive impact on meaningful programs and reduce youth \nidleness.  Additionally, Defendants need to ensure that special education is provided while \non administrative confinement.  As stated previously in this report, the PbS education data \nshows youth are receiving about 3.75 hours per day (weekdays) of education at LHS and \n3.84 hours per day (weekdays) of education at CLS.  While this remains fairly steady to \nprevious data reporting cycles, it remains below the national average.  More importantly, \nthe Monitor’s observations during the site visit revealed that the quality of the education \nprogram is significantly reduced as a result of the “virtual learning” platform which is \noccurring on the living units.  The Defendants should further engage the education expert to \nmake further recommendations that should be implemented, including an assessment of the \nquality and benefits of the online education system Defendants are using. The Defendants \nalso need to focus on bringing more programming into LHS/CLS, especially programming \nculturally relevant and specific to the race and genders of the youth who are at the facility. \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  “Out  time”  has  significantly \nimproved over the last year.  In general, youth are out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.  \nexcept for youth in isolation due to Covid-19 safety measures implemented by Defendants and \nany confinement recommended by PSU.  The Defendants issued a directive regarding periods \nof “self-reflection.” Through the use of data, they were able to capture instances of staff \nplacing youth in rooms for periods of self -reflection and addressing with staff.  The Monitor \nregularly saw youth conversing with other youth during out time which is substantially on \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 41 of 53\n \nthe unit. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  Defendants are able to track when youth eat meals in room \nwhich is an improvement from last reporting period. There were some instances of youth \neating meals in rooms-albeit few. Policy and procedure need to incorporate this section of \nthe Court Order and youth should be eating out of their rooms unless there is a substantial \nthreat of physical harm. \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving much more than the 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week. If \nDefendants improve their quality of data and documentation, and incorporate the Court \nOrder into policy and procedure, they will be in substantial compliance. \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement. The \nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. However, the process and forms need to be \nenacted and written into policy. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room  confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 42 of 53\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis  more  consistently,  including  when  less  restrictive  means  were  attempted. \nDocumentation needs to continue to be completed and consistently applied to all situations. \nDocumentation, data collection and reliability, and quality assurance (with video review) \nneeds to continue to be improved. Also, documentation needs to be created that prove a \nyouth was promptly provided with the report upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  There needs to be continued focus on training, skills development and coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  eliminated.  \nThere  needs  to  be  continued  focus  on  training,  skills  development  and  coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, but data and documentation show that \nthere have been uses of mechanical restraints in LHS and CLS during this reporting period. \nDefendants need to focus on reducing the use of mechanical (as well as physical) restraints.  \nDefendants need to document and establish that there were not less restrictive means \navailable and quality assurance measures, and a final policy and procedure are in place.  As \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 43 of 53\n \ndiscussed in previous sections of this report, the use of both physical and mechanical \nrestraints has trended upward over the last two data collection cycles.  The Monitor believes \nthis is a reflection of the lack of meaningful activities, programs, education and the need to \nenhance  the  behavior  management  system,  including  more  robust  and  meaningful \nincentives and rewards for youth.  Most concerning in the data is that both the rate and \nnumber  of  uses  of  restraint  rose  during  the  October  2020  data  cycle,  substantially \nincreasing the jurisdictional rates well above the national average.   \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Use  of  mechanical  restraints  is \nslightly lower this reporting period in LHS and higher in CLS.  \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \nOctober 2019:     36 uses \nNovember 2019:   21 uses \nDecember 2019:   33 uses \nJanuary 2020:     25 uses \nFebruary 2020:    37 uses \nMarch 2020:     38 uses \nApril 2020:     37 uses  \nMay 2020:    27 uses \nJune 2020:    20 uses \nJuly 2020:                      30 uses \nAugust 2020:    65 uses \nSeptember 2020:  38 uses \nOctober 2020:    43 uses \nNovember 2020:  26 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \nOctober 2019:     10 uses \nNovember 2019:   11 uses \nDecember 2019:    5 uses \nJanuary 2020:      8 uses \nFebruary 2020:     2 uses \nMarch 2020:      7 uses \nApril 2020:      6 uses  \nMay 2020:     0 uses \nJune 2020:     0 uses \nJuly 2020:      0 uses \nAugust 2020:                  0 uses \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 44 of 53\n \nSeptember 2020:   4 uses \nOctober 2020:     4 uses \nNovember 2020:   0 uses \nDocumentation needs to be improved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm \nexisted, and when and how that decision is reviewed. Defendants do have critical outcome \nmeasures for restraints.  Defendants need to continue to work towards reducing the use of \nmechanical restraints, develop better documentation and quality assurance measures. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were four (4) uses of the \n“wrap”  (full  body  restraint)  during  this  reporting  period  (one  use  occurred  during \ntransport by a different agency).  The “wrap” is a restraint device that falls under this \nsection and needs to be monitored for usage compliance.  The wrap should only be used in \nsituations in which PSU has ordered and/or authorized its use in order to prevent active \nself-harm. In these cases, PSU did not order the wrap.  Improved documentation, policy \nrevisions, and quality assurance measure need to be created to better monitor use of such \nrestraint devices.   \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Leg restraints were used during this \nreporting period. In each use, the leg restraints were placed as part of a routine use of \nforce/restraint process in which the youth was non-compliant and/or combative.  In one \nsituation, a CARE team member placed the leg restraint on a youth which ideally should not \noccur.  Documentation has improved relative to when restraints have been used and the \nrationale for usage. However, restraints are being used more frequently than they should be. \nDefendants need quality assurance measures and need to continue to focus on reducing the \nuse of restraints.  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 45 of 53\n \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.   Defendants need to focus on \nreducing  the  use  of  mechanical  restraints  and  ensuring  use  is  not  for  punishment.  \nDefendants  need  to  improve  documentation,  policy  revisions,  and  quality  assurance \nmeasures. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With better documentation, policy revisions, and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants will be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation. However, de-escalation training needs to be completed more often \n(regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue to develop this skill. These skills \nare  also  important  to  help  staff  identify  and  prevent  situations  which  might  lead  to \ndisruption or altercations before such incidents occur Proper de-escalation cannot be \ntrained only once, or even only once a year.  DBT implementation will be very beneficial to \nyouth and staff.   \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be left  alone  in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n45 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 46 of 53\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With policy revisions and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.  (note: data reflected there was one youth in mechanical restraints for more than \n45 minutes but upon further investigation, this was documented in error.) \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented as part of the Incident Debrief process.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches in this \nreporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth will be reviewed at the \nDJC Policy Committee meeting in February 2021. It can then be finalized following review \nby Administration and Legal. Training and related quality assurance measures will be \naddressed in the procedure. A Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and \nshared  with  all  supervisors  to  outline  all  the  necessary  criteria  and  documentation \nrequirements under which a strip search may be completed. With support from the Bureau \nof Training and Development, Quality Assurance and Training staff developed a DJC \nSearches of Youth Training module on Cornerstone eLearning to include policy highlights, \nvideo demonstration of search technique, and assessment questions that will be assigned to \nall safety staff in the first months of 2021.  \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \n46 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 47 of 53\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches this \nreporting period. The policy for searches needs to be finalized and QA developed. Defendants \nare very close to being in substantial compliance. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  If  documentation  and  policy \nrevisions are made, substantial compliance will be obtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches during \nthis  reporting  period.  If  documentation  and  policy  revisions  are  made,  substantial \ncompliance will be obtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  no  strip  searches \nconducted this reporting period. If policy revisions are made, substantial compliance will be \nobtained. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records reviewed \nindicate that all staff have been trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved and policy and procedure/QA developed.  \n \n4.       Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \n47 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 48 of 53\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The  process  for  tracking  and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. With continued practices and QA developed, Defendants will be in \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As stated in the last report, staff have \nbeen trained in MANDT and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. \nLHS/CLS secured Wisconsin Department of Administration grant funding to allow ten (10) \ninstructors to complete train the trainer trainings and subsequently provide Eight-hour \nVerbal Judo training sessions to all staff who work with youth with the goal of reducing risk \nfor injury and enhancing staff confidence at effectively de-escalating conflict or potential \nviolent encounters with youth.  \n \nCompetency testing was administered for all staff completing training and the scores from \nthe competency exam were tracked as part of a quality assurance measure underscoring the \nimportance  utilizing  well  trained  de-escalation  techniques.  DJC  certified  trainers  will \ncontinue to provide quarterly refresher trainings with practice scenarios to support skill \nretention and continued application of Verbal Judo skills at the facility going forward. \n \nDJC  certified  trainers  provided  the  first  round  of  multiple  all-day,  drop-in  refresher \ntrainings/drills with practice scenarios to support skill retention and continued application \nof Verbal Judo skills. The Verbal Judo curriculum was taught to all staff who work with \nyouth through 8-hour trainings held this summer.  \n \nIn addition to MANDT, Verbal Judo provides another paradigm to teach complimentary \ntechniques  and  build  de-escalation  skills  to  enhance  safety  and  treatment  supportive \nenvironments. Led by PSU, MANDT Refresher trainings held during the reporting period \nhighlighted Active Listening as a key skill for de-escalating situations when engaging youth. \nReinforcement of skill will remain a continued focus with the addition of quarterly Verbal \nJudo Drills.  \n \nQuality Assurance has initiated discussion regarding opportunities to streamline reports for \nspecific trainings to reduce the need to cross-reference Academy schedules and class rosters. \nIn addition, the Accountability Tracker  was previously developed  in partnership with \nHuman Resources and made accessible to Leadership to help Supervisors identify needs \nrelated to the consent decree and facilitate corrective action. Because quality assurance \nincludes progressive follow-up which may include re- training, training dates have been \ndetermined Therefore, continued conversation and coordination is needed to efficiently \nmaintain these records; at this time, related documentation is shared.  \n \n48 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 49 of 53\n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  understands  that \nchanges had to be made during the pandemic, however, inadequate programming and \nexcessive idle time is still a problem. Hopefully, the new Program Director can focus on this \nas it is critical to the wellness of youth and staff. The Defendants have created daily schedules \nwhich is a good step in the right direction.  During this reporting period, the following \nprograms occurred: \nFall Fun Days and Ropes Course was held during this reporting period. Youth were able to \nsign up in advance once completing 10 Edgenuity activities and free from a recreation \nrestriction. Leadership has encouraged staff led activities and coupled support with food \nincentives  to  encourage  prosocial  interactions  among  youth  and  with  staff  while \nparticipating in tournaments and unit activities.             \nYouth were encouraged by staff and School Psychologist to participate in the 2021 CEA-W \nCreativity Contest by submitting a sample of creative writing and/or original artwork for \nconsideration. Submissions were accepted through December 1, 2020.  \nTwo youth from LHS participated in the first ever Youth Forum, sponsored by CJJA, the \nBehavioral Health Committee, on a panel discussion (via Zoom) regarding Social and Racial \nJustice Issues. The event also included art displays and a motivational speaker. The two \nyouth from LHS participated along with youth from 3 other states.  \nThe oversite of the music program has been transferred to PSU and coined as MAI (Music \nArt initiative) to provide increased opportunities for therapeutic expression. A Street Art \ngroup will be piloted in Miller soon. PSU has implemented three other evening treatment \ngroups- two for young men focusing on communication and conflict resolution and one for \nyoung women focusing on teambuilding.  \nLHS/CLS  Psychology  interns  are  becoming  more  active  in  supporting  youth  through \nengagement in evening staff-led activities and integration of research. On Thanksgiving, the \nphones were accessible throughout the day, and as we near the holidays, a Living Unit \ndecoration contest is creating excitement with youth. Youth absolutely loved this contest! \nA Zoom cart and job aide have been sent out to provide instructions to staff within the living \nunits.  Within  structured  study  hall,  time  is  set  for  students  to  participate  in  Special \nEducation Resource, Welding, Construction, Greenhouse, meeting with Social Workers, etc. \nAll youth have continued to have access to library materials with the new schedule as before. \nOne day a week, youth will be pulled in small groups from the gym to return and check out \nnew library materials. If a living unit is on quarantine status, there is a bin that will be \n49 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 50 of 53\n \ndelivered to the living unit with a folder containing library requests. The youth can fill out \nthe form, and the staff in the school do their best to accommodate the items.  \nWith the November 16, 2020, implementation of the integrated school and program schedule, \nall youth are now scheduled in unit-based group of Skill Streaming the Adolescent. The \nAdministrators’ memo to counties outlines the change in cognitive behavioral treatment \nprogramming.  \nLeadership continues to integrate youth feedback and increase incentives offered to youth. \nIn response to youth survey suggestions, weekly movie orders (using Netflix subscription for \nfresh and new release options) and monthly video game orders are now available. Youth \nfeedback also resulted in the Business Office ordering additional hair care and other desired \nproducts such as Old Spice. Popular items were suggested for holiday gifts and for weekly \nraffle items. The youth also received Halloween candy this year and were able to enjoy Oreo \npackages given to each youth as an incentive following the last COVID-19 test at the end of \nNovember which aligned with Thanksgiving.  \nOn Mondays, teachers choose two or three youth from each unit that have made progress \nwith their on-line learning platform. They look at how many activities, quizzes and time on \ntask youth spend and award them with a treat of their choice or a 5 by 7 picture of themselves \nto send home.  \nAs a precursor and support of the youth’s transition to the DBT System of Care, an \nEngagement Raffle was instituted November 16, 2020, to reinforce prosocial engagement in \ntreatment groups and evening staff directed activities. As determined by the facilitator, \nyouth can earn raffle tickets for attendance and engaged participation during role plays and \nactivities. Raffle tickets are drawn weekly on Sunday nights with youth winning exclusive \nhygiene items that are not available on the canteen list.  \nDuring this reporting period, various food incentives have also been implemented with a \nrange of options supported by Food Service as ordered by any Supervisor. Supervisors may \nalso receive support from the Business Office to procure food from an outside establishment \nor request specialized purchases. SYCs have organized tournaments and contests across \nliving units.  Led by Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council ITW (Indian Tribes of Wisconsin) \nyouth programming, the making of fry bread continues to be a cultural staple for youth and \nstaff.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and \nvolunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for youth.  Administration \nneeds to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours to further reduce youth \nidleness hours. As mentioned previously, increasing education hours, including for youth \nwho have obtained a diploma or HSED, can greatly assist in reducing idleness time and \nprovide positive youth development strategies through meaningful education and vocational \nprogramming.   \n \n50 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 51 of 53\n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018 \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. (see previous section on staffing for \nmore details). As previously stated, Defendants should continue to focus on training and \ndeveloping staff for them to feel safe and actively engage with youth.   \n \nAs stated in previous reports, the OJOR process could be expedited and youth should be \nevaluated  for  placement  under  community  supervision,  including  intensive  community \nsupervision, as permitted by state law.  Doing so would likely also facilitate keeping youth \ncloser to their home communities, and closer to more programming and culturally relevant \nservices. Defendants need to continue to work towards developing smaller, geographically \nlocated Type 1 facilities and also to evaluate whether there are alternative kinds of facilities \nand/or intensive community services to which youth could be released. There does not seem \nto be any more progress made as this section. This needs to be a priority or Defendants will \nnot be able to come into substantial compliance with this Court Order.  \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  (see previous section for details). \nDefendants need to continue drafting interim policies for LHS/CLS while also developing \nfinal Code revisions. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \n51 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 52 of 53\n \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There has been a vast improvement \nin meeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority \nof cases.  When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a \ncorrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). A framework for other QA measures relating to the consent \ndecree was being created but has not been completed.                \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout this report, \ndata driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and to \nimprove the quality of life for youth and staff.  The Monitor remains confident that the \nDefendants will create a competent quality assurance program especially with the addition \nof the new RFID system, the new leadership team, and dedicated personnel. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Monitor recognizes how difficult COVID-19 has been for everyone at LHS/CLS- staff and \nyouth alike.  The Monitor is pleased that many key positions have been hired for which in turn \nshould have a positive impact on the daily life of youth and staff.  There are several key initiatives \nunderway this reporting period such as training/implementing DBT, identifying a mental health \nconsultant, increase of staff-led activities, and additional staff training and development. In time, \nthis should result in positive outcomes for youth.  The Monitor remains very concerned over the \ncontinuing lack of adequate and meaningful activities and programming for youth which leads to \nextreme boredom and can result in anti-social behavior. This concern has become more evident \nwith recent operational changes, particularly around the manner in which education is being \nprovided during the pandemic.  The education program is not providing youth with adequate \nlearning opportunity or support. The facility would benefit from an increased focus on reducing \nidleness, particularly during weekends and evening hours.  The Defendants have to identify ways to \nmove youth off of their home units more.   This is even more important during the changes to daily \nlife due to COVID-19.  The facility should continue to work on improving the behavior management \nsystem, continue with their progress in implementing DBT, providing improved and increased youth \nincentives that will help in reducing many behavioral incidents and reduce the high number of self-\nrequested confinements and program refusals. Continued efforts need to be made to further engage \nthe educational expert, reduce teacher vacancies, and increase educational time and quality. Regular \ntraining in de-escalation and physical restraint techniques need to continue to occur. Policies and \nprocedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be developed as well as administrative code. Continued \n52 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 121   Filed: 01/25/21   Page 53 of 53\n \nimplementation of the new quality assurance program needs to remain a primary goal.   \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n53 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n ELEVENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Tenth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on July 26, 2021. The Monitor’s eleventh \nreport  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree,  implementation  of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the tenth site visit which took place on June 24, 2021.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe eleventh site visit by the Monitor took place on October 14, 2021.  Due to the pandemic, the \nMonitor limited onsite time to one day and completed necessary interviews/information gathering \nvia in-person and virtual meetings prior to and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed materials \nprovided by the parties prior to and after the site visit for the reporting period ending September \n30, 2021. Materials included but were not limited to: use of force videos, video footage of units \nand safety and security checks, COVID-19 related memos, directives and plans, programming \nmaterials, discipline documents, investigations, PREA investigations, various staff memos, daily \nshift reports, policies, and all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order \n(June, July, August, and September 2021), updated unit rules, updated post orders, work rules, \nmeeting  notes,  employee  leave  data,  behavior  and  treatment  plans,  mechanical  restraint \ndocumentation, incident reports, and other housing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ \ncounsel and the monitoring team were on site during this site visit. Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted \nyouth interviews virtually before the visit, and in person during the visit. The Monitor toured \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 2 of 32\n \nLHS/CLS and interviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to the majority \nof youth and staff present and available during the site visit. Approximately forty-nine youth (49) \nyouth and thirty-one (31) staff were interviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.   \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction \n \nAll of the COVID-19 modifications (health screenings, intake process, and quarantine process) \nwere still in place during this reporting period. The COVID-19 precautions have remained \nconsistent with the CDC’s guidance for congregate settings.  In person visitations has resumed as \nof July 2021. There have been nine (9) youth COVID-19 cases and eleven (11) staff cases. This \nmarks a substantial increase from the last report, in which there were no youth cases. COVID-19 \nvaccinations continue to be offered to every youth meeting the CDC guidelines. Approximately \n27 youth have received both or one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 youth cases \nwere able to be contained to one individual living unit.  \n \nThe total LHS/CLS population continues to remain low, although slightly higher, ranging in the \nhigh 50s to lower 60s.  The overall atmosphere significantly improved from the last visit.  There \ncontinues to be concern regarding programming (although improved from the last visit), use of \nforce, use of mechanical restraints, youth confined to  their rooms due to being placed on \nobservation status and administrative confinement, increased average minutes for administrative \nconfinement, use of other forms of confinement like “modified programming,” and other issues. \nHowever,  overall,  there  has  been  significant  improvement  in  youth  and  staff  morale  and \nimprovement and progress in some areas of the consent decree from the last site visit (detailed \nthroughout the report).   \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, all units, school, and many other areas were clean and orderly.  \nNew furniture installation has been completed in an additional eight (8) living unit day rooms for \na total of eleven (11) living units. Each living unit installation included five (5) stools and six (6) \nchairs that are molded and securely fastened. An additional three (3) more chairs will be added to \neach living unit in the next few months.  \nA large capital project began to install new windows and window frames in each of the twelve \n(12) living units. The new windows and frames include specialized glass that can withstand \nsignificant duress without failing. This extensive effort is expected to improve the environment \nand lighting as well as safety while reducing the need to regularly replace broken windows.  \nDefendants initiated the process to change the lighting in youth rooms, unit dayrooms, and \nemergency lighting. The new lighting will improve the environment on the units by making the \ndayrooms brighter. The Monitor was able to observe a unit with the new LED lighting and it is \nsignificantly brighter. This will be critical during the upcoming winter months when the units are \ndarker due to reduced sunlight.   \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 3 of 32\n \nAdditional fixed cameras throughout the facility (internal and external) will be installed. Over the \nnext year, this project will result in the installation of over 100 new cameras that will increase both \nsafety and accountability throughout the facility.  \nDefendants have replaced failing boilers in Rogers and Miller living units. These new boilers will \nimprove the heating in the units. Additional units will be addressed in the coming months as \nneeded.  Lastly, Defendants replaced bathroom fixtures in Hughes unit including stainless steel \nsinks, toilets, etc.  \nDefendants should continue to focus on the sensory rooms on the units as this can be a place for \nyouth to relax and cool down when needed. The Defendants should be commended for their \ncontinuing commitment to improve the physical plant which improves the daily lives for staff and \nyouth. The physical plant is significantly safer than three years ago. The Monitor will continue to \nupdate the Court on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for \nyouth and staff.   \nEducation Observations \nThe school general areas and classrooms were spotless. Youth, teachers, staff, and a Foster \ngrandparent were present in the school area during this site visit.  There was a very positive \natmosphere in the school. The vast majority of youth in the classrooms were actively engaged in \neducation.  The Roosevelt unit was actively engaged in recreation in the gym. There were no \nstudents in the STAR room (meaning youth did not have to be removed from the classroom).  \nHowever, on the morning of the visit one youth from CLS was removed from the school and \nconfined to her room for disruptive activity. The Monitor was able to see the renovated music \nroom including the newly completed recording studio.  The Monitor heard recordings and watched \nmusic videos produced at LHS/CLS by the youth.  The music is incredible.  Youth and staff should \nbe very proud of the work they have done in the music department.  \nThere are a few new educational units during this reporting period: \n(1) Project-based Learning Derby Car Unit: LHS/CLS teachers developed and implemented a \nunit helping students learn and implement a variety of STEM (science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics) skills in building and racing Derby Cars. This unit began in April of 2021 but \nwas expanded to Black Elk and Curtis Living Units in June.  \n(2) Project-based Learning Flight Unit: Teachers designed and implemented a project-based \nlearning unit on flight. This unit ran with Black Elk, Roosevelt, Wells, and Dubois Living Units \nin August. The unit involved learning about the history of flight, participating in an interview with \na pilot, and building and flying paper airplanes, kites, and balsa gliders.  \n(3) Mystery Motivator Program: The Mystery Motivator Program, which was piloted in May, \ncontinued throughout the summer. Contingent on their cooperation with classroom expectations, \nstudents were able to earn individual as well as class-wide rewards. Some rewards included pizza, \nmovies, basketball  competition, Origami projects, Jeopardy! Competitions, cookie and  milk \nbreaks, virtual escape rooms, and “minute to win it” classroom games. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 4 of 32\n \nThe Monitor is happy to report that three (3) LHS students earned their High School Equivalency \nDiploma (“HSED”) in August. A graduation ceremony is planned for late October.  \nEducation staff met with CESA 9 (teaching cohort in Wisconsin) in June, July, and August. \nEducators continued to work on Project-Based Learning and techniques for student engagement. \nFour education staff members earned their Google Level 1 certification in June. They were \nrequired to pass a rigorous online exam to demonstrate their proficiency in the Google suite \napplications.  Educators  are  also  currently  working  on  Unjammed  Learning  Network  2.0: \nInstructional Design using Google Workspace.  \nOn June 1st, education and senior DJC staff participated in a Zoom meeting with juvenile justice \neducators from Utah and Massachusetts to hear their experiences in implementing DBT at their \nfacilities. This dialogue will be very useful as LHS/CLS continues their journey with DBT.  \nAs of July, youth and education/treatment staff begin their day with a 15-minute community \nmindfulness practice. Staff and students alike appreciate the opportunity to take some time to \ncenter themselves and get ready for a full day of learning. Some activities have included freeze-\ndancing, mindful drawing, and breathing exercises.  \nWith respect to obtaining an educational consultant, Defendants have completed a competitive bid \nprocess  and  intend  to  award  a  contract  to  three  consultants  to  evaluate  the  educational \nprogramming at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools. The consultants are national experts and \nhave been selected to evaluate key educational areas including:  \n•  Operations  \n•  Curriculum and Instruction  \n•  Academic Assessments  \n•  Special Education  \n•  Human Capital  \n•  Technology Integration  \n•  Transition  \nEvaluation work is expected to commence in the next couple of months with a full final report \nexpected sometime this winter.  \nAny youth in COVID-19 quarantine, and youth in the High-Risk Unit Program (explained in more \ndetail below) continue to have education in the unit and not at the school.  The Monitor continues \nto recommend that the frequency of music, art, and recreation needs to increase.  The quality of \nthe music program is second to none and all youth would benefit from the program not just during \nthe school day but on weekends when there is the most idle time.  The Monitor also continues to \nrecommend that the girls’ classroom be painted a brighter color and have more of a classroom feel.  \nThe room remains sterile and has an institutional feel. After the site visit, Defendants have begun \nthe process of picking out paint color, décor, etc. with the help of students and education staff. The \nMonitor looks forward to seeing the finished classroom. \nAs previously mentioned, the entire educational program at LHS/CLS still needs to be evaluated. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 5 of 32\n \nThe Defendants are working on procuring an educational consultant to work on addressing the \nconcerns raised – including the need for deeper and more meaningful teacher interaction with youth \nand enhancing/expanding the daily education hours.  \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit.  Overall, the units \nwere very clean. Overall, the cottages and youth rooms were cleaner than last visit. \nThere were more than adequate staffing levels on each of the living units.  The unit populations \nranged from five (5) to thirteen (13) youth. Staff were more engaged with the youth than during the \nlast site visit.  The Monitor also reviewed video during the reporting period to view day room \nactivities, staff placement and staff engagement. In general, staff positioning improved as they were \nnear the youth, sitting with youth, and interacting with youth in a positive way.  The youth-staff \nrelationship seems improved this site visit.  The body language and tone were positive from both \nyouth and staff.   All the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and willingly \ncommunicated with the monitoring team, leadership of LHS/CLS, and Plaintiffs’ counsel.  The \nMonitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel had an opportunity to talk to most of the youth present in \nthe day rooms.  The Monitor did not interrupt youth in school but visited with them on their home \nunits when they were either on break, lunch, or done for the day. \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed on both the King and Wells cottages. Each unit had six \n(6) girls which is an increase in population. There were three staff members on each unit. The girls’ \nunits were very nicely decorated for Halloween.  The youth housed on King and Wells were playing \ncards, working on puzzles, while others were in school.  One staff member was working on \ndeescalating a youth in her room.  Only one (1) girl was confined to her room based on behavior. \nStaff did a very good job of utilizing the de-escalation techniques learned in training.  The girls’ \nrooms were messier than in previous site visits. The girls were calm, engaged, and had no \ncomplaints.  The Monitor asked various questions as it relates to their quality of life, staff, and use \nof force and none of the girls had anything negative to say.  \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, Addams, Curtis, Miller, Hughes, and Rogers were empty units \nduring this site visit. The boys were housed on Krueger, Black Elk, Dubois, and Roosevelt. All of \nthe living units were very calm and clean in general.  All units had more than adequate staffing. \nSome youth were getting back from school, on telephones, playing cards, braiding hair, playing \nbasketball, playing video games, writing, and cleaning.  All of the youth were talkative with the \nmonitoring team.  None of the youth made a single complaint to the Monitoring team even when \nasked probing questions. The staff on all of the units seemed relaxed and engaged with youth and \npositioned appropriately.  There was no one on quarantine at the time of the site visit.  There were \nno boys involuntarily confined and only two boys in their rooms by choice. The atmosphere on all \nof the units was significantly better than the last site visit.  \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor discussed the “Hughes Program.” The “Hughes Program” was \nimplemented on March 30, 2021 and is considered the high-risk unit. The program is now housed \nin the Krueger unit. The Hughes Program is modified programming for youth who engage in \nphysically aggressive behavior, present a danger to others, and/or exhibited behavior that caused a \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 6 of 32\n \nmajor disruption to the facility.  The Monitoring team offered suggestions to improving the program \nand provided examples of similar programs that can potentially be incorporated within the structure \nof current program to enhance the overall impact and potentially improve services and outcomes.   \nThe Defendants are working on implementing these suggestions.  Youth housed on this high-risk \nunit have a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by PSU in order to specifically address their \nbehavior.  Youth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in conjunction \nwith their weekly Growth Team.   The Superintendent (or designee) will have to approve placement \nonto this unit. The Monitor will keep the Court apprised on modifications made to high risk unit.  \n \nIn general, youth and staff attitudes were much more positive during this site visit.  Although there \nwere more activities for youth to do, there is still a need for more structured and meaningful \nactivities as youth idleness remains a concern, particularly on weekends. Enhancing weekend \nactivities and programs will help reduce the risk of youth engaging in anti-social behaviors when \nthey have little else to do.  During previous site visits, the Monitor recommended creating and \nimplementing a daily schedule to help with youth boredom and create opportunity for structured, \nmeaningful programming and activities.  There needs to be a focus on creating a daily schedule in \norder to improve accountability and minimize the incidents of youth acting out. Improving the \nbehavior management system, improving the rewards and incentives, and developing engaging \nprogramming will have a positive impact on the overall behavior and atmosphere  \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately forty-nine (49) youth were interviewed prior to and during the site visit (formally \nand informally) by the Monitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel.  There were very few requests to \ntalk to Plaintiffs’ counsel while the Monitor was onsite talking with youth than during previous \nvisits.  \n \nYouth did not complain about anything to the monitoring team. Previously, youth complained about \nfood, education, not being let out of their rooms to use the bathroom when needed, being confined, \nstaff not engaging with them, youth going hands on too soon, staff not caring about them and general \ntreatment.  Youth did not make any of these complaints this site visit.  In fact, several youths spoke \nto the Monitoring team and indicated that the facility culture, programs, and safety is much better \nnow compared to their previous commitments to the facility.  This is a good sign that the facility is \nmoving in a positive direction.  \n \nYouth did complain to Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to the site visit (during this reporting period) about \nstaff frequently using observation status, including being deprived of schooling and programming \nand feeling “isolated” while on 5- or 10-minute observation status, concerns about staff antagonizing \nor provoking youth and that this was leading to an increase in the use of administrative confinement, \nkeeping youth in their rooms in  the Krueger unit specifically, and some staff being too quick to use \naggressive physical force and restraints, especially on female youth.  During the site visit, four (4) \nyouth on the high-risk unit (Krueger) told Plaintiffs’ counsel that they are eager to get back to their \nhome unit and thought six weeks was too long to be in the program.  One youth said that when she \nwas on observation status, she really did not interact with PSU on the weekends.  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 7 of 32\n \n \nThere was less idle/unstructured time both during site visit and while reviewing random sampling of \nvideo of living units.  The Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more \nmeaningful/structured programming and activities. It is clear that when staff engage with youth, \nyouth respond positively.   \n \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that the Defendants should take advantage of the reduced \npopulation by having the available staff in plan, prepare, and develop programs for youth. The \nDefendants need to focus on gender and culturally competent programming.  \n \nThe Monitor was provided an update as it relates to the status of LHS/CLS. 2021 Wisconsin Act \n58, the biennial budget, was enacted July 8, 2021 and included $4,000,000 in general fund \nsupported borrowing for the purpose of project planning, development, and design, site selection, \nand land and property acquisition for a new Type 1 juvenile correctional facility in Milwaukee \nCounty. The Department is currently assessing the viability of converting an existing DOC facility \nin Milwaukee County to serve as a secure facility for youth.  Also, 2021 Assembly Bill 524 was \nintroduced in September 2021 to allow for additional public debt in an amount up to $41,791,000 \nfor the purpose of constructing a new Type 1 juvenile correctional facility in Milwaukee County. \nDefendants should work on moving forward with requirements to close LHS and move youth \ncloser to locations where needed, culturally and gender competent programs and services are more \nwidely available. \n \nStaffing  \n \nDuring this reporting period (June-September), there have been some key staffing changes.  Key \nPositions hired during this reporting period are as follows:  \n•  Critical Incident Response Team Coordinator  \n•  Corrections Management Services Director \n•  Treatment Director \n•  SYC2 \n•  Chaplain \n•  Teacher Supervisor \n•  Psychological Consultant \n•  Psychological Associates \n•  Recreation Leaders \n•  Four (4) PSU interns (interns rotate) \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has decreased slightly from the last reporting period (see \nbelow).  There are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS.  Approximately 153 of these positions \nare “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  The teacher \nvacancy rate remains higher than last reporting period (10 vacancies).  There is a significant \nincrease in social worker vacancies.  This is a critical role that should be made a recruiting priority.  \nThe  Monitor  encourages  continuing  to  recruit  teachers  despite  the  reduced  population  and \nchallenges with COVID-19.  Recruiting is still a challenge due to the location of the facility, overall \nteacher shortages, relatively low compensation, location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 8 of 32\n \nLHS/CLS will close, and the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue.   \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \n December 9, 2020  March 1, 2021  May 31, 2021  September 2021 \n         \nYouth   23% (27 out of 115)  25% (29 out of 115)  36% (41 out of 115)  30% (35 out of 115) \n   \nCounselor \nYouth  13% (5 out of 37.5)  23% (8.5 out of 37.5)  19 % (7 out of 37.5)  19% (7 out of 37.5) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  28% (7 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25)  32% (8 out of 25)  40% (10 out of 25) \nSocial Worker  29% (4 out of 14)  21% (3 out of 14)  36% (5 out of 14)  57% (8 out of 14) \n \nThe Youth Counselor vacancies have decreased during this reporting period and Youth Counselor \nAdvanced vacancies remain at 19%.   Staffing levels remain adequate and meet legal requirements \nbased on the reduced population that exists at LHS/CLS. The Defendants should continue to \nmonitor employee leaves and scheduling to ensure staff are not overly mandated.  \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over thirty-one (31) staff. Staff morale seemed much higher this \nsite visit.  Staff were more engaged with youth and seemed less frustrated.  Staff did not have any \nof the same complaints as the last site visit. In fact, staff did not complain about anything.  Staff’s \nbody language was more open, and staff seemed to have good rapport with the youth. One staff \ndid complain about the lack of staff diversity which clearly is an issue at LHS/CLS.  The continued \nimplementation of DBT and other best practices will improve safety for staff and youth.  The \nMonitor observed several very good interactions with youth by staff (de-scalation, playing games, \nmonitoring basketball, and eating with youth) to name a few.   \nOne newer direct care staff stated that she felt the training she received was adequate but suggested \nthat new staff receive additional OJT time to better prepare for working with youth in this \nenvironment.  The Monitor also noted that staff felt the training curriculums may need to be \nreviewed for potential updates to a higher needs/risk population.   \nDefendants conducted a Professional Quality of Life Survey during this reporting period. Fifty-\nseven (57) Staff responded, with results indicating that staff scored in the average range for \ncompassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma. While burnout and secondary trauma \nscores did increase based on the 57 responses obtained this year in an open response /anonymous \nformat, they are considered to be within “average range”. Compassion satisfaction also remained \nin the “average range”. The Defendants will continue with these surveys in the future. \nDefendants also conducted a Staff Interests Survey in August 2021. Staff were also asked to \nrespond to a survey monkey and complete a quick two-minute survey regarding staff interests as \nDJC gathers information from staff as a whole for aiding in development of future programming \nefforts. The survey highlighted the fact that staff have a range of talents and interests that could \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 9 of 32\n \nbuild bridges and spark ideas for programming or other youth and staff-sponsored activities that \nwould reduce idle time and foster positive relationships between youth and staff. The aim is that \nthe list opens up planning to support additional youth programming and activities as well as peer \nsupport and team development opportunities. The survey details will be shared with the newly \nhired Crisis Intervention Response Team Coordinator as well in the hopes that the survey may \nprovide insights into activities that may best support wellness for staff.  \nDefendants continue to work on increasing staff morale but still have much more work to do.  \nDefendants have done the following to increase staff morale during this reporting period: \n•  Two new vending machines were added downstairs and two were added upstairs. There is \nnow a new coffee machine and a new fresh food machine providing fresher options in the \nvisiting room. \n•  Street Taco Cook-Off CASH Committee Fundraiser. \n•  The Wisconsin Correctional Association’s sponsored community service project allowed \nstaff to participate in one of two charitable drives and the resulting cash was donated to the \nfacilitating charity Hope House.  \n•  Greenhouse sale  \n•  Staff give back day with ice cream and popsicles for staff to “beat the heat.”  \n•  An awards ceremony was held for winners of DJC’s Annual Employee Recognition \n“YOU” Awards on July 7, 2021. The ceremony featured speeches and awards presented to \nemployees by Secretary Carr, Deputy Secretary Hoy, and Administrator Hermes. Prior to \nthe event, the Secretary and Deputy Secretary spent about 90 minutes on- grounds meeting \nwith staff in their units.  After the ceremony, all staff were invited to a brat fry on the patio \nand picnic tables outside the administration building. Meal boxes were also packaged and \ndelivered to staff that could not leave their posts during lunch.  Other meal boxes were kept \nrefrigerated for the second shift staff and third shift staff coming in later in the day. After \nthe conclusion of the day’s events, Secretary Carr remained on grounds to host a listening \nsession open to all staff able to attend. \n•  Monthly YCA/YC Attendance and Additional Hours Incentive & Recognition: Many staff \nregularly go above and beyond in different ways every day. In an effort to positively \nrecognize staff regarding attendance and additional hours worked (which are often not by \nchoice), DJC continues to hold a monthly lottery in which qualified staff will be entered \nand the winner will receive a gift card (not funded by state funds, funded by personal \ncontributions from staff to support this staff recognition effort). \n•  Employee(s) of the Month:  Nomination forms are due each month and are then shared \nwith managers and posted around the facility to allow staff an opportunity to read the \nnominations. Employees are nominated by their peers and management staff review the \nnominations every month to declare the employee of the month winners who receive one \nof three reserved “Employee of the Month” parking spots. \n•  Employee Supports & Trainings: Peer supporters follow up with staff who are identified \nas having been involved in a stressful situation on grounds or off grounds. Sometimes by \nphone, sometimes in person, peer supporters try to ensure people are alright or have the \nservices they need in place following tough situations. Peer support is offered during \ndebriefings following significant incidents and sometimes this is a difficult time for people \nto discuss their feelings. Confidentiality is maintained at all times. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 10 of 32\n \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information.  A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible.  \n \nYouth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”) Update/ Dialectical Behavior Therapy (“DBT”) \n \nDJC is continuing in the next phase of participation with YICPM by working with the principal \ninvestigator  from  Georgetown  University.  DJC  has  made  progress  in  the  next  phase  of \nparticipation with YICPM. Throughout the summer a small team met to review the YICPM Data \nspreadsheet. The spreadsheet was completed in August with a call in September to review the \nspreadsheet and next steps with Georgetown University.  \nDJC is committed to developing a treatment-focused organizational culture. The Defendants are \ncollaborating with Massachusetts Department of Youth Services to explore Dialectical Behavioral \nTherapy (“DBT”) as a behavior management system. In consultation with Dr. Lesley Chapin and \ncolleagues from Massachusetts, Utah, and Washington, the DBT informed System of Care (SoC) \nhas been designed to reinforce skill practice and support behavior change.  \nTo date, DBT Skills Groups and the weekly DBT Skill Highlights (shared with leaders and staff) \nare now covering skills within the last module of the DBT skills curriculum. Following the \ncompletion of “walking the middle path” skills, facilitators will have taught all of the DBT Skills \n(including specific distress tolerance, mindfulness, emotional regulation skills) to youth at least \nonce within this first cycle. As of September, the “learner” role has been expanded to include not \nonly safety staff but also some recreation, spiritual services, and administrative staff to support \ncontinued awareness and skill practice across the organization.  \nDBT consultant Dr. Lesley Chapin facilitated a multidisciplinary staff engagement opportunity to \nhear from a panel of Utah and Massachusetts colleagues. Dr. Chapin’s regular onsite visits also \ncontinued to provide staff development in the form of skills coaching, team and individual \nconsultation,  and  mentoring  to  help  staff  consistently  use  DBT  principals  and  skills  when \ninteracting with youth. Based on the heavy amount of treatment-based trainings provided since the \nstart of 2021 and staffing considerations typical for the summer months, it was determined that \nreinforcement of DBT skills would be the most strategic long-term approach in supporting staff \nresilience and an operational paradigm shift to treatment.  \nOutreach was incorporated to engage staff feedback in the change process and support staff \nunderstanding, identify and develop needed resources, and enhance buy-in as a precursor to \nsuccessful implementation. The Prosocial Pilot in Black Elk and CLS provided a soft introduction \nto SoC elements (prosocial points and incentives along with the noncompliant behavior matrix of \ntreatment responses).  \nBased on staff dialogue, the DBT Strategy Team coordinated follow-up consultation with Utah in \nJuly to develop behavior ratings as a key component of the new Behavior Management System \n(BMS). The behavior rating will provide a weekly score (a weighted ratio of prosocial  to \nnoncompliant behavior) that indicates the level to which the youth utilizes skill to effectively \nmanage and engage in prosocial behaviors and problem solving rather than noncompliant behavior. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 11 of 32\n \nYouth, Growth Teams, and OJOR will also review youth’s behavior rating to help determine \nyouth’s readiness to utilize and maintain skills to manage problems effectively prior to transition \nand release planning.  \nA BMS overview (highlighting prosocial points, incentives, noncompliant behavior and behavior \nratings with privileges) was presented during a Town Hall meeting in early September. Trainings \nfor noncompliant behavior and treatment responses to enhance the conduct report process (4 hour) \nas well as BMS elements of prosocial points, incentives, and behavior ratings with privileges (4 \nhours) have continued to be developed for delivery and integration into practice within the coming \nmonths.  \nThe second round of Growth Team Youth Surveys was conducted in late August to align with the \nquarterly schedule set by the Quality Committee. Again, the surveys were purposely given during \nSDA (Staff Directed Activities) to allow for objective facilitation, modeling of engagement \nactivities, and establishing future buy- in. The facilitators involved youth in outdoor water games \nand an ice cream social. Prior to the fun, 76% of youth completed the surveys. The results \ndemonstrated that youth have been very receptive to Growth Teams indicating they have helped \nthe youth understand what was needed to reach their goals, experienced greater positive feedback, \nfelt listened to and expressed having a greater degree of trust as compared to perceptions about \nstaff in general.  \nDuring this same time, an Activities Survey was also facilitated (68% of youth responded) to help \nidentify potential activities that youth may want to try or become engaged with as programming \ndevelops. 55 activities were listed; the top one was cooking with 80% of youth indicating interest. \nJust like the Growth Team Survey data, the information is broken down by Unit and shared for \nintegration into planning and response. The integration of youth feedback is an important step in \nenhancing the treatment milieu and potentially identifying additional privileges that provide \nincreased motivation for skill development.  \nThe Quality committee also facilitated the PROQOL (Professional Quality of Life) assessment \nsurvey in August.  The PROQOL was first administered in the summer of 2020 prior to staff \nawareness of DBT/SoC planning efforts, and it was facilitated with direct department contacts.  \nStaff were very receptive to  taking  the quick Activities Survey as represented by the 127 \nrespondents. 29 staff indicated they were interested in consulting with a YEP (Youth Engagement \nPrograms) Crew to help develop opportunities for youth. The data is also useful for leaders \nconsidering ideas to recognize their staff and will also be shared with the new Crisis Intervention \nResponse Team Coordinator. \nThe  DBT  Strategy  Team  recognizes  the  importance  of  investing  its  support  behind  staff \ndevelopment, treatment milieu, and resource development to provide a successful foundation to \nfully implement our System of Care. For example, the team has also worked with the Safety \nDirector to update post-orders and develop reinforcement strategies to help both staff and youth \nbe prepared for elements of the Behavior Motivation System. A youth preparation plan has also \nbeen outlined to engage CPS and SYCs as a team in delivering one-on-one education with youth \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 12 of 32\n \naround the changes (integration of prosocial points, incentives, noncompliant behaviors and \nresponses, behavior ratings, and privileges) that will be coming.  \nOnce DBT is fully integrated into the programming, there should be improvement in many facets \nof the daily operations of LHS/CLS as well as a significant reduction in actual and perceived safety \nconcerns. \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \n \nDefendants launched their Quality Assurance Review (QAR) process in August 2019.  There was \na Guardian (handheld device that is used to complete safety/welfare checks) Workshop meeting \nheld in July in order to continue refining the process for utilizing Guardian for youth safety checks \nand front-line data gathering also remains ongoing at the time of this report. \nThe two new QA staff has been working on consent decree compliance data measures and QA \nprocesses have included:  \n•  Visual Monitoring  \n•  Administrative Confinement  \n•  Mechanical Restraints  \n•  Use of Force  \n•  Monthly Metrics Chart  \n•  Searches  \n•  CARE Team  \n•  Youth to Staff Ratio  \n•  Youth Complaints  \n•  J-Tracker Notes Audit  \n•  Notification of Rights   \nBeginning in March, the Administrative confinement (“AC”) review committee started meeting \nevery Monday morning to review all AC placements having occurred more than seven days prior \nto that Monday’s date. The aim and scope of the AC review committee has adapted and expanded \nsince June 1, to include new or additional data points that aid the placement reviews. The Monday \nreviews have aided in streamlining the process for reviewing incidents. Whether or not a particular \nincident merits additional review, each incident involving AC is reviewed at the Monday meeting \nto ensure that the debrief form is completed at seven days or is assigned follow up.  \nFacility Improvement Plan (“FIP”) Progress \nAs discussed in the previous Monitor’s report, many PbS indicators, particularly the ones singled \nout in our facility improvement plan action steps, have trended in a positive direction as compared \nto previous collection cycles and against the national averages produced by PbS.  \nAfter the October 2021 data cycle reports and surveys are finalized in mid-November, a new round \nof PbS data will provide DJC with a clearer picture as to whether progress on these Orders has \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 13 of 32\n \nbeen sustained or if there are any other metric indicators that will need addressing. The Monitor \nwill continue to update the Court when the next PbS data becomes available.  \nPolicies and Procedures/Administrative Code Update \nThe below policies, procedures, and Administrative Code sections have been completed during \nthis reporting period: \n \nPolicies Completed \n•  Incident Reporting and Notification \n•  Mandatory Reporting \n•  Use of Body Worn Cameras \n•  Emergency Services, CPR, and AED Use \n•  Injury and Significant Illness Notification (health services unit policy)  \nAdministrative Code Revisions Update  \nDJC staff and committees continue working to revise both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter \n373. While the drafting process for 376 was suspended awaiting approval for the amended scope \nstatement, DJC’s 373 committee met weekly completing a substantial draft  overhaul of the \nprevious chapter. Due to the large-scale changes with respect to process, practice, and philosophy \nrepresented by DJC’s vision for 373, and requirements of this Court Order, the rulemaking process \nrequires the department to submit an amended scope. Given the general timeline associated with \nthe process, both DOC Chapter 373 and DOC Chapter 376 have made significant steps forward in \nthe administrative rule-making process since June 1, 2021.  \nChapter 373: First draft completed by DJC committee on August 10, 2021 and submitted to DOC’s \nOffice of Legal Counsel for review. The attorneys have scheduled a meeting for early October to \ndiscuss some suggested edits or additions prior to submitting the amended scope for approval \nthrough the Governor’s Office.  \nChapter 376: An amended scope statement was submitted for approval June 21, 2021 which had \nthe effect halting any further drafting by the committee on the chapter until the amended scope \ncould be reviewed through the Governor’s office. That process was completed, and the Secretary \nof the Department has approved drafting work on the rule to resume as of September 29, 2021. \nDefendants  need  to  continue  to  aggressively  work  towards  completing  the  respective \nAdministrative Code sections. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 14 of 32\n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Data does not indicate that youth \nare being confined for seven days or for punitive reasons however, Defendants need to re-\nexamine the use of “observation status” and administrative confinement to ensure that staff \nare not using this as a form of punitive confinement. There were youth who were in \nobservation status (confined to room if five- or ten-minute intervals) for several days.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that most \nyouth are being confined for three days or for punitive reasons however, Defendants need to \nre-examine the use of “observation status” and administrative confinement to ensure that \nstaff are not using this as a form of punitive confinement. There were youth who were in \nobservation status (confined to room and observed on five- or ten-minute intervals) for \nseveral days during this site visit.  \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of observation status and \nadministrative confinement has increased during this reporting period. Youth are also in \nthese statuses for longer periods of time that previous reporting periods. It appears some of \nthe confinement should have been AC- not observation status - or combination of both. \nDefendants need to re-examine the use of “observation status” to ensure that staff are not \nusing this as a form of punitive confinement.  There were also many instances of “modified \nprogramming” which can and often does require periods of operational confinement for \nyouth. This is not in compliance with this Court Order.   There is a new directive by \nDefendants that youth who are a danger to others will not be in observation status moving \nforward.  \nThe  Monitor,  counsel  for  Plaintiffs,  and  Defendants  discussed  Administrative \nConfinement/Observation Status and a plan is in place to change how these confinements \nare being utilized and monitored and ensuring compliance with this Court Order. The \nMonitor previously recommended establishing clear criteria for administrative confinement \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 15 of 32\n \nso that staff cannot punitively confine youth and cannot confine youth for more than 24 hours \nif they do not pose an imminent danger of harm to themselves. The Monitor reiterates this \nrequirement.  By establishing clear and objective criteria, leadership can ensure that youth \nare not punitively confined or subject to harmful isolation beyond the periods prescribed by \nthis Court order. The Monitor requested additional documentation that will be reported on \nin the next report to the Court as it was not readily available prior to submission.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The use of AC was significantly \nhigher for both LHS and CLS youth this reporting period, which is not attributable to the \nfact this reporting period is four months instead of the usual three months (June-September).  \nThe number of youths confined for over four (4) hours is also significantly higher than last \nreporting period.  The Monitor is unable to assess whether the youth received “intensive \nmental health services” at the time of this report but will review with the mental health staff \nand consultant prior to the next site visit. \n \nMarch 2021 \nCLS: 9 uses of AC. Average 74 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 19 uses of AC. Average of 125 minutes. 1 youth over four hours.   \n \nApril 2021 \nCLS: 4 uses of AC: Average of 142 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 16 uses of AC: Average of 141 minutes. No youth over four hours (4 \nyouth exactly at four hours) \n \nMay 2021 \nCLS: 2 uses of AC: Average of 113 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 15 uses of AC: Average of 140 minutes. Two (2) youth over four hours \n \nJune 2021 \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 16 of 32\n \nCLS: 4 uses of AC. Average 132 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 20 uses of AC. Average of 113 minutes. No youth over four hours.   \n \nJuly 2021 \nCLS: 13 uses of AC. Average 130 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 80 uses of AC. Average of 166 minutes. 6 youth over four hours.  \n         \nAugust 2021 \nCLS: 20 uses of AC. Average 120 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours \nLHS: 54 uses of AC. Average of 168 minutes. Two (2) youth over four hours.   \n \nSeptember 2021 \nCLS: 31 uses of AC. Average 108 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 49 uses of AC. Average of 187 minutes. Six (6) youth over four hours.   \nThe Monitor was able to able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit.  99.43% of checks were completed within 30 minutes. The \nMonitor reviewed video footage for random days and times and was only one instance in \nwhich staff did not complete the checks in compliance with policy (not ensuring they are \nlooking into youth rooms to ensure youth are safe). Defendants will continue to remind staff \nto  properly  conduct  safety/wellness  checks  while  youth  are  in  room  and  hold  staff \naccountable when appropriate.   \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were fourteen (14) youth \nconfined for over four (4) hours during this reporting period (June-September) (see response \nin previous question). Twelve (12) out of the fourteen (14) extended confinements were \nrecommended by PSU.   \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring any form of room \nconfinement is compliant with this Court Order, draft policy and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.  As previously discussed, observation status \nresulting in confinement needs to be looked at very closely to determine whether it is \nappropriate  or  whether  observation  status  is  being  used  as  a  substitute  for  punitive \nconfinement or administrative confinement.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 17 of 32\n \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were three (3) transfers as a \nresult of extended placements in administrative confinement. Defendants have improved the \ndetails of the commenced plan.   \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24  was  updated.    The  plans  developed  are  very  detailed  and  comprehensive. \nDiscussion  and  clarification  have  occurred  surrounding  observation  status  during  this \nreporting period.  A recent directive was given pertaining to youth placed in observation \nstatus. Moving forward, only youth who are in imminent risk of serious self-harm to \nthemselves/risk of self-harm will be placed in observation status.  Although this provision of \nthe  Court  Order  only  allows  confinement  under  the  observation  policy  for  youth  at \n“imminent” risk of “serious” “self-harm,” it appears that it may be used (or continued) when \nthe harm is attenuated, not imminent and when risk was posed to others. Also, it may be \nused or continued when the risk of harm is not “serious.”  Based on the new directive and \nafter conversations with the parties, it would appear there is a meeting of the minds on who \nshould be placed in observation status. The Monitor will continue to review and monitor the \npractice  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 18 of 32\n \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed on renovated units.   \nThe Monitor did observe rooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of the \nroom. Staff can clearly see into youth rooms now that the windows do not have etching \nand are not covered by  paper/pictures.  Room searches have occurred during this \nreporting period. Many rooms had several blankets, sheets, and other items that could \npose a safety risk due to the volume of items in the rooms.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants are very close to substantial \ncompliance.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. Defendants have \nimproved  their  documentation  and  data  collection.  Defendants  are  close  to  reaching \nsubstantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 19 of 32\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented.  Clinicians are on-site for a minimum of 6 hours each Saturday and \nSunday and the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth. The Defendants \nhave  hired  new  PSU  staff  and  are  working  on  expanding  on-site  treatment  time  on \nweekends.   The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the hours in which they \nare physically present on weekends and evening hours in order to engage youth in a \nmeaningful way during this time.  The Monitor is reviewing PSU data and information. The \nMonitor will work with Defendants and consultant after review.  \n \nA  quality  assurance  program  needs  to  be  developed.  The  Monitor  suggests  that  the \nDefendants consider implementing the mental health expert’s recommendations to further \ndevelop the mental health program/integration at LHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental  \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation/data shows that \nevaluations are completed and within 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. \nThere were no instances of contraindication documented during this review period. PSU \nlaunched two new initiatives this reporting period: (1) PSU attends SYC meetings in order \nto enhance collaboration and communication and (2) created a decision-making model and \nan AC assessment guide.  PSU also developed a job aid to enhance consistency across PSU \nclinicians  when  conducting  the  risk  assessment,  engaging  in  treatment  planning, \ncollaborating with safety staff.  QA needs to be created and implemented.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 20 of 32\n \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants are over 99% compliant \nwith meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe.  QA program has \nbeen developed. Quality assurance measures are in place and when necessary, formal \ninvestigations occur.  There were two (2) Letters of Expectations, four (4) formal job \ninstructions, two (2) letters of expectations, and three (3) suspensions given to staff who did \nnot complete safety/security checks per policy during this reporting period.  The Monitor \nobserved safety/wellness checks being completed on various days/times during this reporting \nperiod and observed only one instance in which staff did not make visual contact with youth. \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time on evenings and weekends.  \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model.  \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons.  Forms and processes for documenting any \npotential property restrictions have been created and utilized. Defendants are close to \nreaching substantial compliance. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general. However, the vacancy rate is high \nfor Social Workers.  The on-call PSU clinician communicates to all the PSU clinicians \nthrough email that a youth has been placed on AC. This allows the primary clinician to \nprovide consultation and direction as to how to return the youth to a baseline, self-regulated \nstate.  The  primary  clinician  consults  with  the  on-call  clinician  and  with  the \nSYC/YC/CUS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the youth plan addresses the issues at hand \nand how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. A PSU clinician follows up in the absence \nof the primary clinician and/or the crisis clinician. PSU collaborates with the SYC and direct \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 21 of 32\n \nstaff. The social worker and youths’ meeting schedules are individualized. Therefore, as is \nthe case with any arising short-term scheduling conflicts (e.g., court, medical needs, OJOR, \nAC etc.) the social worker works with the youth to identify availability if an AC placement \noccurs during regularly scheduled meeting. The vacancy rate for social workers is high and \nshould be priority.  Social workers are critical to quality of care and services for the youth \nand effective re-entry planning.   \nDocumentation,  quality  assurance,  and  policy  and  procedure  need  to  be \nimproved/completed. Defendants are working on a review of the social worker roles and \nresponsibilities.  Defendants need to ensure there is accountability with respect to the services \nprovided by the social workers.   \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. During the pandemic, Defendants \nmoved to smaller-group based treatment to youth where group participation was provided \non the units. This continues. Treatment programming for youth never ceased due to COVID-\n19 precautions, but the size of the groups was modified to accommodate safe social distancing \nmeasures and keep youth who shared a living unit assignment in groups with one another. \nBeginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group treatment \nsessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule.  The Monitor \ncontinues to encourage these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as possible. \n  \nOnly youth who are actively in AC status due to posing a serious risk of imminent physical \nharm to others would potentially miss a treatment group. Beginning in July, QA and SoC \nstaff and supervisors have identified and implemented a QA process for checking make up \ntreatment programming sessions are completed and documented in the J-Tracker youth \nnotes.  QA  staff  review  monthly  AC  data  and  cross-reference  AC  placements  against \nscheduled treatment programming times. Where AC placements coincide with the youth’s \nscheduled group time, QA staff review each instance for J-Tracker Youth Notes on or around \nthe date of the AC Placement that properly document the required make-up session was \nprovided. This process has improved the frequency of documentation being provided for the \nmake-up sessions. It has also identified gaps that QA and SoC Staff are working together to \naddress through reviewing and formalizing the business process for providing make up \nsessions and writing that into a facility procedure. \n  \nDefendants need  to  continue  to  focus  (document  and  QA)  on providing  rehabilitative \nprogramming  that  was  scheduled/in  process  before  placement  in  room \nconfinement. Defendants to ensure that any missed/rescheduled treatment groups do not \nnegatively impact a youth’s progress. \n \n  \niii.         Educational services with the general population  to the \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 22 of 32\n \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Classes now occur in the school \nbuilding except for high risk of Steps 1 and 2, new intakes due to quarantine, youth in \nmedical isolation, youth who are in 5- or 10-minute observation status, or AC.  \n \nAs stated in the narrative section of this report, the Defendants are in the bid process to \naward  a  contract  to  three  (3)  consultants  to  evaluate  the  educational  program.    The \nevaluation work will begin in the next few months with a report expected later in the winter.  \nThe Monitor will update the Court with the findings and recommendations.  \n \nDefendants need  to  ensure  that  special  education  is  provided  while  on  administrative \nconfinement and observation status and overall educational hours should increase.  The \nMonitor is happy to report that during the site visit, youth were engaged in the classrooms. \nIt would be extremely beneficial to provide art, music, woodworking, the greenhouse, \nwelding, and sewing and other types of programs to youth in the evening and on weekends. \nAlso, it would be ideal for social workers to work with you outside of the school day in order \nto have less scheduling issues and would help with any idle time after school.  The Defendants \nshould continue to focus on bringing more programming into LHS/CLS, especially culturally \nand gender relevant. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. In general, youth are out of their \nrooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.  except for youth in isolation due to Covid-19 safety measures \nimplemented  by  Defendants,  any  confinement  required,  or  any  self-confinement.    The \nMonitor regularly saw youth conversing with other youth during out time. Although each \nunit had sensory rooms, they were quite bare this site visit.   There were very few instances of \nyouth being in their rooms during this site visit.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 23 of 32\n \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) documented \ninstances of youth eating in their rooms (June and July) which were staff imposed based \non substantial threat of physical harm.  Defendants are able to track when youth eat meals \nin room and based on reports, the two instances were justified as the youth posed an \nimmediate and substantial threat. Defendants are close to being in substantial compliance.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  on \nadministrative confinement are receiving much more than the 3 hours of “out time” per day \nor 30 hours per week. (As stated earlier in the report, PbS definition of “room confinement” \ndoes include confinement for purposes of observation, even when ordered by PSU.) However, \nthere were youth on observation status and Administrative confinement that did not get at \nleast three hours per day of out time.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement. The \nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. Policy has been completed. Defendants are close \nto being in substantial compliance. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 24 of 32\n \nconsistently, including when less restrictive means were attempted. Documentation, data \ncollection and reliability, and quality assurance (with video review) needs to continue to be \nimproved. Also, documentation needs to be created that prove a youth was promptly \nprovided with the report upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.   \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.   \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, but data and documentation show that \nthere were increased uses of mechanical restraints /other restraints during this reporting \nperiod. Defendants need to continue focusing on reducing the use of mechanical (as well as \nphysical) restraints.  Defendants need to document and establish that there were not less \nrestrictive means available and quality assurance measures in every instance of the use of \nrestraints and follow the final policy and procedure that are in place.  The review process \nand quality assurance have significantly improved during this reporting period.  \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 25 of 32\n \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Below is the number of mechanical \nrestraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \nMarch 2021:    17 uses   \nApril 2021:    18 uses \nMay 2021:    17 uses \nJune 2021:    20 uses   \nJuly 2021:    33 uses \nAugust 2021:    11 uses \nSeptember 2021:  12 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \nMarch 2021:               1 uses \nApril 2021:     3 uses \nMay 2021:     4 uses \nJune 2021:     5 uses  \nJuly 2021:     3 uses \nAugust 2021:     6 uses \nSeptember 2021:   7 uses \nDocumentation needs to be improved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm \nexisted, and when and how that decision is reviewed. Defendants should note why the acts in \nquestion required a specific type of use of force, such as explaining why measure utilizing \nless force would have been insufficient in a specific situation. The review process should \nconsider the nuances in different situations.  Defendants have excellent critical outcome \nmeasures for restraints.  Defendants need to continue to work towards reducing the use of \nmechanical restraints and quality assurance measures. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were five (5) uses of ankle \nor wrap this reporting period. The ankle/wrap restraints were not ordered by PSU, but \nPSU was consulted and present.  Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, \ntraining, and QA measures and ensure PSU staff order these types of restraints.  \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 26 of 32\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage. Defendants have \ncreated quality assurance measures. Defendants need to continue to focus on reducing the \nuse of restraints.  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.    Defendants  need  to  continue \nfocusing on reducing the use of mechanical restraints.  Defendants need to continue to \nmonitor and assess the use of restraints and duration.   \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no  evidence of \nyouth being restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staff have received training in \nphysical  force,  restraints,  and  trained  in  proper  de-escalation.  The  Defendants  are \nincreasing the frequency of these trainings (regular, informal, refreshers). These skills are \nalso important to help staff identify and prevent situations which might lead to disruption \nor altercations before such incidents occur. DBT implementation will be very beneficial to \nyouth and staff. Defendants have made DBT a priority and are continuing to train staff. \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 27 of 32\n \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No  youth shall be left  alone  in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were five (5) instances of \nyouth being placed in mechanical restraints over 45 minutes. However, two (2) instances \nwere due to an incident on the Hughes unit which required outside law enforcement and \nthus, the mechanical restraints were not placed by the Defendants. For instances in which \nDefendants placed mechanical restraints on youth, the appropriate personnel authorized \nthe use of the mechanical restraints.  PSU approved and followed up within two (2) hours.  \nDefendants are working on a QA process for this section.  Defendants also need to ensure \ntherapeutic interventions occur.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented as part of the Incident Debrief process.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nin this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been finalized \nduring this reporting period. A Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and \nshared  with  all  supervisors  to  outline  all  the  necessary  criteria  and  documentation \nrequirements under which a strip search may be completed. Only supervisors can authorize \na strip search.  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 28 of 32\n \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.   \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.   \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nduring this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.   \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nconducted this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records reviewed \nindicate that all staff have been trained in trauma informed care. There no strip searches \nthis period.  \n \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 29 of 32\n \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nduring  this  reporting  period.  Documentation  has  improved.  Policy  and  procedure/QA \ndeveloped. PSU is consulted, and it is documented. \n \n4.       Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants  are focusing on de-\nescalation skills.  Staff have been trained in MANDT and other training which includes de-\nescalation skills training. De-escalation training/modeling continues to occur. \n \nThe Monitor personally observed staff de-escalating youth and observed several instances of \nde-escalation in review of video footage.  Staff are more comfortable utilizing these skills, but \ncontinued focus, training, and review need to occur.  Defendants should include cultural \ndiversity issues as part of crisis management training and procedures. Knowing these issues \nand how they are communicated is critical to successful behavior management.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Programming needs improvement \n(as discussed throughout this report) and idleness remains high but improved.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth.  Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \nto further reduce youth idleness hours. The staff survey completed by Defendants show that \nstaff have a wide range of talents that can shared with the youth.  The religious service leader \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 30 of 32\n \nhas been hired during this reporting period and regularly works with youth.  Youth are \nenjoying the religious services. As mentioned previously, increasing education hours and \nvocational programming, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED, can \ngreatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development strategies.  \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018 \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants should continue to focus on training and developing staff and evaluating their \nhiring process. As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts \nthe overall culture, atmosphere and environment of the facility.  Staff wellness has a direct \nimpact on the relationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, \nuse of restraint, and the use of isolation and confinement.  Staff interactions were much \nimproved this site visit and staff seemed less stressed.  Staff wellness remains an issue but \nthere seems to have been a positive change over the last four months.  The Monitor will \ncontinue to work with Defendants on strategies to improve staffing ratios and identifying \nadditional strategies to positively impact staff morale/wellness.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    DJC  staff  and  committees \ncontinue working to revise both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter 373. While the drafting \nprocess for 376 was suspended awaiting approval for the amended scope statement, DJC’s \n373 committee met weekly completing a substantial draft overhaul of the previous chapter. \nDue to the large-scale changes with respect to process, practice, and philosophy represented \nby DJC’s vision for 373, the rulemaking process requires the department to submit an \namended scope. Given the general timeline associated with the process, both DOC Chapter \n373 and DOC Chapter 376 have made significant steps forward in the administrative rule-\nmaking process since June 1, 2021.  \nChapter 373: First draft completed by DJC committee on August 10, 2021. Submitted to \nDOC’s Office of Legal Counsel for review. The attorneys have scheduled a meeting for early \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 31 of 32\n \nOctober to discuss some suggested edits or additions prior to submitting the amended scope \nfor approval through the Governor’s Office.  \nChapter 376: An amended scope statement was submitted for approval June 21, 2021 which \nhad the effect halting any further drafting by the committee on the chapter until the amended \nscope could be reviewed through the Governor’s office. That process was completed, and the \nSecretary of the Department has approved drafting work on the rule to resume as of \nSeptember 29, 2021. Defendants need to create an expedited timeline for finalizing all \nregulations and submitting them for approval. \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in the \nvast majority of cases. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority of cases.  \nWhen it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a corrective action \nplan  developed  but  follow  up  needs  to  occur to  ensure  the plans  are  completed  (QA \ncomponent).  Also, a more thorough review with staff involved needs to occur. A framework \nfor other QA measures relating to the consent decree has been created. Defendants have \nmade huge progress as it relates to QA.       \n            \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout this report, \ndata driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and to \nimprove the quality of life for youth and staff.  Defendants have created a competent quality \nassurance program.  The leadership team is developing daily data to review that will \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 130   Filed: 11/16/21   Page 32 of 32\n \nautomatically be available in order to make real time operational decisions. The Monitoring \nteam will continue to work with the superintendent to establish performance goals, analyzing \ndata, and creation of corrective action plans. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe overall atmosphere has significantly improved during this site visit.  Staff and youth seemed \nless stressed during this site visit and the interactions between staff and youth were very positive. \nThe Defendants should also be commended on all of their work on the physical plant including \npainting, lights, windows, general maintenance, and making the units as home-like and safe as \npossible.  \n \nWith that being said, the facility would benefit from an increased focus on reducing idleness, \nparticularly during weekends and evening hours.  Increased focus on creating “meaningful” programs \nand activities during the periods of time would have a profound impact on reducing incidents of \nviolence and improving staff and youth relationships. Defendants need to continue to develop the \n“High Risk Unit” programming that ensures youth can move through the steps at an expedited pace \nif a youth’s behavior warrants it. The music, art, gardening, welding, etc. should be expanded as youth \nreally enjoy these activities and youth exhibit positive behavior while participating in these activities.  \nThe Defendants should continue their work on implementing the behavior management system, \ncontinue with their progress in implementing DBT, providing improved youth incentives that will \nhelp reduce behavioral incidents, and bringing gender and culturally relevant programming to \nLHS/CLS.  Continued efforts need to be made to further engage the educational expert, reduce \nteacher  and  social  worker  vacancies,  increase  educational  time  and  quality,  reduce  use  of \nadministrative confinement, and clarify the observation policy to ensure compliance with the \nAgreement. Regular training in de-escalation and assessment, evaluation, and review of use of force \ncontinuum need to continue to occur. Applicable administrative code needs to be finalized and \napproved. Staff wellness needs to continue to be a priority. Lastly, as the Monitor continues to state \nin reports to the Court, there needs to be a focus on moving youth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate \nsetting(s).   \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n \n32 \n ",

The Monitor’s \nseventeenth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation \nof recommendations in the February 2018 technical assistance report, and comment on any \nobservations and/or updates since the sixteenth site visit which took place on February 9, 2023. \nSITE VISIT \nThe seventeenth site visit by the Monitor took place on May 25, 2023. The Monitor and Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel were onsite for one day and completed necessary interviews and information gathering via \nin-person and virtual meetings prior to, during and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit for the reporting period \nending May 31, 2023 (February, March, April, and May 2023).  Materials included but were not \nlimited to use of force videos, video footage of units, video footage of administrative confinement, \nvideo of safety and security checks, programming materials, investigations, daily shift reports, \npolicies, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order, meeting notes, \nemployee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint documentation, incident \nreports, and other housing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted approximately twenty-\nfive (25) youth interviews before and during the site visit.  The Monitor toured LHS/CLS and \ninterviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to many of youth and staff \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 2 of 31\n \npresent and available during the site visit. Approximately twenty-six (26) youth and twenty-four \n(24) staff were interviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.  \nOVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, CONDITIONS, AND ATMOSPHERE \nIntroduction \n \nThe total LHS/CLS population continues to decline during this reporting period. The population \nis much lower compared to the last reporting period which ranged from 62-75 youths. At the time \nof the site visit, the population was 46 youths (1 youth off site).  Staffing levels have improved \noverall from last period. Although direct-care staffing vacancy rates have improved, on most days, \nonly 50% of staff report to work due to various employee leaves. However, the current reduced \npopulation allows for adequate staffing levels.    Leadership, staff, and youth overall at LHS/CLS \ncontinue to have positive interactions with each other and the general atmosphere during the site \nvisit was calm.  Reduced population levels have enabled some programming to resume for most \nyouth due to the increase in staffing ratios. Although youth and staff attitudes were positive in \ngeneral, youth had more complaints than on the last site visit, which is discussed in more detail \nbelow.  The uses of administrative confinement and mechanical restraints were lower in CLS this \nperiod. But the uses of administrative confinement and mechanical restraints were much higher \nfor LHS youth. The overall operations of LHS/CLS continue to be moving in a positive direction \nand Defendants continue to make progress in areas of the provisions of this Agreement.  \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, school, and many other areas were clean and orderly. All units \nand the vast majority of youth rooms were clean and organized.  Staff and youth should be \ncommended for their continued commitment to improving their daily lives at LHS/CLS. \n \nDefendants continue with the following physical plant improvements: \n \n•  The video phone system that is replacing the facility Zoom program went live and was \nmade available for youth on March 6, 2023. All legal guardians and the youth’s approved \nvisitors were notified via email, and by standard mail, as to the process for creating an \naccount and completing the video visits. It is the approved visitor’s responsibility to \nschedule all video visits with you, so the youth were also encouraged to reach out to their \napproved family and friends ensuring the system is working for them, or to report issues \naccessing the system to staff.   \n•  All youth rooms on the Living units have been upgraded and replaced with LED Lighting. \n•  Updated and installed all new exhaust fans for youth living units to improve heating. \n•  New windows and doors have been installed in Wells Living Unit making that seven units \ncompleted. \n•  All living units have a new game room for youth (Xbox Room). \n•  Completed a new staff wellness work out room and created a new staff training room out \nof the old computer lab. \n•  Asphalt project has been approved and is scheduled to start beginning in June.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 3 of 31\n \n•  Began the process of updating all boilers, hot water heaters and electric panels in each \nyouth living unit. \n•  Put an order to replace all living unit dayroom televisions with larger televisions. \n•  Updated with new faucets and sinks in food service area. \n•  Removed old ceiling tiles in HSU and replaced them with new antimicrobial ceiling tiles. \n•  Updating and replacing current water fountains with new water Fountain/bottle filler \ncombination throughout school and administrative areas. \n•  The Youth Leadership Council (“YLC”) put together requests from youth to improve \nquality of life at LHS/CLS. Defendants changed clothing items for both CLS and LHS \nyouth based on youth feedback, added items in canteen/food service to provide for more \noptions, added hygiene items, added greeting cards so youth can send cards to loved ones, \nadded chocolate milk, burgers with larger patties. \n \nDefendants should be commended for their continuing commitment to improving the physical \nplant which improves the daily lives of staff and youth. The Monitor will continue to update the \nCourt on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and \nstaff.  \nEducation Observations \nStudents returned to the classroom on January 30, 2023, and remained there throughout this \nreporting period. The physical appearance of the school areas and classrooms were beautiful as \nusual. There were a lot of staff and teachers in the school area. The Monitor was happy to see that \nyouth were in class in the school receiving traditional instruction (not relying on Edgenuity).  \nYouth were happy that they are back to in-person instruction in the school. Some LHS youth were \nin the gym playing basketball and utilizing the workout equipment, CLS youth were in the library, \nand the other students were engaged in the classrooms.   \n \nSkills Development Program (SDP) units do not have education in the school building unless they \nare on Step 3.  These youth continue to receive education on the unit, including primarily on \nChromebooks during any school hours they are confined in their rooms. Chromebook-based \nlearning continues to pose a challenge for youth. \n \nAs  mentioned  in  previous  reports,  Defendants  engaged  three  consultants  to  evaluate  the \neducational programming at LHS/CLS. The education consultant’s report was finalized and \nreviewed.  The report indicated similar concerns as those raised by the youth, Plaintiffs’ counsel, \nand the Monitor, including education on the units instead of in the school, overuse of Edgenuity, \nand needed improvements to services and resources for youth with disabilities, with reading \ndifficulties, or with other special education needs. Upon receipt of the consultant’s final report, the \neducation department began evaluating the recommendations in order to prioritize its components \nand develop an implementation strategy that ensures compliance standards are met.  \n \nThe education department has made numerous updates during the reporting period to education \nservices, including changes to services provided to youth who require administrative confinement, \nor youth who are placed in the SDP. The school provides youth in Skills Development with a \nspecial education (SPED) teacher in addition to a general education teacher.  The units housing \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 4 of 31\n \nthe Skills Development Programs now have an upper day classroom dedicated to school classes \nwhere licensed SPED teachers are placed for specific social/emotional learning (SEL) support. \nThese teachers also attend youth growth team meetings with other unit staff and work closely with \nPSU. \n \nA spreadsheet has been created that monitors AC placements for youth as an indicator for potential \nIEP updates. 10 days/60 hours of AC during school hours triggers a manifestation determination \nmeeting. A manifestation determination meeting is meant to help determine if the youth’s recent \nbehavior is being caused by their disability, and/or if there are modifications to the youth’s IEP \nand its delivery that could help the student be more successful. \n \nA contingency statement has also been added to youth IEPs stating that if a youth becomes part of \nthe SDP program, the youth’s school schedule will be modified to provide more intensive and \ndirected services aimed at meeting the youth’s behavioral/emotional needs while still providing \nacademic  supports  designed  to  allow  the  student  to  progress  back  into  the \ngeneral education environment.  The  contingency  statement  is  meant  to  inform  students  and \nparents and ensure that students receive their services regardless of what living unit they are in. It \nalso makes clear that SPED youth in SDP will have access to their teachers and support staff, can \nparticipate in their IEP meetings, will receive their special education classes, and will receive \nSocial-Emotional Learning classes. \n \nThe multidisciplinary approaches between education and the other departments have resulted in \nmore collaboration particularly around the IEP process with PSU. Staff involved in this process \nare soliciting and sharing more information regarding the youth’s progress, as well as the youth’s \nemotional  and  behavioral  concerns  in  regard  to  the  school  environment  and  filtering  this \ninformation through the school psychologist. Increased efforts are being made to unify students’ \nIEPs  and  Behavior  Management  Plans  (BMPs)  and  to  consult  on  students’  behavior  and \ncorresponding intervention efforts.   \n \nThe education department continues to use student testing, previous IEP assessment data, and any \nother pertinent information in a youth’s educational record or through the multidisciplinary \napproach described above to assist in determining a student’s present level of performance. The \neducation department continues to train staff in the design of instruction and is currently working \nwith CESA 9 on this as well as exploring continuum of support options. The process improvement \nimplementation efforts in the education department with the support of CESA 9 will be ongoing \nand include staff professional development around Curriculum & Instruction (CI) and Specially \nDesigned Instruction (SDI).  \n \nStarting on June 5, 2023, the education department contracted with North Central Technical \nCollege (NCTC) to offer dual credit welding courses to students at CLS/LHS. The curriculum \nconstitutes 50 total hours of instruction in two classes, Introduction to Welding and Thermal \nCutting. Youth enrolled in the welding program attend classes in the shop on weeknights and \nduring the school day. The two classes allow youth to earn six (6) credits in total, three high school \ncredits, and 3 three credits towards the welding certificate program at NCTC that are also \ntransferrable toward any other associate degree. \n \nStaffing levels and reduced population continue to  allow for  most  youth  to  regularly  have \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 5 of 31\n \neducation in the school and off the living units and Defendants continue to implement the \nrecommendations of the educational consultants.  \n \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit (King, Roosevelt, \nBlack Elk, Rogers, Miller, Dubois, and Hughes). Overall, the units and youth rooms, halls, living \nunit area, closets, and bathrooms were very clean. Youth were respectful when interacting with the \nMonitor, Plaintiff’s counsel, and facility leadership.  \nThe unit populations ranged from three (3) (CLS unit) to ten (10) (LHS) youth.  The Monitor saw \nstaff engaging with youth during this site visit and the months preceding it during a review of \nrandom videos. \nAll the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful. However, youth were not as interested \nin talking with the Monitor as the previous site visit. Most youth were on their lunch breaks from \nschool and seemed to want to relax and converse with their friends or play cards. A few youths \ncomplained about the food and a few thought that staff showed favoritism.  Two (2) youth \ncomplained about the new staff not knowing what to do. The youth made several complaints to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel which are described below. The Monitor had an opportunity to talk to many of \nthe youth present in the day rooms.  \nSince the time onsite for the Monitoring visit is limited, the Monitor always reviews videos of the \nliving units on random days and times to get a better idea of what youth and staff do on the units \nand whether staff are positioned near youth and interacting with youth in a positive way.  The \nMonitor reviewed videos during the reporting period (random days and times) to view living units, \nschool, outdoor recreation, and other activities.  In many instances (25 videos) staff were engaged \nwith youth when they were out of their rooms doing a variety of activities such as: \n•  Eating with youth at the tables \n•  Watching television with youth \n•  Playing cards with youth  \n•  Conducting a mediation between two youths \n•  Youth in with the Chaplain \n•  Youth in classrooms \n•  Youth outside playing basketball \n•  Youth in the Douglass recreation center \n•  Youth and staff were in the music lab on several days  \n•  Youth were observed on telephones,  arts and crafts, various  recreation, prepping for \nshowers and meals \n•  Youth and staff were cleaning \n•  Youth on tablets \n•  Youth in the game room on unit \nOn review of video, staff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables with youth. The \nbody language and tone were positive from staff and youth in general on video. The Monitor did \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 6 of 31\n \nobserve one mental health staff on unit in one of the videos and there seemed to be less structured \nactivities observed.  The Defendants need to continue to focus on meaningful and structured \nprogramming.  \nDuring this site visit, the CLS youth were housed in King Unit. There were five (5) youth total in \nCLS. CLS units and youth rooms were clean.  Two (2) girls were on the unit and the other three (3) \nyouth were in school. Youth on the unit were not permitted to attend school in the building due to \ntheir status in the SDP but were playing ball and sitting and talking. Most youth had positive \nattitudes and engaged with leadership and the monitoring team. There was adequate staff in CLS. \nThe LHS youth were housed in Roosevelt, Black Elk, Rogers, Miller, Dubois, and Hughes. At the \ntime of the site visit, the units had adequate direct-care staffing.  All units were extremely clean \nand organized.   Two (2) youths were on Administrative Confinement, three (3) youths were in \ntheir rooms in LHS voluntarily. Other youth on the units were standing or sitting, talking, playing \ncards, cleaning, and/or eating.    \n \nThe Roosevelt and King living units operated as the SDP at LHS and CLS respectively during this \nreporting period due to some unit renovations. Usually, SDP youth are housed in Krueger and \nWells. The Roosevelt and part of King units are considered the “High Risk” Units. The SDP is \nmodified programming for youth who have engaged in physically aggressive behavior, have \npresented a danger to others, and/or have exhibited behavior that caused a major disruption to the \nfacility.   \n \nAs previously reported, Dialectical behavioral Therapy “DBT” is provided to youth in the SDP \nincorporating individualized planning along with the in-person group work already assigned to \nyouth in the SDP so that they are engaging in DBT skills and receiving feedback on a daily basis. \nYouth assigned to the SDP have a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by PSU in order to \nspecifically address their behavior. Youth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-\ndisciplinary team in conjunction with their weekly Growth Team. \n \nThere  needs  to  be  a  focus  on  creating  additional  activities  for  all  youth,  especially  while \noperationally confined and regardless of behavior status (i.e., even youth in the SDP). The Monitor \nis happy that Defendants continue to provide a basketball hoop and stress ball to youth on SDP. \nAdditional activities for youth are especially important in Krueger considering they are confined \nmore than the general population units. SDP includes a PAUSE in which youth are unable to \nprogress through the levels until they meet certain expectations. For LHS PAUSE youth, they are \nrotated in and out of their rooms and this has been documented as “operational confinement.” As \nrecommended in the last report, Defendants need to think of alternatives to having two groups for \nPAUSE  “operational  confinement”  on  Krueger  so  that  youth  are  not  disproportionally \noperationally confined. Some suggestions are dividing the unit or having two units operate SDP in \nLHS. The Monitor and Leadership will be discussing this in the next few weeks.  \n \nDefendants need to focus on following a daily schedule that provides for structured and meaningful \nactivities and accountability (off the unit as much as possible) to minimize the incidents of youth \nacting out and ensuring staff are adhering to the schedule absent an emergency.  Defendants also \nneed to continue to focus on consistent implementation of the new behavioral motivation system as \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 7 of 31\n \nit seems to be having a positive impact on the safety and security of the LHS/CLS. \n \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately twenty-eight (26) youth were interviewed during the site visit (formally and \ninformally)  by  the  Monitor  and  approximately  twenty-five  (25)  youth  were  interviewed \nextensively prior to and during the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel and several more informally \nduring the tour.  \n \nIn general, youth attitudes were not as positive as the last site visit, and youth were not playful or \ntalkative with the Monitoring team. A couple of youth stated that the staff “are really good here” \nbut some of the newer staff do not know what they are doing yet. A few youths complained about \nthe food but overall, the youth preferred to socialize more with each other and staff than with the \nMonitor during this site visit.  \n \nMany youths did want to talk with Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to and during the site visit and had more \ncomplaints than the last site visit. Youth in the Skills Development Program complained about \nhaving education on the units using Chromebooks and not attending class in the school area with \nlive instruction. Several youths complained about not liking the new Behavior Motivation System \n(“BMS”) and it not being evenly or consistently applied to all youth. Several youths complained \nthat staff treated them badly. A few youths complained about staff going “hands on” too quickly \nand too much. Youth also complained about recreation restrictions.  Youth also complained about \nsome staff exhibiting racist behaviors.  \n \nIt is important that Defendants continually communicate the details of the new behavior motivation \nsystem and what the expectations are of youth and staff since this is still a new system and youth \ndon’t seem to have a uniform understanding of it. It will take time to fully implement with fidelity \nand consistency. Defendants need to make sure through a rigorous quality assurance process that \nthe  system  is  being  implemented  consistently  and  in  accordance  with  training,  policy,  and \nprocedure, especially with the number of new staff onboarding.  Defendants should continue to \ninclude the youths’ voices for input and development of meaningful incentives and rewards through \nthe youth council.  The Monitor believes this new system of care will have a positive impact on the \nculture  of  the  facility  and  focus  on  youth’s  positive  behavior  in  time.    While  Defendants \noperationally confine, there needs to be additional resources available to youth and more in-room \nactivities to engage youth—even for youth on Skills Development Program. The significant hiring \nin the youth counselor classifications and reduced population, should provide for more available \nstaff and less operational confinement, in turn resulting in youth spending more time out of their \nroom, off units, and in the school area.  \n  \nThe Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more meaningful/structured \nprogramming and activities. The hiring of social workers should assist in this endeavor. It is clear \nthat when staff engage with youth, youth respond positively. The Defendants need to continue to \nfocus on gender-specific and culturally competent programming.  \n \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 8 of 31\n \nUpdate Type I Facility \n \nIn January 2023, the Milwaukee Common Council and Mayor approved rezoning the proposed \nsite for a new juvenile correctional facility in the northwest part of the City. On February 3, 2023, \nthe request for the land purchase was approved through the State Building Commission.  \n \nThe state’s Joint Committee on Finance (JCF) met June 1, 2023, and adopted budget provisions to \nfully fund the construction of the Milwaukee Type 1. The JCF serves as the principal legislative \ncommittee charged with review of all state appropriations and revenues, and it carries out a detailed \nreview of the biennial budget recommendations of the Governor. The committee’s vote to include \nfunding for the Type 1 represents a step forward, however the final budget bill must still be \napproved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. In light of these recent developments, \nthe facility remains on track for a projected completion date in 2026. \n \nAs previously mentioned, moving youth closer to locations where necessary cultural- and gender-\nrelevant programs and services are more widely available, and where family visits can be more \neasily accessible, will have a positive impact on youth and will allow for a larger pool of applicants \nto fill critical roles.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nThe staffing levels at LHS/CLS have improved during this reporting period. Staff vacancies have \nsignificantly been reduced however, employee leaves continue to be high during this reporting \nperiod at LHS/CLS and across DOC. On average, LHS/CLS is operating at 50% of staffing levels. \nStaffing  shortages  increase  the  burden  on  those  who  work  to  maintain  a  safe  and  healthy \nenvironment for youth and staff. Defendants are working diligently to try to attract and retain staff \nfor these critical roles and have truly created significant incentives for new and existing employees \nin order to help with attracting new talent and retaining current staff.  \nThe Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advance staffing vacancy percentages are lower than the \nlast  reporting  period  (see  below).    There  are  311  total  positions  (“FTEs”)  at  LHS/CLS. \nApproximately 122 of these positions are “direct care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor \nAdvanced (“YC/YCA”). There has been an improvement in the vacancy rate for youth counselors \nthis period. The teacher vacancy rate is higher than the last reporting period (8 vacancies), or 36% \nof positions, which is not the direction the Monitor hoped for.  With limited educators, Defendants \nwill have continued difficulty with increasing the quality and quantity of education for youth. \nThere are no social worker vacancies at the moment which is a huge improvement over the last \nreporting period. The salary range was increased in order to attract and retain social workers.  \nRecruiting in general is still a challenge due to the location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if \nLHS/CLS will close, and for educators, the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to \ncontinue.   \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \nOctober 31, 2022  January 31, 2023  April 30, 2023 \n     \n \n \n  8 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 9 of 31\n \n                                                                    YCYCoooouuuuntnthshs e e lloorr   2211%%  ((260 o ouut to of f2 984) )  2342%%  ((293 o ouut to of f2 984) )  1245%%  ((173 o ouut to of f2 984) ) \n  Adv. \n \nTeacher  32% (6 out of 19)  32% (6 out of 19)  36% (8 out of 22) \n \n  Social Worker  75% (9 out of 12)  64% (7 out of 11)  0% (0 out of 6) \n \n \nCritical hires this period are as follows: \n•  One Special Education Teacher \n•  Two new Psychological Associates are scheduled to start in June \n•  Twenty-one (21) new YC were hired from February 1, 2023, through April 30, 2023 \n•  Seven additional new YCs accepted offers after April 30, 2023 \n•  All six Social Worker positions are now filled \n \nSpecific efforts to recruit staff during this reporting period included: \n•  YC/YCA $4 add-on extended to the date of implementation of the 2023-2025 State of WI \nCompensation Plan \n•  NC 2 $5 add-on extended to the date of the implementation of the 2023-2025 State of WI \nCompensation Plan \n•  Some current Psychological Associates received a base pay increase due to equity \n•  Sign-on bonuses extended for YC, Treatment Specialist 1 & 2, Social Worker, Psych Assoc \n& Psych Licensed, Teacher \n•  DOC Recruitment commercials continue with Bally Sports (these air during major WI \nsports games) \n•  DOC Recruitment continues with billboard advertising in select areas around the state \nincluding one specific to DJC and the facility located on the corner of two densely traveled \nlocal highways \n \nRecruiting efforts for this period include: \n•  UW Stevens Point Career Fair- 2/28/23 \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews- Rhinelander Job Center- 3/20/23 \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews- Wausau Job Center- 3/22/23 \n•  Merrill High School Job Fair- 4/6/23 \n•  DOC Virtual Military Open House & Career Fair- 4/19/23 \n•  Rhinelander High School Job Fair- 4/20/23 \n•  CLS/LHS Treatment Director presented to UW Stevens Point “Intro to Social Work” class- \n4/20/23 \n•  UW Stevens Point (Marathon County) Career Expo- 4/21/23 \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews- Rhinelander Job Center- 5/1/23 \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews- Wausau Job Center- 5/2/23 \n•  Northcentral Technical College Nursing Career Fair- 5/12/23 \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 10 of 31\n \n•  Medford High School Job Fair- 5/16/23 \n \nDefendants continue to focus on staff wellness. Below are the employee wellness events occurring \nduring this reporting period: \n \nFebruary 7 & 8, 2023  Breakfast Burritos \nFebruary 10, 2023  Therapy Dogs \nFebruary 15, 2023  Wisconsin Day! \nMarch 15 & 17, 2023  St. Patrick’s Day Events \nApril 5, 2023  Treats for Teammates \nApril 9, 2023  Easter Egg Hunt for Staff \nApril 11 & 12, 2023  Chen family fundraiser \n \nThe CIRT’s most recent meeting was held March 30 at Wiggly Field Indoor Volleyball Court. \nMany of the team members came in on their days off, which showed their individual commitment \nto the efforts of supporting DJC’s staff. The group started the morning off with a quick icebreaker \nintended to compel new ideas for the team. One such proposal was performing scheduled CIRT \npresence throughout the facility. Because the facility has a fair number of newer employees, the \nCIRT wants to be front and center ensuring facility staff are aware of CIRT, know what CIRT’s \ncore function and purpose is, and most importantly, avail themselves of the resources CIRT offers. \nFinally, staff were reminded about the important role that confidentiality plays in making CIRT \nsuccessful and how CIRT members are held to a higher standard and looked up to as leaders. To \nconclude the meeting the CIRT team participated in a mock defusing and a mock debriefing \nfocusing on the skills the team has been trained on and keeping those skills sharp.  \n \nMay 8 through 12, was Correctional Employees Week. Throughout the first week of May, four \ntimes a day during all five weekdays, goodies for staff were delivered across all shifts for employee \nappreciation week plus drawings for gift cards and assorted gift baskets that in total twenty-one \n(21) staff won.  \n \nNumerous facility staff were nominated, and several were chosen as winners in the 2023 DOC \nSALUTE Awards. The SALUTE awards annually recognize employees who go above and beyond \nin the performance of their job duties under the categories of Service, Awareness, Leadership, \nUnique, Team, and Excellence.  \n \nThe Monitor spoke to over twenty-four (24) staff. Staff morale seemed good overall at the time of \nthe site visit. A review of video over the reporting period showed staff regularly engaging with \nyouth. Staff were less talkative on this site visit, but this could be due to the time of day of the site \nvisit (lunch break) or the fact that many of the staff were new and OJT staff were in training.  \nThe behavioral motivation system has been fully implemented. The BMS focuses on a youth’s \nprogress in their education and treatment plans. This model involves a focus on positive youth \noutcomes and an improved behavior motivation system. As stated in previous reports, the goal of \nthe pilot for the new system of care was to develop a team atmosphere amongst groups of living \nunits, consistent post assignments, and to reduce overall ordering. The Monitor continues to \nrecommend that this team approach extend to PSU and Education so that each housing unit has \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 11 of 31\n \nthe same team working with them.  Moving the Supervisors office to the units helped create a team \ndynamic and add additional support. The Monitor recommends that PSU staff also move to the \nunit they are assigned in order to increase their support on the units.  When critical staff are present \nand available on the units, overall safety and quality of life improve.  \nThe Monitor is very supportive of this new system of care.   The “one team” approach has proved \nsuccessful in other jurisdictions.  The Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff \nwellness a major focus moving forward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, \nchanges to programming, and general information as well as sharing positive outcome measure \ndata. A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible and are properly \ntrained for the environment and youth demographics. Improving staff wellness will certainly have \na positive impact on the overall atmosphere and reduce turnover, which will then provide an \nopportunity to decrease the vacancy rate, reduce employee leaves and improve staffing ratios.  \nUse of Force Reviews \n \nThe Monitor has reviewed a variety of use of force incidents during this reporting period.  Some \nof the incident videos showed staff using Principles of Subject Control (POSC) during physical \nrestraints and others showed the use of Mandt.  The Mandt system is a comprehensive integrated \napproach to preventing, de-escalating, and if necessary, intervening, when a youth’s behavior \nposes a threat of harm to themselves or others. While the Mandt system acknowledges the need to \nuse physical restraints, it focuses on physical restraints being used on a youth at a lower frequency \nand lower duration than POSC—only in circumstances to prevent harm to staff, other youth or \nthemselves.  \n \nThe Mandt System integrates knowledge about the neurobiological impact of trauma with the \nprinciples of positive behavior interventions and provides a framework that empowers staff to do \ntheir work in a way that attempts to minimalize the use of physical intervention. The Monitor \nencourages  the  Defendants  to  fully  implement  the  Mandt  system  strategies  and  techniques \ndesigned to support de-escalation and lower the potential of staff or youth injury. Defendants \nshould incorporate facility expectations for the use of Mandt techniques and set a target date to \ndiscontinue training staff in POSC.  \n \nThe two techniques (POSC and Mandt) had sharply different results. Oftentimes, the POSC \nrestraints actually escalated physical restraint incidents, meaning youth got more upset and staff \nintervention was more aggressive than when the Mandt techniques were implemented, which in \nturn raised the potential for negative outcomes to safety for the staff and youth involved.  \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nThe Quality Assurance Program at LHS/CLS continues to be second to none.  DJC has a program \nthat other jurisdictions should model. Critical information is readily available to the leadership \nwhich allows them to make proactive, data driven decisions that increases the safety of youth and \nstaff.  During this reporting period, Defendants have developed data for the requirements of this \nCourt Order.  This is very useful tool to assess compliance with this Court Order.  Again, \ncontinuous improvements have been made in data collection and in the quality assurance program.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 12 of 31\n \nPolicy and Procedure Update \n \nThe DJC Policy Committee continues to review and update policies of note to the facility.  In the \nDecember meeting, the committee reviewed the following policies which will allow for further \nreview of facility procedure in the coming months: \n \n•  100.07.04 – Bomb Threats  \n•  100.07.05 – Emergency Procedures for Major Chemical Spills, Gas Leaks, or Similar \nEmergencies  \n•  300.02.14 – Sale of Facility Goods  \n•  300.05.16 – Contraband  \n•  300.07.03 – Escorting and Transporting Pregnant Youth  \n \nThe following policies have been reviewed and approved by administration;  \n \n•  100.07.03 – Fire Emergency Procedures  \n•  200.07.02 – Bomb Threats \n•  300.02.15 – Youth Property  \n•  300.04.03 – Incentives  \n•  300.05. 24 – Internal and External Communication Systems for Emergencies  \n \nAdministrative Code Revisions Update \n \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and \nDOC Chapter 373 forward. During this reporting period the committee met with the Office of \nLegal Counsel (OLC) to discuss the current draft of Chapter 373. The committee continues to \nrefine Chapter 373 and incorporate OLC recommendations.  The committee also received the final \nedits from OLC regarding Chapter 376 and is now in the process of reviewing suggested edits and \nfinalizing the draft.   \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 13 of 31\n \nyouth are being confined for seven days for any reason.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nyouth are being confined for three days for any reason.  \n \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Defendants  need to continue to \nexamine their use of all forms of confinement and review incidents to ensure that staff are \nnot using any form of confinement as punitive confinement including High-Risk Program \nPAUSES stage.  Confinement is not appropriate during the PAUSE stage of the High-Risk \nProgram.  After discussion with the Defendants, they are reassessing the confinement for \nyouth for the PAUSE stage of the program. In addition, the Monitor assessed whether youth \ncame out of their room for administrative confinement at the time indicated in reports by \nreviewing ten (10) incidents. Nine out of ten youth came out at the time indicated in \ndocumentation. Upon further review, the one (1) youth that did not come out of room at the \ntime indicated, was because they immediately went into operational confinement.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only  be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of AC was significantly \nlower for CLS this period. The use of AC was much higher for LHS. There was a substantial \nincrease in youth confined over four (4) hours in this reporting period (16 instances). \nDefendants need to continue to examine use of all forms of confinement and review incidents \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 14 of 31\n \nto ensure that staff are not using any form of confinement as punitive confinement including \nthe High-Risk Program PAUSES stage.  Confinement is not appropriate during the PAUSE \nstage of the High-Risk Program. After discussion with the Defendants, they are reassessing \nthe confinement for youth for the PAUSE stage of the program. Defendants need to continue \nto assess how they can more effectively provide intensive mental health services for youth  \n. \n \nOctober 2022 \nCLS: 40 uses of A.C. Average 153 minutes. Two (2) youth over four hours. \nLHS: 53 uses of A.C. Average of 307 minutes. Seven (7) youth over four hours.  \n \nNovember 2022 \nCLS: 22 uses of A.C. Average 134 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 19 uses of A.C. Average of 210 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours \n(22 hours). \n \nDecember 2022 \nCLS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 147 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 35 uses of A.C. Average of 172 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nJanuary 2023 \nCLS: 3 uses of A.C. Average 113 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 30 uses of A.C. Average of 151 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nFebruary 2023 \nCLS: 3 uses of A.C. Average 128 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 49 uses of A.C. Average 241 minutes. Seven (7) youth over 4 hours. One \nyouth 2180 minutes (approximately 36 hours). \n \nMarch 2023 \nCLS: 14 uses of A.C. Average 109 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 19 uses of A.C. Average 108 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \n \nApril 2023 \nCLS: 10 uses of A.C. Average 120 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 57 uses of A.C. Average 194 minutes. Six (6) youth over 4 hours with   \none youth confined for 2164 minutes (approximately 36 hours). \n \nMay 2023 \nCLS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 117 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 46 uses of A.C. Average 163 minutes.  Three (3) youth over 4 hours. \n \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit. 99.25%- 99.66% of checks were completed within 30 minutes \nduring this reporting period. The Monitor reviewed video footage for random days and times \n(50  reviews)  and  Defendants  were  100%  compliance  with  completing  the  checks  in \naccordance with policy. Staff did an outstanding job and should be commended for their \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 15 of 31\n \ndiligence in ensuring youth safety while in their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \npose a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  sixteen  (16)  youth \nconfined for over four (4) hours during this reporting period (see response in previous \nquestion). This is a significant increase in number of placements and the amount of time in \nplacements from the last reporting period.  Documentation shows that PSU approved the \nextended time.  \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring any form of room \nconfinement is compliant with this Court Order, draft policy and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Six (6) youth were placed on \nextended placement in administrative confinement pending transfer out of the facility (4-\nMJTC, 1- released, 1-adult prison).  The other ten (10) youth had a plan commenced to \nreturn the youth to general population. \n \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to 8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.  \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) youths \nadministratively confined beyond 24 hours who were transferred.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 16 of 31\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol policy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and \nshall treat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended \npolicy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 is being utilized. The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. Only \nyouth who are at imminent risk of serious self-harm to themselves/risk of self-harm will be \nplaced in observation status. There were 27 youth in observation status this period. Youth \nwere regularly seen by mental health per documentation. The Monitor will continue to \nreview and monitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor would not \ndeem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety and \nsecurity measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make the \nrooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed in renovated units. Youth rooms were \nthe cleanest the Monitor has seen since being appointed. The rooms were very organized \nallowing staff to clearly see into the room, perform room searches more effectively, and \nensure to the extent possible that there are no dangerous items in room.   \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants are in substantial compliance. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 17 of 31\n \nMonitor about access to water, regular hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. A few of \nSDP youth complained to Plaintiffs’ counsel that they did not receive the higher quality \nhygiene items that youth in general population can earn through the Behavior Motivation \nSystem.  Defendants have modified their practice as per recommendation by the Monitor. \nDefendants have improved their documentation and data collection.  \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin room confinement, staff shall engage in challenges intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible. PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants continue to properly \ndocument who from PSU was notified, time of notification, and the intervention technique \nutilized with the youth.  \n \nExamples of the crisis intervention techniques used with youth when confined can include, \nbut are not limited to: processing of the incident, coping ahead/safety plans, in the moment \nskills  coaching/practice  of  DBT  skills  including  mindfulness,  recommitment  to  goals, \nvalidation,  time  away  from  stressors  or  time  for  reflection/refusing,  fostering  insight, \nimplementation  of  established  Youth  Plan,  assistance  problem-solving,  increase  self-\nawareness/awareness of body sensations as indicators, Behavior Chain Analysis (formal and \ninformal) and Thinking Report, encourage self-reflection/identify vulnerabilities, consistent \nredirection/limits, Behavior Intervention Protocol fostering insight/skill identification/skill \npractice, and plans to address conflict/safety/skills practice. \n \nClinicians are on-site for 6 hours each Saturday and Sunday. The Monitor continues to \nsuggest that PSU increase the hours in which they are physically present on weekends and \nevening hours in order to engage youth in a meaningful way during this time.  Because \nconfinement can create or exacerbate mental health problems, treatment is going to be even \nmore critical as the population continues to remain higher if the Defendants are confining \nyouth to their rooms for any reason. The Monitor also suggests that specific PSU clinicians \nshould work with the same youth in order to establish continuity (when possible) and should \nprimarily work on the units. If possible, Defendants should consider putting PSU staff \noffices on the unit like they did with the Supervisors’ offices.  This will reinforce to the youth \nand staff that they are “one team” servicing the youth and could be readily present to \nmitigate any situations.  The Monitor did speak to a clinician on the unit who is primarily \nassigned to two units. The Monitor was pleased to see the clinician on the unit, and she was \nvery familiar with the youth she worked with on the units.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 18 of 31\n \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  In  general,  documentation/data \nshows that evaluations are completed (if there is not already a mental health evaluation) \nwithin 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. The Monitor is told youth on \noperational confinement are being seen by PSU and evaluated for contraindication. The \ndocumentation  has  improved,  and  the  Monitor  has  seen  documentation  for  youth  on \noperational confinement and whether they are evaluated for contraindication.   \n \nThere  were  no  instances  of  contraindication  documented  during  this  review  period. \nDefendants need to ensure that they are meeting the criteria in this section and document \nany and all room confinement including operational room confinement.  \n \n     e.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant to \ncurrent policy at least every 30 minutes in all cases, and contemporaneously \nrecord the actual time of such checks in a log kept for that purpose. Staff who \nfail to make such checks or who falsify such records may be subject discipline. \nAny youth placed in room confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall \nreceive daily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be face-\nto-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is personally available, \nin which case it may occur by phone or video conferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants were between 99.25%- \n99.66% compliant with meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe. \nQuality assurance measures are in place and when necessary, formal investigations occur. \nThere were no formal job instructions for not completing safety and security checks. The \nMonitor observed safety/wellness checks being completed on various days/times on every \nunit during this reporting period and observed no instances in which staff did not make \nvisual contact with youth per policy- 100% of the checks were compliant. Staff met or \nexceeded the 30-minute timeframe, looked into room, and the intervals were staggered.  \n \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time in the evenings and weekends doing \ngroups  and  having  one-on-one  sessions  with  youth.  The  Monitor  also  continues  to \nrecommend that PSU staff, like Supervisors, have offices on the unit and work with the same \nyouth when possible.   \n \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 19 of 31\n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \ne.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  While  youth  are  on \noperational room confinement, regardless of level in the behavior management program or \ntheir status on SDP, the Monitor recommends that youth be provided with activities to do \nthat would encourage physical movement in rooms, arts, crafts, music etc.  Based on the \nMonitor’s recommendation, as of February 2023, youth on SDP transitioned to level “C” \nfrom “D” affording youth better hygiene products and fans. Thus, all youth on level C receive \nthe same property regardless of where they are housed.  \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general.  It is difficult to assess whether \nthese services are being provided while youth are in operational room confinement because \nDefendants do not track operational room confinement time per youth. During the reporting \nperiod the DOC broad-banded the Social Worker Classification giving the facility the ability \nto pay employees in that classification more money than previously was possible to offer. As \na result, several people who were certified social workers, but were working in different \npositions at CLS/LHS accepted positions back as social workers.  This is a significant \nimprovement from the last site visit. Social workers are critical to quality of care and services \nfor the youth and effective re-entry planning.  \nDefendants need to ensure there is accountability with respect to the services provided by \nthe social workers, mental and healthcare workers.  \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 20 of 31\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants moved to smaller group-\nbased  treatment  to  youth  where  group  participation  was  provided  on  the  units.  This \ncontinues. Beginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group \ntreatment sessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule. The \nMonitor continues to encourage these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as \npossible.  \n   \nDefendants  need  to  continue  to  focus  (document  and  QA)  on  providing  rehabilitative \nprogramming  that  was  scheduled/in  process  before  placement  in  room  confinement \nincluding operational confinement. Defendants need to ensure that any missed/rescheduled \ntreatment groups do not negatively impact a youth’s progress. \n \n  \niii.         Educational  services with  the general  population to  the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices. Defendants shall ensure special education services \nfor all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. On January 31, 2023, youth began \ngoing down to the school area including SDP youth on Level 3 (SDP youth on Levels 1 and 2 \ncomplete their educational instruction on the living unit). Youth were in school during the site \nvisit and the Monitor saw youth in school during random video reviews.  Some youth also had \ndifficulty learning through Edgenuity. The Monitor is pleased to report that education is being \nprovided in the traditional manner which is not relying on Edgenuity for many youths. As noted \nabove, some youth on SDP Step 1 and 2 continue to receive education on the unit and they \ncontinue to work from Chromebooks when confined to their rooms. \n \nThe  education  consultants  completed  their  report  which  included  recommendations.  \nDefendants are working on implementing many of the recommendations. There needs to be \na continued focus on providing more instruction by teachers and not self-instruction or \ninstruction on Edgenuity, more assistance for students with disabilities or reading problems, \nand education in the school area which is more representative of a typical educational setting \nin the community.  \n \nThe  Monitor  continues  to  suggest  that  Defendants  should  provide  more  art,  music, \nwoodworking, the greenhouse, welding, and sewing and other types of programs to youth in \nthe evening and on weekends The Monitor was happy to see during the site visit and through \n.\nrandom video review that during this reporting period, youth were able to access many of \nthese programs. As of June, youth are now able to get educational credit for welding.  This \nwill assist youth in obtaining employment when released.  The youth expressed how much \nthey like these activities to the Monitor.  However, the Defendants should continue to focus \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 21 of 31\n \non bringing more programming into LHS/CLS, especially culturally and gender relevant \nprograms. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staffing levels have significantly \nimproved this period.  Youth are regularly out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. During \nthis reporting period, the general population youth are going to the school area. Youth on \nSDP Levels 1 and 2 do not go to the school area for education area.  Monitor regularly saw \nyouth conversing with other youth during out time when the youth were on the units in the \nday room.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were eighteen (18) \ndocumented instances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on \nsubstantial threat of physical harm during this reporting period. Defendants are able to \ntrack when youth eat meals in their rooms and based on reports that the Monitor reviewed, \nit appears these instances were justified.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. According to Defendants’ tracking, \nthere were sixteen (16) youth who did not receive 3 hours of out time per day and three (3) \nyouth who did not receive at least 30 hours per week. The facility continues to confine youth \non SDP who are also on PAUSE.  Defendants are strategizing on how to continue with \nPAUSE in SDP without rotating youth in and out of their rooms.  There was less operational \nconfinement due to staffing shortages in this period.    \n \nLHS SDP unit continues to operate primarily on a two-group schedule seven days per week \nthroughout the reporting period. However, CLS SDP unit has operated in one group since \nJanuary 4, 2023. Documentation of the youth who are subject to operational confinement \nbegan  in  May.  Since  then,  DJC  has  tracked  and  documented  the  use  of  operational \nconfinement and the reason for its necessity. This documentation has been maintained and \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 22 of 31\n \nprovided with the materials produced for the 10th of the month reports. \nDefendants do not track this on an individual basis, so the Monitor cannot determine how \nmany youths are not getting at least 3 hours of out-time per day or 30 hours per week \nindependently. Defendants are tracking groups of youth per unit based on scheduling.  \nAccording to their data, sixteen (16) youth did not meet their required 3 hours of “out time” \nper day and three (3) youth did not receive at least 30 hours/week of out time.  Once the \nRFID can track this on an individual basis, the Monitor will be able to more accurately assess \nthis provision.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals. Within one hour of a youth's placement in \nroom confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The DOC-2942A was developed and \nmoved into J-Tracker operation designed to draw the required information for the written \nreport directly from the incident debrief form, as soon as the SYC overseeing the incident \nhas completed their required fields for a major incident. Once the SYC has completed their \nrequired fields, a response assignment can be generated by the SYC to the unit staff where \nthe youth on AC is housed. Upon receipt of the response assigned, unit staff are then able to \ngenerate the DOC-2942A and deliver it to the youth. \n \nThe new process and forms have been drafted into an updated Incident Debrief procedure. \nThere is a photo uploaded showing staff giving the notice to youth with time stamp.  Youth \nwho are confined due to staffing issues/PAUSE are not given these notifications of rights.  \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth  is  placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \nconsistently except in cases of operational confinement, including when less restrictive \nmeans  were  attempted.  Documentation,  data  collection  and  reliability,  and  quality \nassurance (with video review) needs to continue especially for AC. Also, documentation \nneeds to be created that proves a youth was promptly provided with the report upon the \ncompletion of room confinement including operational room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 23 of 31\n \n \n1.  OC reduction plan. Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    The  Monitor  did  not \npersonally see any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit. Data and documentation \nshow that there was significant decrease in use of mechanical restraints for both LHS and \nCLS. The Monitor reviewed several uses of force videos and there were no inappropriate \nuses of mechanical restraints observed.  \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regain control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Below  is  the  number  of \nmechanical restraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \n \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \nNovember 2022:               1 use \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 24 of 31\n \nDecember 2022:              4 uses \nJanuary 2023:                 3 uses \nFebruary 2023:             21 uses \nMarch 2023:                    2 uses \nApril 2023:                    12 uses \nMay 2023:              15 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \n \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \nNovember 2022:    4 uses \nDecember 2022:              2 uses \nJanuary 2023:                 1 use \nFebruary 2023:     1 use \nMarch 2023:                    4 uses \nApril 2023:                1 use \nMay 2023:      1 use \n \nDefendants  have  significantly  reduced  the  use  of  mechanical  restraints  in  CLS  but \nsignificantly increased the use in LHS compared to the last four-month reporting period.  \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were  zero uses of \nrestraints other than handcuffs during this reporting period.  Defendants have developed \npolicy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were  zero uses of \nrestraints other than handcuffs during this reporting period.  They were ordered by \nsecurity staff as youth posed an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to \nothers. Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 25 of 31\n \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used. Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor has not observed \nmechanical restraints used for punishment/discipline on site visits, review of video, or \ndocumentation  reviewed.    The  mechanical  restraints  policy  and  a  subsequent  facility \nprocedure was finalized April 4, 2022. The Incident Debrief QA process, and the Use of Force \nReview  QA  process  updates  have  overlapped  to  provide  QA  staff,  POSC/MANDT \ninstructors, and facility administration with a triple layered system for scrutinizing all uses \nof mechanical restraints.  \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. All safety staff equipped with \nmechanical restraints are trained specifically in the use of physical force, and restraints, and \nin proper de-escalation techniques. Defendants should incorporate facility expectations for \nthe use of Mandt techniques and set a target date to discontinue training staff in POSC.  \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living \nunit.  No  youth  shall  be  left  alone  in  restraints.  Any  use  of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 26 of 31\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE FOR THIS PERIOD. There \nwas one instance of a youth being placed in mechanical restraints for over 45 minutes and \nit was approved by the Deputy Superintendent. Defendants have created a QA process for \nthis section. Defendants also need to ensure therapeutic interventions occur when youth are \nmechanically restrained in excess of 45 minutes.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has \nbeen added to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been \nmodified. The length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is \nregularly documented as part of the Incident Debrief process.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.   Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possess drugs or weapons that could not \nbe discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches in this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been \nfinalized. A Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all \nsupervisors to outline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under \nwhich a strip search may be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search.    \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause. Less intrusive searches, including using \na metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top \nor other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is conducted, \nunless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth that less \nintrusive  searches,  which  may  include  physical  contact,  would  cause \ngreater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  zero  (0)  strip \nsearches this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 27 of 31\n \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis  reporting  period.  It  was  conducted  in  a  private  area.  QA  has  been  developed. \nContraband was in fact found. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches during this reporting period. No youth was near the youth being strip searched.  \nQA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nconducted during this reporting period. The staff conducting the strip search was the same \ngender. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis period the staff conducting the search was trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches during this reporting period. Staff were aware of the mental health status prior to \nthe search as youth regularly attempts to self-harm. Staff did find contraband that could \nhave  been  used  in  self-harm.  Documentation  has  improved.  Policy  and  procedure/QA \ndeveloped.  \n \n4.       Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 28 of 31\n \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants do provide de-\nescalation training to new and current staff.  All safety staff are trained specifically on proper \nde-escalation  techniques  and  are  provided  with  additional  systems  trainings  including \nMandt and Verbal Judo. In addition to the internal refresher training all staff are required \nto maintain their POSC certification.  \n \nThe Monitor has reviewed a variety of use of force incidents during this reporting period.  \nSome of the incident videos showed staff using Principles of Subject Control (POSC) during \nphysical  restraints  and  others  showed  the  use  of  Mandt.    The  Mandt  system  is  a \ncomprehensive  integrated  approach  to  preventing,  de-escalating,  and  if  necessary, \nintervening, when a youth’s behavior poses a threat of harm to themselves or others. While \nthe Mandt system acknowledges the need to use physical restraints, it focuses on physical \nrestraints being used on a youth at a lower frequency and lower duration than POSC—only \nin circumstances to prevent harm to staff, other youth or themselves.  \n \nThe Mandt System integrates knowledge about the neurobiological impact of trauma with \nthe principles of positive behavior interventions and provides a framework that empowers \nstaff to do their work in a way that attempts to minimalize the use of physical intervention. \nThe Monitor encourages the Defendants to fully implement the Mandt system strategies and \ntechniques designed to support de-escalation and lower the potential of staff or youth injury. \nDefendants should incorporate facility expectations for the use of Mandt techniques and set \na target date to discontinue training staff in POSC.  \n \nThe two techniques (POSC and Mandt) had sharply different results. Oftentimes, the POSC \nrestraints actually escalated physical restraint incidents, meaning youth got more upset and \nstaff intervention was more aggressive than when the Mandt techniques were implemented, \nwhich in turn raised the potential for negative outcomes to safety for the staff and youth \ninvolved.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 29 of 31\n \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor and Defendants have \nhad many conversations/meetings regarding increased programming.  As recommended \npreviously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social workers, PSU \nstaff,  and  volunteers  can  be  utilized  in  creating  and  leading  programming  for  youth. \nDefendants  should  continuously  work  to  increase  meaningful/structured  program  and \nactivity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours.  \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018, \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested for improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants  have  implemented  several  initiatives  to  increase  recruiting  and  retention, \nparticularly in the social worker classification which has resulted in all of the social worker \npositions  being  filled.  The  Monitor  recommends  that  a  formal  staffing  assessment  be \ncompleted.  A staffing assessment will provide the jurisdiction with an updated analysis \nneeded to properly maintain mandatory posts for each facility as well as identify any specific \nneeds based on facility designs, populations, and staffing ratio needs based on incidents of \nviolence and other unique circumstances to each facility. Staffing assessments also take into \nconsideration the average leave usage for all types of leave used on an annual basis, to include \nvacations, sick leave, Worker’s Compensation, FMLA, and leave associated with annual \ntraining.  Ensuring that each facility has the appropriate number of FTE’s to effectively \nmanage the facility also has a direct impact on staff wellness and reducing fear for safety \nconcerns.   As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts the \noverall culture, atmosphere, and environment of the facility. Staff wellness has a direct \nimpact on the relationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, \nuse of restraint, reduces employee leave/vacancies, and the use of isolation and confinement.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments  to  administrative  code.  Defendants  will  make  all  reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  DJC’s  Administrative  Code \ncommittee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter 373 \nforward. During this reporting period the committee met with the Office of Legal Counsel \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 30 of 31\n \n(OLC) to discuss the current draft of Chapter 373. The committee continues to refine \nChapter 373 and incorporate OLC recommendations.  The committee also received the final \nedits from OLC regarding Chapter 376 and is now in the process of reviewing suggested \nedits and finalizing the draft.   \n \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process. Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent. Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review all uses of strip \nsearches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon probable \ncause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in the \nvast majority of cases absent weekends. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in \nmajority of cases. When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is \na corrective action plan developed but follow-up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). Defendants QA program is exceptional and continues to further \ndevelop the program to include compliance measures with this Court Order.  The QA team \nshould be commended for all the hard work and dedication to creating an extremely robust \nsystem that has increased the safety for youth and staff by allowing leadership to make \nproactive decisions and analyze many key data points on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.  \n            \nB.           Quality assurance. The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  As  discussed  throughout \nprevious reports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court \nOrder and to improve the quality of life for youth and staff. Defendants have created an \nexceptional quality assurance program and have developed daily data to review that will \nautomatically be available in order to make real-time operational decisions. Defendants \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 142   Filed: 07/05/23   Page 31 of 31\n \ncontinue to further develop the program to include additional compliance measures with this \nCourt Order.   \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe population trended down, and staff vacancy rates improved resulting in improved staffing \nratios in this reporting period. The Monitor was pleased that youth attended traditional education \nin the school area (except those on units 1 and 2 of SDP) for the entire reporting period. The \nrecommendations of the educational consultant should continue to be implemented to improve the \nquality and quantity of education. Defendants need to continue to focus on programming, de-\nescalation training, and ensuring that the new system of care/behavior motivation system is being \nimplemented  consistently  which  should  have  a  positive  impact  on  youth  by  reducing \nadministrative confinement and physical and mechanical restraints. The Monitor continues to \nrecommend that PSU have a bigger presence on the units as this can mitigate any incidents of \nviolence  and  subsequent  use  of  force  as  well.  Based  on  these  video  reviews,  the  Monitor \nencourages  the  Defendants  to  fully  implement  the  Mandt  system  strategies  and  techniques \ndesigned to support de-escalation and lower the potential of staff or youth injury.  \n \nLastly, as the Monitor continues to state in reports to the Court, there needs to be a continued focus \non moving youth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s) or diverting them from confinement \nentirely. Overall, the Monitor continues to see progress. \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns of the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n31 \n ",

      "text": " \n \n \n \n \n \nVia E-Mail and U.S. Postal Service \n \nAugust 16, 2024 \n \nHonorable Judge James Peterson \nUnited States District Court \nWestern District of Wisconsin \n120 N. Henry Street, Suite 320 \nMadison, WI 53703 \n \nDear Judge Peterson –  \n \nYou were cc’d on a letter sent from the Republican members of the Senate Committee on \nJudiciary and Public Safety and Assembly Committee on Corrections (hereinafter referred to as \n“Committee”) requesting the Department of Corrections (“DOC”) seek modifications to the \nconsent decree in J.J. vs Litscher, Case No. 17-CV-47. Through news media sources, I received \na copy of the letter that Governor Evers sent you asking for no changes in the consent decree. \nLike Governor Evers, I, the Committee, and the Legislature are not parties to this case. My only \npurpose in writing you is to ensure you have the fullest picture of what is occurring at Lincoln \nHills/Copper Lake. \n \nUnlike Governor Evers, I will not use this letter for partisan attacks or rhetoric. I write to correct \nmany of the factual errors contained in the letter sent by Governor Evers. I will address them in \nthe order in which they appear in Governor Evers’ letter. \n \n1 – “…recent efforts requesting the consent decree to be modified and softened, namely by \nmembers of the Wisconsin State Legislature…” \n  Although the letter from the Committee does request Secretary-Designee Hoy request \nmodifications to the consent decree, the Committee is not the only group seeking \nmodifications. Those requesting modifications include members of the Legislature not \non the Committees, current and former staff at Lincoln Hills/Copper Lake (“LH/CL”) \naffected family members and even former inmates at LH/CL.   \n \n2 – “[The Legislature]…fail[s] to acknowledge or recognize this history and the pattern of \nneglectful and unlawful behavior [resulting in the consent decree]. \n  As you know from the Committee letter, members expressly acknowledge and \nrecognize the history of behavior at LH/CL.1 \n                                                 \n1 Page 2, Paragraph 4 of the Committee letter, “We are all aware of the conditions at Lincoln Hills that necessitated \nthe consent decree six years ago. Those conditions were unacceptable, and no one wants to return to those \nconditions.” \n \n\n \n3 – “I believe it is highly unlikely that the ACLU…will seek or support changes to the consent \ndecree. …[I]t also seems unlikely that you and this Court would be willing to accept any \nchanges.” \n  While this statement may be true, the Court revisiting the consent decree and its \nrestrictions is appropriate given the dangerous conditions for both juveniles and staff at \nLH/CL. \n \n4 – “[Lincoln Hills/Copper Lake] is now getting praise as a national leader in the juvenile \ncorrections space [from the Council of Juvenile Justice Administrators].” \n  The Council of Juvenile Justice Administrators (CJJA) is, essentially, a think tank with \ncorporate sponsors. While CJJA’s mission may be aligned with the Evers \nAdministration’s goals, and may align with your and the plaintiff parties’ view of \nJuvenile Corrections, it is not the only entity with an interest in Juvenile Corrections.  \n \nAlthough I did not do a deep dive into CJJA’s corporate sponsors, I note that one of the \nsponsors of CJJA is “The MANDT system”. The MANDT system is a “holistic, \nevidence-based training system to reduce workplace violence.”2  At the Senate \nCommittee’s hearing in Merrill on August 6, we heard from DOC that they are requiring \nstaff to use the MANDT system. We also heard from staff that the MANDT system isn’t \nworking at LH/CL, and largely fails to de-escalate conflict.  \n \nI point this out not to disparage or malign the MANDT system. I raise this to show that \nCJJA has vested interest in promoting use of its sponsors’ products, and claiming the \nsuccessful implementation of them.  \n \n5 – “[T]he consent decree not only increases safety for youth, but it helps keep our staff safe \ntoo.” \n \n  Assaults on staff have reached all-time highs since implementation of the consent \ndecree, despite having 60% fewer juveniles at LH/CL. According to DOC’s own data, \nthere has been a 47% increase in staff assault since 2018, with a record 93.82% \ncompletion rate of a “successful staff assault.” As you are aware, earlier this year, \nLH/CL was the site of the first murder of a Wisconsin correctional officer in the state’s \n176 year history.  \n \nAt our almost 8-hour hearing in Merrill, attended by DOC and Governor Evers’ staff, \nwe heard testimony of extremely low staff morale, and staff afraid to do their job for \nfear of being reprimanded. We heard testimony of staff afraid to file complaints or speak \nup, for fear of retaliation. Staff testified that attacks on staff and between inmates have \nbeen covered up or not reported, and that staff body camera footage has mysteriously \ndisappeared or been unavailable. Staff also testified that untrained personnel were \nplaced “in charge” of juveniles in their housing units, and staff was frequently alone in \nthose units. Most importantly, staff testified that they are unable to keep the juveniles in \ntheir care safe.  \n                                                 \n2 https://www.mandtsystem.com/ \n\n \nI do not know if Governor Evers’ statement is wishful thinking, spin, gas lighting or a \nlie. I do know, however, that the data and anecdotal evidence show it is untrue.  \n \nI encourage you, if you are able, to watch the entire August 6, 2024 hearing on WisconsinEye. I \nam certain it can be made available to you, if you request it. \n \nI acknowledge that there are other Evers Administration policies at LH/CL that go beyond the \nconsent decree that are also contributing the dangerous environment at LH/CL. As these policies \nare not before your court, I have not discussed them in this letter. However, if you desire, I \nwould be happy to provide them.  \n \nThere are aspects of Governor Evers’ letter which are more political and rhetorical that I have \nnot addressed as it should not be pertinent to your decision. As I stated earlier, I felt the need to \naddress the factual inaccuracies in Governor Evers’ letter to you, in order for you to get a fuller \nlegal picture of what is happening at LH/CL.  \n \nAs Wisconsin moves forward with new juvenile facilities opening next year, we must ensure the \nsafety of juveniles in the correctional system and the staff monitoring those juveniles. After six \nyears, and near complete compliance with the consent decree, it is appropriate for you and the \nparties to revisit the consent decree to determine its impact on the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake \nSchools and the future facilities.  \n \nRegards, \n \n \nVan Wanggaard \nChairman \nSenate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety \nSenate Author of 2017 Wisconsin Act 185 \n ",

      "text": "Case: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 149   Filed: 08/16/24   Page 1 of 4\nWISCONSIN LEGISLATURE \nP. 0. Box 7882 Madison, WI  53707-7882 \nAugust 8, 2024 \nSecretary-Designee Jared Hoy \nDepaiiment of Corrections \n3099 E. Washington A venue \nMadison, WI 53704 \nDear Secretary-Designee Hoy, \nAs you are aware, we have been concerned with the safety and security of both staff and inmates \nat the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools (Lincoln Hills) for a number of years. At the \ncommittee meeting in Merrill this week, we heard first hand of extremely dangerous working \nand living conditions, and a number of violent incidents that have gone unreported to law \nenforcement and the general public. We have expressed our concerns with safety and Lincoln \nHills to the depaiiment both publicly and privately. \nTragically, these concerns came to a predictable and devastating head in June with the murder of \nCounselor Corey Proulx at Lincoln Hills. \nWe know the Depaiiment of Corrections (DOC) and the staff at Lincoln Hills have been \noperating under a consent decree and permanent injunction since 2018. That consent decree has \ngreatly limited the tools available to Lincoln Hills staff to ensure their safety, and the safety of \nthe inmates at the facility. Specifically, the consent decree: \n•  Prohibits punitive confinement. \n•  Restricts Administrative Confinement to youth who pose a \"serious risk of \nimminent physical harm to others\" and limits confinement to 12 hours. \n•  Prohibits \"the use of OC Spray and other chemical agents.\" \n•  Restricts the use of \"mechanical restraints\" to handcuffs, except to prevent \n\"imminent physical harm to self or others.\" \n•  Requires additional \"out time\" to inmates in Administrative Confinement. \nEach of these items were highlighted as contributing to an unsafe environment at Lincoln Hills at \nour committee hearing. The fact is, since the consent decree went into effect, Lincoln Hills has \nbecome less, not more, safe. \nAdditionally, the consent decree is directly resulting in more kids being charged with more \ncrimes while in custody and staying in custody longer. This is because the real-world \nimplementation of the consent decree has created an environment where kids have less structure \nand discipline, giving them more oppo1iunities to act out. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 149   Filed: 08/16/24   Page 2 of 4\nThe most recent monitoring report into Lincoln Hills showed the DOC in \"substantial \ncompliance\" with almost all of the requirements of the consent decree. The areas which it was in \npa1iial compliance cited a lack of proper paperwork, the non-elimination of tools that have not \nbeen prohibited, but restricted, and the use of confinement during delays in inmate transfers. \nAs we heard this week, the consent decree has led to a one-size-fits-all approach. We were told \nthat the Depaiiment and staff is instructed to simply \"check the box\" on the consent decree items \nrather than maintain a safe and healthy environment at Lincoln Hills. The testimony this week \nshowed that since the consent decree went into effect, DOC has had less control at Lincoln Hills, \nand both imnates and staff feel less safe. \nLincoln Hills staff need to get the bullseye off their back, so that they may safely and efficiently \nensure the security and welfare of themselves and the residents of Lincoln Hills. \nWe are all aware of the conditions at Lincoln Hills that necessitated the consent decree six years \nago. Those conditions were unacceptable, and no one wants to return to those conditions. \nHowever, staff assaults have been steadily increasing over the last couple of years culminating in \nthe murder of Corey Proulx, despite a dwindling population. \nSimply put, it appears that we may have reached the point where attempting to be fully \ncompliant with the consent decree is causing more harm than good. \nTherefore, we ask that you petition United States District Comi Judge James Peterson, to revisit \nand revise the consent decree and permanent injunction requirements to enhance safety of staff \nand inmates at Lincoln Hills and all future Type I facilities. \nSincerely, \n~~ \nChairman Van Wanggaard  Chairman Michael Schraa \nSenate Committee on Judiciary & Public Safety  Assembly Committee on Corrections \ntat~ \nSenator Mary Felzkowski  Representative Calvin Callahan \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 149   Filed: 08/16/24   Page 3 of 4\nSenator Andre Jacque  Representative Ty Bodden \nVice Chairman  Vice Chairman \nSenator Eric Wimberger  Representative Janel Brandtjen \nSenator Jesse James  Representative Rob Brooks \nRepresentative Karen Hurd  Representative Dave Maxey \nRepresentative Jerry O'Connor  Representative Angie Sapik \nRepresentative Paul Tittl \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 149   Filed: 08/16/24   Page 4 of 4\nCc:  US District Court Judge James Peteroen \nGovernor Tony Evers \nACLU of Wisconsin \nJuvenile Law Center ",

      "text": " \n  \n \n \nOffice of the Governor   State of Wisconsin\nVIA U.S. MAIL AND EMAIL   \n   Tony Evers\nAugust 14, 2024  \n  \nChief Judge James D. Peterson  \nU.S. District Court  \nWestern District of Wisconsin  \n120 North Henry Street, Room 320  \nMadison, WI 53703  \n  \nChief Judge Peterson:  \n  \nI write to you today about the consent decree in J.J. v. Litscher, Case No. 17-CV-47, following the tragic death of Lincoln \nHills Youth Counselor Corey Proulx. As you are likely aware, Corey passed away as a result of injuries he sustained when \nhe was assaulted by a youth who was incarcerated at Lincoln Hills. Corey’s death is a heartbreaking tragedy that has had a \ntremendous impact on the staff and leadership of Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools and the entire Wisconsin \nDepartment of Corrections (DOC). Corey’s family lost a partner, father, uncle, brother, and son, and the DOC family—for \nthe first time in its history—lost a fellow employee on the job. Earlier this month, I was able to attend Corey’s celebration \nof life and there is no question that Corey loved working at Lincoln Hills, and he was committed to its mission.  \n \nIn the weeks since it has been disappointing to see some attempt to undermine the good and important work that has been \nhappening at the facility over the last several years. These efforts have resulted in new conversations and calls to request \nchanges to the consent decree that, as you are well aware, was ordered by the court after state and federal investigations \nduring the Walker-Kleefisch Administration found frequent and excessive use of force on kids, excessive use pepper \nspray, excessive confinement, failure to intervene in youth-on-youth fights, no investigations into sexual misconduct \nallegations, sexual abuse of youth, and physical abuse of youth that included broken bones and feet being slammed in \ndoors. The court-ordered consent decree that was agreed upon in 2018 in your court by former Gov. Walker’s \nAdministration and the ACLU exists precisely because the conditions at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake under the Walker-\nKleefisch Administration were inhumane and unlawful, as evidenced by the fact that the mistreatment of youth has \nresulted in costing the state and taxpayers millions in settlements.   \n  \nUnfortunately, in my view, recent efforts requesting the consent decree to be modified and softened, namely by members \nof the Wisconsin State Legislature, fail to acknowledge or recognize this history and the pattern of neglectful and \nunlawful behavior that led the state of Wisconsin to be in this position and under a court-ordered consent decree in the \nfirst place. It is my understanding members of the Wisconsin State Legislature intend to ask you and this court to revisit \nand revise the consent decree that was agreed upon years ago as a result of youth abuse. I write today respectfully \nrequesting that you decline to do so.  \n  \n I believe it is highly unlikely that the ACLU, after years of advocacy to improve conditions at the schools, will seek or \nsupport changes to the consent decree. Further, given the progress consistently outlined throughout the monitor's reports \nduring my administration, it seems also unlikely that you and this Court would be willing to accept any changes. Even \nstill, I write today to underscore that this administration, under my leadership and at my direction, supports the court-\nordered consent decree the previous administration agreed to, and we are committed to the ongoing work of ensuring \nLincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools are safe and supportive environments for staff and youth until we can safely and \n♦\n♦  \nOffice of the Governor  PO Box 7863, Madison, WI 53707 \n \n(608) 266–1212   www.evers.wi.gov\n\nresponsibly close these facilities for youth placement. We will continue to comply with the agreement and our work to \nreach substantial compliance in all 50 provisions.  \n  \nWe have taken Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools from a facility so grossly mismanaged and dangerous and harmful \nto youth that it needed intervention from federal law enforcement to a facility that is now getting praise as a national \nleader in the juvenile corrections space. Just last week, DOC Secretary Jared Hoy received a letter from the Board \nPresident of the Council of Juvenile Justice Administrators. That letter reads in part, “CJJA recognizes Wisconsin as an \nemerging leader in operational reforms within secure correctional facilities and, while this event is difficult and horrific, \nwe cannot lose sight of the positive outcomes that have occurred because of the reforms that have taken place. [...] The \nwork to reduce harmful practices, such as solitary confinement and the use of OC spray, is commendable and aligns with \nnational best practices in juvenile justice and the mission of CJJA.”  \n  \nSimilarly, the consent decree not only increases safety for youth, but it helps keep our staff safe, too. This is reflected in \nthe data. For example, data from an October 2023 survey indicated staff feared for their safety less than the national \naverage. We have seen staff assaults at Lincoln Hills on the decline and the facility's workers’ compensation claims \ncontinue to show an overall downward trend. This shows a clear correlation to the increase in safety for our staff.  \n  \nWe will continue to comply with the court-ordered consent decree. Further, once we have reached complete and \nsubstantial compliance and are released from the consent decree, we will continue the work we have been doing to move \naway from the cruel and abusive practices that precipitated the consent decree years ago, incorporate evidence-based, \ndata-driven practices to improve treatment and outcomes, and ultimately move toward a juvenile justice model that will \nhelp make our kids, our communities, and our state safer. For example, the items included in the consent decree will \ncontinue to guide our work at the new, smaller, regional Type 1 facilities, and we will be doing so not just because the \ncourt requires us to do so but because these are national best practices driven by data and outcomes, focused on \nrehabilitation and growing skills for re-entering their home communities, which is where the majority of these kids are \nheaded, and that is what's best for our kids.  \n  \nImportantly, we also recognize that the incident that led to Corey’s death has significantly fractured the great trust that had \nbeen established and built up between the staff and youth over the last few years, and it has resulted in staff being \nconcerned for their safety. This is a natural and expected reaction to this traumatic event. In coordination with frontline \nstaff requests, to ensure staff feel safe and are safe following Corey’s death, DOC has been able to use restraints, \nadministrative confinement, and referrals to MJTC—all within the parameters of the consent decree—to address youth \nwho pose a threat of harm to themselves or staff. We have consistently demonstrated the ability and continue to balance \nsafety for youth and staff with compliance, and we are committed to continuing to do so.  \n  \nAdditionally, since Corey’s death, the DOC secretary has been working up at the facility at least one day a week, and we \nhave made a concerted effort to increase direct communication between line staff and facility leadership as well as the \nDivision of Juvenile Corrections (DJC) staff and the secretary's office. I have also been in touch with DOC leadership, \nDJC leadership, and have spoken directly with leadership of the facility. I also intend to again return to the schools later \nthis month, as I have done throughout my time as governor. For example, DJC and DOC leadership have heard from staff \nabout staffing levels and training following this incident. DOC has adjusted staffing to help ensure Lincoln Hills and \nCopper Lake Schools can work to maintain a minimum staffing level of two youth counselors per unit and regularly \nengaging staff to assess their comfort level working on units, particularly when staffing is lower. When there is not \nadequate staffing, DOC has increased available overtime hours and adjusted operations as necessary. Starting this week, \nthe Roosevelt housing unit, which houses our skills development youth will be increased to a three-person post.  \n  \nIn the days and weeks ahead, DOC will continue their investigation into Corey’s death to confirm all the facts of the \nevents, understand the circumstances, and determine if any policies and procedures were violated. They will be evaluating \ntrainings and seeking front-line feedback and suggestions for relevant subject matter for future training ideas, topics, and \nscenarios as the facility continues and enhances their ongoing training for staff. DOC will continue their robust \nrecruitment efforts to ensure we maintain adequate staffing levels within our units and prevent any potential staffing \nshortages. This is critical to sustaining a safe, secure, and supportive environment for both staff and youth in our care.  \n  \nAs you know from the monitor’s reporting over the last five years, our administration has made important progress at \nLincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools—progress that, most especially given the state of these facilities when I took \noffice, I am incredibly proud we have accomplished. When we walked in the door of the facility in 2019, we were in \n♦\n♦  \nOffice of the Governor  PO Box 7863, Madison, WI 53707 \n \n(608) 266–1212   www.evers.wi.gov\n\ncompliance with only one of the consent decree items. Today, we are in partial compliance with all items of the consent \ndecree and substantial compliance with 43 of 50. I am incredibly proud of the staff and leadership of the facility and the \nwork, trust, and dedication it has taken to get to this point. It has not been an easy road—and we continue to face \nchallenges—but I believe this work is critically important and that we have a responsibility to ensure this work continues.  \n  \nI appreciate your consideration of this matter and my request.  \n  \nRespectfully yours,    \n   \n   \n \nTony Evers    \nGovernor  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n♦\n♦  \nOffice of the Governor  PO Box 7863, Madison, WI 53707 \n \n(608) 266–1212   www.evers.wi.gov",

      "text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \n \nJ.J., by and through his next friend Sakeena Jackson; K.D., by \nand through her next friends John Levy and Meranda Davis; \nC.M., by and through his next friend Toinette Ducksworth; \nR.N., by and through his next friend Gloria Norwood; M.S., by \nand through his next friend Jolene Waupekanay; A.V., by and \nthrough his next friend Veronica Rocha-Montejano; M.R., by \nand through his next friend Autumn Rodgers; S.K., by and \nthrough her next friend Thomas Korn; and A.P., by and through \nORDER \nher next friend Louise Plaskey, \n17-cv-47-jdp \n \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, JOHN D. PAQUIN, \nWENDY A. PETERSON, and BRIAN GUSTKE, \n \nDefendants. \n \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \n \nFor the reasons set forth in the Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action \nSettlement, THE COURT MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: \n1.  The form and content of the Notice to the Class and the manner by which the \nNotice to the Class was disseminated constituted “a reasonable manner” of providing notice \nand satisfied the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h)(1), and due \nprocess. \n2.  The Court, having considered all relevant legal factors and evidence, finds the \nsettlement  embodied  in  the  Stipulation  for  Consent  Decree  and  Permanent  Injunction \n \n\n \n(“Consent Decree”) to be fair, reasonable, and adequate pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(e)(2). \n3.  Defendants’ conduct that is the subject of the parties’ settlement agreement \nconstitutes a violation of Federal rights pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) with regard to \nthe rights guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n4.  The prospective relief provided by the Consent Decree is narrowly drawn and \nextends no further than necessary to correct the violations of federal rights alleged by plaintiffs.  \n5.  The prospective relief provided by the Consent Decree is the least intrusive \nmeans of remedying Defendants’ violations of Federal rights. \n6.  The  Court  makes  these  findings  having  given  substantial  weight  to  and \nconsideration of any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice \nsystem caused by the relief. \n7.  The prospective relief provided by the  Consent Decree complies with the \nrequirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A). \n8.  The Court approves $220.50 per hour as the currently hourly rate allowed by \n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(3).   \n9.  The Court finds that the attorneys’ fees and costs provided for in the Consent \nDecree were directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of Plaintiff's rights \nor directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for a violation.  The Court \n \n\n \nfurther finds that the agreed-upon amount of attorney fees and costs is proportionately related \nto the court ordered relief for the violations of Federal rights. \nTHESE FINDINGS HAVING BEEN MADE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n1.  The Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement, Dkt. 100, and Joint \nMotion for Attoney Fees, Dkt. 101, are GRANTED. \n2.   The Consent Decree and Permanent Injunction, Dkt. 105, may be entered. \n3.  The Court will retain jurisdiction over this action until all claims have been dismissed. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: September 21, 2018                                   /s/ James D.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \nJ.J., by and through his next friend, \nSakeena Jackson, for themselves and all \nothers similarly situated, \nPlaintiffs, \nV.  Case No.:  17-CV-47 \nJONE. LITSCHER, in his official capacity \nas Secretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \nDefendants. \nSTIPULATION AND CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \nThe parties, by their respective undersigned counsel, hereby stipulate and agree to entry by \nthe Court of the following Consent Decree and Permanent Injunction (the \"Agreement\" or the \n\"Consent Decree\"). \nI.  INTRODUCTION AND RECITALS \nA.  On January 23, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a Class Action Complaint for Declaratory \nand Injunctive Relief, initiating the above-captioned action under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983.  On January 24, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification. \nThe Plaintiffs amended their Complaint on April 18, 2017, and filed a Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction on April 19, 2017. The Defendants answered the \nComplaint and Amended Complaint, and responded to the Plaintiffs' motions. \nThe parties conducted significant discovery. \nB.  The claims in this action relate to the use of restrictive housing (a/k/a room \nconfinement), chemical agents, mechanical restraints, and strip searches at \nLincoln Hills School (LHS) and Copper Lake School (CLS).  Following briefing, \nhearings, and rulings by the Court, and the parties' input, the Court entered a \npreliminary injunction on July 10, 2017. The Court entered an order certifying a \nclass on September 15, 2017. \nC.  The parties to this Agreement are the Plaintiffs, individually named and those \n\nsimilarly situated; the State of Wisconsin (State); the Secretary of the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Corrections (DOC); the Administrator of the DOC Division of \nJuvenile Corrections; the Superintendent of LHS and CLS; and the Director of \nSecurity for LHS and CLS. \nD.  Anticipating the costs of litigation and recognizing a shared interest in improving \nthe conditions of confinement for youth at LHS and CLS, the Plaintiffs and \nDefendants intend for the full compliance with this Agreement to resolve all \nclaims in the above-captioned action. \nE.  In entering into this Agreement, the State does not admit any violations of \nconstitutional rights of youth confined at LHS and CLS, nor does it admit any \nviolation of state or federal law.  This Agreement may not be used as evidence of \nliability in any other legal proceeding.  However, the State remains firmly \ncommitted to improving the conditions of confinement for youth at LHS and \nCLS. \nII.  DEFINITIONS \nA.  Presumptive Applicability of Administrative Code.  Unless defined below, the \nterms in this Consent Decree and Permanent Injunction shall be defined as they \nare defined in Wisconsin Administrative Code, Chs. DOC 346 & 371-396. \nB.

Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \neffective six months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nAgreement, an initial period of administrative confinement may not \nexceed four hours for a youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. When the youth is in room confinement to prevent a risk of \nimminent physical harm to others, Defendants shall engage in visual \nchecks at least every 30 minutes, as specified in current policy, and shall \nprovide intensive mental health services designed to return the youth \nsafely to the general population. If at any point the youth no longer poses a \nrisk of imminent physical harm, he or she must be immediately returned \nto general population. Time in administrative confinement may exceed \nfour hours only under the following circumstances: \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 \nhours) when: \ni.  A psychologist, psychology associate or psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \n11.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to \n8 am. \nc.

Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no \nlater than two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in \nroom confinement. A youth must have access to any needed \nmental health treatment while in room confinement. During the \ntime that a youth is in room confinement, staff shall engage in \ncrisis intervention techniques designed to return the youth to \ngeneral population as soon as possible.  PSU interventions during \nthis time shall not consist only of conversations with youth through \na locked door. \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after \nbeing placed in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a \nmental health need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, \nMH-2a, MH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be \nreviewed by a PSU staff member to determine whether that \nplacement is a contraindication to the youth's mental health or if \nother options will adequately protect the youth or staff. \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant to \ncurrent policy at least every 30 minutes in all cases, and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose. Staff who fai I to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall \nreceive daily contact with a mental health provider. This contact \nshall be face-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU \nstaff is personally available, in which case it may occur by phone \nor video conferencing. \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar \nto or the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific \nitems of property may be restricted as needed for safety of the \nyouth and staff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be \ntemporary in nature until these items can be safely returned to the \nyouth.  A Supervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall \nreview any property restrictions on a daily basis and document the \n4 \n\nreview. \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \ni.  All regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services. \n11.  Any rehabilitative programming (e.g., Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \niii.  Educational services with the general population to the \nextent practicable.  If attending educational services with \nthe general population proves unworkable due to an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm or an \nunreasonable risk of significant disruption to classroom \ninstruction, youth in room confinement shall receive \nalternative educational services on days that the general \npopulation receives such services.  Defendants shall ensure \nspecial education services for all eligible youth. \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to \nanother person. Sensory stimulation shall also be available \nduring \"out time,\" unless such activities cause immediate \nand substantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nv1.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \nweek and at least 3 hours per day.  Time in general \npopulation on a given day shall be credited to those hours. \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes ofa youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written \nnotice of his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n6.  Documentation.

The youth must be promptly provided with this report \nimmediately upon its completion. \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to \nimplement QC-Spray reduction plans, attached and incorporated hereto as \nAppendix B, as outlined in the preliminary injunction. \n2.  Prohibition on use of QC-Spray and other Chemical Agents.

Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others, and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n1.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n11.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \niii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, \nin rare instances when necessary for articulated reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints.  When youth are being transported for release to \na non-locked environment, there shall be a presumption \nthat restraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during \nsuch transportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff. \n6 \n\nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor mental health purposes, must be authorized by a Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living \nunit.  No youth shall be left alone in restraints.  Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible and no later than 2 hours following, PSU staff shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement. \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \n3.  Process for strip searches. \na.  When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view \nof another youth. \n7 \n\nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched, unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma \ninformed practices. \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n4.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations. \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the \nFebruary 26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, \nTeresa Abreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to \nimplement the recommendations. \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (1) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \nA.  Incident review process.  Defendants will establish a review process for any \nincident that involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or \nmechanical restraints used for more than 45 minutes (excluding during \ntransportation). The review committee will include all staff directly involved in \nthe incident, their supervisors, the social worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff \nwho are familiar with the youth, the facility director of security, the deputy \nsuperintendent, and the superintendent.  Within 24 hours, all available members \n8 \n\nof the review committee shall meet to assess whether physical force, OC spray, \nroom confinement, or mechanical restraints were used appropriately, to discuss \nless restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have used, and to provide an \nopportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If not all members of \nthe review committee are available for the meeting within 24 hours, the full \nreview committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later than one \nweek after the event. The review committee shall also review all uses of strip \nsearches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \nB.  Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \nV.  CONTINUING JURISIDICTION, MONITORING, \nENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION \nA.  Continuing Jurisdiction. The terms of this Agreement will be incorporated into \nan  order to be entered by the Court. The Court will retain jurisdiction over this \naction until the Agreement terminates and all claims for injunctive relief in the \nAction have been dismissed. \nB.  Termination. \n1.  Defendants may move for termination of the Agreement and dismissal of \nall claims in accordance with section 2 below on the earlier of the date on \nwhich: (a) all juveniles have been transferred from LHS/CLS to the \nappropriate Type I juvenile correctional facility or to secured residential \ncare centers for children and youth, or (b) 36 months after entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n9 \n\n2.  The Court shall grant the motion and the Agreement shall terminate and \nall claims shall be dismissed if: \na.  The Department of Corrections has permanently closed the Type 1 \njuvenile correctional facilities housed at LHS and CLS, and the \nAdministrative Code has been amended as provided in Section III. \nH, after the Monitor has conducted a single inspection of each \nfacility under section V.C.3.c.; or \nb.  The Department of Corrections has not permanently closed the \nType I juvenile correctional facilities housed at LHS and CLS and \nthe Administrative Code has not been amended as provided in \nSection III.H, after the Monitor has certified, in two consecutive \ninspections of each operational Type I juvenile correctional \nfacility, conducted after the 36 month term of this agreement, that \nsuch facilities are operating in compliance with sections Ill.A, B, \nC, and D; or \nc.  The Department of Corrections has not permanently closed the \nType I juvenile correctional facilities housed at LHS and CLS but \nthe Administrative Code has been amended as provided in Section \nIII.H, after the Monitor has certified, in two consecutive \ninspections of each operational Type 1 juvenile correctional \nfacility that such facilities are operating in compliance with \nsections Ill.A, B, C, and D; or \nd.  The Department of Corrections has permanently closed the Type 1 \njuvenile correctional facilities housed at LHS and CLS but the \nAdministrative Code has not been amended as provided in Section \nIll.H, after the Monitor has certified, in two consecutive \ninspections of each operational Type 1 juvenile correctional \nfacility, that such facilities are operating in compliance with \nsections III.A, B, C, and D \nC.  Monitoring. \n1.  The Parties agree that Teresa Abreu will be retained to serve as the \nParties' jointly appointed Monitor. Neither party, nor any  employee or \nagent of either party, shall have any supervisory authority over the \nMonitor's activities, reports, findings, or recommendations.  Should \nTeresa Abreu become unwilling or unable to act as Monitor, the Parties \nwill  meet and confer to attempt to agree upon a replacement.  Should the \nParties be unable to agree on a Monitor within 45 days of Teresa Abreu \nbecoming unavailable, they will each recommend two potential Monitors, \nfrom  which the Court will select a replacement. The intention of the \nParties is  that Defendants will develop the capability to comply with the \nsubstantive provisions of the Agreement without long-term monitoring \n10 \n\nbeyond the duration in Section V(B) of this Agreement and the  Monitor \nwill assist Defendants in developing this capability. \n2.  Within two weeks of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, \nDefendants shall provide the Monitor with a copy of the relevant \nAdministrative Code provisions, as well as with the February 26, 2018 \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. \n3.  The Monitor shall: \na.  Have access to LHS and CLS at any time determined by the \nmonitor for the inspections and site visits described below. Such \naccess shall include ability to inspect and photograph all youth \nliving areas (including but not limited to student rooms, day spaces, \nexercise rooms or outdoor recreation spaces), control rooms in \nhousing units, visiting areas, areas where searches of students are \nconducted, any isolation or restrictive housing rooms or rooms \nused for such purpose, classrooms, counseling or social services \nrooms, and to speak with any youth in a private and confidential \nsetting.  The Parties' counsel may attend the  Monitor's site visits. \nThe Monitor may have private conversations  with staff, and with \nyouth with the youth's consent. \nb.  Conduct monitoring site visits at LHS and CLS at least four times \nin the  first calendar year of the Agreement and at least two times \nper calendar year for the duration of the Agreement. \nc.  Conduct an  inspection or inspections of each new facility which is \ncreated and operated by DOC pursuant to 2017 Wisconsin Act 185 \nwithin two to three months after the opening of each such facility \npursuant to the terms in V(B)(2). For the purposes of such \ninspection only, the Monitor may have access to documents, site \nvisits, and interviews described in section (a). \nd.  Have authority to request, and obtain from Defendants within five \ndays of any such request, incident reports involving any youth and \nany documents relating to or reflecting staffing levels and staff \ntraining, use of room confinement, use of QC-spray or other \nchemical agents, use of mechanical restraints, strip searches, \npositive behavior interventions and supports, and de-escalation \npractices at LHS/CLS, or, for the purpose of inspection of new \nfacilities described in the preceding subsection, at such new \nfacilities. \ne.  Within two weeks of each site visit, produce and send to the \nParties' counsel a draft Compliance Status Report assessing the \n11 \n\nDefendants' compliance with the substantive terms of the \nAgreement. The Compliance Status Reports shall summarize any \nreview of documents and other pertinent information and assess \nwhether the Defendants are non-compliant, in partial compliance, \nor in full compliance with each of the substantive terms set forth  in \nthe Substantive Relief sections of this Agreement. The parties  may \nsubmit written comments to the Monitor within five days of \nreceiving the draft Compliance Status Report.  Within five days of \nreceiving any such comments, the Monitor will produce and \ndistribute to the Parties a final Compliance Status Report for each \nsite visit, which will be filed with the Court, with appropriate \nredactions of any information identifying particular youth. \nf.  Within two weeks of Court approval of this Agreement, obtain from \nDefendants all of Defendants' policies, procedures and training \nmaterials related to room confinement,  use of OC spray or other \nchemical agents, use of mechanical restraints, strip searches, \npositive behavior interventions and supports, and de-escalation \npractices at LHS/CLS.  Within four weeks of receiving such \nmaterials, the Monitor will make recommendations for  changes to \nDefendants' codes, policies, procedures, and training materials so \nthat the codes, policies, procedures, and  training materials comply \nwith or contribute to compliance with  the substantive terms of this \nAgreement. \ng.  Be empowered to adjust any deadline one time for implementation \nof a specific provision of this Agreement in order ensure the safety \nof youth and staff. If it is in the interest of youth and staff and will \nnot adversely affect the safety of youth and staff, the Monitor may \nalso recommend shortening a specific deadline. Any Party who \nobjects to the Monitor's adjustment of any deadline may petition, \non an expedited basis, the Court to review the determination, or the \nreasonableness of the length of time of any extension, taking into \naccount the safety of youth and staff and the reasonableness of \nDefendants' efforts to comply with the terms of this agreement. \nThe opposing Party shall have five days to respond to any such \npetition. Any further extensions require court approval. \n4.  Defendants will pay the Monitor's reasonable fees and costs.  The Parties \nrecognize that DOC needs to be able to anticipate the costs associated \nwith the Monitor's services. Accordingly, the Monitor's fees will be \npresumed reasonable if they are less than or equal to $130,000.00 for the \nfirst year of monitoring and $100,000.00 per year for any subsequent \nyears.  However, the Parties also recognize that the reasonable activities of \nTeresa Abreu or any replacement Monitor should not be unreasonably \nrestricted by hourly caps.  Should the Monitor or Plaintiffs  believe that the \npresumptive cap will unreasonably interfere with  effective Monitoring, \n12 \n\nthe Monitor or the Plaintiff may, after meeting and conferring with \nDefendants in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute,  move the Court \nfor an increase in the presumptive reasonable fee. \n5.  Limitations on public disclosures by Monitor. Except as required or \nauthorized by the terms of this Agreement or the parties acting together, \nthe Monitor shall not: make any public statements (at a conference or \notherwise) or issue public findings with regard to any act or omission of \nthe State or its agents, representatives or employees, or disclose non \npublic information provided to the Monitor pursuant to this Agreement. \nAny press statement made by the Monitor regarding his/her employment \nmust first be approved, in writing, by the parties. The Monitor shall not \nvoluntarily testify in any other litigation or proceeding with regard to any \nact or omission of the State or any of its agents, representatives, or \nemployees related to this Agreement, nor voluntarily testify regarding any \nmatter or subject that he or she may have learned as a result of his or her \nperformance under this Agreement. Reports issued by the Monitor shall \nnot be admissible against the State in any proceeding other than a \nproceeding related to the enforcement of this Agreement. Unless such \nconflict is waived by the parties, the Monitor shall not accept employment \nor provide consulting services that would present a conflict of interest with \nthe Monitor's responsibilities under this Agreement, including being \nretained (on a paid or unpaid basis) by any current or future litigant or \nclaimant, or such litigant's or claimant's attorney, in connection with a \nclaim or suit against the State or its departments, officers, agents or \nemployees. The records maintained by the Monitor shall be kept \nconfidential to the extent permitted by Wisconsin's Public Records Law \nand the federal Freedom of Information Act. This paragraph does not \napply to any proceeding before a court related to performance of contracts \nor subcontracts for monitoring this Agreement. \nD.  Enforcement. \n1.  Plaintiffs' counsel will have access to LHS/CLS on two days' notice to \ninspect any youth living areas and speak with youth in a confidential \nsetting.  Plaintiffs' counsel will be able to speak confidentially to youth by \ntelephone on one day's notice. \n2.  Defendants shall produce to Plaintiffs each month by the 10th day of the \nfollowing month: (1) a report of the  number of youth held in any form of \nroom confinement during the month, which shall include the duration of \nand reason for each instance of such confinement; (2) a report of the time \nout of cell and property restrictions for each youth held in any form of \nroom confinement during  the month; (3) a report of any instances of use of \nmechanical restraints  during the month, including reasons for and duration \nof the restraint; (4)  a report of any instances of use force, including any \nuses of OC spray or other chemical agents including reasons for the use of \n13 \n\nforce or OC spray; and (5) a report of any strip searches of youth  during \nthe month, including the reason for each strip search, the conditions under \nwhich the search was performed (including the location  of and personnel \nperforming the search), and any contraband found in  the search. \n3.  Defendants shall produce to Plaintiffs and the Monitor each month by the \n10th day of the following month, a report indicating the youth subject to \nroom confinement under observation status and the duration that the youth \nspent in such room confinement.  While not subject to any compliance \nassessment, the Monitor may choose to comment on the use of room \nconfinement for youth in observation status within a Compliance Status \nReport pursuant to Section V(C)(3)(e). \n4.  If the Plaintiffs believe that any of the monthly reports provided in 0(2) \nabove indicate non-compliance with a substantive provision of the \nAgreement, the Plaintiffs may, after meeting and conferring with the \nMonitor and Defendants in a good faith effort to resolve the alleged non \ncompliance, bring a motion to the Court for enforcement of the \nAgreement. Any enforcement order may require Defendants to take \nadditional actions designed to achieve at least partial compliance. Upon \nany finding in a final Compliance Monitoring Report that the Defendants \nare non-compliant with any substantive provision of the Agreement, the \nPlaintiffs may, after meeting and conferring with Defendants in a good \nfaith effort to seek resolution of the non-compliance, bring a motion to the \nCourt for enforcement of the Agreement or Contempt. \nE.  Additional Provisions. \n1.  The Parties stipulate, based on the entire record, that the relief set forth in \nthis Agreement meets the requirements of 18 U.S.C 3626(a)(l)(A), and the \nParties shall jointly request that the  Court make these findings. \n2.  Defendants agree not to unilaterally move to terminate or modify this \nagreement under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(6) until the Agreement ends according \nto its terms. \n3.  Plaintiffs will seek reasonable attorneys' fees and costs for work \nperformed up to and through the Date of Final Approval of this \nAgreement. The Parties will attempt to reach an agreement regarding the \namount of fees and costs after negotiations regarding the substantive terms \nof this Agreement have concluded. Plaintiffs will seek reasonable \nattorneys' fees and costs for facilitating and monitoring the \nimplementation of this Agreement for the duration of the Agreement.  If the \nparties are unable to reach an agreement as to the amount of fees for such \nmonitoring, Plaintiffs shall submit a fee petition to the Court for \ndetermination. \n14 \n\n4.  Plaintiffs' counsel may send in writing to Defendants' counsel time \nsensitive concerns about the treatment of individual youth. Defendants' \ncounsel agrees to make reasonable efforts to investigate these concerns \nand respond in writing to Plaintiffs' counsel within a reasonable period of \ntime. \n5.  In the event of circumstances threatening to cause immediate or irreparable \nharm to the class or any portion of the class, Plaintiffs may seek immediate \njudicial relief. \n6.  The Parties will work together to ensure the timely preparation and filing \nof all motions, briefs, and documents necessary to obtain preliminary and \nfinal approval of this Agreement pursuant to applicable rules and  statutes. \n7.  This Agreement supersedes all other agreements made between the Parties \nand all preliminary orders issued during the course of this  litigation \nregardless of form. \n8.  This Agreement constitutes the final written expression of all of the terms \nof the settlement between the Parties and is a complete and exclusive \nstatement of those terms, except that: \na .  The Agreement may be modified at any time by a written and \nsigned document executed by mutual agreement of Plaintiffs' \ncounsel and Defendants' counsel, subject to approval by the Court; \nb .  Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs, when agreed upon, will be \nincorporated as a term of this Agreement. \n9.  All modifications to this Agreement will be filed with the Court. \nF. Attorney Fees \n1.  Defendants agree to pay Plaintiffs' counsel the sum of eight hundred \neighty-five thousand dollars ($885,000) in full satisfaction of all claims \nfor fees and costs for work done by plaintiffs' counsel through June 18, \n2018, in connection with this litigation.  Payment shall be made within \ntwenty (20) days of the Court's entry of an Order granting Final Approval \nto the Settlement Agreement. \n2.  Defendants agree to pay Plaintiffs' Counsel's reasonable expenses and \nfees for time reasonably spent on this case from June 19, 2018, through \nthe date of the Court's entry of an Order granting Final Approval to the \nSettlement Agreement.  The Parties agree that plaintiffs shall be \ncompensated for their time at the rate of $220.50/hour (the current Prison \nLitigation Reform Act cap).  Such payment shall be in full satisfaction of \nall claims for fees and costs for work done by plaintiffs' counsel in \nconnection with this I itigation from June 19, 2018, through the date of the \n15 \n\nCourt's entry of an Order granting Final Approval to the Settlement \nAgreement. \n3.  Defendants agree to pay Plaintiffs' Counsel's reasonable expenses and \nfees for time reasonably spent on this case from the date of the Court's \nentry of an Order granting Final Approval to the Settlement Agreement. \nThe Parties agree that Plaintiffs shall be compensated for their time at the \nhighest rate permitted by the Prison Litigation Reform Act at the time \neach request for fees is submitted to Defendants. \n4.  The Parties agree that the time and expenses for no more than two \nattorneys for the Plaintiffs to attend site visits by the monitor are \npresumptively reasonable.  However, the Parties also understand that \ncircumstances may justify additional attorney time for particular site \nvisits. This provision shall not be construed to limit the time Plaintiffs' \ncounsel may reasonably spend on this case outside of the monitor's site \nvisits. \n5.  Submissions for fees and costs shall be made as follows: Plaintiffs' \ncounsel shall submit to defendants' counsel documentation of fees and \ncosts from time-to-time.  Defendants may review the documentation and, \nwithin twenty (20) days of receiving such documentation, either pay the \namount sought in full or provide Plaintiffs' Counsel with a written \nresponse identifying amounts objected to as unreasonable. The Parties \nwill attempt to resolve all disputes among themselves, with payment to be \nmade within ten (10) days of resolution. If the parties are unable to \nresolve their differences, the parties agree that the dispute shall be \nsubmitted to the District Court or a magistrate judge for a determination \nof whether and to what extent plaintiffs' counsel's claimed fees and costs \nare reasonable under the circumstances.  The parties agree to abide by the \ndetermination of the District Court or magistrate judge, and defendants \nshall pay the amount determined to be reasonable within ten (10) days of \nthe determination. \n6.  This Addendum may be modified at any time by a written and signed \ndocument executed by mutual agreement of Plaintiffs' counsel and \nDefendants' counsel. All modifications to this Addendum will be filed \nwith the Court. \n7.  This Addendum may be signed in counterpart originals. \n16 \n\nDated this 13th day of September, 2018. \nAttorneys for the Plaintiffs \nACLU OF WISCONSIN FOUNDATION \nBy:  Isl Laurence J.

I only became aware of it in 2021 hence why I have not \nmade reference to it sooner. Part 2 of the book deals with how the Brain works and Prut 3 deals \nwith the impact of Trauma on the Brain. Note all the children who ru·e at Lincoln Hills have been \ntraumatized. \nA review of the most recent repmt by the monitor surely is sobering. The State allowed an \ninflux of some 30+ new individuals to be added to the population 1) KNOWING that there was \nNOT adequate staff to take care of the 39 individuals who were there and 2) KNOWING that \nthere would be significant disrnption as the children had to establish a new social order which \nwould include physical challenges to establish that order. 3) KNOWING that a form of solitary \nconfinement would be necessary to keep the children safe since they did not have the staff to \nmake sure that they would be safe. \nA review of the most recent report would also allow you to reopen the case to find out why the \nState 1) did what it did ie violate the RIGHTS of the children by not figuring out how to \nadequately staff Lincoln Hills (Note Wales sits empty and is much closer to a larger population \nthat could staff the facility.) 2) To establish that all the children had suffered significant trauma \neven before they were sent to Lincoln Hills and the State/County had FAILED to address that \ntrauma with effective therapy. Dr Kolk establishes very cleru·ly that ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT \nALL and that there ru·e many different factors that can influence the type of therapy that will be \nmost effective to heal these children brain injuries. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 133   Filed: 06/09/22   Page 2 of 8\nIt is clear that you are the only person who may care enough and be willing to acknowledge what \nDr Lonnie Athens observed now 30 years ago that ALL violent individuals were FIRST \ntraumatized Brutalized and then they all acted out and became Belligerent.  How is it that the \nState of Wisconsin has not come to realize that children who are traumatized, act out and that \nacting out is BECAUSE of the injury to the BRAIN. \nI pray that you will reopen the case based upon the NEEDS of the CHILDREN to get the \nTHERAPY that they need to heal from the past traumas they have suffered and the current \ntrauma they are experiencing at Lincoln Hill itself. \nYes what was the State to do with 30+ children who they had not planned for? Oh Stuff them at \nLincoln Hills which was already inadequately staffed. It is only poor kids who will suffer so who \ncares. We need more bodies for our adult prisons! \nHopefully you reopen the case. \n~9r1vL--\nThomas Spellman \nWritten January 2020 \nGood morning Judge Peterson \nThis will sound preposterous but it is clear after a year of a new Political administration (Evers \nand Kaul) and yet another letter to the ACLU that no one will speak for the interest of the \nchildren at Lincoln Hills School for Boys. (see attached letter) \nWhat are the interest of the children at Lincoln Hills that have been systematically ignored? \nThere is no need to examine why or by whom those interest have been ignored only that they \nhave been. \nThis is about the brain. We know that we do not have an established language to describe the \nbrains \"condition\" after a person has been abused or traumatized. What we know is that the brain \nof a person who has been abused/traumatized, in a sustained way, is significantly different from \nthe brain of a person who has not been abused/traumatized in a sustained way. Suffice it to say \nthat the person has a brain injury which requires treatment just like any other part of the body \nthat is injured and yet as we know we have no common language to adequately talk about a brain \ninjury which has been caused by abuse/trauma. In addition to the brain injury we have not \nacknowledged the symptoms that let the person and others know that there is a brain injury. We \ndo know that all injuries require some treatment if they are to heal and make the person whole \nagain and so it is reasonable to assume that brain injuries require some treatment as well. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 133   Filed: 06/09/22   Page 3 of 8\nWe know that the children who are at Lincoln Hills have behaviors that are not socially \nacceptable and those behaviors are a threat to others. \nThe question is why did the children who are at Lincoln Hills develop those behaviors? Are they \njust bad children or have their brains been injured? As we answer that question, we will begin to \nunderstand the true interest of the children who are at Lincoln Hills. \nNow 30 years  ago Lonnie Athens PhD, a sociologist, made an observation that a person who \nwas abused/traumatized in a sustained way would develop socially unacceptable behaviors. He \nnamed those socially unacceptable behaviors -belligerency. He clearly established the \nbehavioral process that a person goes through to become violent or to use violent behavior for \nsome purpose. \nNow 15 years ago two additional people made significant observations that have provided clear \ndirection to know what is in the interest of the children at Lincoln Hills. \nFirst is the work of Dr Amen MD who as a psychiatrist uses SPECT imaging to look at the brain. \nWhat is critical about his work is that a SPECT image shows where the blood flows to the brain \nand shows that a brain that has been injured by abuse/trauma will literally show holes in the \nbrain compared to the brain of an individual who has not been injured. If you have not seen a \nSPECT image of the brain go to his web-site. The importance of this tool is that we can see how \nthe abuse/trauma has impacted and changed the brain. His work also has demonstrated that the \nbrain can heal itself and become more normal with care. \nThe second work is the ACE study completed by the health insurance company Kaiser -\nPermanent. The study was a questionnaire about a person health condition including 10 questions \nabout the individual childhood experiences. \nThose experience, which are weighted by the those who answered the questionnaire established \nthat traumatic events in a person's life can result in a physical response by the body These have \nbeen called Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE's) \nWhat does all this have to do with the interest of any one child at Lincoln Hill School for Boys? \nBefore any of these children were adjudicated to Lincoln Hills, they had suffered any number of \nACE's which caused significant brain injuries Those brain injuries were not treated as evidenced \nby the socially unacceptable behavior that got them to Lincoln Hills and which continues. \nI will suggest to the court that there is more than ample testimony in this case to establish that the \nchildren at Lincoln Hills were abused and traumatized by the State of Wisconsin through what \nhas been established in testimony before this very court We know that the abuse trauma injured \nthe children brains and while there were no SPECT images made of the children's brains as they \nentered Lincoln Hills those images today would document for the court and the world to see \nwhat the State of Wisconsin did to these children. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 133   Filed: 06/09/22   Page 4 of 8\nThis brings us to the reason to reopen the case because by now it should be clear beyond a doubt \nthat the true interest of these children is to have help in the process of healing the brain injuries \nthat they have suffered and to a lesser degree continue to suffer at the hands of the State of \nWisconsin. \nThese children require LOVE if their brains are to grow and prosper and as we know there is no \nLOVE  ( or very little) at Lincoln Hills  People who are guards who fear those they are to guard \nso much that the would lock themselves into a secure room which as we know was not secure as \nthe windows could be broken, The solution install stronger glass. \nI have included the other letters to the court and to State officials and to the ACLU attorneys \nwhich includes specific suggestions of what needs to happen at Lincoln Hills that is in the \ninterest of the children at Lincoln Hills School for Boys. \nPlease for the sake of the children do what is needed so their most basic human developmental \nneeds are provided to them as they are provided to all those who are more fortunate. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 133   Filed: 06/09/22   Page 5 of 8\nThere are 10 childhood traumas measured in the ACE score.

Karyn Rotker \nACLU \n207 E Buffalo Street  Suite 325 \nMilwaukee  WI  53202 \nGood morning all \nJust finished reading Patrick Marley's article in the MJS from Oct 19 and had no plans on \nresponding until this morning at 3 :00 am when yet again I realized that there is still no voice for \nthe children! \nIn early October I read Molly Beck's article on the third Report of the Lincoln Hills by \nTeresa Abreu and in September I read Allison Dikanovic long article on New York's \"Close to \nHome\" program. While the program is operated in neighborhoods of New York what happens \ninside each house could surely be happening inside each home (cottage) at Lincoln Hills where \nthe children live. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 133   Filed: 06/09/22   Page 8 of 8\nThere does seem to be some conflict between the Report and the newspaper story. I will assume \nthat the Report to the Court is the fair assessment and that the \"incidents\" that have occurred in \nAugust and September only involve a few of the children. \nTeresa Abreu's September Report indicate that the DOC has provided more programming for the \ninmates than the prison \"has ever had available to youth.\" Sort oflike Christmas in July. There is \nno doubt that increased programing is good and it is good to have more choices. \nMost unfortunately programing does not address the fundamental challenge facing many of the \nchildren at Lincoln Hills School for Boy and that is the abuse and trauma that they had \nexperienced before being sent to Lincoln Hills and the abuse and trauma that they experience at \nthe hands of the State of Wisconsin while at Lincoln Hills. \nWho speaks for the children? \nThe children must have parents. Is that difficult to figure that out? Their brains are still growing \nand they need individuals who they see as parents. They need individuals who do not have keys \nand the power to write them up They need individuals who with time they can trust. Without \ntrust there is no growth. What is so difficult to see. Maybe see your own children and then you \nwill know what these children need. \nAs I pointed out in my letter of January 21, 2019 to each of you and it along with the previous \nletters to the Atty General are still needed today as they were needed long before I wrote those \nletters these children need healing for their brains that have been damage by the abuse and \ntrauma that they have experienced. \nPatrick noted that the DOC stated that \"The inmates involved in the August incident were \"held \naccountable for their actions with therapeutic and research-backed approaches, rather than with \npunitive punishments\". This is to say the least a peculiar statement, as if in a session or two, and \nthese individuals or in a group the abuse and trauma will be healed. The anger that was displayed \nin the incident reports has far deeper roots that a few sessions of \"therapeutic and research \nbacked approaches\". \nThis is yet another demonstration that DOC policy is to never address the underlying abuse and \ntrauma that the children at Lincoln have and are suffering. There are no therapist listed as staff at \nLincoln Hills  Yes counselors and social workers but those folks have not been trained to deal \nwith the trauma that these children have experienced and suffered. \nPeace \nThomas Spellman \nCc  WI Rep Tyler August \nWI Senator Steve Nass ",

LITSCHER, JOHN D. PAQUIN, \nWENDY A. PETERSON, and BRIAN GUSTKE, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nIn light of the parties’ submissions, the evidence and argument presented at the \nhearing,  and  the  entire  record  in  this  matter,  the  court  concludes  that  plaintiffs  have \ndemonstrated their entitlement to a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, and for the reasons \nstated at the conclusion of the hearing, the parties are ordered to confer and to submit an \nagreed proposed form of injunction to the court by July 7, 2017. If the parties cannot agree \non  all  terms  of  the  injunction,  they  should  set  out  their  competing  proposals  in  the \ndocument.  \nTo facilitate the parties’ work, the court provides the following points that illustrate \nlikely  constitutional  problems  with  Lincoln  Hills’  use  of  restrictive  housing,  mechanical \nrestraints, and incapacitating agents: \n1.  The  court  will  not  completely  bar  the  use  of  restrictive  housing  for  punitive \npurposes. But if punitive restrictive housing is to be used, sentences must be \n\nmoderated  to  bring  them  within  national  norms  for  states  that  use  punitive \nisolation, which is a maximum of five to seven days.  \n2.  Restrictive  housing  should  not  be  routinely  used  for  prehearing  confinement. \nPrehearing confinement may involve isolation only to the extent needed to protect \nthe safety of youth or staff. \n3.  Adequate  time  out  of  cell  must  be  provided  to  youth  in  punitive  restrictive \nhousing. One hour out of cell per day is likely unconstitutional, but the court will \nleave it to the parties to determine an appropriate amount. \n4.  During  out  time,  youth  should  not  be  unduly  restricted.  Social  restraint \n(prohibiting interaction with peers) and mechanical restraints may be imposed \nonly to the extent needed to protect the safety of youth or staff. \n5.  Adequate opportunity for physical exercise must be provided to those in restrictive \nhousing. The converted cell in High Hall does not afford an adequate exercise \nspace.  \n6.  Placement in restrictive housing should not interrupt rehabilitative or educational \nprogramming.  \n7.  Cell conditions in restrictive housing should be ameliorated to reduce isolation \nand  provide  adequate  stimulation.  Reasonable  property  restrictions  may  be \nappropriate, particularly as justified by safety concerns, but the current restriction \nto one book is excessive. \n8.  Mechanical restraints may not be used on youth during out time, unless staff \ndetermines  that  mechanical  restraints  are  justified  for  safety  reasons  for  that \nindividual on that occasion.  \n9.  Lincoln Hills/Copper Lake must develop a plan to reduce or eliminate the use of \nincapacitating agents (OC). The reasons for past excessive use of OC should be \nsystematically evaluated, reported, and remediated. The plan should articulate \nalternatives to the use of OC, and provide a plan for the implementation of the \nalternatives. If OC is to be used, the conditions under which is it to be used must \nbe more narrowly defined. \n10. The terms of the injunction must be consistent with the legitimate interest in \nmaintaining the safety, security, and good order of the institution.  \n11. The terms of the injunction, if not to be implemented immediately upon court \napproval, should include deadlines or schedules for implementation. The schedules \nfor phasing in any provisions should recognize the urgency of remediating what \nthe court has found to be acute harm to the youth at the institution. \n2 \n \n\nThe court will be available for teleconferences with counsel to assist them in reaching \nagreement on the terms of the injunction. \nEntered June 23, 2017. \nBY THE COURT: \n \n            /s/ \n            ________________________________________ \n            JAMES D.

Where to begin? \nI do not have access to the case file so I do not know who saw my letter of June 7, 2022. What I \ndo know is that no one reached out to me to follow up on what the children NEED -NO MUST \nreceive. \nThe medical profession (mental health is part of the medical profession is it not) KNOWS what \nis necessary on a whole myriad of medical emergencies BUT it seems THEY DO NOT KNOW \nTHAT TRAUMATIZE CHILDREN WHOSE BRAINS ARE DEVELOPING MUST HAV  E \nEFFECTIVE TREATMENT. Are we real or is this a fantasy world. Oh, that's right they are \nprimarily children of color and so ..... . \nWhat is happening to the developing brains of the children who are locked in their rooms (for \ntheir safety) and with what? No mention of the hours each day they are locked in their rooms. \nThe irony is that the horror that was documented in your Court under the Walker administration \nhas not been fully resolve by the Evers administration. \nFor now, 14 reports, three and one half years, the developing brains of the CIDLDREN who are \nat Lincoln Hills School for Boys are still suffering. While it is OK for the \"Government\" to take \nits time to finally raise the pay scale to encourage both more people to apply and to have folk \nwho apply with a better set of skills as well. \nAgain all that I have suggested still stands and I will admit that I am slow but my wife has a \nvery, very good therapist, and he helps her greatly, and he is in his office in Janesville and she is \nin our home. \nWHY are the children NOT GETTING daily therapy, a human being that cares about them, at \nleast 5 days a week. Yes remotely just as my wife does.  I do not get a sense that there are house \nparents but I hopefully I am wrong on that. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 138   Filed: 12/15/22   Page 2 of 2",

In general, the agreed-upon provisions will drastically reduce the use of punitive \nrestrictive  housing,  chemical  agents,  and  mechanical  restraints.  The  court  has  afforded \ndefendants  some  time  to  implement  some  changes  that  require  additional  training  or \nprogramming for youths. But most of the critical changes must be implemented no later than \nJuly 21, 2017. \nPlaintiffs also propose additional provisions requiring systematic changes to how staff \nare  trained  and  youth  behavior  is  managed.  Id.  at  18-21.  Changes  like  these  may  be \nadvisable.  But  the  preliminary  injunction  is  intended  only  to  eliminate  constitutional \nviolations, not to mandate a set of “best practices.” Plaintiffs also ask the court to order \nadditional  reporting  on  the  use  of  restrictive  housing,  chemical  agents,  and  mechanical \n\nrestraints.

Case No. 17-CV-47 \n \nJon E. Litscher, et. al., \n \n        Defendants. \n     \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF JOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nSETTLEMENT APPROVAL \n     \nINTRODUCTION \n \nCounsel for the Plaintiff Class and Counsel for Defendants jointly submit this \nmemorandum of law in support of the Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action \nSettlement.   For the reasons set out below, the Settlement reached in this case is fair, reasonable \nand adequate, and therefore the parties request that the Court provide for notice to the Class and \nset a date for a final approval hearing on the Settlement. \nProcedural History \n \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint against Defendants in this Court on January 23, 2017 \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the constitutional rights of youth incarcerated at Lincoln \nHills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls (collectively “LHS/CLS”) related to \npractices of solitary confinement, mechanical restraints and pepper spray.   An amended \ncomplaint filed on April 19, 2017 added additional allegations of constitutional violations related \nto strip searches.  Defendants filed answers denying the allegations of the complaints. \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 2 of 19\n \nAfter production of documents by the Defendants and certain depositions, the plaintiffs \nmoved for a preliminary injunction on April 19, 2017.  (Dkt. 17) This Court held an evidentiary \nhearing on the preliminary injunction motion on June 22 and 23, 2017. (Dkt. 61,62) At the \nconclusion of the hearing the Court ruled that the plaintiffs had shown “more than a reasonable \nchance” of succeeding on their claims of constitutional violations with respect to the practices of \nsolitary confinement, pepper spray and mechanical restraints.1   (Dkt. 67) \nFollowing the Court’s ruling and an order identifying parameters for preliminary relief \n(Dkt. 65), the parties submitted the terms of a preliminary injunction order consistent with the \nCourt’s decision.   After review of this submission, the Court entered a preliminary injunction \norder on July 10, 2017. (Dkt. 71.) \nOn September 18, 2017, the Court certified a class consisting of “All persons who are \nnow, or in the future will be, confined at Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School \nfor Girls.”  (Dkt. 81) The issues certified for class treatment are the constitutionality of \ndefendants’ policies and practices with regard to the use of solitary confinement, mechanical \nrestraints, and chemical agents. The Court also appointed the ACLU of Wisconsin Foundation, \nthe Juvenile Law Center, and the law firm of Quarles & Brady LLP as class counsel.  \nSettlement Negotiations \nThe parties began exchanging settlement proposals in September 2017 through in person \nnegotiations, as well as exchanges of correspondence, draft proposals and phone calls. (Muth \nDecl., ¶ 2). \n                                                 \n \n1 Plaintiffs had not included strip search practices in their motion for a preliminary injunction. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 3 of 19\n \nBased on an agreement between the parties, Defendants subsequently engaged Michael \nDempsey and Mark Soler, experts in juvenile corrections not previously retained by either party \nto the litigation, to conduct a review and make recommendations to the parties concerning \nneeded changes related to Defendants’ use of solitary confinement, OC spray, mechanical \nrestraints and strip searches.  The parties planned to take into account those recommendations in \nfurther settlement negotiations.   The experts conducted their work in the first two months of \n2018 and issued a report to counsel for the parties dated February 26, 2018. (Muth Decl., ¶ 3). \nWhile the parties were in the process of negotiating a possible settlement, the Wisconsin \nlegislature passed a law which requires the state to establish new Type 1 secure juvenile \ncorrectional facilities and authorizes counties to establish secured residential care centers for \nchildren and youth.  Act of Mar. 30, 2018, § 110(2)(a), 2017-2018 Wis. Legis. Serv. 185 (West).  \nPursuant to the newly enacted legislation, LHS/CLS would be converted to an adult institution \nand new Type 1 secure facilities will be created. (Muth Decl., ¶ 4). \n The parties continued their negotiations in a mediation conducted before Magistrate \nPeter Oppeneer with sessions on April 5 and May 8, 2018 as well as telephonic discussions with \nMagistrate Oppeneer, which ultimately resulted in agreement.  (Muth Decl., ¶ 5). \nThe parties executed the final version of the settlement on May 25, 2018.  (Muth Decl., ¶ \n6).  \nSummary of the Terms of Settlement \n \nA.  Restriction on Room Confinement \nThe settlement calls for the complete elimination of the punitive use of room confinement \nwithin 10 months of approval of the settlement. (Settlement, §III.A.1.c).   Room confinement is \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 4 of 19\n \ndefined as confining a youth alone in room or cell outside of normal sleeping hours. (Settlement, \n§II.B). Effective upon approval, the settlement limits maximum terms of punitive room \nconfinement to 10 days, declining to a maximum of 3 days seven months after approval, and \ncompletely eliminating the punitive use of room confinement after 10 months. (Settlement, \n§III.A.1). \nThe settlement limits the use of administrative room confinement to situations when a \nyouth poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to others, and limits such use to 4 hours, \nwith the possibility of two 4 hour extensions.  (Settlement, §III.A.2). Night time hours when \nyouth are normally sleeping are not included in calculations of the time limits. The limits on \nadministrative confinement commence six months after approval of the settlement.  Id. The \nparties also agreed on clarifications of the use of room confinement for youth on observation \nstatus because of a risk of self harm. (Settlement, §III.A.3). \nThe settlement provides that minimum “out time” for a youth in confinement must be 30 \nhours per week and 3.0 hours per day.   (Settlement, §III.A.4.g.vi). Youth in room confinement \nare to receive educational, rehabilitational, psychological and related services similar to the \ngeneral population.  (Settlement, §III.A.4.g).  Youth are also to receive time out of their cells for \nexercise, for social interaction and for their meals. \nB.  Pepper (OC) Spray \nThe Defendants shall continue to implement an OC-Spray reduction plan.   The use of \nOC Spray and other chemical agents is prohibited twelve months after approval of the \nSettlement. (Settlement, §III.B). \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 5 of 19\n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints \nRestraints may only be used by specifically trained staff, if those staff determine that \nrestraints are the least restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical harm to self \nor others, and restraints must be removed immediately when the youth regains control and when \nthe threat of harm or the safety security concern has abated. (Settlement, §III.C.1).  Use of \nmechanical restraints is limited to handcuffs except when ordered by psychology staff to prevent \nself-harm, or by security staff to prevent an immediate substantial threat of physical harm to \nothers, or in some situations during transportation.  Mechanical restraints may never be used for \npunishment or discipline, and youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, such as a bed, \nwall, desk, or table, unless specifically ordered by psychology staff.  (Settlement, §III.C.1). \nAny use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or for mental health \npurposes, must be authorized by a Youth Counselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor \nin a living unit.  No youth may be left alone in restraints.  Any use of mechanical restraints in \nexcess of 45 minutes must be approved by the superintendent, security director, or designee and \nreviewed every 45 minutes thereafter. (Settlement, §III.C.1.g). \nD.  Strip searches \nThe agreement limits the situations when strip searches of youth may be conducted.  \nFacility staff may not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause to \nbelieve that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could not be discovered \nthrough less intrusive means. (Settlement, §III.D.1). Less intrusive searches, including using a \nmetal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top or other clothing, must \nbe attempted before a strip search is conducted. (Settlement, §III.D.2). \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 6 of 19\n \nWhen a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no unintended individuals are \nable to view the search, including by video or other recording device. Under no circumstance \nmay a youth be strip searched within view of another youth.  Strip searches may only be \nconducted by individuals of the same gender identity as the youth being searched, unless the \nsearch is conducted by a medical professional. Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained \nin trauma-informed practices. If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult with mental health \npractitioners before conducting the search. (Settlement, §III.D.3). \nE.  Monitor \nUnder the agreement, Teresa Abreu will be appointed to monitor Defendants’ compliance \nwith the terms of the Agreement.  (Settlement, §V.C).  Ms. Abreu’s qualifications are set out in \nher curriculum vitae attached as Exhibit B to the Declaration of R. Timothy Muth.   The Monitor \nwill conduct four site visits during the first calendar year of the Agreement and two site visits per \nyear during the remaining time the Agreement is in place.  In addition to the site visits, the \nMonitor will have access on request to books, records and reports from LHS/CLS.  The Monitor \nwill prepare a report after each site visit which will be filed with the Court. (Settlement, \n§V.C.3.e). \nThe Monitor will also make at least one visit to each new site opened by the Defendants \npursuant to 2017 Legislative Act 185 to assure that the new facility is complying with the \nprovisions of this agreement related to room confinement, restraints, strip searches and pepper \nspray.  (Settlement, §V.C.3.c). \nDefendants will pay Monitor’s reasonable fees and costs.  (Settlement, §V.C.4). \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 7 of 19\n \nG.  Administrative Code Changes \nDefendants will make all reasonable efforts to amend the Wisconsin administrative code \nwithin six months after entry of the Court’s order. (Settlement, §III.H). The amendments will \nimpose restrictions on any juvenile correctional facilities operated by DOC that are consistent \nwith the material terms of this Agreement as they relate to: (1) Room Confinement, (2) OC-\nSpray and Other Chemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints, (4) Strip Searches, and (5) \nObservation Status.   \nH.  Documentation and Enforcement \nThe settlement agreement requires Defendants to maintain concurrent documentation and \nto produce to Class Counsel monthly reports related to the use of pepper spray, room \nconfinement, mechanical restraints and strip searches. (Settlement, §V.D.2). On two days notice, \nClass Counsel will have access to living areas at LHS/CLS for inspections and to speak to \nYouth. (Settlement, §V.D.1). \nIf Class Counsel believe there are violations of the settlement and are unable to resolve \ntheir concerns after meeting and conferring with Defendants, Class Counsel may move the Court \nfor appropriate orders to enforce the terms and conditions of the settlement.  (Settlement, \n§V.D.4). \nF.  Termination \nDefendants agree not to move to terminate this agreement until a minimum of three year \nhave passed or they have shut down LHS/CLS.  (Settlement, §V.B).  The agreement may then be \nterminated under the following conditions: \na.    If Defendants have closed LHS/CLS and have amended the Administrative Code, the \nagreement terminates after the Monitor has inspected each new Type 1 juvenile facility. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 8 of 19\n \nb.    If Defendants have closed LHS/CLS but have not amended the Administrative Code, \nthe agreement terminates after each new Type 1 juvenile facility has been inspected by the \nMonitor twice and been found to be in compliance with the substantive terms of this Agreement. \nc.   If Defendants have not closed LHS/CLS, then the Agreement terminates after each \nnew Type 1 juvenile facility and LHS/CLS has been inspected by the Monitor twice after the \nfirst 36 month of the Agreement and been found to be in compliance with the substantive terms \nof this Agreement. \nI.  Continuing Jurisdiction \nThe Court will maintain continuing jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Order \nincorporating the settlement provisions. (Settlement, §V.A). \nLEGAL ARGUMENT \n \nA.   The Court Should Preliminarily Approve the Proposed Settlement Agreement  \n \nThe Settlement Agreement complies with the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), under \nwhich the Court may grant approval of a settlement only after finding that it is “fair, reasonable, \nand adequate.” In determining whether to approve a settlement, the Court considers the \nfollowing factors: “the strength of plaintiffs’ case compared to the amount of defendants’ \nsettlement offer, an assessment of the likely complexity, length and expense of the litigation, an \nevaluation of the amount of opposition to settlement among affected parties, the opinion of \ncompetent counsel, and the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed at \nthe time of settlement.” Synfuel Technologies, Inc. v. DHL Express (USA), Inc., 463 F.3d 646, \n653 (7th Cir. 2006) (quoting Isby v. Bayh, 75 F.3d 1191, 1199 ((7th Cir. 1996)) (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Smoot v. Wieser Bros. Gen. Contractors, Inc., No. 15-CV-\n424, 2016 WL 1736498, at *5 (W.D. Wis. Apr. 29, 2016). Courts have also considered the \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 9 of 19\n \npresence of collusion in reaching the settlement and whether the agreement promotes the public \ninterest as relevant factors. See ACLU v. U.S. Gen. Sers Admin., 235 F. Supp. 2d 816, 818 (N.D. \nIll. 2002). \nThe Seventh Circuit points out that “federal courts look with great favor upon the \nvoluntary resolution of litigation through settlement” and in the class action context there is “an \noverriding public interest in favor of settlement.”  Armstrong v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Milwaukee, \n616 F.2d 305, 312-13 (7th Cir. 1980), overruled on other grounds by Felzen v. Andreas, 134 \nF.3d 873 (7th Cir. 1998).   The Seventh Circuit has also instructed district courts \"to refrain from \nresolving the merits of the controversy or making a precise determination of the parties' \nrespective legal rights.\" and that “the Synfuel/Reynolds evaluation of potential outcomes need \nnot always be quantified, particularly where there are other reliable indications that the \nsettlement reasonably reflects the relative merits of the case.” Kaufman v. Am. Express Travel \nRelated Servs. Co., 877 F.3d 276, 285  (7th Cir., 2017)(citations omitted). \nApproval of a proposed settlement under Rule 23 requires two steps. First, the district \ncourt conducts a preliminary review of the settlement prior to notice being issued to the class. \nSecond, following notification of the class, the court conducts a fairness hearing at which the \nopinions of class members may be heard. The court then decides whether the proposed \nsettlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Armstrong v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Milwaukee, 616 \nF.2d at 314.  \nThe purpose of the preliminary review of the settlement is to “determine whether the \nproposed settlement is “‘within the range of possible approval’” and “to ascertain whether there \nis any reason to notify the class members of the proposed settlement and to proceed with a \nfairness hearing.” Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 314 (quoting Manual for Complex Litigation § 1.46, at \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 10 of 19\n \n53-55 (1st ed.  1977)). See also Gautreaux v. Pierce, 690 F.2d 616, 621 n.3 (7th Cir. 1982) \n(same).  The standards for obtaining preliminary approval are less stringent than those for \nobtaining final approval. In re Ford Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litig., 258 F.R.D. \n671, 675-76 (D. Kan. 2009). See also In re Bromine Antitrust Litig.¸ 203 F.R.D. 403, 416 (S.D. \nInd. 2001) (“[t]he bar is low” for preliminary approval).  \nThe court reviewing the proposed settlement should not make conclusions on the merits \nof the claims or “second guess” the settlement’s terms. Barnes v. United States, 89 Fed.Cl. 668, \n670 (Fed. Cl. 2009). The settlement agreement should be analyzed in the light most favorable to \nthe agreement as a whole rather than performing a provision-by-provision evaluation. Isby v. \nBayh, 75 F.3d 1191, 1199 (7th Cir. 1996) (citing Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 315).  \n1.   The Proposed Settlement Offers Relief Commensurate with the Strength of \nPlaintiffs’ Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n \nIn the case at bar, “the strength of the case for plaintiffs on the merits, balanced against \nthe amount offered in settlement,” weighs in favor of approval. Kaufman v. Am. Express Travel \nRelated Servs. Co., 877 F.3d 276, 284  (7th Cir., 2017) (citation omitted). See also Synfuel \nTechnologies, Inc. v. DHL Express (USA), Inc., 463 F.3d 646, 653 (7th Cir. 2006) (quoting In re \nGeneral Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litig., 594 F.2d 1106, 1132 (7th Cir.1979)) (citing \nthis factor as the most important one to consider in the context of final approval of a settlement). \nWhile the instant case seeks no monetary damages and thus is not amenable to balancing an \n“amount offered” against the merits of Plaintiffs’ case, it is clear that the scope and breadth of \nthe injunctive relief provided in the Consent Decree is well-balanced against Plaintiffs’ \nlikelihood of success on the merits. Even though Plaintiffs believe that the merits of their claims \nare strong, there is no guarantee that, should they prevail, the relief ordered by the Court would \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 11 of 19\n \nbe substantially greater than the relief provided for by the Consent Decree.  Ruiz v. Johnson, 154 \nF. Supp. 2d 975, 981 (S.D. Tex. 2001) (discussing appointment of special master to monitor \nconsent decrees).  \nSimilarly, injunctive cases involving conditions of confinement under section 1983 \nfrequently result in settlements requiring specific changes to policies, as is the case with the \nConsent Decree. See, e.g., D.M. v. Terhune, 67 F. Supp. 2d 401, 404 (D.N.J. 1999); Stipulation \nof Dismissal of Actions & Order (Dkt. # 115), Valenzuela v. County of Los Angeles, No. 02-\n9092 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2007); Settlement Agreement between the United States and the \nAlameda County Sheriff’s Office, DOJ Complaint 204-11-290, February 4, 2010, \nhttp://www.ada.gov/alameda_county_sa.html..  \nThe relief provided by the Consent Decree is particularly reasonable given the limits on \nprospective injunctive relief imposed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), which \nrequires that injunctive relief  should “extend no further than necessary to correct the violation  \nof the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs …[and] that such relief is narrowly \ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the \nleast intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(1). In the instant case, the Parties agree that the relief set forth in the Consent Decree \nfully complies with the PLRA’s limitations.   Likewise, Defendants have agreed not to seek \ntermination pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(1)(A), which would otherwise permit Defendants to \nmove to terminate post-judgment relief after as little as two years. In contrast, based on its terms, \nthe relief offered by the Consent Decree will extend until the closure of LHS/CLS, and \nDefendants have passed a review by the Monitor of new juvenile facilities replacing LHS/CLS \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 12 of 19\n \nand/or have amended the Administrative Code for the Department of Corrections to incorporate \nthe substantive terms of the Agreement.  \n2.   The Parties Have Conducted Extensive Discovery and Litigation  \nMore than fifteen months have elapsed from the time Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in \nthis action.  During that time, the Defendants produced in discovery more than 21,000 \ndocuments concerning incidents and operations at LHS/CLS, and receive updated productions on \na bi-monthly basis.   Plaintiffs worked with prominent national experts on solitary confinement \nand juvenile corrections who testified at the preliminary injunction hearing.    Plaintiffs have \nconferred frequently with class members about the ongoing conditions at LHS/CLS.  The fully \nlitigated preliminary injunction hearing before the Court speaks to the Parties’ respective abilities \n“to make informed and reasonable assessments of their respective positions.” See Kitson v. Bank \nof Edwardsville, No. 08-507-GPM, 2009 WL 3066620, at *3 (S.D. Ill. Sept. 18, 2009). \n3.   The Proposed Settlement Will Avoid the Substantial Costs, Delay, Risk, and \nUncertainty of Additional Litigation  \nAlthough the Parties have already litigated this action for more than fifteen months, if the \nparties were to continue to litigate, years would likely pass before a decision on the merits was \nreached, relief ordered and implemented, and all appeals exhausted. As currently calendared, the \ntrial of this matter would not commence until November 2018.  The lengthy trial would impose \nsignificant costs on the Parties, and post-trial litigation would likely delay the implementation of \nrelief to class members, should they prevail on the merits.   While the preliminary injunction \norder provides certain relief to the class members, in the interim, the class members will not \nreceive the benefit of the further reductions in the use of room confinement, pepper spray and \nstrip searches provided in the settlement.  Further, the risks associated with further litigation are \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 13 of 19\n \nsubstantial. Approval of the Consent Decree will avoid these otherwise inevitable costs, delays, \nand risks.  \n4.   The Proposed Settlement is the Product of Extensive, Arm’s-Length \nNegotiations. \nAs discussed supra, the Parties negotiated the substantive terms of the Consent Decree \nduring two mediation sessions with Judge Oppeneer, after obtaining input from independent \njuvenile corrections experts, and months of written correspondence and telephone calls. Each \nprovision of the Consent Decree is the result of careful, bilateral negotiations among counsel \nexperienced with cases of this nature. The lack of collusion is evidenced by the substantial time, \ncosts, and effort expended by the Parties in pursuit of a final agreement. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(e)(3), the Plaintiffs and Defendants have no other agreements between them other than the \nStipulation for Consent Decree and Permanent Injunction. (Muth Decl., 7).¶   \n5.  The Opinion of Competent Counsel Supports Approval of the Consent \nDecree.  \nThe Court should consider the representations of counsel experienced in the litigation of \ncases of the type before the Court. Great Neck Capital Appreciation Inv. P'ship v. \nPricewaterhousecoopers, L.L.P., 212 F.R.D. 400, 410 (E.D. Wis. 2002). Plaintiffs’ counsel \nincludes multiple attorneys experienced in complex class action litigation and cases involving \ncivil liberties issues.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have considered myriad factors and believe that the \nConsent Decree is fair, reasonable, and adequate and will provide substantial benefits to the \nClass.  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 14 of 19\n \nB.   The Class Notice and Manner of Dissemination Are Reasonable  \nBefore a class action may be settled, “[t]he court must direct notice in a reasonable \nmanner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1). \nWhen, as in the case at bar, class members will be bound by a settlement of injunctive claims, \nnotice to the class should include, inter alia, the “essential” terms of the proposed settlement, \nincluding attorneys’ fees, options and procedures for objecting to the settlement, the date and  \ntime of the fairness hearing, and a procedure for making inquiries to class counsel. Manual for \nComplex Litigation § 21.312, at 295 (4th ed. 2004); see also Mangone v. First USA Bank, 206 \nF.R.D. 222, 232 (S.D. Ill. 2001). A copy of the proposed class notice is attached to the motion.  \nNotice to the class should “facilitate[] understanding and . . . arouse[] the interest of the \nreader.”  F.C.V. Inc. v. Sterling Nat’l Bank, 652 F. Supp. 2d 928, 933 (N.D. Ill. 2009). In F.C.V., \nthe notice “was eight pages long, and was simple and explicit in its explanation of the recipients’ \noptions and the consequences of those options.” Id. at 932. This notice was held to have \n“sufficiently informed the recipients” of their rights and options in the settlement. Id. at 947.   \nThe proposed notice meets this standard. \nThe proposed notice plan also satisfies Rule 23(e) and the requirements of due process. \nPursuant to this plan, notice will be distributed to all current youth at LHS/CLS, mailed to their \nparents or guardians, and provided to incoming youth as part of their orientation process.    It will \nalso be posted throughout LHS/CLS in conspicuous locations in the day space of general \npopulation housing units. Copies of both the notice and the Settlement will also be available in \nthe LHS/CLS library and will be made available to youth or their parents or guardians upon \nrequest to DOC or Class Counsel.  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 15 of 19\n \nIn similar cases involving prisoners and detainees, courts have held that providing notice \nby postings in the detention facilities, postings on government websites, and dissemination \nthrough organizations that work with class members is sufficient when supplemented by hand \ndelivery for certain subsets of the class, and that individual mailed notice to the entire class is not \nrequired. See, e.g., VanHorn v. Trickey, 840 F.2d 604, 606 (8th Cir. 1988) (holding that flyers \nposted on the walls at correctional facility was sufficient notice); Hall v. County of Fresno, No. \n1:11–cv–02047–LJO–BAM , 2015 WL 5916741, at *3, *8 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2015) (approving \nnotice to prisoner class by posting notice in English and Spanish in all housing units and hand-\ndelivering to prisoners in lockdown and restricted housing units). The parties here do both: \nnotice will be provided individually to youth and their parents or guardians, and will be posted \nwidely at LHS/CLS.  The parties propose that the deadline to issue the notice as described in the \nSettlement be ten business days after preliminary approval (the “Notice Deadline”), and that \nclass members have 30 days to submit any objections to the settlement (the “Notice Period”). \nThe parties further request that this Court set a Final Approval Hearing as soon as \npossible after the close of the Notice Period; the parties will file a motion for final approval, \nresponding to any objections, no later than seven days before the Final Approval Hearing.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 16 of 19\n \nC.  Attorney fees \nClass Counsel will seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for work performed up to \nand through the Date of Final Approval of this Agreement. The Parties will attempt to reach an \nagreement regarding the amount of fees and costs prior to issuing notice to the class. Plaintiffs \nwill seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for facilitating and monitoring the implementation \nof this Agreement for the duration of the Agreement.  If the parties are unable to reach an \nagreement as to the amount of fees for such monitoring, Plaintiffs shall submit a fee petition to \nthe Court for determination.   \nThe proposed notice now states that Defendants have agreed to “pay the lawyers for the \nyouth for their reasonable attorneys’ fees and the costs of the lawsuit.” Proposed Notice, §7. The \nparties will attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the amount of fees and costs to be paid \nprior to distributing the notice, in which case that amount will be included in the notice. Should \nthe parties reach agreement on a negotiated amount of fees and costs after notice has been issued, \nthey will provide supplemental notice pursuant to Rule 23(e); should they be unable to reach \nagreement, Plaintiffs will file a fee petition pursuant to Rules 23(h)(1) and 54(d)(2), and notice \nwill be provided pursuant to Rule 23(h)(1).  \n \nCONCLUSION \n  The proposed settlement of this class action was the product of months of arms-length, \ngood faith negotiations by the parties.   For the reasons set forth above, the Court should \npreliminarily approve the settlement and set a date for a final approval hearing to take place after \nnotice to the plaintiff class has been given. \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 97   Filed: 06/01/18   Page 17 of 19\n \nDated this 1st day of June, 2018. \n/s R.

The Monitor’s \nthird report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the second site visit which took place March 8-11, 2019.  \n \nSITE VISIT \nThe third site visit by the Monitor took place on May 31 through June 2, 2019.  The Monitor \nreviewed materials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit.  Materials \nincluded,  but  were  not  limited  to:  updated  Krueger  program  handbook,  grievances,  school \nschedules, recreation schedules, counselor logs, staff memos, daily shift reports, video footage of \nuse of force incidents, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this court order, unit \nrules, work rules, employee leave data, employee corrective action reports, behavior and treatment \nplans, mechanical restraint documentation, incident reports, other housing documentation, self-\nassessment report, facility enhancement report, and various meeting minutes. The Parties were \npresent during the site visit. The Monitor took photographs, toured LHS/CLS, and interviewed \nyouth and staff.  Approximately forty-five (45) youth and thirty (30) staff were interviewed \nformally and informally by the parties during this site visit.   \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 2 of 30\n \n \nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS \n \nPhysical Plant \n \nThere were significant improvements made throughout LHS/CLS.  The general areas of the facility \nand living units were much cleaner than the last visit. Staff put together Spring cleaning contests \nwith rewards for youth.  The feedback has been positive from youth and staff.  Many of the \nrecommendations made in previous Monitor reports and the February 2018 technical assistance \nreport have been implemented (described in more detail throughout this report).  Youth behavior \nexpectations were written in a positive tone versus the negative tone observed during the last two \nsite visits.  There was less graffiti and etched glass throughout the facility overall and sanding and \npainting  have  been  done  in  several  areas.    Defendants  need  to  continue  to  monitor  and \ncover/replace graffiti and etched glass as there are still areas with significant graffiti/etched glass \n(Black Elk and TIP units).   \n \nDuring the last site visit, the Defendants informed the Monitor that there was a bid for painting the \ninterior of the cottages and that there would be a youth art program to further decorate the walls \nwith murals and artwork once the base painting project is completed.  It is evident that the painting \nand decorating projects have begun and the Monitor has been told the work will continue \nthroughout LHS/CLS facilities.  Renovations have been completed on one of the girls’ units, \nalthough they had not yet moved into the building at the time of the site visit.  The renovations are \nvery impressive and will aid in reducing the “prison” like feel and should have a positive impact \non the overall atmosphere once renovations are completed and the girls move into the cottage.  \nThere have been art supplies purchased for youth to use on the living units.  \n \nIn general, youth rooms and bathrooms remain messy and dirty.  There needs to be a continued \nfocus on youth rooms being clean and orderly and the bathrooms being cleaned more regularly \nand thoroughly.  Several maintenance issues were observed throughout the facility which needed \nattention  such  as  bathroom  leaks  and  faucets  and  toilets  not  working,  etc.  The  Monitor \nrecommended including incentives around the room/bathroom cleanliness in the new behavioral \nmanagement system that is being developed. In the last report, the Monitor noted that there were \nseveral serious incidents in which youth used furniture and other unsecured unit equipment to \nfacilitate escapes from their housing units and used debris from these disturbances as potential \nweapons against staff.  Defendants have made efforts to remove and/or secure items that have been \nused by youth in disturbances and built barriers around areas containing these objects in order to \ncreate a safer environment. The Monitor recommended that searches of all buildings need to be \nconducted to remove excessive objects, materials, equipment, furniture, etc., to enhance the safety \nand security of the units/buildings and to maintain a more orderly and safe environment.  There \nwas clear evidence that this is being completed on a more regular and thorough basis.  The Monitor \nrecommended that Defendants should consider replacing existing furniture with furniture that is \nspecifically designed and engineered for secure environments and the secure furniture has been \npiloted in a living unit.  The Monitor also noted that one or more living units had security bars on \nthe exterior windows to prevent such disturbance and reduce the likelihood of a disturbance or \nescape.  It might be worth placing similar preventive measures on other units to deter such \nbehavior.  Defendants should be commended for vastly improving the overall atmosphere at \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 3 of 30\n \nLHS/CLS.   \n \nSchool/Living Units Observations \n \nThe Monitor visited each cottage twice during this site visit with the exception of Krueger and TIP \n(Monitor visited these units three times) and toured the school on Friday when school was in \nsession.  Below, are the Monitor’s observations: \n \nThe Monitor saw the majority of staff engaging with youth. Specifically, teachers engaged with \nyouth in the classrooms. Several youths were working diligently cleaning the school area and \nliving units. Youth attitudes overall were much improved during this site visit.  The school had \npositive messages throughout, artwork displayed, names of youth on the honor roll were displayed, \nwindows in classrooms were no longer covered so there was a clear unobstructed view which \nincreases safety for staff and youth, youth were engaged in the classrooms, and the school was \nvery clean.  The Monitor observed a psychologist having a session with a youth outside of the \nschool sitting at a table. The Monitor observed flag football tournaments taking place and there \nwere volunteers in the Foster Grandparent’s program present.  The Monitor recommended that the \nDefendants hire an education expert to complete an assessment of the educational programming \nat LHS/CLS. The Defendants retained the expert who completed the assessment prior to the \nMonitor’s visit.  The Defendants will share the assessment with the Monitor upon completion. The \nteachers seemed to enjoy their job, but they are struggling with staff shortages and wish there was \nmore technology available.  There were 8 teachers absent from work on Friday. \n \nAll the girls were on the King unit.  The other girls’ cottage (Wells) was being renovated.  The \nMonitor was happy to see that there was an improvement in the overall atmosphere of the girls’ \nunit and improvement of youth attitudes. Staff were engaged with the youth during free time, the \nunit was clean, furniture had been reupholstered (youth helped), and staff were eating with youth \nat the tables.  The Monitor asked staff for the safety/welfare check forms and there was a vast \nimprovement of documentation.  Everything written in the unit for the youth was written in a \npositive tone and the girls’ mugshots were no longer taped to the tables.  Youth rooms were still \nvery messy.  The girls are not allowed out at the same time (high hall and low hall) and the Monitor \nobserved five youth confined.  The Monitor continues to recommend that all youth should be out \nat the same time engaged in programming.  Staffing ratios as observed by the Monitor would \nsupport this. The Agency needs to focus on gender specific programming to enhance the programs \nand activities for the girls’ facility.  \n \nThe girls will move to Wells upon completion of the renovation project.  The new Wells cottage \nshould be the cottage that all cottages should be modeled after.  It was recommended that the \ninstitutional paint be replaced with colorful paint.  The paint color on Wells is a beautiful blue and \ngreen, the décor is beautiful and soothing, the furniture is comfortable, there are motivational \nsayings on the wall, and the shower curtains are bright and colorful.  There is a sensory room for \nthe girls to relax in.  There is chalkboard paint in the youth rooms to encourage artwork and writing \n(reduce  graffiti).  There  is  a  “model”  room  with  furniture  that  is  specifically  designed  and \nengineered for secure environments (bed, desk, shelf, and chair).  The Monitor believes this model \nroom will enhance the safety and well-being of youth.  The Monitor believes that the renovations \nto this cottage will enhance the quality of life for youth and staff as well improve the overall \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 4 of 30\n \natmosphere. The Monitor looks forward to the expansion of these rooms throughout LHS and CLS.  \n \nWith respect the boys’ cottages, generally, all the youth rooms were messy and dirty.  The Monitor \nreviewed the safety/wellness documentation and it has greatly improved from the last visit. The \nMonitor  worked  with  the  Defendants  on  creating  an  individualized  form  to  be  used  for \nsafety/wellness checks as opposed to using one form to document all youth that was kept in the \nstaff offices.  During the last site visit, none of the documentation complied with policy and \nprocedure. During this site visit, the Monitor observed staff doing the safety/wellness checks and \nthe Monitor only found one entry that was not compliant with policy and procedure.  Staff are \ndoing a much better job at doing the safety/welfare observations and documenting.  The Monitor \nmade further recommendations to the forms that will make it easier for staff to complete.  In \nprevious reports, the Monitor commented on staff placement on the unit.  During this site visit, \nstaff were placed near the youth and were much more interactive with the youth. This is a vast \nimprovement from previous visits.  \n \nIn Krueger, the unit was clean, there was more artwork on the walls, mugshot pictures were \nremoved, and youth (Levels 1 and 2) were engaged in the classrooms on the unit on Friday.  Youth \nrooms were cleaner on Krueger than on other units.  The Monitor observed two youth in their \nrooms but was told the youth were in the rooms at the youths’ request.  Staff were appropriately \nengaging with youth. \n \nIn Addams, the living unit was clean, there was a beautiful mural on the wall, the graffiti was \nremoved, and all the glass on the doors were replaced. There were some clean youth rooms on this \nunit.  There were five youth confined, some youth were outside, and some youth were in the day \nroom.  Safety/Welfare checks were complete. Staff were appropriately engaging with youth. \n \nIn Black Elk, the unit was clean, but the hallways and rooms were not.  There is a lot of graffiti on \nthis unit.  One room had a sheet up over the bed preventing staff from observing the youth, two \nyouth were doing each other’s hair (in violation of policy), and the other youth were in the day \narea. The bathroom floor was very wet.  Safety/Welfare checks were completed but were not \nstaggered.  \n \n In Curtis, the unit was clean.  Five youths were in their rooms (significantly less than the last site \nvisit). Youth were very chatty on both days. Youth seemed happy.  Safety/welfare checks were \ncomplete. Youth were out in living area during free time and eating at meal time. Staff were \nappropriately engaging with youth. \n \nThe Miller unit was generally clean but the rooms on this unit were extremely dirty.  It is evident \nthat youth have not cleaned their rooms (if at all) in several days.  The youth were at the gym when \nthe Monitor visited on the first day. Youth were in the day areas on the second day making phone \ncalls and watching television. Staff were appropriately engaging with youth. \n \nIn Dubois, youth were just coming back from outdoor recreation.  The Unit was clean and orderly.  \nYouth were very chatty and spoke quite positively about staff.  Youth rooms were messy.  \nSafety/welfare checks were complete.  Staff were appropriately engaging with youth. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 5 of 30\n \nIn Roosevelt (TIP unit), there were 4 rooms with so much etching on glass that you could not see \ninto the room at all. The Monitor notified the Superintendent that the youth should be moved to \ndifferent rooms until this can be fixed.  This unit was by far the cleanest unit. The floors sparkled. \nYouth were out eating and relaxing in the day room.  Staff were appropriately engaging with youth.  \nThe Monitor recommended this cottage be shut down and TIP relocated because this unit has the \ndoors with small windows with a food tray slot. Recently, (after the site visit) the Monitor was \nshown sample windows (larger) that will make observations easier for staff until administration \ndecides whether to keep youth in Roosevelt.  It will be a better atmosphere in the other cottages. \nThis was the only unit that had balls as chairs inside the youth rooms. Although there have been \nimprovements in activities for the boys, idle time is still high.  It is highly recommended that the \nagency hires a consultant to help with programming and activities for the boys.   \n \nIn fact, the Monitor was very impressed with the number of positive comments and attitudes shared \nfrom both the staff and youth perspectives.  Administration, staff and youth should be commended. \nDuring this site visit, LHS/CLS had less of an institutional feel and the overall atmosphere has \nvastly improved.  The Monitor saw more positive interactions between staff and youth.  The grass \nwas replaced with new sod and there was new landscaping. The Monitor observed several youths \nriding their bikes around campus, which was something the Monitor had never seen before at any \nfacility.  This was a very positive activity to initiate.  \n \n \nStaffing \n \nDirect care staffing vacancy percentage has slightly improved from the last site visit, however, \nstaffing  issues  continue  to  exist  at  LHS/CLS.  There  are  311  total  positions  at  LHS/CLS.  \nApproximately 155 of these positions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor \nAdvanced (“YC/YCA”)).   There are still a large number of staff on various leaves of absence \n(FMLA/Workers’ Comp, etc.) which contributes to the staffing shortages and mandated overtime.  \nThe teacher vacancy rate remains unchanged – and very high - and recruiting remains a challenge. \nThis is directly impacted education for youth. The Monitor looks forward to the educational \nexpert’s assessment/report.  \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of \nNovember 28, 2018 2018  March 14, 2019  May 31, 2019 \nYouth  22% (23 of 105)           15% (16 out of 105)  11.5% (12 out of 105) \nCounselor \nYouth  18% (9 of 50)               48% (24 out of 50)  50% (25 out of 50) \nCounselor Adv \nTeacher  39% (11 of 28)             39% (11 of 28)  43% (12 of 28) \nSocial Worker   14% (2 of 14)   0% (14 of 14)   0% (14 of 14) \n \nIn order to address staffing challenged at LHS/CLS, effective April 28, 2019, security personnel \nbegan  receiving  a  $5.00/hour  add-on  for  worked  hours.  Eligible  employees  are  in  the \nclassifications  of  Correctional  Officer,  Correctional  Sergeant,  Youth  Counselor  and  Youth \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 6 of 30\n \nCounselor Advanced. The effectiveness of this increase on recruiting and retention cannot be \nassessed at this time, but it seems that this could have had an impact on existing LHS/CLS staff’s \nmorale.   \nThe Monitor believes non-traditional scheduling should still be considered.  In the last report, the \nMonitor recommended that the facility conduct a full staffing assessment to include a relief factor \nanalysis looking at all leave types and its impact on staffing levels. Defendants should also review \nthe staffing composition per shift/per cottage as there are a lot of new staff working together which \nposes additional challenges.   \n \nThe Monitor spoke to over thirty staff and the majority of staff seem energetic and stated they are \nless tired and are working less double shifts than previously reported.  The vast majority of staff \nwant more training on alternatives to OC spray and reduction/elimination of confinement. The \nmajority of staff also expressed the desire to have more programming for youth. Staff said they \nenjoy interacting with youth and are accepting of the changes that are taking place.  Most staff did \nnot have a fear that the elimination of OC Spray was coming but want more training and want \nalternatives to OC spray.  Staff are showing much more attention to building relationships with \nyouth and in engaging youth in a positive manner.  \n \nThe Defendants have implemented many of the recommendations for staff wellness. The Monitor \ncontinues to stress the need to make staff wellness a major focus moving forward.  There has been \nimproved communication with staff and youth regarding the reform effort (written and verbal). As \nrecommended in the technical assistance report, staff are engaged in developing programming and \npolicy changes and are actively participating in youth and family council meetings. The Monitor \nsaw that there were employees recognized as “Employees of the Month” and there was an ice \ncream social for staff during the site visit.  There were reminders for staff to stay hydrated with \nbottles of water offered. Krueger Living Unit Program was a finalist in the SALUTE awards Team \ncategory. Each of the 17 members who are most consistently part of staffing the Krueger Unit \nreceived  certificates  and  coffee  mugs  for  being  nominated.  There  is  correctional  officer \nappreciation calendar and Teachers Appreciation Month.  The Defendants should continue to \ncreate policy driven staff recognition programs, and tap into staff’s talents, passions, and interests \n(artists, musicians, yoga etc.) to bring into programming.  \nAs part of the agency and facility commitment to improving conditions for both staff and youth, \nthey are engaging in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (YICPM), which will be explained in \ngreater detail under the next section.  As part of the YICPM, the agency will be using their “subject \nmatter expert” (SME) technical assistance days to focus on programing enhancement and staff \nwellness.  The SME TA should have a positive impact on both if these focus areas.  \nThe Monitor  continues to suggest  modifying  the mental  health and  recreational staff work \nschedules to include more evening and weekend hours which is when youth idleness is at the \nhighest.  The Monitor believes this would have a huge impact on youth and staff. \n \nQuality Assurance \n  \nData continues to be a significant problem at LHS/CLS.   The Monitor continues to stress the fact \nthat data-driven decision making is critical to the safety and quality of life of youth and staff, as \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 7 of 30\n \nwell as to ascertain compliance with the Court Order. Data continues to not be accurately recorded, \nadequately collected or analyzed for incidents subject to the court order in this case.  Not only do \nthere need to be additional data measures, but a plan must be developed for implementation of \ncompetent data collection with a focus on accuracy at the line staff level (i.e. safety/welfare check \nlogs,  incident  reports,  use  of  force  incidents,  all  confinement,  youth  idleness,  grievances, \neducational hours per youth, etc.). \n \nAs mentioned previously in this report, the agency and facility have begun working with a team \nof experts in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (YICPM) Cohort Three.  Informed by research \non “what works” in serving youth in custody, as well as professional standards and the field’s \npreeminent thinking on best practices, the YICPM initiative is designed to assist state and county \njuvenile justice agencies and facility providers to implement a comprehensive and effective service \ndelivery approach. Utilizing the YICPM monograph as a roadmap, the Council of Juvenile \nCorrectional Administrators (CJCA), the Center for Juvenile Justice Reform at Georgetown \nUniversity’s McCourt School of Public Policy (CJJR), and a team of consultants will provide \nparticipating sites with 18 months of training and technical assistance (TTA) to align core, \nresearch-based principles with everyday practice, and achieve more positive outcomes for youth, \nfamilies, staff and communities.  \n \nThe Youth in Custody Practice Model offers agencies and facilities guidance on essential practices \nin four key areas:  \n1.  Case planning; \n2.  Facility-based  services  (e.g.,  education,  behavioral  health,  behavior  management, \nrehabilitative programming); \n3.  Transition/reentry; and  \n4.  Community-based services. \n \nThe enumerated practices stem from the view that services and approaches for system-involved \nyouth and their families should be: research-based; developmentally appropriate; family-centered; \nindividually focused and predicated on validated assessments; strength-based; trauma-informed; \ndata-informed and outcome-driven; culturally responsive; and coordinated.  Ultimately, the goals \nof the YICPM initiative are to (1) promote safe, fair and healthy environments for youth, staff and \nfamilies; (2) prepare, equip, empower and support staff to provide effective services; (3) increase \npositive  youth  and  family  experiences  and  outcomes;  and  (4)  enhance  community  safety. \nAnticipated outcomes from the effort are listed in the section below, titled “Goals, Expected \nOutcomes and Evaluation.”  \n \nThe Monitor feels that this is a positive step and that participation in the YICPM will be extremely \nuseful in aligning the core principles of the practice model as they relate to the areas of focus under \nthe Monitor’s review.  \n \nThe jurisdiction also utilizes the Performance Based Standards (“PbS”) which is a program for \njuvenile justice agencies, facilities, and residential care providers to identify, monitor, and improve \nconditions and services provided to youths using national standards and outcome measures.  PbS \nis a holistic management tool. PbS standards address facility safety, security, order, programming \nand fairness as well as services provided to respond to youths’ needs for physical health, behavioral \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 8 of 30\n \nhealth, substance use, education, vocational education, reentry planning and connection to family \nand community. Performance achieving the standards is measured by both quantitative and \nqualitative data from administrative forms, youth records, incident reports, climate surveys of \nyouths, staff and families and exit interviews of youths (only those leaving long-term correction \nfacilities.) PbS trains and supports participants to collect the data, analyze the results and use them \nto change practices using a structured and measurable improvement planning process. \n \nDuring the site visit, the Monitor spent considerable time going through the PbS April data \ncollection report to review how the data measures can be used in making critical decisions as well \nas how it can be utilized for the creation of the quality assurance program.  The Monitor also \nreviewed  the  report  functions  which  will  be  very  useful  for  management.  The  Monitor \nrecommended that the jurisdiction monitor incidents of assaults, fights, youth and staff injuries, \nand other critical outcomes measures on a monthly basis using the most recent PbS field averages \nas a guide to gauge the overall safety for staff and youth.  As a note, PbS data collection cycles \noccur twice annually, in April and October, however, there are ways to monitor the critical \noutcome measures on a monthly basis, possibly using J Tracker or another monthly metrics report \nwhich this Monitor could assist in setting up.  \n \nWhen looking at the PbS facility performance profiles for April 2019, we see some progress being \nmade but improvement is needed in regard to the critical outcome measures, primarily those that \nrelate to safety, order, security and programming. For example, Critical Outcome Performance \nSame/Better than the field average scores are rated at 54.55% for CLS and 51.25% at LHS.  Critical \nOutcome Performance Better than Last Data Collection Profile Scores are 48.48% for CLS and \n63.64% for LHS. What this data indicates is a need for continued focus and monitoring on critical \noutcome measures in order to reduce incidents effecting these outcome measures. The facility \nshould conduct a thorough review of the April PbS data and incident reports in order to better \nunderstand the nature of these incidents, as well as any specific information around the times of \nday, day of week, staff involved, etc., that may provide better insight on the driving causes around \nthe incidents and help identify strategic corrective action plans or development of the PbS Facility \nImprovement Plan (FIP).   \n \nTo address the need for a quality assurance and improvement program, the Defendants have \ncreated two new positions (Quality Assurance Specialist and Program and Policy Analyst).  The \ngoal will be to continuously assess not only compliance with this Court Order, but the quality and \nadequacy  of  the  social  and  recreational  programming  provided,  healthcare,  education, \nenvironmental health and safety, and discipline and order.  The Monitor is happy to work with the \nindividuals selected for these positions and already has worked with one of the individuals \nselected.  The second individual was hired after the third site visit thus, the Monitor has not had \nthe opportunity to meet.  The Monitor is looking forward to working with this individual.  \n \nThe Program and Policy team for the Division of Juvenile Corrections should continue to work \nwith the vendor (J-Tracker) to include other critical measures as described during the site visit.  \nThe Monitor is unable to assess the accuracy of the data because of the lack of documentation and \nquality of documentation and the ability to track via electronic systems to automatically capture \ndata.  To address the data issues, the Defendants have created and filled two new positions, \nidentified funding for experts as recommended by the Monitor, and is working towards developing \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 9 of 30\n \nan electronic room check system.  \n \nPolicies and Procedures \n \nSignificant revisions to policy and procedure and Administrative Codes have not yet occurred. \nDJC Admin Rules Committee had its first meeting on May 30, 2019. The Monitor does not have \nany updates as to when certain Codes will be repealed and recreated. All policies refer to the \nAdministrative Code and thus modifications to the Administrative Code should be a priority as \nstated in the First and Second Report of the Monitor.   \nPolicies relevant to LHS/CLS need to be compliant with the federal court orders and should contain \na quality assurance section for every policy.  After review of some of the updated DOC DJC \npolicies and procedures and local procedures, quality assurance is still not part of the policies and \nreference to this litigation is not listed in the “references” section.  Policy and procedure changes \nstill need to be made as it relates to Security and Inspections, Mechanical Restraints, Clinical \nObservations, Youth Movement and Suspension of Movement, Use of Force, Searches of Youth \n(not compliant with Court Order), Emergency Response Unit, and several others.  The Monitor \nwas pleased to see that the CARE team has been implemented and is being regularly utilized, \nhowever, a policy and procedure needs to be created which clearly outlines the mission of the \nCARE team, identify circumstances where CARE team will be deployed, describes how staff are \nchosen for the CARE team, and includes a quality assurance section. The Monitor suggests \nincreasing the CARE team as it appears they are successful at deescalating situations and their \nhours of operation should be extended to evening and increased weekend hours when youth are \nnot in school. The CARE team has an 78.5% success rate when utilized which is very good.  Also, \nmany of the policies continue to indicate “discuss at staff meeting.”  There should be formalized \ntraining with employee sign offs acknowledging receipt and understanding.  Effective proficiency \ntesting for all training classes still needs to be developed.  The Monitor will continue to work with \nthe Defendants on policy and procedure. \n \nYouth Interviews \n \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and the Monitor conducted several youth interviews.  Approximately forty-five \n(45) youth were interviewed during the site visit (formally and informally).   \n \nMany youths said that LHS/CLS was better today than it was a year ago.  A few youths said \nconditions had not improved (some were at LHS/CLS less than a year).  Many stated that staff \ninteracted with them more than they used to.  Most youth who participated in the Youth Advisory \nCouncil really liked it (although one youth thought it was pointless).  The overwhelming majority \nsaid that they were not confined much, were not restrained, and were not strip searched (which \nwas a huge improvement from interviews with youth during last visit).  A few thought staff were \n“going through the motions” but wished they spent more time with them.  Youth were able to \nidentify staff they really liked and when asked why they liked them, the youth told the Monitor it \nwas because they were fair, consistent, and cared for them.  There were still a few reports by youth \nof concerns about some staff members. A number of youth also expressed concerns about staff not \npromptly  intervening when fights occur. In addition,  youth still thought there were several \ninconsistencies involving staff not following the grievance procedure, program rules, canteen, and \ninconsistencies in the staff assigned to the various living units.  Youth really do like it when they \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 10 of 30\n \nhave the same staff working with them.  \n \nThe common complaints from youth interviewed were that they were bored and had nothing to do \n(not enough programming or activities) even though they admitted there is more now than before, \nbut they still want (and could use) more activities, since too much time without activities can breed \nproblems. Youth disliked split hallway times (half of youth locked in rooms while the remainder \nare out in day room).  Several complained about the mosquitos and did not want to go outside \nbecause of it. Youth complained about other youth, peer pressure, and bullying and felt staff did \nnot try and stop it.  They were mad when youth would run around and not follow directives because \nit impacted their ability to participate in programming or would have to go to their rooms until \nthere was control of the unit. Youth complained about two specific incidents which were being \ninvestigated at the time of the site visit. \n \nWhen interviewing youth who have been OC sprayed, youth were asked if they decontaminated \nquickly and vast majority said yes (this is also supported by the video watched during site visit).  \nSome youth said they chose not to get decontaminated. Youth complained that they did not feel \nsafe  because  youth  were  not  being  confined  anymore  when  they  got  in  altercations  (no \nconsequences when they act out).  A few said they were worried about staff when OC is eliminated.   \nYouth continued to frequently complain of delayed response to call lights (often indicated when a \nyouth has to use the restroom because there is no toilet in their rooms). \n \nThe Monitor found that much of what youth reported was accurate.  When touring all of the living \nunits, fewer youth were confined than during last site visit. Youth who were in their rooms were \nthere because they chose to be, or due to split halls, shift change, or counts. The Monitor reported \nin the last report that confinement logs did not reflect confinement time as staff believed time spent \nalone in a cell for “cool offs,” counts, “resets,” split hall out time, and periods of positive behavior \n(“PPB”) were not confinement time. Staff also did not think that time spent alone in a cell by any \nyouth not in Krueger for whatever reason, was confinement time which should be documented.  \nAfter the last site visit, direction was given clearly defining “confinement” to staff and now staff \nare aware of what confinement is and will have to document accordingly.  The Monitor anticipates \ndocumentation moving forward will be more accurate. The Monitor did observe less idle time, but \nthere still is room for improvement.  Comparing the April and October activity logs in PbS, \nsignificant improvement has been made in reducing idleness.  Operational room confinement still \nremains significantly higher than the field as does unstructured leisure activity hours.  Most staff \nwere engaged with youth in a positive manner and were placed in the vicinity of youth (as opposed \nto in their offices like last visit).   With respect to the youth statements regarding staff not \nresponding to their call lights timely or at all, this was confirmed in a survey and even with the \nMonitor’s own eyes.  Ten out of 10 youth reported staff not responding timely to the lights in their \nroom.  \n \nWith respect to the youths’ statements on OC usage and decontamination, the Monitor reviewed \nsome documentation that shows the time between spray and decontamination  has improved \ngreatly.  Also, in reviewing video of several OC spray incidents, the decontamination was soon \nafter spray when youth wanted the decontamination. The threat of OC Spray is made often, as \ndocumented in the daily shift reports. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 11 of 30\n \nThe Monitor observed (and youth reported) several positive interactions between youth and staff. \nYouth reported that LHS is “way better than before” and were much happier and the Monitor could \nobserve the youth and staff’s demeanor which reflect this.  Youth complained about the food more \nduring this site visit.   Youth really enjoyed when staff sat with them at meals, or at the tables when \nthe youth were conversing with friends.  Youth enjoyed playing games with the staff and enjoyed \nthe basketball, ping pong, and flag football tournaments.  The Monitor observed many of these \nactivities.  Youth  that  sign  up  will  participate  in  Spades  tournament,  chess/checkers,  bags, \nScategories, etc. Additional staff are being utilized to facilitate afternoon/evening programming.  \nThe following programming has been added for youth: \n•  DBT skills group for CLS youth  \n•  Debate Club – voluntary for all LHS youth \n•  Art Therapy Group – voluntary for all LHS youth  \n•  DBT skills – voluntary/referral based for LHS youth other than TIP \nand Krueger  \n•  CBT for Insomnia – voluntary for Curtis youth \n•  Prison Preparation Group – voluntary for Curtis youth  \n•  DBT Skills group for TIP youth – referral based/voluntary for TIP  \n•  Music, Movement, Movie Group – Currently running in Krueger \n•  DBT Skills group for Krueger youth  \n•  Journaling Group – voluntary for Krueger youth \n•  Building Mastery – voluntary for Krueger youth  \n•  Sex Offender Treatment Programming – referral based – joint run by \ntreatment specialist  \n•  Yoga – voluntary for all youth \n•  Book Club – voluntary for all youth  \n•  Biblio-therapy Group – voluntary for youth  \n \nThe Monitor has been told in the future that the following will be offered: \n \n•  Music, Movement, Movie – will be offered to other LHS youth on a \nvoluntary basis in the near future \n•  The Art of Storytelling – voluntary for all LHS youth  \n•  Game-Based CBT for Child Sexual Abuse Group – Referral based for \nCLS  \n \nThe  Defendants  have  made  efforts  to  identify  and  contact  community  partners  to  increase \nprogramming  at  LHS/CLS.  Hopefully,  there  will  be  continued  movement  on  bringing  in \ncommunity partners.   As previously  mentioned, there  is still a  need  for culturally relevant \nprogramming.  \n \nThere  have  been  significantly  more  resources  identified,  specifically,  positions  created  for \ndedicated staff allocated to make the necessary changes needed to improve conditions for youth \nand staff, funding for various capital projects and national experts on a temporary basis to assist in \ndeveloping systems, programs, education, and assist in making the necessary changes to reach \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 12 of 30\n \nsubstantial compliance with the Court Order. Defendants have made significant progress in \nimproving the quality of life for youth and staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree. As previously stated, \nthere is a challenge with adequacy of data for many areas (documentation, accuracy, consistency, \nand analysis) thus, some sections do not contain a detailed narrative.  \n \nA.  Room Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand procedure –and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for three days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand  procedure  –  and  if  this  improvement  is  sustained  -    they  will  reach  substantial \ncompliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: It has not been ten months after the entry of the Court’s order.  \nThe Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. However, youth are being \nconfined for behavior such as for “reflection”, split halls (sometimes due to behavior), and \nsometimes as a group when several youths engage in disruptive behavior.  These actions do \nrepresent a form of confinement as defined by the court order, which needs to be documented \nso that compliance with section can be assessed at the appropriate time.  \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 13 of 30\n \n \n2. Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative confinement may exceed four hours only under the following \ncircumstances: \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  For this reporting period, there \nwere instances in which administrative confinement was being used for youth who did not \npose a serious risk of imminent physical harm.  It also appears that, rather than releasing \nyouth from confinement as soon as they no longer pose a risk, Defendants are generally \ntreating four hours as a default minimum period of time for administrative confinement. The \nMonitor suggested how to document this requirement in policy and in forms as well as made \nsuggestions to place youth in the day room once they no longer pose a serious risk of \nimminent physical harm to others. Defendants need to improve their quality of data and \ndocumentation and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure.  The Monitor also \ndiscussed alternatives to confinement for administrative purposes such as med pass, counts, \nshift change, and split hall time.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 \nhours) when: \n \n1.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  In a large number of instances, it \ndoes not seem that administrative confinement is being extended.  Defendants need to \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand procedure. \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 14 of 30\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Generally,  youth  who  are  in \nadministrative confinement are in the Krueger program.  Although youth have behavioral \nplans developed, the program needs to be improved to include more robust behavioral plans \nand the plan needs to be revisited should a youth not be able to return in an appropriate \nperiod of time.  The Monitor spent several hours reviewing and discussing the Krueger \nprogram.  The Defendants were working on updating the program. Defendants need to \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand procedure. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to \n8 am. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \npm to 8 am.   \nc.  Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    There  is  no  evidence  that \nadministrative confinement has been extended beyond 24 hours, and thus there have not \nbeen  such  transfer  plans  created.  If  Defendants  improve  their  quality  of  data  and \ndocumentation, and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure, they will be in \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants need to improve their \nquality  of  data  and  documentation  and  incorporate  the  court  order  into  policy  and \nprocedure. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended pol icy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated on 9/19/18 and the dates contained in the policy has been corrected. \nThe Monitor suggests a more formal training and staff sign off reflecting they read and \nunderstand policy. Additionally, a quality assurance mechanism needs to be created. \n  \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 15 of 30\n \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: NON-COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are \nsafety and security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and \nto make the rooms more suicide resistant.  The Monitor recommended that Defendants \nreplace the existing room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and \nengineered for secure environments.  The new replacement furniture which is in the Wells \nunit is consistent with what the Monitor would expect to see in a secure facility and should \ncertainly reduce the opportunity for suicidal incidents within the youth rooms.  The \nDefendants  have  a  mock  room  with  the  new  furniture  which  will  be  a  significant \nimprovement once completed throughout LHS/CLS.   \n \nWith respect to youth rooms, there is little to no change from the last site visit. Most youth \nrooms were not clean or organized. Several rooms had multiple blankets/sheets covering \nlarge areas of the room making it difficult for staff to assess whether there is contraband \nthat can be harmful to youth inside the rooms or assessing youth activity while in bed.  \nThere has been improvement on graffiti and etching on the glass which has improved \nstaff’s ability to clearly see the youth through the window. Also, on the TIP unit, the \nMonitor recommended that the windows to be changed (they are very small and pretty \nhigh on the door). Post site visit, the Monitor has seen the new windows which will be \ninstalled that are much larger and will improve visibility.  \n \nSafety/Welfare  checks  have  significantly  improved  and  are  now  being  done  on  an \nindividual  basis.    Safety/welfare  documentation  show  that  room  checks  are  being \ncompleted every 30 minutes.  Staggered intervals need to be focused on. As previously \nmentioned in this report, The Monitor has made recommendations to the forms that will \nsimplify the process.  The Monitor recognizes that an electronic system is being explored \nby the agency, but this will take some time. Safety/welfare checks need to be a priority \nand progress needs to continue to be made.  While not required by the Court Order, the \nMonitor continues to recommend increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a \nminimum of every 15 minutes when youth are confined to their rooms as this is supported \nby JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice \nModel. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 16 of 30\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth have not complained about \naccess to water or hygiene supplies. However, a common complaint among youth in rooms \nwithout toilets (dry rooms) continues to be that staff are very slow to respond when they \nindicate they need to use the restroom. Administration investigated this complaint for this \nreporting period and the results were the same.  It was proven that this is in fact occurring \nfrequently.  Further, Defendants do not document this issue. Defendants need to create a \nform, policy, and quality assurance measures as to this section and others.  Administration \nneeds to continue to investigate and hold staff accountable until the problem is fixed.  Staff \nneed to be held accountable should an investigation reveal the delay is purposeful. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no \nlater than two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nbut still needs more improvement.  Time of call to PSU staff is now being documented on \nthe incident report in most instances, but there is room for improvement. This requirement \nshould be included in the development of a quality assurance program. \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Monitor  requested  any \ndocumentation  indicating  that  confinement  is  contraindicated  and  there  were  no \ninstances documented. There is a form “Psychology Input for Security Decision” which \nis  where  the  contraindication  would  be  documented  and  there  is  a  policy  (Policy \n500.70.04) Again, as with all policies, a section should be created to include quality \nassurance and monitored by facility administrators. \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 17 of 30\n \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.   Safety/Welfare checks  have \nsignificantly improved and are now being done on an individual basis.  Safety/welfare \ndocumentation show that room checks are being completed every 30 minutes.  Staggered \nintervals need to be focused on. As previously mentioned in this report, The Monitor has \nmade  recommendations  to  the  forms  that  will  simplify  the  process.    The  Monitor \nrecognizes that an electronic system is being explored by the agency, but this will take \nsome time. Safety/welfare checks need to be a priority and progress needs to continue to \nbe made.   \n \nDefendants are holding more staff accountable for this reporting period as there were 36 \n“Letters  of  Expectation”  and  two  staff  were  formally  disciplined  related  to  visual \nmonitoring.  Staff need to be held accountable for not completing checks according to \npolicy. In addition, although the requirement in this Court Order is “at least every 30 \nminutes” the Monitor recommends that every youth should have a visual inspection at \nleast every 15 minutes at staggered intervals. This is supported by JDAI standards, PREA \nstandards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. The agency should \nmake an electronic, software-based rounds checking system a priority.  PSU staff do visit \nyouth daily when on site. \n \nf.   Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary in \nnature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Some  rooms  contained  more \nproperty than outlined in handbooks.  Some rooms had less property in their rooms, such as \nKrueger and Targeted Intervention Unit (“TIP”). The Monitor could not confirm whether \nthis was restricted as needed for safety. Documentation needs to be improved as to this \nrequirement and confinement needs to be accurately recorded. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 18 of 30\n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Social  worker  visits,  mental \nhealth services, and other health services are provided.  Once documentation, quality \nassurance program is created, and this requirement is clearly in policy and procedure, \nDefendants will be in substantial compliance.  \n \n11.  Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Programming  is  inconsistent.  \nThere is a lack of documentation as to specific programming that occurs daily. There does \nnot seem to be programming when youth are on PPB or, according to the Krueger handbook, \nin Phase 1 of the program.  This was discussed, and the Monitor anticipates this will change \nonce the Krueger is updated/modified according to discussions during the site visit. Also, \nthere are occasions where staffing levels do not allow for planned programming. There has \nbeen improvement in available programming, but there is still a lack of other activities for \nyouth  to  engage  in,  resulting  in  excessive  amounts  of  idle  time  and  split  hall  time \n(confinement). This occurs especially, but not only, on weekends. \n \n111.   Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Educational Services for general \npopulation occur in the classrooms in the school area. Youth in the Targeted Intervention \nProgram (“TIP”) attend classes in the school area but separate from the general population. \nYouth in Krueger do not receive educational services in the school area (except for youth \non Phase 3) but remain on living units.  Youth also continue to be “suspended” from school. \nPbS data is available for this reporting period, and it does appear that youth are engaged \nin educational activities for more time than during the last visit. As reflected in the staffing \nsection of this report, the current teacher vacancy rate is 43% (12 of 28 allocated positions) \nis mostly likely impacting the ability of youth to be in school for longer periods.  Educational \nhours need to be increased for all youth on a daily basis.  The Monitor recommends that all \nyouth regardless of status have education in the school area or, at a minimum, off their \nliving unit. The Monitor also recommends culturally relevant programming/materials be \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 19 of 30\n \noffered. The Monitor has also connected the agency with an education consultant who has \ncompleted the assessment.  The Monitor awaits the report. The Monitor anticipates there \nwill be more recommendations contained in that report. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most units still have “split hall” \nwhich means a portion of youth are confined to their rooms while others are out, and they \nrotate. Based on the staffing numbers on the unit, there is no reason that all youth cannot be \nout in the day room/outside etc. The Monitor saw youth conversing with other youth and \nstaff during out time which is an improvement from the last visit.  In youth interviews, youth \nstated  that  they  are  not  confined  to  their  rooms  “that  much.”  Some  youth  actually \ncomplained that other youth were not confined enough when they were involved in an \naltercation.  Youth still want more activities when they are out of their rooms and feel they \ndo not really do anything, which, as discussed elsewhere, is a significant problem. There is \nnot any real programming in Phase 1 of the Krueger Program and not a lot in Phase 2. The \nMonitor has been told that the Krueger Program is changing to increase out time and youth \nwill receive phone calls and be able to have more movement on the unit. Phase 3 has a little \nmore sensory stimulation. The Krueger program is out of pilot form, and the leadership has \nre-evaluated the program to ensure compliance with the court order and technical assistance \nreport with the Monitor’s assistance.   Enhancing programs and meaningful activities for the \nKrueger program should have a positive impact and allow for youth to return to their home \ncottages quicker. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The majority of meals take place \nout of the room but there are several occasions where youth eat meals in their rooms when \nthere is not an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm.  The Monitor witnessed \nsome youth eating in their rooms and have seen this documented in shift reports. Should \na youth eat a meal in their room, the decision by staff needs to be justified, supported by \ndocumentation, and instances need to be reviewed by facility administrators. Meals are \nnot documented on living units except Krueger, but they need to be.  When reviewing the \nKrueger documentation, a large number of youth are eating in their rooms without \nevidence of a threat of physical harm. Also, there are several blank entries meaning staff \nare not documenting whether youth are eating in rooms or not.  There needs to be a \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 20 of 30\n \nquality assurance measure created and this requirement needs to in policy and procedure.  \n \nv1.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Logs indicate that most youth are \nreceiving 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week.  Documentation, data collection \nand reliability make it difficult for the Monitor to assess level of compliance. The Monitor \nmade several recommendations that should be implemented as soon as possible.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  It is not clear whether youth are \nbeing told that they can grieve their placements in room confinement at all (or being told \nthey can do so within 15 minutes of placement).  There were 70 grievances filed by youth \nduring this reporting period (on a variety of issues, not just placement). This indicates many \nyouths utilize the grievance procedures. There was only one grievance related to discipline. \nHowever, youth still feel the process is confusing and some reported that staff were not \nfollowing the grievance procedure as required by policy.  The Monitor does suggest that a \nmore robust tracking system be developed with a quality assurance piece that ensures \ngrievances are being timely and appropriately addressed and communicated to youth. The \nMonitor  made recommendations to forms which if implemented, should improve data \ncollection. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, which is not being done.  Documentation \nneeds to be completed and consistently applied to all situations, other than sleeping hours, \nin which youth are confined alone in their rooms, regardless of what unit they are in \n(including not only Krueger, but all units in both LHS and CLS, and the reason for the \nconfinement). Documentation, data collection and reliability, and quality assurance needs \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 21 of 30\n \nto be improved.   \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants need to continue to \nimplement their OC reduction plan.  There are youth still being sprayed in instances where \nlesser means could have been used (video of instances were viewed during the site visit), and \nspray is being used to “prevent self-harm” when other means could have been used. The OC \nreduction plan should involve training staff on a variety of de-escalation skills as well as a \ndirective that OC should only be used in situations that present a serious life safety or \nthreatening situation.  In reviewing video, it is clear that staff do not have the skills to de-\nescalate or restrain youth.  Staff are too slow to go hands on when situations require it.  The \nMonitor  made  several  recommendations  including  increased  training,  implementing  a \nspecialized team, and ensuring incident reviews are meaningful.  The expanded use of CARE \nTeams can greatly assist in de-escalating situations and ultimately reducing/eliminating the \nuse of OC.  Additionally, as recommended in the technical assistance report, a new incentive-\nbased behavior management program that focuses on rewarding positive behavior should be \ncreated which will have a direct impact on youth behavior and thus, reduce the need for \nforce of any kind.  The Monitor is told the Defendants are working on a new and improved \nbehavior  management  system  which  the  Monitor  will  be  happy  to  review  prior  to \nimplementation. While there continues to be a significant decrease in the use of OC spray \nover the last six months, there is a rise in the number of incidents during this reporting \nperiod.  Continued focus on training, skills development and coaching, continued focus on \noverall atmosphere should have a positive impact on the number of incidents requiring this \ntype of intervention.  Merely reducing or modifying the intervention protocols for these types \nof incidents is not a sufficient response.   \n \nThe below graph reflects the combined usage of OC at LHS and CLS in 2018/2019. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 22 of 30\n \nLHS/CLS 2018 Combined Chemical Restraint Use  \n25\n21\n20\n20\n14 14\n15\n12\n11\n10 10\n10 8 8\n5 5\n5 3 3\n0\nApr 18  May  Jun 18  Jul 18  Aug 18 Sep 18 Oct 18 Nov 18 Dec 18 Jan 19 Feb 19 Mar 19 Apr 19  May\n18 19\nLHS/CHS OC Usage+Sheet1!$H$3\n \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  Compliance will be assessed by the Monitor at the time \nrequired under this section. \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The Monitor did not personally \nsee any youth in mechanical restraints during site visits, but logs show there are occasions \nwhere youth are placed in mechanical restraints – including being put “on the belt” as well \nas in cuffs. Data shows there were more youth mechanically restrained than during the last \nreporting period. With better documentation and quality assurance measures, Defendants \nmay be close to achieving substantial compliance with this provision if they can document \nand establish that there were not less restrictive means available.   \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 23 of 30\n \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Mechanical restraints are rarely \nused but when they are, there is little or no documentation as to whether and how there is an \nimminent threat of physical hard, and when and how that process is reviewed.  There needs \nto be a continuous effort to monitor youth who are placed in mechanical restraints and \nconsistent documentation. With better documentation and quality assurance measures, and \nreturning to the reduction in use of restraints that previously existed, Defendants may be \nclose to achieving substantial compliance with this provision \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \nMechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \n1. \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \n11.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  However, when restraints have \nbeen used, there is little or no documentation of the reasons for doing so, whether and how \nthere is an imminent threat of physical harm, and when and how that process is reviewed. \nWith better documentation and quality assurance measures and returning to the reduction \nin use of restraints that previously existed, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial \ncompliance with this provision. \n \n \ni ii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 24 of 30\n \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is some indication that \nrestraints may be regularly used with youth in Phase 1 at Krueger, which would be \ninappropriate. By ceasing this practice, and with better documentation, policy revisions, \nand  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving  substantial \ncompliance with this provision. \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With better documentation, policy revisions, and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nf.   Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation.  However, de-escalation training needs to be completed more often \n(regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue to develop this skill.  Proper de-\nescalation cannot be trained only once, or even only once a year.  The Monitor suggested \nhaving staff who are very good at de-escalation work with staff who could use a refresher \nor with new staff especially since a large majority are new.  During the site visit, there was \na unit that was out of control and when the Monitor talked with staff, they all had been at \nLHS/CLS for a year or less.  Documentation needs to be improved and a quality assurance \nmechanism needs to be in place. \n \ng.   Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No  youth shall be  left alone  in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 25 of 30\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation shows that strip \nsearching still occurs, but the Monitor cannot assess whether there is probable cause to \nbelieve that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could not be discovered \nthrough less intrusive means because this is not documented.  Blanket strip searches of youth \nat intake or returning from court has ceased, but staff are doing a “hygiene” check which \nrequires a youth to strip to underwear and bra which is replacing the “strip search.” This \ntype of search should only be used for the same reasons as a strip search when utilized for \nthis purpose (probable cause of youth possessing drugs or weapons that could not be \ndiscovered through less intrusive means). As previously stated, the policy for searches need \nto be amended to reflect the language in this section. \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that strip \nsearching is still occurring, but the Monitor cannot assess whether there is probable cause, \nwhether less intrusive means were considered, or whether youth were allowed to change into \na tank top or other clothing because this is not documented.  Staff are doing a “hygiene” \ncheck which requires a youth to strip to underwear and bra which is replacing the “strip \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 26 of 30\n \nsearch.” This type of search should only be used for the same reasons as a strip search when \nutilized for this purpose.  It does not appear that less intrusive searches are attempted before \na strip search is conducted. Documentation shows that Staff are conducting pat down \nsearches, but the Monitor did not see any and youth did not report this was happening.  \nAdditionally, hygiene checks go beyond tank top or other clothes (youth are stripped to \nunderwear and/or bras.)  As previously stated, the policy for searches need to be amended \nto reflect the language in this section.  Documentation needs to be improved.  \n \n3.  Process for strip searches. \n \na. When a strip search is  conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved as to how staff are ensuring that unintended individuals cannot view the search \n(detail the area where search is occurring, state that there are no recording devices, and \ndocument who is present in the area, etc.) If documentation and policy revisions are made, \nsubstantial compliance can be obtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved detailing the area where search is conducted and how other youth cannot view the \nyouth being strip searched.  If documentation and policy revisions are made, substantial \ncompliance can be obtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nd.   \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved as to which staff conducted the search, that the search is by staff who is of the same \ngender identity as the youth if the strip search is being conducted by someone other than a \nmedical professional. The Monitor recommended form changes for documentation purposes. \n \ne.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Training records indicate that \nmajority of staff have been trained in trauma informed care.  Documentation needs to be \nimproved as to strip searches.  \n \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 27 of 30\n \n \nf.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor is told by direct care \nstaff and mental staff that mental health is consulted. Documentation needs to be improved.  \n \n4.  Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most staff have been trained in the \nnew MANDT training and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. The \nMonitor recommends increasing the training frequency for staff to increase their experience \nand skill levels in managing and de-escalating situations before they result in the use of \nrestraint and/or isolation.  Although there is a use of force review process, it needs to be \nthorough and comprehensive, include a corrective action plan when force was used where it \ncould have been avoided, and timelier than they are being done. The Monitor recommended \nin instances where de-escalation was successful, those examples should be used as a training \ntool for other staff including having other staff view the videos.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of id le time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Many of the recommendations that \nwere made in the February 2018 technical assistance report have been implemented such as \nfamily  events,  yoga/Zumba,  increased  tournaments,  more  arts,  and  the  additional \nprogramming listed in the narrative part of this report.  Also, as recommended in the \ntechnical  report,  youth  advisory  and  family  councils  have  been  implemented  and  the \nMonitor’s recommendations have been incorporated into the process (agendas, minutes, \nfrequency, and increased staff involvement). Seven meetings took place over the last three \nmonths.  The council meetings are well received by youth and staff. Although there were \nmore activities for youth during this site visit, there is still a significant amount of idle time \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 28 of 30\n \nfor  youth.  The  Monitor  recommended  that  a  programming  schedule  be  created  and \nimplemented.  A draft version has been created but needs to be implemented and policy and \nprocedure with a data measures needs to be created.  The Monitor believes this will assist in \nreducing idle time and also will hold staff accountable.  \n \nAs recommended previously, counselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and \nvolunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for youth.  Several staff \nmade  suggestions  for  programming  such  as  art  therapy,  dog  therapy,  increased \ntournaments, job readiness skills, music, balance and restorative justice, and teen court. \nMany of these suggestions have been implemented or will soon be implemented. During \ninterviews  with  staff,  staff  expressed  a  desire  to  participate  in  activities  with  youth. \nAdministration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours to \nfurther reduce youth idleness hours.  As mentioned previously, increasing education hours \ncan greatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development strategies \nthrough  meaningful  education  and  vocational  programming.    Recreation  and  exercise \nschedules are every other day according to staff and appear to be inconsistent and often \nlimited due to a variety of reasons.  Extended recreation should be considered. The volunteer \ncoordinator has contacted several potential community partners so hopefully this will prove \nbeneficial.  The Defendants have identified funding to pay for a consultant that can assist \nwith developing gender and culturally appropriate programming. The Monitor provided \npotential experts for Defendants to consider.  \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Some of the recommendations made \nin the February 2018 report have been implemented such as hiring bonuses to obtain new \nstaff, increased wages for current staff, staff recognition, and staff wellness initiatives.  There \nhas been a huge reduction in vacancy rates for direct care staff over the last six months.  \nThere still are major staffing challenges due various employee leaves and teacher vacancies. \nOther recommendations have not been implemented such as redrafting job descriptions and \njob postings which highlights the youth counselor aspect of position instead of “guard” or \n“corrections” description, rewrite position summary, reassess current staff schedules and \nplacement, part-time staff to fill in the gaps and/or outside security firms to supplement \nexisting staff, or assessing and ensuring staff are not working too much overtime. Given the \nlong-standing staffing deficiencies, there is an urgent need to also explore methods for \npromptly reducing youth populations. This might include expediting the OJOR process and \nevaluating  youth  for  placement  under  community  supervision,  including  intensive \ncommunity supervision, as permitted by state law. \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 29 of 30\n \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  DOC has identified sections of the Administrative Code that \nneed to be modified, but significant revisions have not yet occurred.  The Monitor has been \ntold implementation will take some time as it requires certain Codes to be repealed and \nrecreated.  All policies  refer to the Administrative Code and thus modifications to the \nAdministrative Code should be a priority.  Interim policies should be considered, and the \nMonitor has been told that there is a mechanism to amend policies for LHS/CLS. \n \nII.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any \nincident  that  involved  the  use  of  force;  OC  spray;  room  confinement;  or \nmechanical restraints used for more than 45 minutes (excluding during \ntransportation). The review committee will include all staff directly involved in the \nincident, their supervisors, the social worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who \nare  familiar  with  the  youth,  the  facility  director  of  security,  the  deputy \nsuperintendent, and the superintendent.  Within 24 hours, all available members of \nthe review committee shall meet to assess whether physical force, OC spray, room \nconfinement, or mechanical restraints were used appropriately, to discuss less \nrestrictive alternative strategies that staff could have used, and to provide an \nopportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If not all members of the \nreview committee are available for the meeting within 24 hours, the full review \ncommittee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later than one week after \nthe event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of strip searches weekly \nto ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon probable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Although reviews occur for most \nincidents (informally), the reviews often occur well after the 24-hour timeframe.  Often, \nthe reviews do not occur until 3-4 weeks after the incident.  Timeframes have improved \nfrom previous months. Staff involved are not brought together for meaningful discussions.  \nWhen it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is not a corrective \naction plan developed. The Monitor made suggestions to the Superintendent as to this \nsection during the site visit utilizing specific incidents occurring during the reporting \nperiod similar to the last visit.   \n \nB.  Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 111   Filed: 07/01/19   Page 30 of 30\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Critical quality assurance positions \nare now filled and will be assisting in developing a quality assurance program.  The Monitor \nreviewed sample performance goals, reviewed PbS in great detail, and made suggestions for \nmonthly performance measures and how to incorporate into policy.  As discussed throughout \nthis report, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order \nand to improve the quality of life for youth and staff.  \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Defendants have made significant improvements with improving staff and youth interactions, \ndeveloping  more  programming  options  for  youth,  reducing  confinement  time,  reducing \nmechanical restraints, reducing staff vacancies, developing staff wellness initiatives, filling new \npositions to help with data collection and quality assurance, identifying funding for various outside \nexperts and funding for physical plant improvements, and made physical plant improvements.  As \na result of the progress made, it is clearly evident that these changes are having a positive impact \non the overall atmosphere and culture of the facility.  Staff are much more engaged with youth and \nbuilding positive relationships which will ultimately have an impact on reducing incidents of \nviolence, restraint and/or room confinement.   \n \nContinued efforts need to be made with reducing teacher vacancies and increasing educational \ntime, training in de-escalation and physical restraint techniques, amending policy and procedures, \ndeveloping a quality assurance program, developing a means to monitor and track PbS critical \noutcome measures through a monthly metrics report or dashboard, and continuing the physical \nplant improvements (paint, murals, etched glass, covering graffiti, furniture in the day room and \nsuicide “resistant furniture.” All documentation needs to improve.  There should also be a focus \non reducing/eliminating the confinement of youth during normal operational processes such as \nmed pass, counts, shift change and splitting up youth in “high” and “low” halls.  Although there is \nmore work to do, the Monitor was pleased with the progress made over the last three months.  The \nMonitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n30 \n ",

The Monitor’s \nfifth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the fourth site visit which took place on September 13, 2019.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe fifth site visit by the Monitor took place from February 6 through February 8, 2020. The \nMonitor reviewed materials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit. \nMaterials included, but were not limited to: programming materials, staff surveys, PbS data, \nproject plans, grievances, counselor logs, staff memos, daily shift reports, video footage of use of \nforce incidents and activity on unit, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this court \norder,  updated  unit  rules,  work  rules,  employee  leave  data,  behavior  and  treatment  plans, \nmechanical restraint documentation, incident reports, other housing documentation, policy drafts, \nfacility enhancement report, and various meeting minutes. The Parties were present during the site \nvisit.  The  Monitor  took  photographs,  toured  LHS/CLS,  and  interviewed  youth  and  staff. \nApproximately forty-four (44) youth and thirty-one (31) staff were interviewed formally and \ninformally by the Parties during this site visit. \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 2 of 36\n \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction \n \nWhile the conditions at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake have certainly improved since a year ago, \ndocumentation and interviews indicated that there has been some regression since the September \n2019 site visit, especially with respect to punitive and administrative confinement and the use of \nrestraints. During this reporting period, Defendants have eliminated the use of OC Spray and there \nwere significant incidents in which alternatives to OC spray had to be utilized. The response to \nthese incidents impacted the use of confinement, restraints, programming, and PbS data.  The \nMonitor anticipates an improvement during the next reporting period. In more detail below, are \nthe observations and recommendations from this site visit.  \nPhysical Plant \nThe general areas of the facility were very clean and orderly.   It was very cold with snow on the \nground but the walkways throughout the facility were shoveled nicely. The atmosphere in general \nwas calm throughout LHS/CLS.  The recommendations as to the physical plant modifications \nmade in previous Monitor reports and the February 2018 technical assistance report have been \nimplemented and/or are progressing. Several physical plant improvements have been completed \nincluding, but not limited to, electronic documentation and reporting system (“RFID”), Wells, \nMiller, Black Elk, DuBois and Curtis cottages remodeling, additional telephones installed in each \nof the cottages, and the new generator is complete and operational. Additional projects not yet \ncompleted are the camera upgrade, electrical upgrade, camera, the new staff break room, and \nremaining cottage remodels (King, Roosevelt, Krueger, and Rogers).  The Monitor will continue \nto update the Court on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for \nyouth and staff.   \nIn general, entrances into the units were very clean and orderly, the day rooms were very clean, and \nmost of the bathrooms in the cottages were clean. The level of cleanliness of youth rooms varied \nthroughout the cottages (described in more detail below). There were no observable maintenance \nissues observed during this visit.  The Defendants have included the room and unit cleanliness in \ntheir behavior management system and “Clean Up” contests continue to occur, and other incentives \nare planned on a regular basis. Because the Defendants have removed and/or secured items that have \nbeen used by youth in disturbances and built barriers, the facility is much safer, particularly in the \nnewly renovated living units. The Monitor recommended that searches of all buildings be conducted \nto remove excessive objects, materials, equipment, furniture, etc., to enhance the safety and security \nof the units/buildings and to maintain a more orderly and safer environment.  Defendants now \nregularly conduct and document searches and there was no evidence of excessive objects, furniture, \netc. in the living units or classrooms. This is an improvement from the last site visit.  Youth and staff \nshould be commended. The Defendants replaced existing furniture with furniture that is specifically \ndesigned and engineered for secure environments and the secure furniture are in several of the living \nunits.  There is a schedule for removing the remaining of the existing furniture and replacement with \na goal completion date of August/September 2020. Defendants believe they will meet this timeline. \nSchool/Living Units Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage and toured the school on Friday.  The school continues to have \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 3 of 36\n \npositive messages throughout, and artwork displayed. The classrooms and the general school area \nwere very clean. All the girls were in the school area attending class. However, many youth were \nnot in class because five teachers were absent, and when such absences occur youth remain on \ntheir units. Youth that were in the classrooms were behaved and engaged. There were two youth \nin the library reading books. There was one youth in the STAR room.  There is now a room \ndesignated for the Grandparents program.  The youth really enjoy when the grandparents are there.  \nThere was somberness this visit as one of the grandparents experienced a serious medical condition \n(unrelated to her volunteer work) a day before the site visit. The music room moved to a bigger \nspace and the youth are truly enjoying this new space.  Recording studios are being developed and \nthe youth and faculty are excited.  There were several teacher absences this day so there were not \nmany youth in class.  In the afternoon, youth were filtering into the school area for “CR2EW” \nwhich is a new social emotional program cultivating resilience, responsibility, empathy, and \nwisdom. Small groups of youth and staff participate daily, although youth in Levels 1 and 2 on \nKrueger and youth who have graduated are not included in the program. There was a graduation \nceremony on Friday which was very exciting for staff and youth. There is an increased use of \nonline education in the schools. Some youth like this method of instruction, while others did not \nand felt they would benefit more from instruction by a teacher in the classroom. \nThe Monitor previously recommended that the Defendants hire an education expert to complete an \nassessment of the educational program at LHS/CLS. The expert was retained and provided initial \nobservations.  The  expert  returned  in  November  to  further  assess  the  education  department’s \noperations and make specific recommendations. The Monitor recommends that the Defendants \nengage the consultant further and work to address the concerns raised – including the need for more \ndeep and meaningful teacher interaction with youth - and implement the recommendations made by \nthe consultant and the Monitor with respect to staffing and the educational program for LHS/CLS. \nThe Monitor reported last time that the Defendants moved the girls’ educational programming out \nof the main school and into a smaller building in the Copper Lake section of the facility, with fewer \namenities and facilities than in the main school.  The Monitor highly recommended that the girls \nreturn to the main school as soon as possible.  Although the Monitor recommended that the girls \nreturn to the main school sooner, the Defendants did not move the girls back until February 4, 2020.   \nYouth on levels 1 and 2 in the Krueger Program continue to attend school in classrooms on their \nliving unit. The Defendants should consider allowing youth on Levels 1 and 2 to attend class in the \nmain school if their behavior warrants it (similar to the TIP unit at a minimum).  \nThere was a high number of staff at the facility, specifically on the living units during the site visit \ndue to new staff doing on the job training (“OJT”).  The Monitor saw staff engaging with youth, \nalthough less so than during the September visit.  Youth attitudes overall were very good during this \nsite visit.  All the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and many were very chatty.  \nOJT staff cannot be counted towards the PREA staffing ratio, but they are able to actively engage \nwith youth.  This would have been a great opportunity for staff to sit with youth more, engage in \nmeaningful programming with youth, and learn the day to day responsibilities of youth and staff.   \nSafety/welfare checks are no longer being completed on paper because the new RFID system has \nbeen implemented. The RFID system is a data driven assessment about youth observations, \nmovement, and classification.  It measures staff performance on safety/security checks in real time, \nwhich will help manage compliance with the various requirements of the Court Order and other \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 4 of 36\n \nstandards. The Monitor could not observe whether the safety/welfare checks were completed and \nup to date/staggered on the units at the time of the site visit as they are still adjusting to running \nreports. However, the Monitor did observe the process and witnessed staff completing the rounds \non  all  units.  Subsequent  to  this site  visit, the Monitor  reviewed  a  random sampling  of  the \nsafety/welfare  check  data  from  the  electronic  system.  The  majority  of  the  checks  were  in \ncompliance with the Court Order. Staff really like the new electronic system and seem to be \nadjusting well to the new system.   The new system appears to work much better than the old paper \nsystem and, more importantly, staff appear to be paying much better attention to the process and \nyouth safety. One small recommendation for the new RFID system is to change the word “inmate” \nto youth within the software of the programming and replace the icon with the hands in the cell \nimage for another one (if possible).   \nDuring this site visit, the girls were split between King and Wells cottages since the renovation \nproject that was in progress during the last visit is completed and since there was an increase in the \nnumber of girls at CLS.  The atmosphere is quite different on the two girls’ units.  On Wells, the \ngirls were very chatty and respectful.  They expressed how happy they are to be back in the main \nschool. Staff were sitting with the girls at the table while they played games and were doing artwork. \nThe girls were conversing appropriately with each other and staff. The rooms on the unit were \ngenerally clean and orderly with beds made. No one was confined to their room and youth were \nwaiting patiently for their meal to be served.  The Monitor observed staff redirecting youth \nappropriately and youth following staff direction.  Staff were completing their safety/security \nrounds, engaging with youth, preparing dinner, and medicine pass was occurring.  It was a very \ncalm and happy unit. \nKing was less calm; staff were not sitting with youth and youth were not engaged in any activities \nbesides sitting at the tables waiting for dinner. The rooms in general were not clean, however, the \nunit itself was clean and orderly. No one was confined.  Youth seemed more irritable in this unit \nthan on Wells. Inconsistency of staff could be a factor for this difference. \nWith respect the boys’ cottages, generally, the cottages themselves were cleaner than the last visit. \nThe Monitor recommended during the last site visit that staff adjust their placement now that youth \nare all out of their rooms from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (generally speaking) and can more freely move \naround the unit.  Staff were appropriately placed around the unit from a safety perspective.  There \nwere significantly less youth in their rooms during this site visit than any of the previous site visits. \nAs previously mentioned, there were a lot of staff on the living units due to staff completing on \nthe job training (3-5 staff per cottage) but many were standing around the youth observing youth \nversus sitting with them and engaging. With the number of staff on the unit, some could have \nplaced themselves around the unit and some could have been engaged with youth. During this site \nvisit, staff in general were not interacting with the youth as much as the Monitor observed during \nthe last visit. Perhaps this is because most of the staff at the time the Monitor toured were very \nnew.  \nIn Krueger, the unit was clean. Youth rooms were dirty and had graffiti as observed during the last \nsite visit.  Six (6) youth were out in the day room eating their meals calmly and exhibited good \npeer relations. There were five (5) staff on the unit.  Four (4) youth were in their rooms as youth \non Krueger rotate in and out of their rooms for meals and programming. Staff were sitting with \nyouth and chatting with youth. Based on staffing levels, the Monitor believes that all youth should \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 5 of 36\n \nhave their meals at the same time in order to reduce confinement time.  \nThe Monitor had recommended in all units that “split hall” time (which means that half the youth \nwere confined in their rooms while the other half were out of their cells) be eliminated, and youth \nremain out in the day room during medicine pass, counts, and shift change thereby reducing \noperational room confinement significantly. As of September 3, 2019, the Defendants ceased doing \nconfinement for these reasons throughout LHS/CLS.  However, the Defendants reinstituted these \ntypes of  confinements  in  October  2019  after some  significant  group disturbances,  and  they \ncontinued through the site visit despite the lack of any major disturbances since October.  A few \ndays after the site visit, the Monitor was told that the Defendants stopped doing these types of \nconfinement. LHS/CLS continues to have “open dayrooms” which allow the youth to be out of \ntheir rooms from at least 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for the majority of this reporting period. Youth are happy \nthat they are not being confined to their rooms during these hours although they express concern \nabout a lack of activities.  \nIn Addams (intake unit), the living unit, bathroom, and rooms were very clean and orderly. The \ncottage is beautifully decorated.  There were ten (10) youth on the unit and five (5) staff. Staff \nwere engaged with youth and the youth were quite silly. There were no youth confined. There was \nsignificantly less graffiti in the youth rooms than during the last visit.   The new staff stated that \nthey were very happy and that the training they received was excellent.  \nIn Black Elk, the unit was clean.  Youth were in the day room eating and no youth were confined.  \nMost of the rooms were clean.  Youth were pretty rowdy, and it was not a calm environment.  \n \nThe Rogers unit (TIP) was clean and youth rooms were not as clean as the other units.  There were \nfive (5) staff on the unit. Two (2) youth were in their rooms voluntarily. Staff were not engaged \nand were standing with their arms crossed. Youth were on the unit watching television, playing \ngames, and talking with each other.  The unit was calm.  \n \nThe Hughes living unit was the least clean and had the most graffiti. About half of the rooms were \nclean and the other half were messy. Youth were out cleaning and eating lunch.  There were three \n(3) staff on the unit.  Youth were on the telephone, talking with each other, and some youth were \neating. One youth was in his room at his request. We talked with one of the youth on this unit who \nsaid this was his second time being at LHS.  He said he was here a few years ago and stated that \nthe facility “is way better now than it was back then.” \nThe Miller unit was very clean. Youth rooms were moderately clean.  Two youths were in their rooms \nvoluntarily.  Youth seemed to really get along. Youth were watching television, braiding hair, and \nplaying foosball.  \n \nThe Dubois unit was very clean. The bathroom was very dirty.  Half of the rooms were clean (one \nside) and the other half were very messy and dirty. Youth were out in the unit reading, talking, and \nwatching television.  No youth were in their room. There were four (4) staff on the unit.  Staff were \nvery happy and said that there have been less incidents than in the past.   \n \nLHS/CLS continue to have less of an institutional feel and the overall atmosphere is as good as the \nlast site visit. Staff and youth continue to make positive comments and have positive attitudes. The \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 6 of 36\n \nbiggest complaint from youth this visit was the food, canteen out of stock items, and being bored. \nYouth did not complain to the Monitor about phone restrictions or perceived unfairness of points \nearned this visit. They did complain to Plaintiffs’ counsel about those staff members who were \nperceived as being quick to deny them points or provoking them and, as youth put it, seemed not to \nwant the youth to succeed, while they appreciated staff who worked with them to succeed.  Two new \nphones were installed on each of the living units which has allowed more access for youth. \nDefendants have done an excellent job of essentially eliminating phone restrictions as recommended.  \nIn September 2019, there were twenty-seven (27) restrictions and in November there were two (2). \nA year ago, there were as many as 109 phone restrictions in a month.  Leadership understands the \nimportance of family engagement in the overall well-being of youth. Youth also did not complain \nabout the quality of canteen/prices as they did during the last visit.  During the last visit, the Monitor \nbrought up the youth complaints about the new vendor, cost of canteen, and the impact on \nprogramming.  The Defendants were able to address these issues quickly and discussed canteen \nduring four youth advisory groups (reflected in the group notes).  \n \nAlthough there seems to be more programming during school days and school hours, there is still a \nlack of structured programming in the evening and on weekends, and for youth whose classes are \ncancelled due to teacher absences. While youth are out of their rooms there should be engaging \nactivities for the youth.  This is extremely noticeable and needed during the weekends when school \nis not in session and no other programs are occurring, and staff also stated that there was no \nreplacement programming for youth when teachers were absent.  Youth are bored and while being \nout of their rooms is certainly an improvement, more meaningful activities and weekend programs \nwould also help reduce the risk of youth engaging in anti-social behaviors when they have little \nelse to do Youth need more to do than simply sitting in the dayroom area watching television or \nplaying cards.  The data shows, and the Monitor observed, a high level of self-confinement.  There \nneeds to be a bigger focus on reducing youth idleness and more structured programming should be \nput into place.  In an effort to develop more activities, Defendants implemented a “Youth Activities \nCommittee” in October 2019.  The purpose is to develop staff-directed activities. Defendants \nanticipate incorporating the Committee’s suggestions into programming in the near future.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nDuring this reporting period, there have been a few staffing changes. As previously reported, in \nAugust  2019,  Defendants  hired  a  new  Administrator  to  oversee  the  Division  of  Juvenile \nCorrections.   Additionally, a new Deputy Administrator has been hired during this reporting \nperiod. The Monitor had the opportunity to meet the new music recreation worker. He is passionate \nabout his work and the youth absolutely love working with him and enjoy the music program that \nis being developed. The addition of the music recreation worker is having a positive impact on \nprogramming.  One of the two Psychologist Supervisors at LHS/CLS recently took a new position \nat another DOC facility. The Defendants are actively recruiting for her replacement. \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has improved from the last site visit. There have been \nthirty-nine (39) new direct-care staff hired during this reporting period. There are 311 total \npositions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS. Based on population, Defendants determined that they need three \n(3) fewer teacher FTEs and thus moved the FTEs to other critical positions. Approximately 153 of \nthese positions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  \nThrough  collaboration  with  the  12-hour  committee  comprised  of  the  Security  Director, \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 7 of 36\n \nSupervising Youth Counselors, and Youth Counselors, the Youth Counselor and Youth Counselor \nAdvanced posts were re-evaluated.  It was determined that there was a need to reallocate the \nnumber of positions in each of these two classifications (as indicated below). There is still a large \nnumber of staff on various leaves of absence (FMLA/Workers’ Comp, etc.) The teacher vacancy \nrate remains high but with very slight improvement over the last five months. Recruiting is still a \nchallenge due to the location of the facility, overall teacher shortages, relatively low compensation, \nand the year-round school calendar. This is directly and negatively impacting education for youth. \nAs previously mentioned, the entire educational program at LHS/CLS needs to be evaluated and \nimproved. \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of   Vacancy Rate % as  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of  \nMarch 14, 2019  of May 31, 2019  Sept. 6, 2019  January 30, 2020 \nYouth   15% (16 out of 105)  11.5% (12 out of 105)  14% (15 out of 105)  7% (8 of 115) \nCounselor \nYouth  48% (24 out of 50)  50% (25 out of 50)  7% (3.5 out of 50)  15% (5.5 of 37.5) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  39% (11 of 28)  43% (12 of 28)  36% (10 of 28)  32% (8 of 25) \nSocial Worker  0% (14 of 14)  0% (14 of 14)  21.5% (3 of 14)  21 % (3 of 14) \n  \nIn order to address staffing challenges at LHS/CLS, effective April 28, 2019, security personnel \nbegan receiving a $5.00/hour add-on for worked hours and twelve (12) hour shifts were piloted in \nNovember 2019.  Although there has not been a data driven analysis of the 12-hour shift, there \nwas a very comprehensive staff survey completed. The majority of staff prefer this scheduling.  \nMost staff feel that their quality of life has improved.  Every staff person the Monitor spoke to said \nthey absolutely love the new schedule.  Staff reported that they work less hours and are not ordered \nto work extra shifts as much as they used to be, which has had a positive impact on their well-\nbeing. The Monitor made suggestions for an impact analysis of the new schedule.  \nThe Monitor spoke to over thirty-one (31) staff and the majority of staff seem relatively energetic \nand happy.  Many of the veteran staff stated that they believed the facility is making good progress, \nthey are beginning to feel safer and things are improving.  There were a lot of new staff shadowing \non the units (on the job training). The vast majority of staff again expressed the desire to have more \nprogramming for youth.  The new staff really liked their job and said it was better than they thought \nit would be. They all said that they felt the training they received and, most importantly, the OJT \non the units, sufficiently prepared them for the work.  Staff were adjusting well to the new RFID \nsystem and were very happy that they did not have to track youth movement/confinement on paper \nanymore. Also, staff felt they are adjusting very well to the elimination of OC spray. Staff also \nrealize the need to continue building new skills that will help them manage and respond to youth \nbehaviors more positively and enable them to more effectively de-escalate youth.  Staff were very \nopen to talking to the Monitor and genuinely seemed to enjoy their jobs.  In response to the \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 8 of 36\n \nMonitor’s previous reports, the administration conducted Situational Awareness Training (a POSC \nupdate training) focused on alternative techniques to prevent and address behavioral problems \nprovided to staff in July, August, and September.  There have also been several trainings on suicide \nprevention and MANDT training. The facility plans to continue to focus on training. Staff are \nadjusting very well to the changes occurring. In the Monitor’s conversation with staff, staff did not \nraise issues with the elimination of punitive confinement, OC spray, and phone restrictions, or with \nthe new RFID system, open day rooms, or the 12-hour shift.  \nThe Defendants have implemented almost all of the recommendations for staff wellness including \nincreased training, staff recognition program, engaging staff in developing programming and policy \nchanges, actively participating in youth and family council meetings, reducing ordering of staff \n(mandated overtime), and constructing a relaxing staff lounge. The Monitor continues to stress the \nneed to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving forward.  \nAs part of the agency and facility’s desire to improve conditions for both staff and youth, they are \ncontinuing to engage in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”), which was explained \nin the previous Monitor reports.  The third YICPM site visit took place November 14-15, 2019.  \nDJC leadership, LHS/CLS managers, and other staff participated.  The DJC/facility has finalized \nplans  to  use  their  remaining  subject  matter  expert  (“SME”)  days  on  training,  leadership \ndevelopment and staff capacity to operationalize a treatment practice environment/model.  The \nmultidisciplinary team reviewed national best practices, discussed family engagement, healthy \nenvironments, youth voiced supporting staff, addressing racial and ethnic disparities, behavior \nmotivation, crisis intervention and management, and education. The Monitor looks forward to the \nagency implementing these plans to improve conditions of confinement for youth and well-being \nof staff. \nThe Defendants are also collaborating with Massachusetts Department of Youth Services to \nexplore Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (“DBT”) as a behavior management system. Defendants \nalso reached out to an expert on Trauma and Brain Development in order to enhance training and \nprogramming for youth and staff. In September, there was a Reentry Simulation during National \nReentry Week. The program simulates the first month in the life of a youth after release from \nprison.  The simulation is set to show the various difficulties a youth encounters post-release. The \nsimulation also helps staff empathize with the anxiety and struggles youth experienced. There were \nthirty-six (36) boys and ten (10) girls that completed the whole program. The goal is to continue \nto do the simulations more regularly in the future since the feedback was positive from staff and \nyouth. \n \nThe Monitor suggested modifying the mental health (PSU) and recreational staff work schedules \nto include more evening and weekend hours. PSU staff work until 8 p.m. during the week and are \non-call 24/7. The Defendants should continue to involve PSU staff, especially leadership, in \nmaking improvements at the facility (such as improvements to incentives, consequences, and \nworking with the OJOR system). Currently, there is a PSU staff member who comes in each \nweekend to perform rounds, finish notes, and intakes (four hours) and will report to the facility as \nneeded.  However,  there  are  no  groups  or  programming  involving  PSU  on  the  weekends.  \nWeekends are when there is the most idle time.  There really is a missed opportunity for PSU \ninvolvement during this period.   \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 9 of 36\n \nIn addition, documentation indicates that there is a relatively high rate of transferring youth from \nLHS to Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center (MJTC). Criteria for when such transfers are deemed \nappropriate should be clear and written in policy and procedure. The Monitor recommends that the \nfacility obtain a mental health expert to evaluate the programming, staffing, and services that exist \nat LHS/CLS, and make recommendations on how to address the issues raised and improve \ntreatment and services for youth at LHS/CLS. \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nAs previously reported, to address the need for a quality assurance and improvement program, the \nDefendants have created and filled both QA positions.  The Monitor has had the pleasure of \nspending time with these individuals over the last five months.  The Monitor will be focusing on \nassisting the team with their data collection and QA program.  The goal continues to be not only \nassessing compliance with this Court Order, but the quality and adequacy of the social and \nrecreational  programming  provided, healthcare,  education, environmental  health, safety,  and \ndiscipline.  \nDuring this site visit, the Monitor spent a lot of time going over data including the Performance \nbased Standards (“PbS”) from the October data collection cycle. The Defendants have created a \n“Quality Assurance Review” process that is completed each month.  A framework for identified \noutcome measures was developed to align with PbS national benchmarks.  In the interim, an \nIncident Statistics report from J-Tracker is provided to leaders to capture various types of incidents. \nKey monthly data is now being shared with leadership relating to youth fights/assaults, horseplay \nresulting in injuries, youth on staff assaults, use of force incidents, and workers’ comp injuries \nreported. Searches are now documented in J-Tracker and search reports are created and reviewed. \nAs reported in the fourth report, a vendor has been awarded a contract for an electronic rounds \nsystem (RFID). The system is up and running and a staff directive has been provided.  QA and \npolicy still need to be developed, but this electronic system will make LHS/CLS safer. Staff and \nyouth should be commended for embracing this upgrade, which is a significant change to how \nsafety/security checks and other youth movement and programming is and will be documented \nand analyzed.  \n \nPbS data collection cycles occur twice annually, in April and October.  Facility Improvement Plans \n(“FIP”) have been created after the most recent PbS Coach Site Visit and has been forwarded to the \nMonitor.  PbS is a continuous data-driven improvement model grounded in research that holds \njuvenile justice agencies, facilities and residential care providers to the highest standards for \noperations, programs and services.  The FIPs are the vehicles for jurisdictions to continuously \nbring about meaningful change. They bridge the gap between understanding and actions to \nimprove the conditions of confinement at a facility, beginning with identifying the specific \noutcome measure(s) a facility want to improve. The FIP process provides the facility with the \nability to track progress towards identified outcome goals, and receive scores based on that \nperformance and identified FIP goals. \n \nFIP Action Steps \nPbS offers a 7-action step tool, driven by a research-informed improvement model, to support and \nguide PbS participating agencies and facilities as they work to achieve both incremental and \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 10 of 36\n \nsustainable change. The action steps entered into the PbS website make up the team's concrete plan \nto attain the improvement you are seeking. \n \n1.  Analysis of Performance  \n•  Pinpoint the causes of your outcome performance. \n2.  Creating Buy-In  \n•  Identify how you will engage those whose support you need to improve the targeted \noutcome or area of change. \n3.  Setting Outcome Measure Goal  \n•  Create short, interim & long-term goals that provide benchmarks and a vision to \nwork toward. \n4.  Improvement Process Action Steps  \n•  Develop concrete, measurable actions to address the factors that contributed to your \noutcome performance. \n5.  Interim Measures  \n•  Identify how you will monitor your progress toward your goals to see what is \nworking and adjust your strategies as necessary. \n6.  Sustaining Performance  \n•  Identify strategies that will support what is working to ensure sustainable change. \n7.  Performance Recognition  \n•  Determine how you will formally and informally recognize staff, youth and other \nstakeholders for their contribution to the improvement process; celebrate successes! \nThe following outcome measures were selected for these FIPs based on input from the PbS Coach \nand facility outcome: \nLHS Facility Improvement Plan #1010 \nOutcome Measure \nSafety 02 Injuries to youths per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \nSafety 03 Injuries to staff per 100 \nstaff-days of employment. \nSafety 04 Injuries to youths by \nother youths per 100 person-days of \nyouth confinement. \nSafety 11 Assaults and fights on \nyouth per 100 person-days of youth \nconfinement. \nSafety 12 Assaults on staff per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 11 of 36\n \nCLS Facility Improvement Plan # 1009 \nOutcome Measure \nOrder 08 Isolation, room \nconfinement, segregation/special \nmanagement unit use per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement.  \nDuring the site visit, a thorough and in-depth review was conducted of the October PbS data \ncollection for both LHS and CLS.  During the review, outcome measure data clarification and input \nwas sought from both the facility PbS Site Coordinator and the assigned PbS Coach.  As a result of \nthe review, the following highlights and outcomes are noted: \n \nPbS Data Quality – Some issues were identified as to the quality of the data entered for some \noutcome measures, including outcomes measuring around daily activity durations.  It should be \nnoted that that both LHS and CLS chose to only record unit activity data for a period of one week, \nrather than for the entire month of October, thereby somewhat skewing the data.   This is particularly \ntrue for this data cycle, because the one week in October during which data was collected coincided \nwith the elimination of OC spray and several serious incidents occurred at the facility during the \nweek in question. The facilities have not since experienced similar incidents of this magnitude. \nThe facilities should try to follow the PbS instructions for the interactive Unit Logs which states, \n“Enter one Unit Log survey for each living unit in your facility. For this survey, collect and track \ndaily hours minimally for seven consecutive days during the data collection period. Tracking hours \nfor the entire data collection month is preferred. Report activities for what the majority of youths \non the unit are participating in.”  \n \nThe categories are: \n \nEducation  Other Facility Programs \nLeisure Activity  Unit in Sleeping Rooms \nRecreation Activity  Operational Activity \nThe issues with most of these data points appears to be around unit and area documentation.  For \nexample, there is a discrepancy between the education hours reflected in the PbS activity data with \nwhat the school believes should be the correct number of hours a youth is in school. The number of \nhours fluctuates greatly between units and between boys and girls.  At LHS, the average number of \neducation hours per day is 2.49 hours, with the highest number of hours being reported by the \nDuBois Unit, 4.00 hours, and the lowest reported by the Roosevelt Unit, at 1.86 hours per day.  At \nCLS, the average number of education hours is reported at just 2.14 hours per day.  The school \nprincipal stated that these hours are incorrect and do not reflect the actual hours youth are attending \nschool. Since this continues to be a discrepancy in the data, further verification of school data is \nnecessary. \nAdditionally,  the  unit  activity  record  for  the  Krueger  Unit  reflects  that  youth  are  spending \napproximately 20.64 hours per day in their rooms (10.5 hours reflected as sleeping time and 10.14 \nhours reflected as “in sleeping rooms,” room confinement).  The activity log for the Krueger Unit \nalso did not reflect any hours for education.  During discussion with the facility and the PbS Coach, \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 12 of 36\n \nit was learned that the data for the activity logs was taken as a one-week snapshot.  It is possible \nthat this particular week did not reflect a “normal” course of activity for the Krueger Unit, however, \nit is the data currently available through PbS and is as entered by the facility. \nFinally, both sites should work closely with the PbS Coach in order to better address the required \ndata collection for Unit logs going forward for the Interactive Reports to be useful to the sites and \nto the Monitor.  It will take a good understanding of the definitions of each category and all \nprogram areas working together to assure comprehensive reporting and data quality. A reminder \nis that the Unit log looks at what the majority of the residents on each unit are doing during waking \nhours.  The Monitor urges the facility to work more towards reporting data for the entire data \ncollection month in order to get a clearer picture of daily activity in order to better monitor idleness \nissues.  \n \nUse of Restraint Outcome Measures - Both LHS and CLS show “0” incidents of use of chemical \nagents (Order 6) during the October 2019 data collection cycle, which is commendable and per the \nSettlement Agreement.  However, the rate of physical restraints (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use \nper 100 person days of confinement) has increased somewhat at both LHS and CLS as has the rate \nof mechanical restraint (Order 4 – Mechanical Restraint use per 100 person days of confinement) \nincidents.  More remarkable is the higher rate of both Order 3 and Order 4 occurring at the CLS \nwith the girls.   \n \n(Note: PbS defines Physical Restraints as facility authorized and trained holds used by staff to \nsubdue an otherwise uncontrollable youth in order to prevent the youth from injuring him or \nherself, or others.  Mechanical Restraints: Mechanical devices used to prevent an uncontrollable \nyouth from injuring him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints may only be used for short \nperiods of time and must be used under medical supervision.) \nAlso, during the discussions around the use of restraint incidents, facility staff remarked that they \nhad reduced the use of the Care Teams during recent months and this resulted in a higher number \nof restraint-usage incidents.  Care Teams are designed precisely to reduce the need for the use of \nrestraints and have been effectively shown to work at facilities across the country and have been \nshown to be effective at LHS and CLS as well. It also appears that Administrative Confinement \n(AC) has increased as a result of a reduced Care Team effort. The Monitoring team reviewed several \nincidents in which a Care Team response would most likely have resulted in a different outcome.  \nThe Department should more systemically implement the core principles of the Care Team model by \nutilizing an agency strategic plan process that involves additional staff training in de-escalation \ntechniques; include Care Team deployment information in shift debriefings in order to review the \nprocess and provide on-going situational training for staff;  implement a Care Team response incident \nreport that also reflects the outcome of the response in order to better track outcomes from Care Team \ndeployments; implement the S.O.D.A.S model (Situation, Options, Disadvantages, Advantages, \nSolution) into the Care Team model; and, finally, the facility leadership team should incorporate \ndaily/weekly review of all use of force/restraint incidents to evaluate if and when the Care Team \nshould have been activated to help de-escalate a situation.  This should be used as a staff training and \nawareness process to help staff build new skills and to help change their mindsets in how they first \nreact to certain types of youth behaviors. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 13 of 36\n \nIsolation, Room Confinement and Segregation Measures – Overall, the PbS outcome measures \naround isolation and room confinement are improved over the April 2019 PbS data collection cycle \nreflecting over 83.82% of room confinements are terminated in under eight hours, and slightly fewer \nin under four hours, 80.15%. These are both very commendable achievements, and both are slightly \nbetter than the national field averages for these outcome measures.  However, where we see an issue \nis around Order 13 – Isolation, Room Confinement for reasons not related to behavior.  These \nappear to primarily be incidents where youth are refusing to participate in programs and education. \nAs you can see from the following chart, self-requested and declined to participate in programs \ninvolves 81% of the non-behavior related confinement incidents. There were 112 (12%) recorded \nincidents during the month of October where youth declined programing/education.  \n \nValue  Count  Percent \nSelf-requested  748  79% \nDeclined to participate in program  112  12% \nProtect other youths or staff  77  8% \nConsequence for rule violation  4  0% \nProtect property  1  0% \nGive youth time to cool off  1  0% \nOne youth accounted for 50 confinements and two other youth accounted for 32 confinements each \nduring the month of October.  It would seem based on the above data that the majority of these 114 \nconfinement incidents from these three youth were self-requested and/or declined to participate in \nprograms. Increased and more meaningful programming, less idle time, and increased involvement \nof mental health staff would certainly improve and help reduce incidents of self-requested and \ndeclined to participate confinement incidents.  \nThe PbS Incident reporting data for October reflects the following important data points: \n➢  19% of the incidents occurred in the Roosevelt Unit; \n➢  17% of the incidents occurred in the Rogers Unit; \n➢  95% of all incidents occurred within a living unit; \n➢  84% of incidents involved some form of an “assault;” and  \n➢  83% of incidents involved “failure to comply.” \nYouth and Staff Climate Surveys – Both youth and staff appear to be more responsive in utilizing \nthe youth and staff climate surveys.  It is strongly recommended that both department and facility \nleadership take the time to thoroughly review the agency/jurisdiction count summaries for both the \nyouth and staff climate surveys.  The results can be very insightful and useful for leadership.  Below \nare some of the survey results that the Monitor found most useful to be included in this report. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 14 of 36\n \nStaff Climate Survey Results: \n \nIn your opinion, what would make this facility safer? \nValue  Count  Percent \nMore staff  121  78% \nSafety equipment  86  55% \nTraining  67  43% \nOther  65  42% \nLess overcrowding  33  21% \nIn regard to the above chart, the following are the top ten most requested training that staff felt \nwould make the facility safer: \n \nWhat training would you like to see? \nValue  Count  Percent \nVerbal de-escalation  75  48% \nSafety and security  60  39% \nGang training  51  33% \nAdolescent development  48  31% \nGeneral behavior management  48  31% \nAgency policies and procedures  46  30% \nEthics  45  29% \nAppropriate staff/youth relationships  42  27% \nCommunication  41  26% \nCultural diversity and awareness  41  26% \n \nOctober 2019 PbS Staff Climate Survey Results: \n➢  79% of staff responses reported they fear for their safety (it is important to note here that the \nstaff surveys were last conducted in October 2019); \n➢  83% of responses reported they believe the facility is unsafe or very dangerous; \n➢  83% of responses indicate that staff believe they do not have authority to discipline youth \nappropriately. \n➢  It is important to note that the week in October during which PbS data was collected was a \ntemporary period in which there were several disturbances, and may not accurately reflect the \ncurrent fear levels (as indicated by interviews with staff during the site visit) \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 15 of 36\n \n \nJanuary 2020 DOC/DJC Staff Survey Results: \n➢  Since switching to the 12-hour shifts, 77% of staff strongly agree, agree, or somewhat agree that health \nand safety has improved for themselves and their co-workers. \n➢  82% of staff strongly agree, agree, or somewhat agree that the change has had a positive impact on their well-\nbeing.  \n➢  78% of staff strongly agree, agree, or somewhat agree that job satisfaction has improved for themselves \nand their co-workers.   \n \nYouth Climate Survey Results: \n \nDo you fear for your safety in this facility? \nValue  Count  Percent \nNo  28  44% \nYes  28  44% \nNot recorded  6  9% \nRefuse to answer  2  3% \n \nIn comparison, the youth fear for safety measure, Safety 13, has steadily improved from the \nprevious two data collection cycles.  The rate still remains higher than the national field average \nbut is improving. \n \nWithin the last six months at this facility, have you been beaten up or threatened with being \nbeaten up? \nValue  Count  Percent \nYes  31  48% \nNo  25  39% \nNot recorded  6  9% \nRefuse to answer  2  3% \n \n➢  52% of youth responded that they do not understand their legal rights; \n➢  96% responded that they know and understand the behavior management points system and \nknow their levels; \n➢  55% reported have received a family visit. \n \nThere needs to be a continued focus on adequacy and quality of the data collected and analysis of \nother subjects of the Court Order.  Defendants need to make this a priority.  Defendants should \nalso pay particular attention to each Facility Improvement Plan as each FIP includes a section for \ncomments relating to the implementation status of each action step completed by the PbS Site \nCoordinator or assigned staff member. Ongoing FIP review comments are entered by Facility \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 16 of 36\n \nAdministrators, Agency Directors and the assigned PbS Coach.  This is an excellent way to for the \nagency and facility leadership to monitor on-going progress with each of the FIP goals and to \nprovide input, guidance and direction during the process. \nPolicies and Procedures  \n \nThere have not been many revisions made to policy and procedure since the last site visit.  The \npolicy for the Rapid Response Team (900.05.04) has been revised. Administrative Codes have not \nprogressed and have not been finalized.  There have been several staff directives issued including \none for the new RFID system, behavior management approach, and staff check lists. All policies \nrefer to the Administrative Code and thus modifications to the Administrative Code should \ncontinue to be a priority. Interim policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be \ndeveloped.  Policies relevant to LHS/CLS need to be compliant with the federal court order and \nshould contain a quality assurance section for every policy. Defendants should continue to update \npolicy and procedures because without updated policies and procedures, which include quality \nassurance measures, substantial compliance with the court order cannot be achieved.    \nCompetency post-tests have been created for MANDT (de-escalation), visual monitoring, and \nobservation checks. There is now a final academy exam that requires short answer/short essay \nresponse in key areas and include scenario-based application of knowledge.  All security staff \nreceive one year of field training officer support.  \nThere has been more formalized training that includes employee signoffs acknowledging receipt \nand understanding of policies and procedures.  Effective proficiency testing for all training classes \nstill needs to be developed. The Monitor will continue to work with the Defendants on policy and \nprocedure. \nYouth Interviews  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and the Monitor conducted several youth interviews. Approximately forty-two \n(42) youth were interviewed during the site visit (formally and informally). As in the previous two \nvisits, there were significantly less requests to talk with the Monitor, although the number of \nrequests to speak with Plaintiffs’ counsel was higher than during the prior visit. Previously, the \nmajor complaints from youth were the new canteen vendor, perceived unfairness in how the point \nsystem was applied, being cut off from the phone—and therefore often from family contact—as a \npunishment, and the desire to have more things to do. During this visit, by far the biggest complaint \nby the youth was being bored, the quality of the food and frequency of the same meals being \nserved.  The Monitor observed the meals served during the site visit, and they did not seem as \nappetizing as in the past.  The Defendants stated that they will address this issue and consider a 4-\n6-week menu.  The second most common complaint was that when selected canteen items were \nunavailable, this was not communicated to the youth, which would have enabled them to pick \nalternative items.  The Monitor suggested that LHS/CLS leadership continue to work with the \nvendor and the business office to fix this communication problem.  The youth work hard to earn \npoints and in turn, earn canteen privileges. Any issues with canteen should be fixed immediately. \nThe third most common complaint was that the RFID bands were uncomfortable (they are on the \nthicker side). The Monitor suggested speaking with the vendor to see if there are any tweaks that \ncan be made.  It also might just take time for youth to adjust to the bands in general.   The \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 17 of 36\n \noverwhelming majority continue to report that they are rarely confined, if at all, were not restrained \nthat much, and were not strip searched. Youth liked that there was a single behavioral management \nsystem because it is easier to understand. Youth earn points daily and they like that aspect of it, \nalthough, as noted above, youth raised concerns with Plaintiffs’ counsel about some staff members \nwho they felt were quick to deny points or fail to try to help them succeed. Youth reported that they \nhad recreation often which they enjoyed. Youth also really liked the new music program and staff \nmember. Youth did not complain about unit and room searches like they had previously.   \nThere were a few who discussed certain situations and the Monitor investigated the allegations \nduring and after the site visit. As evidenced by documentation and discussions with youth on \nKrueger, starting in October confinement was reinstituted for split halls, counts, shift change, and \nmedication pass. The Monitor recommended that the Defendants resume open day rooms and stop \nconfining youth for operational convenience.  The Defendants assured the Monitor that they will \nmodify the program accordingly and the Monitor will evaluate that at the next visit.  \n \nDefendants continue to offer more programming however, there is still too much idle time especially \nduring the evenings and weekend. Defendants are and should continue to identify more resources \nand continue to implement the programs as recommended by the retained experts.  \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree. As previously stated, \nthere is a challenge with adequacy of data for many areas (documentation, accuracy, consistency, \nand analysis) thus, some sections do not contain a detailed narrative.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the Court Order into \npolicy and procedure –and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach substantial \ncompliance.   \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 18 of 36\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Based on data and youth interviews, \nmost youth are not being confined for three days, although there appear to be some isolated \nexamples of this occurring. If Defendants improve their quality of data and documentation \nand incorporate the Court Order into policy and procedure – and if and if they ensure that \nno youth are being confined for three or more days, they will reach substantial compliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Although Defendants do not call it \n“punitive confinement” there have been instances where youth were confined for punitive \nreasons. There were a few significant group disturbances in early Fall of 2019 that led to the \nDefendants confining youth for reasons that do not meet the administrative confinement \ndefinition. in that youth were being confined after some threat or misbehavior that did not \nconstitute  (or  continue  to  constitute)  an  imminent  threat.  The  Monitor  recommended \ncreating policy which clearly outlines the criteria for administrative confinement so that staff \ncannot punitively confine youth.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only  be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he \nor  she  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During this reporting period, there \nwere instances in which administrative confinement was being used for youth who did not \npose a serious risk of imminent physical harm. It also appeared that, rather than releasing \nyouth from confinement “immediately” – i.e., as soon as they no longer pose a risk - \nDefendants are in many instances generally treating four hours as a default minimum period \nfor administrative confinement (and in some cases quite a bit longer). The Monitor suggested \nhow to document this requirement in policy and in forms as well as made suggestions to place \nyouth in the day room once they no longer pose a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. According to the data collected, administrative confinement has increased during this \nreporting period.  \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 19 of 36\n \nDuring  the  last  site  visit,  the  Monitor  suggested  alternatives  to  confinement  for \nadministrative purposes such as med pass, counts, shift change, and split hall time. Most \nyouth serve the administrative confinement on their home unit. Some youth are serving their \nconfinement on Krueger and are referred to the “Krueger Program.” The Krueger Program \nhas been modified based on some of the Monitor’s recommendations, but there is still more \nrefinement that needs to happen.  The Supervisor of the unit has developed a comprehensive \nprogram and is very receptive to suggested changes by the Monitor. Although youth have \nbehavioral plans developed, the program needs to be improved to include more robust \nbehavioral plans and the plans need to be revisited with more frequency should a youth not \nbe able to return to the home unit in an appropriate period of time.  The Monitor also \nsuggested that the Defendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a youth to move through \nlevels 1 and 2 and that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the criteria for referral into \nthe program as well as criteria for exiting the program.  The Monitor also suggested allowing \nyouth  on  levels  1  and  2  to  attend  school  in  the  school  area  and  participate  in  other \nprogramming if their behavior warrants.   \n \nThe Monitor spent time with PSU and discussed providing “intensive mental health services \ndesigned  to  return  the  youth  safely  to  the  general  population.”  There  is  a  lack  of \ndocumentation  as  to  this  provision making  it  difficult  for  the  Monitor  to  fully  assess \ncompliance. Policy and procedure and a quality assurance review process needs to be \nimplemented, and documentation needs to be streamlined and improved.  The Monitor \nsuggested that the Defendants retain a mental health expert to evaluate the program and \nmake recommendations to, among other things, ensure these services are being provided.   \nReview of the sampling of reports from the new RFID system show most 30-minute checks \nare being completed in compliance with the Court Order. \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There was a significant number of \nyouth confined for over four (4) hours this reporting period.  Specifically: \n \nAugust:   4 youth  \nSeptember:   39 youth  \nOctober:   29 youth \nNovember:  16 youth  \nDecember:   16 youth. \nMany of these confinements reported and documented that youth remained on AC despite \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 20 of 36\n \nPSU’s recommendation of removal.  With this said, Defendants are now accurately capturing \nconfinement time, number total placements, average confinement time per month, and \nnumber of days without AC placements. This is a huge improvement in data collection.  \nDefendants now need to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring they are following this Court \nOrder, draft policy and procedure with AC placement criteria, and continue to QA this data. \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During the last site visit, generally, \nyouth who were in administrative confinement were in the Krueger program.  This has \nchanged in that now most youth serve the administrative confinement on their home unit \nwhich is a positive step. Some youth are serving their confinement on Krueger and are \nreferred to the “Krueger Program.” The Krueger Program has been modified based on some \nof the Monitor’s recommendations, but there is still more refinement that needs to happen.  \nAlthough youth have behavioral plans developed, the program needs to be improved to \ninclude more robust behavioral plans and the plan needs to be revisited with more frequency \nshould a youth not be able to return to general population promptly.   \n \nThe Monitor also suggested that the Defendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a \nyouth to move through levels 1 and 2 and that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the \ncriteria for referral into the program.  Defendants need to improve their quality of data and \ndocumentation and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure and train staff \naccordingly. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \np.m. to 8 a.m.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were eleven (11) youth in AC \nfor more than 24 hours. Data shows only two (2) youth were transferred to another facility \nunder a commenced plan which left nice (9) instances in which this provision was violated. \nDefendants  need  to  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  for  ensuring  compliance  with  this \nprovision in all cases.  Defendants need to improve their quality of data and documentation \nwith respect to the “commenced plan” and incorporate the Court Order into policy and \nprocedure. \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 21 of 36\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated.  The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. A quality \nassurance mechanism needs to be finalized. \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. The Monitor recommended that Defendants replace the \nexisting room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for \nsecure environments.  The Defendants have completed the renovations in five living units \n(Wells, Miller, Black Elk, DuBois and Curtis) with a plan for completion of the other \ncottages in the last quarter of the year. The new replacement furniture is consistent with \nwhat the Monitor would expect to see in a secure facility and should certainly reduce the \nopportunity for suicidal incidents within the youth rooms. This is a huge investment by \nDefendants and shows their commitment to complying with this provision. \nThe Monitor did not observe rooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of \nthe room. Room searches are taking place more often and documented, and staff can \nclearly see the youth through the window.  \nSafety/welfare documentation show that room checks are being completed at least every \n30 minutes and are staggered in the majority of cases. Defendants have purchased, \ninstalled, and are using the new electronic system in all the units.  Staff have adjusted to \nthe new system very well and stated that this new electronic system is much easier to use \nthan  the  paper  documentation.    Prior  to  implementing  the  new  electronic  system, \nDefendants had to use additional personnel to ensure that the checks were being done in \naccordance to policy and procedure. The new system is much less staff intensive, is easily \nmonitored, and creates a safer environment for staff and youth.  Defendants need to \nmodify their policy and procedure related to safety/welfare checks.  \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 22 of 36\n \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues \nto recommend increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every \n15  minutes  when  youth  are  confined  to  their  rooms  as  this  is  supported  by  JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \nDefendants should be commended for the vast improvement on these safety/welfare \nchecks and for investing in the technology needed. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain about \naccess to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage.  If Defendants improve their \nquality of data and documentation, and incorporate  the Court Order into policy and \nprocedure, they will be in substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The time PSU responded and \nwhat crisis intervention technique was used should be documented.  Also, since PSU staff \nare not physically present on weekends and some evening hours (outside of the four hours \nthey are required to do), the Monitor is unsure how PSU staff are engaging youth in a \nmeaningful way.  A quality assurance program needs to be developed and documentation \nshould be streamlined.  As previously stated, the Monitor suggests that the Defendants \nconsider utilizing an expert in order to further develop the mental health program at \nLHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 23 of 36\n \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  requested  any \ndocumentation  indicating  that  confinement  is  contraindicated  and  there  were  no \ninstances documented during this review period. There is a form “Psychology Input for \nSecurity Decision” which is where the contraindication would be documented and there \nis a policy (Policy 500.70.04). \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Safety/Welfare  checks  have \nsignificantly improved. Safety/welfare documentation show that room checks are being \ncompleted  at  least  every  30  minutes  and  are  staggered  in  most  cases.  The  agency \nimplemented an electronic, software-based rounds checking system- RFID. Prior to the \nnew electronic system, Defendants have provided additional personnel to ensure that the \nchecks  are  being  done  in  accordance  to  policy  and  procedure  and  modified  the \ndocumentation as suggested by the Monitor.  There are also regular quality assurance \nreviews in order to increase compliance. Following an internal review of documentation, \nrandom days and times across all units and shifts are selected each month to perform \nauditing.  Any discrepancies are entered into the “Accountability Tracking” spreadsheet \nto help identify staff who need more training/assistance/discipline.  \nThere was no formal discipline or “Letters of Expectation” during this reporting period.  \nThere were 16 job instructions given during this reporting period. PSU staff do visit youth \ndaily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone.  \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing \nthe frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. Defendants should be commended for the \nvast improvement on these safety/welfare checks and for implementing the electronic \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 24 of 36\n \nsystem as quickly as they did. Staff should also be commended for embracing this new \nsystem.   \n \nf.   Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary in \nnature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and implemented.  \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is a lack of documentation \nas to this provision. Social worker visits, mental health services, and other health services \nare provided in general.  Documentation, quality assurance, and policy and procedure \nneed to be improved/completed in order for the Monitor to fully assess compliance.  \n \nii.  Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Youth’s participation in Skills \nStreaming is tracked across sessions and reported to the youth’s Social Worker and OJOR \nfor consideration, but there is an overall lack of documentation as to specific programming \nthat occurs daily. Staff did confirm that youth in Krueger phase 1 and 2 receive PSU-led \nsmall group sessions and evidence-based cognitive behavioral treatment in the form of \nSkills Streaming rather than receiving the same closed group treatment programming that \nwas scheduled or in progress on their home unit.  \n  \niii.   Educational services with the general population to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 25 of 36\n \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Educational  Services  for  general \npopulation occur in the classrooms in the school area (although there is also an increase in the \nuse of online instruction). Youth in the Targeted Intervention Program (“TIP”) attend classes \nin the school area but separate from the general population. Youth in Krueger do not receive \neducational services in the school area (except for youth on Phase 3) but remain on the living \nunit.  The PbS data also showed almost no schooling for youth in Krueger, education hours \nvaried by unit, and fewer average daily hours of instruction for girls than for boys. It is \nunclear whether that is a consistent pattern or only occurred because of the situation the \nweek data was collected, but this is concerning and should be monitored and improved. \nAdditionally, during the last reporting period and for all but two days of this reporting period, \nadministration decided to move the girls’ educational services out of the traditional school \narea and into a building with fewer amenities and facilities than the main school. The \nDefendants did resume the girls’ education in the main school two days before the site visit \nwhich is a positive change.  The girls really enjoy getting out of their cottage and into the main \nschool and that should be continued. The Monitor recommends that all youth regardless of \nstatus have education in the school area.  The Defendants should further engage the education \nexpert  to  make  further  recommendations  that  should  be  implemented,  including  an \nassessment of the quality and benefits of the online education system Defendants are using. \nDefendants should implement the recommendations made by the educational consultant, \nincluding those in the June 1, 2019 memorandum to LHS/CLS. The Defendants also need \nto focus on bringing more programming into LHS/CLS, especially programming culturally \nrelevant and specific to the race and genders of the youth who are at the facility.  \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  “Out  time”  has  significantly \nimproved over the last year.  In general, youth are out of their rooms from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  \n(with the exceptions in Krueger discussed previously). The Monitor regularly saw youth \nconversing with other youth and staff during out time.  In youth interviews, youth stated that \nthey are not really confined to their rooms at all. However, the data shows that a large number \nof youth are self-confining.  This is a concern for the Monitor.  Youth still want more \nstructured activities when they are out of their rooms and feel they do not really do anything, \nwhich continues to be a significant problem and could lead to self-confining.  More refinement \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 26 of 36\n \nto the Krueger Program also needs to occur as discussed during the site visit, such as \neliminating confinement for staff convenience (which Defendants stopped doing after the site \nvisit) and evaluating the length youth are on Levels 1 and 2.  Enhancing programs and \nmeaningful activities for the Krueger program should have a positive impact and allow for \nyouth to return to their home cottages more quickly. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most meals take place out of the \nroom.  Meals are now being documented for all youth (not just youth in Krueger as during \nthe last site visit).  Staff are now able to document when the meal is eaten in their room \nvoluntarily or staff imposed. The Monitor did not witness youth eating in their rooms but \nhas reviewed documentation in which youth are eating meals in their room.  Documentation \nhas improved from the last site visit and will further improve with the RFID system.  Policy \nand procedure need to incorporate this section of the Court Order. \nvi.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week in a large majority of the time. \nThis has significantly increased since confinement due to split halls, confinement for shift \nchange, counts, and medicine pass were discontinued (although as discussed above, the hours \nof confinement for youth on Krueger for these and other reasons, did increase after October \nand, based on the PbS data showing youth in their cells for more than 20 hours per day, \nwhich appears to have reduced out time to less than 30 hours per week on the Krueger Unit).  \nDocumentation and data collection need to be improved.   \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is now a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. The Monitor suggests that staff ask the youth \nto sign off that they were informed of their rights and were provided with written notice of \nhis/her rights.  There were 76 grievances filed by youth during the first three months of this \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 27 of 36\n \nreporting period (on a variety of issues, not just placement) and 9% were discipline related. \nThis indicates youth are aware of the grievance procedure and utilize it.  Defendants do have \na robust tracking system in place.  Defendants do analyze and have created measures for \nyouth grievances. The quality assurance piece needs to ensure grievances are being timely \nand appropriately addressed and communicated to youth.  \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth  is  placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis more consistently. Documentation needs to continue to be completed and consistently \napplied  to  all  situations.  Documentation,  data  collection  and  reliability,  and  quality \nassurance needs to continue to be improved. Also, documentation needs to be created that \nprove a youth was promptly provided with the report upon the completion of room \nconfinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated during this reporting period.  There needs to be continued focus on training, skills \ndevelopment and coaching, programming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.  This \nis a huge accomplishment by the agency and staff at LHS/CLS. \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  eliminated \nduring  this  reporting  period.    There  needs  to  be  continued  focus  on  training,  skills \ndevelopment and coaching, programming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.  This \nis a huge accomplishment by the agency and staff at LHS/CLS. \n \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 28 of 36\n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, but data and documentation show that \nthere  was  an  increase  in  use  of  mechanical  restraints  during  this  reporting  period. \nDefendants need to focus on reducing the use of mechanical restraints.  Defendants need to \ndocument and establish that there were not less restrictive means available and quality \nassurance measures and final policy and procedure are in place. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of mechanical restraints has \nincreased during this reporting period. Documentation shows that a few times youth were \nrestrained even when the youth were calm and compliant. Documentation needs to be \nimproved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm existed, and when and how \nthat decision is reviewed. If Defendants reduce the use of mechanical restraints, and develop \nbetter documentation and quality assurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The monitor is aware that the \ntransboard was used three times for one youth as authorized by PSU during the reporting \nperiod. With better documentation and quality assurance measures and continuing to focus \non  reducing  the  use  of  restraints,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving  substantial \ncompliance with this provision. \n \nii.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 29 of 36\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor is aware that a wrap \nhas been used during this reporting period three times. Note: Future use of the wrap should \nbe monitored and documented within monthly data reports as well as in the PbS data \ncollection cycles and, per PbS definitions, should be documented as “other” mechanical \nrestraint usage for outcome measure Order #5 – Other Restraint Use. Documentation has \nimproved relative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage.  With better \ndocumentation and quality assurance measures and continuing to focus on reducing the use \nof  restraints,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving  substantial  compliance  with  this \nprovision. \n \n iii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. It appears that in isolated cases, \nrestraints may have been used for discipline based on past behavior, when the youth was \ncalm  and  compliant.  If  Defendants  eliminate  such  uses  of  restraints,  with  better \ndocumentation, policy revisions, and quality assurance measures, Defendants may be close \nto achieving substantial compliance with this provision. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With better documentation, policy revisions, and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nf.   Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 30 of 36\n \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation. However, de-escalation training needs to be completed more often \n(regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue to develop this skill. These skills \nare  also  important  to  help  staff  identify  and  prevent  situations  which  might  lead  to \ndisruption  or altercations before such incidents occur Proper de-escalation cannot be \ntrained only once, or even only once a year. The Monitor continues to suggest having staff \nwho are very good at de-escalation work with staff who could use a refresher or with new staff \nespecially since a large majority are new.  \n \ng.   Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be left  alone in  restraints.   Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process itself is being \nanalyzed for improvement. New data will be available.  The length of time youth spend in \nrestraints is now being documented as part of the Incident Debrief process. If Defendants \nmaintain this, they will be close to achieving substantial compliance.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 31 of 36\n \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there are \nvery few occasions where youth are strip searched period and there is no evidence that strip \nsearches without probable cause are being done. The policy for searches needs to be finalized \nand QA developed. Defendants are close to being in substantial compliance. \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that strip \nsearching still occurs but on a much lesser frequency. Documentation shows there were less \nthan five (5) strip searches during this reporting period. Blanket strip searches of youth at \nintake or returning from court and hygiene checks have been completely eliminated. The \npolicy for searches needs to be finalized and QA developed. Defendants are close to being in \nsubstantial compliance. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved as to how staff are ensuring that unintended individuals cannot view the search \n(detail the area where search is occurring, state that there are no recording devices, and \ndocument who is present in the area, etc.) If documentation and policy revisions are made, \nsubstantial compliance can be obtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved detailing the area where search is conducted and how other youth cannot view the \nyouth being strip searched.  If documentation and policy revisions are made, substantial \ncompliance can be obtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation needs to be improved \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 32 of 36\n \nas to which staff conducted the search, that the search is by staff who is of the same gender \nidentity as the youth if the strip search is being conducted by someone other than a medical \nprofessional. The Monitor previously recommended form changes for documentation purposes. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that \nstaff have been trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor is told by direct care \nstaff that PSU is consulted. Documentation needs to be improved.  \n \n4.  Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  process  for  tracking  and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. With continued practices and QA developed, Defendants will be in \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most staff have been trained in \nMANDT and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. Several training \nsessions have occurred during this reporting period. The Monitor recommends increasing the \ntraining frequency for staff to increase their experience and skill levels in managing and de-\nescalating situations before they result in the use of force, restraint and/or isolation. The use \nof  force  review  process  continues  to  improve.    It  continues  to  be  more  thorough, \ncomprehensive, and timely. Corrective action plans when force was used where it could have \nbeen avoided are being done in most cases. The Monitor recommended in instances where de-\nescalation was successful, those examples should be used as a training tool for other staff \nincluding having other staff view the videos. \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 33 of 36\n \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of id le time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Many of the recommendations that \nwere made in the February 2018 technical assistance report have been implemented such as \nfamily events, yoga/Zumba, increased tournaments, dog therapy, more arts and music, \nwriting contests, living unit decorating contests, CREW. Youth advisory and family councils \nhave been implemented, regularly scheduled, and the Monitor’s recommendations have been \nincorporated  into  the  process  (agendas,  minutes,  frequency,  and  increased  staff \ninvolvement). Recreation leaders have been hired to focus on art and music. There have been \nmusical  instruments  purchased  and  music  lab  enhanced.    Although  there  were  more \nactivities for youth during this reporting period, there is still a significant amount of idle \ntime.  Now that youth are basically out of their rooms from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., there is a need \nfor more activities/programming. These activities/programming should be in addition to \nschool, not as a substitute for education.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and \nvolunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for youth.  There has been \nan activities committee established. Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured \nprogram and activity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours. As mentioned previously, \nincreasing education hours, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED, can \ngreatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development strategies \nthrough meaningful education and vocational programming.  \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants  shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most of the recommendations made \nin the February 2018 report have been implemented such as conducting a staffing analysis, \nhiring bonuses to obtain new staff, adjustment to schedules, staff break room, increased wages \nfor current staff, staff recognition, and several staff wellness initiatives. Defendants have \nclearly made staff wellness a priority and this is evident in my interactions with staff.   \nDefendants should continue to focus on training and developing staff in order for them to feel \nsafe and actively engage with youth.  There still are major staffing challenges due to various \nemployee leaves and teacher vacancies.  There is an urgent need to address the teacher \nvacancy rate. A plan needs to be developed that will provide mandated education to youth on \na daily basis (certifying security staff, combining classrooms, increasing student ratios than \ncurrently, reducing the number of teachers on leave or vacation, reaching out to community \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 34 of 36\n \nschools/substitutes etc.)  \n \nAlthough the population is lower at LHS/CLS, the agency needs to develop meaningful \nmethods for further reducing youth populations. This might include expediting the OJOR \nprocess  and  evaluating  youth  for  placement  under  community  supervision,  including \nintensive community supervision, as permitted by state law.  Defendants need to continue to \nwork towards developing smaller, geographically located Type 1 facilities and also to evaluate \nwhether there are alternative kinds of facilities and/or intensive community services to which \nyouth could be released. In October 2019, the Agency submitted a request to the Joint \nCommittee on Finance requesting the authority to construct two Type 1 facilities, as well as \nnecessary funding required to construct the facilities. This needs to be an ongoing priority or \nDefendants will not be able to come into substantial compliance with this Court Order.  \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DOC has identified sections of the \nAdministrative  Code  that  need  to  be  modified,  but  significant  revisions  have  not  yet \noccurred. Defendants need to continue drafting interim policies for LHS/CLS while also \ndeveloping final Code revisions. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There has been an improvement in \nmeeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority of \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 35 of 36\n \ncases.    When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a \ncorrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). A framework for other QA measures relating to the consent \ndecree is being created.  \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Critical quality assurance positions \nare now filled and will be assisting in developing a quality assurance program. The Monitor \nreviewed sample performance goals, reviewed PbS in great detail, and made suggestions for \nmonthly performance measures and how to incorporate into policy. As discussed throughout \nthis report, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order \nand to improve the quality of life for youth and staff.  The Monitor remains confident that \nthe Defendants will create a competent quality assurance program especially with the \naddition of the new RFID system. \n \nCONCLUSION \nThere have been significant improvements to the physical plant of LHS/CLS which is providing a \nless institutionalized feel for youth and staff. This is reflected in an improved quality of life for both \nyouth and staff. The overall atmosphere today has vastly improved from a year ago, although there \nhave been some setbacks since the last site visit.  Eliminating OC spray and implementing the new \nRFID system are the two biggest accomplishments this reporting period.  Leadership, staff, and youth \nshould be commended because it took a lot of hard work and commitment by all to get to the place \nwhere LHS/CLS is today.  Defendants have more programming for youth than LHS/CLS has ever \nhad available to youth. Direct-care staff vacancies have been reduced.  As a result of the progress \nmade, it is clearly evident that these changes are having a positive impact on the overall atmosphere \nand culture of the facility.  \nThe Monitor feels that the facility can benefit from and see improved outcomes from further \nimplementation of the Care Team model.  The Care Team model has shown great success in other \njurisdictions in not only reducing the number of use of force/restraint and confinement instances, but \nalso improvement to the overall atmosphere, climate and culture of a facility by improving staff and \nyouth relationships.  As noted throughout the report, the facility would also benefit from utilizing \na mental health expert to evaluate the mental health program. \nThe  facility  would  also  benefit  from  an  increased  focus  on  reducing  idleness  and increasing \nmeaningful activities, particularly during weekends and evening hours.  The facility should continue \nto work on improving the behavior management system, providing improved and increased youth \nincentives that will help in reducing many behavioral incidents and reduce the high number of self-\nrequested confinements and program refusals.  The agency recently reviewed a behavior management \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 116   Filed: 03/05/20   Page 36 of 36\n \nsystem being used in Utah and is working to implement a similar BMS program here.  Once in place, \nthe new system should show success in reducing these types of refusals.  \nContinued efforts need to be made to further engage the educational expert, reduce teacher vacancies, \nand increase educational time and quality. Regular training in de-escalation and physical restraint \ntechniques need to continue to occur. Policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be \ndeveloped as well as administrative code. Implementing the new quality assurance program needs \nto be a primary goal.  The physical plant improvements need to continue as scheduled.  Although \nthere are improvements to be made, the Defendants continue to make progress.  \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n36 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nSIXTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n  \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Fifth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on March 5, 2020. The Monitor’s sixth \nreport  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree,  implementation  of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the fifth site visit which took place on February 6 through \nFebruary 8, 2020.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe sixth site visit by the Monitor took place on May 15, 2020.  Due to the recent pandemic, the \nMonitor limited onsite time to one day and completed necessary interviews/information gathering \nvia virtual meetings over the following two weeks after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to and after the site visit for the reporting period ending \nMay 31, 2020. Materials included but were not limited to: Covid-19 related memos, directives and \nplans, programming materials, PbS data, project plans, grievances, counselor logs, various staff \nmemos, daily shift reports, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order, \nupdated unit rules, work rules, employee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical \nrestraint documentation, incident reports, and other housing documentation.  Due to Covid-19 \n(reducing visitors during this time), only the monitoring team were on site during this site visit. \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 2 of 45\n \nPlaintiffs’ counsel conducted several youth interviews virtually (via video calls) and participated \nin the various virtual calls with the Agency and facility staff.  The Monitor took photographs, \ntoured LHS/CLS, and interviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to the \nmajority of youth and staff present during the site visit. Approximately sixty-two (62) youth and \nforty-one (41) staff were interviewed formally and informally by the Monitor during this site visit.   \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction \n \nIt is important to note that during most of the evaluation period, the pandemic, Covid-19, impacted \nthe world. Just as the entire country had to make systemic changes in order to stop the spread of \nthis infectious disease, so did correctional institutions around the country.   LHS/CLS as well as \nother institutions developed an emergency operation plan with the goal of mitigating any potential \nexposures to Covid-19. The Monitor understands that the priority of the Agency was to mitigate \nthe chances of exposure to Covid-19 (youth or staff) in LHS/CLS.  LHS/CLS is fortunate to be \npretty isolated geographically.  The Governor put a temporary transfer hold in which LHS/CLS \nhas not received new admissions since March 26, 2020. Not only did this mitigate any chances of \noutside exposures, it significantly reduced the population to the lowest the Monitor has seen (76 \nyouth).   In addition, due to a combination of not admitting new youth and working to get youth \nout more quickly, the total LHS/CLS population declined to below 80 youth.  It is significant to \nnote that DOC reports (and the PbS data indicate) that this decline was accompanied by a reduction \nin incidents and misbehavior by youth. The population reduction allowed more individualized \nattention, and there was more stability in the units. This positive outcome is important and \nsomething that should be addressed and continued: i.e., that having fewer youth and keeping them \ntogether with consistent and individualized staffing can reduce incidents and benefit youth and \nstaff alike. Program modifications had to be made due to the pandemic including, but not limited \nto: no in person visitation (virtual visitation occurred frequently-discussed in more detail below), \neducation moved to “e-learning” like the rest of the country, grandparents programming was \nhalted, tournaments etc. had to change so the units did not comingle, PSU, teachers, social workers, \nand other staff rotated and conducted services virtually when they could not be done in-person. \nOverall, even during this difficult time, youth and staff had very good attitudes and adjusted to the \nmany changes implemented during this crisis.   \nPhysical Plant \nThe general areas of the facility were very clean and orderly.   The atmosphere in general was very \ncalm throughout LHS/CLS.  The Monitor noted in the last report that the recommendations as to \nthe physical plant modifications made in previous Monitor reports and the February 2018 technical \nassistance report have been implemented and/or were progressing. Due to Covid-19, remaining \nphysical plant projects had to be put on hold.  However, seven (7) of the twelve (12) cottages have \nbeen remodeled to date (Wells, Miller, Dubois, Curtis, King, Black Elk, Roosevelt) and the new \nstaff breakroom has been completed.  Additional projects not yet completed are the camera \nupgrade, electrical upgrade, and remaining cottage remodels.  The Monitor will continue to update \nthe Court on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and \nstaff.   \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 3 of 45\n \nThe entrances into the units were very clean and orderly, the day rooms were very clean, and most \nof the bathrooms in the cottages were clean. The units were more orderly and cleaner in general than \nduring the last visit.  The level of cleanliness of youth rooms varied throughout the cottages \n(described in more detail below) but were generally cleaner than the last visit. Youth and staff should \nbe commended.  \nThe Monitor previously recommended that searches of all buildings be conducted to remove \nexcessive objects, materials, equipment, furniture, etc., to enhance the safety and security of the \nunits/buildings and to maintain a more orderly and safer environment.  Defendants regularly conduct \nand document searches and there was no evidence of excessive objects, furniture, etc. in the living \nunits or classrooms. However, search procedures were modified due to Covid-19 emergency \nprocedures.    The Monitor suggests that pre-Covid-19 search procedures continue.   \nSchool/Living Units Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage and toured the school during the site visit.  The school continues \nto have positive messages through out and artwork is displayed. The classrooms and the general \nschool area were very clean.  However, it must be noted that no youth were present in school due \nto educational services being held virtually and on the units. On March 24, 2020, the schools began \nproviding education on the units with most education staff working off-site, and this is ongoing.  \nThe schedule was distributed with a training brief assisting with Chromebooks and logging into \nEdgenuity (on-line learning tool). Teachers were on-site once a week. Music, art, and recreation \nstill occurred. Students had Zoom meetings with teachers when needed. Teachers checked in \nregularly with unit staff and students and are able to monitor youth’s progress through Edgenuity.  \nOf course, e-learning is not the preferred format for teaching, but during the pandemic, many \nlearning institutions have taken this approach. However, a number of youth did complain to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel about dislike of and difficulties with this format, especially the lack of personal \nattention and real time feedback from teachers. The change in educational format at LHS/CLS is \nconsistent with what many other schools throughout the country implemented during Covid-19.  \nThe Monitor spoke to the educators present during the site visit and reviewed the e-learning tool.  \nThe Monitor previously recommended that the Defendants should retain an education expert to \ncomplete an assessment of the educational program at LHS/CLS. The expert was retained and \nprovided initial observations. The expert returned in November to further assess the education \ndepartment’s operations and make specific recommendations. The Monitor recommends that the \nDefendants engage the consultant further and work to address the concerns raised – including the \nneed for more deep and meaningful teacher interaction with youth, enhancing or expanding the daily \neducation hours, which is only about three (3) hours per day - and implement the recommendations \nmade by the consultant and the Monitor with respect to staffing and the educational program for \nLHS/CLS. The Monitor was told that retaining the educational consultant has been put on hold.  The \nMonitor encourages the Defendants to reengage.   \nThere were more than adequate staffing levels on the living units. The Monitor saw some staff \nengaging with youth, although less than last visit (partly due to attempts at social distancing).   Youth \nattitudes overall were very good during this site visit.  All the youth that the Monitor interacted with \nwere respectful and very interested in interacting with the monitoring team.   The Monitor had an \nopportunity to talk to almost all of the youth present in the day rooms.  The fact that only the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 4 of 45\n \nmonitoring team came onto the units was less intimidating than when facility/agency leadership are \npresent. Due to the positive and more in-depth conversations with youth, the Monitor will continue \nto conduct future site visits in this manner.    \nSafety/welfare checks are no longer being completed on paper because the new RFID system has \nbeen implemented as of January 2020. As a reminder, the RFID system measures staff performance \non safety/security checks in real time, which will help manage compliance with the various \nrequirements of the Court Order and other standards. The Monitor observed staff completing the \nrounds on all units. Small recommendations made by the Monitor during the last visit were for the \nnew RFID system to change the word “inmate” to “youth” and replace the icon with the hands in \nthe cell image for another one (if possible).  The Monitor is told that this has been communicated \nto the vendor and is being developed.  As of April, a youth is scanned when (s)he enters and exits \nhis/her room in an effort to align the RFID’s capabilities with DJC’s ongoing PbS data collection \nwork.  DJC continues to work on creating and refining reports regarding various outcomes including \nyouth  confinement  by  date,  type,  and  youth,  track  length  of  confinement  and  reasons  for \nconfinement. The new RFID has many capabilities and the Monitor suggested continuing to use \nand develop (if needed) other measures in the system.    \nDuring this site visit, the girls were split between King and Wells cottages.  Hughes cottage was \nbeing utilized as the female quarantine.  One youth was on the Hughes unit as she had to go offsite \npreviously for medical attention.  The atmosphere on the girls’ units were extremely positive.  This \nis an improvement from the last site visit. Youth were laughing with each other.  On King, some of \nthe girls were outside drawing pictures with chalk, several girls were gardening, and other youth \nwere interacting with each other on the unit. The social worker was present on the unit and the some \nof the girls were going to weaving class.  The girls were in very good spirits and liked having school \non the units.  The rooms on the unit were generally clean and orderly with beds made. No one was \nconfined to their rooms, but one youth voluntarily was in her room sleeping.   The Monitor observed \nstaff redirecting youth appropriately and youth following staff direction.  Staff were completing \ntheir safety/security rounds and observing the youth throughout the unit.  It was a very calm and \nhappy unit.  Staff expressed their difficulty with managing and helping the youth with education \n(something that has increasingly occurred because, as noted above, the online education system has \nnot been providing adequate support for a number of the youth). \nWells was clean and very beautifully decorated. Some girls were making Origami with staff. Two \ngirls created a song and dance about how to stay safe during Covid-19 which they performed for \nthe Monitor.  The staff were engaged with the youth and the atmosphere was very positive. The \nrooms in general were clean and the unit itself was clean and orderly. Two youth were in their \nrooms voluntarily.   \nThe girls were very engaged with the Monitor. The girls complained that they did not have as many \npaid jobs as the boys (and wanted more) and that there were phone restrictions for non-phone related \nbehaviors.  They understood the programming changes due to Covid-19. At this time, the girls liked \nhaving school on the units and were not upset about not going to the school area.  Once the youth \nare allowed back in the regular school, it is important for the girls to also go back into the main \nschool, which has superior facilities and resources. They liked arts and crafts and enjoyed sewing \nmasks as a project.  They also missed visitations but liked the Zoom calls with their families.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 5 of 45\n \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, generally, the cottages themselves were clean. Youth told the \nMonitor that they had to clean due to the Monitor visit. The Monitor recommended during the last \ncouple of site visits that staff adjust their placement since youth can more freely move around the \nunit (some youth in day room, outside, in and out of their rooms, and bathroom).  Staff were \nappropriately placed around the units from a safety perspective.  During this site visit, staff in \ngeneral were not interacting with the youth as much as the Monitor observed in previous visits but \nthis could be due to social distancing practices.  \nIn Krueger, the walkway and unit were clean. Youth rooms were dirty and had graffiti as observed \nduring the last two site visits.  Nine (9) youth were out in the day room and three (3) staff were \npresent on the unit. Youth exhibited good peer relations and were respectful to the Monitor and \nstaff.  The unit was dark for some reason. Staff were positioned around the unit. Youth were \nmaking calls and sitting on the unit talking with each other. Youth complained about wanting more \nactivities to do (bored), wanted playing cards, wanted MP3 players, and stated there were still \nissues with getting canteen, and the food served is not good. On a positive note, the Monitor \nobserved that additional phones have been installed in all of the units to make phones calls more \naccessible to youth. \nIn Addams, the living unit and bathroom was clean. There was still a lot of graffiti. Not a single \nyouth was confined. Youth were doing homework, making telephone calls, and playing cards. \nYouth rooms were very clean and orderly. Unit was calm. Staff were engaged with youth and \nhelping with schoolwork.   There were nine (9) youth on the unit and three (3) staff. Youth openly \ntalked with the Monitor. They did not like that they had to see barbed wire outside their unit which \nwas just a constant reminder that they were “locked up.”  They also said they did not like most of \nfood served but loved the barbeque chicken.  They said they would like to make masks too.  They \ncomplained about having nothing to do. \nIn Black Elk, the youth rooms and unit were very clean.  One (1) youth was confined. Eight (8) \nyouth were out in the day room. The atmosphere was calmer than the last visit. Youth were out in \nthe day room interacting with each other. All of the youth talked were very talkative with the \nMonitor.  Youth talked to the Monitor about staff (ones they liked and ones they did not), discussed \nissues  with  canteen,  wanting  MP3  players,  complained  that  their  RFID  bracelets  were \nuncomfortable, wanting more things to do, and they missed going down to school and participating \nin other activities.  They did enjoy Zoom calls with family but miss visitation.  \n \nThe Rogers unit (TIP) was clean.  Bathrooms and rooms were cleaner than last visit. All youth \nwere out of their rooms (no confinement). Youth were about to eat lunch out in the day room. \nThere were three (3) staff on the unit and six (6) youth. Staff were positioned around the unit.  The \nunit was calm. Youth were very quiet and did not want to engage much with the Monitor. They \ndid mention that there were issues with canteen, would like to make masks if offered the \nopportunity, and missed the teachers and going to the school area.  \nThe Curtis Unit was clean and quiet. Half of the youth rooms were clean. There were twelve (12) \nyouth on the unit. When asked, staff could not tell me how many youths were in their rooms (2 youth \nwere confined). Youth were out in day room talking with each other. Youth talked with the Monitor.  \nYouth complained about canteen and the food.  They also mentioned phone restrictions and restricted \nout time due to Covid-19.  They would like to cook more food.  They did complain about one \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 6 of 45\n \nparticular staff which the Monitor brought to management’s attention. Youth want more activities to \ndo and more games. They would like to make masks. \nThe Miller unit and youth rooms was clean. Eight (8) youth were in the day room and no one was \nconfined. Two (2) staff were working on the unit. Youth were eating lunch or doing chores. Overall, \nthe unit was calm. All of the youth talked with the Monitor.  Youth’s favorite meal is the barbeque \nchicken and macaroni and cheese.  Their least favorite meals were Salisbury steak, meatloaf, and stir \nfry.  They complained about the canteen. They stated they had phone restrictions. They missed going \nto school. They also stated that they did not get to order anything or do anything special for Mother’s \nDay which was disappointing. They missed the “grandma” snacks.  \n \nThe Dubois unit was very clean. Some youth rooms were clean. Youth just finished eating and were \ncleaning up.  There were fifteen (15) youth on the unit. Two youth were doing homework and one \nyouth was in his room (voluntarily) watching a show.  There was a total of five (5) staff on the unit \n(two nurses were on the unit providing medication to youth as needed).  The Monitor spoke to 9 of \nthe 15 youth. Youth did not complain of phone restrictions.  They would like more to do and have \nmore board games to play (some of theirs were pretty destroyed).  They would like to make face \nmasks if offered and missed being in school.  They would like more bikes.  Youth also wanted more \nassistance with note taking as e-learning and lack of in person 1 on 1 teacher support was difficult. \nThe Monitor suggested having groups in the units on how to take effective notes.   \n \nIn March, the Foster Grandparents asked if they could work with youth to make facemasks for the \nyouth and staff at CLS/LHS.  This started out as a kind gesture to provide a few masks with a \ngroup of youth that had did not have previous experience with sewing. To date the team of staff \nand youth have made hundreds of masks for our staff and youth. They have also taught our youth \nan amazing skill and the opportunity to give back to the facility and community.  However, that \nskill and opportunity has been limited to the girls; many boys expressed interest in doing this and \nthe opportunity should be expanded to them. \n \nThe Monitor was happy to see that the recreation schedule (Music, Art & Physical Recreation \nprograms) were maintained to provide youth programing and activities during COVID-19.  Some \nyouth  told  Plaintiffs’  counsel  that  they  did  not  feel  they  received  enough  of  this  kind  of \nprogramming and would like the opportunity to have music, art and physical recreation daily, not \nto have to choose among those activities.  Youth Activity’s Committee has started STEM projects \nwith the youth. Youth are continuing to paint canvases to be displayed on the units. \n \nBecause in person visitation had to stop due to Covid-19, Zoom visits began March 26.  As of May \n11, 384 visits had been facilitated with 94 unique youth participating. All youth indicated they \nhave  been  offered  Zoom  visits.  Twenty-nine  (29)  Youth  completed  a  survey  and  41%  of \nrespondents indicated they had not previously received an in-person visit.  Youth did tell Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel that they would like more frequent Zoom calls. \n \nYouth were asked what they liked about the newly instituted Zoom visits.  Below are the \nQualitative Highlights for “What I like about Zoom / Positive Experience with Zoom”: \n \n“Seeing mom. They make happy and better days” \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 7 of 45\n \n“Seeing my dog and family at home” \n“Seeing my family’s faces” \n“It allows me to see home and how my families are living.” \n “See my baby brother tell me his age” \n“I love seeing my grandma” \n“I’ve been locked up 19 months and haven’t seen my family since then because they live in Texas, \nbut Zoom let me get a visit” \n“I saw my nephew” \n“I seen my niece” \n“Seeing my little sister smile” \n“Seeing my house again”  \n“Everything” \n \nDue to the positive response to these Zoom calls, Defendants are going to try and keep these going \neven when in person visitation resumes. This will be a great addition due to visitation being \ndifficult due to the geographic location of LHS/CLS.   \n \nThere continues to be food incentives for youth. The food service department processes requests \nfor pizza parties and incentive snacks for youth incentives almost every day most weeks and since \nMarch 1, the CLS/LHS has served a total 762 individual food incentives to youth (not including \nthe popcorn and soda on Saturday nights for movie night, and not including the incentive food that \nis purchased for youth from local restaurants and stores).     \n \nDJC continues to explore and expand the use of technology, especially in light of COVID-19. \nStarting Friday, March 13, movies were broadcasted to every living unit and personal television at \nset times during the weekend.  A feature movie that is brand new will be shown every Saturday \nnight at 6:00 pm, and then that movie will be available for order from the movie library.  This will \ngive everyone an opportunity to watch the new movies at the same time.  Popped popcorn will be \nsent down to the units on Saturday with the dinner meal to be served during the movie that evening.   \n \nAdditionally, DJC is now able to use Channel 2 with a network computer connection/display. This \nmeans we are able to display a YouTube video to the entire facility at once. Implementing use of \nthis technology, a pre-recorded religious service video on Channel 2 can be displayed on Sundays. \nAs with movies, all living units will need to have the dayroom TVs turned on (to Channel 2) for \nany youth would choose to view this during this time. This is in addition to youth being able to \nview the same service/video from their own rooms on Channel 2 if they have a personal TV. \nFollowing the religious services videos there may also be a few other videos shown carrying \npositive messaging involving some well-known celebrities.  \n \nThere is still a need for additional structured programming overall.  The Monitor understands that \nCovid-19 has required some programming to change/cease, but there still could be more activities \nfor the youth to do.  While youth are out of their rooms there should be engaging activities.  As \npreviously  mentioned,  youth  are  bored  and  while  being  out  of  their  rooms  is  certainly  an \nimprovement, more meaningful activities and weekend programs would also help reduce the risk \nof youth engaging in anti-social behaviors when they have little else to do – particularly during \nCovid-19 when so many interactions with other youth, family, staff, and educators are now being \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 8 of 45\n \ndone virtually. Youth need more to do than simply sitting in the dayroom area watching television \nor playing cards.  There needs to be a bigger focus on reducing youth idleness and more structured \nprogramming should be put into place.  In response to needing more structured, gender and culturally \nrelevant programming, Defendants have created a new position of “Program Director.” The job \ndescription is being finalized and posting and recruiting will occur soon after.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nDuring this reporting period, there have been a few key staffing changes.  The Superintendent of \nLHS/CLS is transferring back to the adult system.  The Monitor wants to thank the Superintendent \nfor all of his hard work and dedication to improving the conditions for youth and staff in his care.  \nHe had an amazing rapport with staff and youth and worked diligently implementing the suggested \nchanges made by the Monitor and this Court Order.  He graciously delayed his transfer in order to \nensure that LHS/CLS had consistency in leadership during the pandemic.  Posting and recruiting \nfor the Superintendent position occurred and an internal candidate has been recently selected.  The \nMonitor  looks  forward  to  working with  this  individual.    Additionally,  one  out  of  the  two \nPsychologist Supervisor positions remains vacant. The Defendants are actively recruiting for her \nreplacement. Two new Unit Supervisor positions have been created which will allow for the Unit \nSupervisors to supervise two units.  \n \nIt is important to note that there is a hiring freeze due to budget restraints. Some positions are not \nable to be filled such as the Chaplain and Educational Assistant.  The Monitor hopes there can be \nexceptions made for any key position hires at LHS/CLS in order to meet the requirements of this \nCourt Order.  \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage significantly improved over the last year.  There have been \nfifteen (15) new direct-care staff hired during this reporting period. There are 311 total positions \n(“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS.  Previously, based on population, Defendants determined that they need \nthree (3) fewer teacher FTEs and thus moved the FTEs to other critical positions. Approximately \n153  of these positions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced \n(“YC/YCA”).  The teacher vacancy rate remains high (8 vacancies). Hiring has not occurred during \nthis reporting period due to Covid-19 and education being online. The Monitor encourages \ncontinuing to recruit teachers despite the reduced population and challenges with Covid-19.  \nRecruiting is still a challenge due to the location of the facility, overall teacher shortages, relatively \nlow compensation, and the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue. As \npreviously mentioned, the entire educational program at LHS/CLS needs to be evaluated and \nimproved. \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of \nMay 31, 2019  Sept. 6, 2019  January 30, 2020  May 13, 2020  \nYouth   11.5% (12 out of 105)  14% (15 out of 105)  7% (8 of 115)  8.6% (10 out of 115) \nCounselor \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 9 of 45\n \nYouth  50% (25 out of 50)  7% (3.5 out of 50)  15% (5.5 of 37.5)  13% (5 out of 37.5) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  43% (12 of 28)  36% (10 of 28)  32% (8 of 25)  32% (8 out of 25) \nSocial Worker  0% (14 of 14)  21.5% (3 of 14)  21 % (3 of 14)  21% (3 out of 14) \n  \nThere has not been a data driven analysis of the 12-hour shift (which began in Nov. 2019) to date, \nbut now that there are six (6) months of data available, the Office of Budget and Programs will be \nconducting an analysis of the 12-hour shift.  A second comprehensive staff survey was completed. \nEvery staff person the Monitor spoke to said they absolutely love the new schedule except one. In \nthe recent survey conducted, some staff reported that they work fewer hours and are not ordered \nto work extra shifts as much as they used to be, but this seems to be dependent on which shift and \nwhich cottage they work in.  It appears that more staff than not like the schedule. However, the \noverall positive comments are somewhat less than in the previous survey.   \nThe Monitor spoke to over forty-one (41) staff and the majority of staff seemed happy.  The vast \nmajority of staff again expressed the desire to have more programming for youth.   Every staff \nperson the Monitor spoke to and observed were proficient with the RFID system.  Staff were not \nas engaged with the youth this visit (except the staff on the girls’ units).  Perhaps staff were trying \nto social distance during Covid-19.  Staff were somewhat frustrated with the lack of support with \ne-learning.  Some had difficulty trying to assist youth while completing their other responsibilities \nand some had difficulty with certain subject matters. Staff were excited about the new break room.  \nThey had not used it yet due to Covid-19, but the staff break room is beautiful.  The atmosphere is \nrelaxing, and the leadership took the staff’s recommendations with respect to how they wanted the \nroom to look and the items that they wanted in the room.  The staff break room exceeded the \nMonitor’s expectation.  \n \nThe Defendants have implemented almost all of the recommendations for staff wellness including \nincreased training, staff recognition program, engaging staff in developing programming and policy \nchanges, actively participating in youth and family council meetings, reducing ordering of staff \n(mandated overtime), and constructing a relaxing staff lounge.  Other staff incentives implemented \nwere: \n-  Staff recognition board \n-  Staff have been able to wear jeans throughout COVID-19. \n-  Staff treat bags for correctional employee appreciation week.  \n-  March - Luck of the Lincoln staff giveback for St. Patrick’s Day. Soda and candy then staff \ncould pick a small scratch card to see if they won an additional prize.  \n-  February - handed out granola bars and Rice-Krispies treats.  \n-  January - festive mugs with hot cocoa and candy.  \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward.  \nAs part of the agency and facility’s desire to improve conditions for both staff and youth, they are \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 10 of 45\n \ncontinuing to engage in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”), which was explained \nin the previous Monitor reports.  The third YICPM site visit took place November 14-15, 2019.  \nAs of April 6, 2020, DJC planned the next steps with YICPM. In place of in-person meetings \nduring COVID-19, the plan for  continued collaboration on YICPM was decided to be  the \nfollowing: \n \n•  YICPM consultants will record webinars on practice model content areas and forward to \nDJC when completed. The initial webinar will focus on the practice model content areas \nof Case Planning, Re-entry, and Community Supervision. \n•  DJC can then view each webinar either as a group or individually.  \n•  After viewing the webinar DJC will schedule Zoom meetings to discuss the webinar \ncontent and complete associated checklists as a team. \n•  Following internal discussion, DJC will then schedule Zoom calls with YICPM to share \nour checklists and plot out next steps with them. \n \nSince the last meeting, all new youth admitted to LHS/CLS are utilizing a new Growth Plan.  The \nMonitor continues to look forward to the agency implementing these plans to improve conditions \nof confinement for youth and well-being of staff.   \n \nThe Defendants are also collaborating with Massachusetts Department of Youth Services to \nexplore Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (“DBT”) as a behavior management system. DJC has \nproposed hiring a DBT contractor to assist with implementation of DBT as a behavioral motivation \napproach. The Monitor was informed that the consultant has been retained and planning has begun.  \nThe Monitor looks forward to working with the consultant. In addition to obtaining the consultant, \nPSU has recently conducted a DBT readiness self-assessment. Information gathered from the self-\nassessment will assist the division once they begin implementing the strategic framework for DBT.  \n \nThe Monitor was informed that due to Covid-19, contracting with a mental health consultant was \npostponed. The Monitor continues to recommend that the facility obtain a mental health expert to \nevaluate the programming, staffing, and services that exist at LHS/CLS – including for youth with \nsignificant mental health needs - and make recommendations on how to address the issues raised \nand improve treatment and services for youth at LHS/CLS.  \n \nThe Monitor previously suggested modifying the mental health (PSU) and recreational staff work \nschedules to include more evening and weekend hours, especially given the lack of sufficient other \nstructured activities during those times. PSU staff work until 8 P.M. during the week and are on-\ncall 24/7. The Defendants should continue to involve PSU staff, especially leadership, in making \nimprovements at the facility (such as improvements to incentives, consequences, and working with \nthe OJOR system). Currently, there is a PSU staff member who comes in each weekend to perform \nrounds, meet with youth on AC and observation status, attend to any crises, finish notes, and \nintakes and will report to the facility as needed. However, there are no groups or programming \ninvolving  PSU  on  the  weekends.    The  Monitor  recommends  that  scheduling  of  PSU  be \nreconsidered (rotate staff if need be, alternating weekends, etc.) or if this is not possible, then hire \nadditional PSU staff to work nights and weekends.  Weekends are when there is the most idle time \nand need for additional meaningful programming.  Adding weekend programming will also have \na positive impact on reducing incidents of violence and other behavioral incidents related to \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 11 of 45\n \nboredom and lack of activities. There really is a missed opportunity for PSU involvement during \nthis period and particularly during Covid-19 when engagement with family, staff, and other youth \nare reduced.  \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nAs stated in the last report, a framework for identified outcome measures was developed to align \nwith PbS national benchmarks.  PbS data collection cycles occur twice annually, and the most \nrecent cycle was in April 2020.  Facility Improvement Plans (“FIP”) have been created after the \nmost recent PbS Coach Site Visit and has been forwarded to the Monitor.  As a reminder, PbS is a \ncontinuous data-driven improvement model grounded in research that holds  juvenile justice \nagencies, facilities and residential care providers to the highest standards for operations, programs \nand services.  The FIPs are the vehicles for jurisdictions to continuously bring about meaningful \nchange. They bridge the gap between understanding and actions to improve the conditions of \nconfinement at a facility, beginning with identifying the specific outcome measure(s) a facility \nwant to improve. The FIP process provides the facility with the ability to track progress towards \nidentified outcome goals, and receive scores based on that performance and identified FIP goals. \nSince the last reporting period, the following action steps, have been implemented to improve \noverall conditions of confinement, operational services, programs and/or facility culture: \n \n1.  Both schools continue to update PbS boards in the main lobby of the schools. \n \n2.  Sent in Award Applications for (LHS):  \n \n•  1 Youth for scholarship. \n•  1 staff Department of Education scholarship. \n•  4 Art Contest. \n•  2 Kids Got Talent (waiting on consent forms from parent/guardians).  \n•  1 Barbara Allen Hagen Award- Removing OC.  \n \n3.  Sent in Award Applications for (CLS):  \n \n•  2 Art Contests. \n•  2 Kids Got Talent (waiting on consent forms from parent/guardians). \n \n4.  An introduction to PbS has become a part of new staff orientations & the new Youth \nCounselor/Youth Counselor Advanced academy. \n \n5.  Added a Supervisor of the Month to the Employee of the Month recognitions.  \n \n6.  REC schedule (Music, Art & Physical Recreation programs) maintained to provide youth \nprogramming and activities during COVID-19.  Evening programming continues and is \npopular with youth although a number of youth requested that these opportunities be \nincreased \n \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 12 of 45\n \n7.  Youth Activity’s Committee has started STEM projects with the youth.  \n \n8.  Youth continuing to paint canvases to be displayed on the units. \n \n9.  FY17-FY19 Workers Compensation claims were evaluated to look for patterns and \ntrends. \n \n10.  Ten (10) staff completed Verbal Judo Instructor training.  \n \n11. A multi-disciplinary committee was created to review the Case Planning process.  \n \n12. School Updates: Student Honor Roll is being recognized at the school. CR2EW \ndeveloped to monitor and support student progress in addition to advocating throughout \nacademic and social circumstances.  \n \n13. HSU continues targeted monthly educational activities for the youth. \n \n14. Began a Field Training Officer program for non-security staff. \n \nFIP Action Steps \nPbS offers a 7-action step tool, driven by a research-informed improvement model, to support and \nguide PbS participating agencies and facilities as they work to achieve both incremental and \nsustainable change. The action steps entered into the PbS website make up the team's concrete plan \nto attain the improvement the facility is seeking. \n \n1.  Analysis of Performance  \n•  Pinpoint the causes of your outcome performance. \n2.  Creating Buy-In  \n•  Identify how you will engage those whose support you need to improve the targeted \noutcome or area of change. \n3.  Setting Outcome Measure Goal  \n•  Create short, interim & long-term goals that provide benchmarks and a vision to \nwork toward. \n4.  Improvement Process Action Steps  \n•  Develop concrete, measurable actions to address the factors that contributed to your \noutcome performance. \n5.  Interim Measures  \n•  Identify how you will monitor your progress toward your goals to see what is \nworking and adjust your strategies, as necessary. \n6.  Sustaining Performance  \n•  Identify strategies that will support what is working to ensure sustainable change. \n7.  Performance Recognition  \n•  Determine how you will formally and informally recognize staff, youth, and other \nstakeholders for their contribution to the improvement process; celebrate successes! \nThe following outcome measures were selected for these FIPs based on input from the PbS Coach \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 13 of 45\n \nand facility outcome: \nLHS Facility Improvement Plan #1010 \nOutcome Measure \nSafety 02 Injuries to youths per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \nSafety 03 Injuries to staff per 100 \nstaff-days of employment. \nSafety 04 Injuries to youths by other \nyouths per 100 person-days of youth \nconfinement. \nSafety 11 Assaults and fights on \nyouth per 100 person-days of youth \nconfinement. \nSafety 12 Assaults on staff per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \nOutcome Measure  Original Value  Current Value  Average Value  Goal \nSafety 02Injuries to youths per 100 person-\n64.00  53.00  18.70  48.00 \ndays of youth confinement. \n \nSafety 03Injuries to staff per 100 staff-\n19.00  3.00  3.20  14.00 \ndays of employment. \n \nSafety 04Injuries to youths by other \nyouths per 100 person-days of youth  17.00  2.00  4.29  12.00 \nconfinement.   \nSafety 11Assaults and fights on youth \nper 100 person-days of youth  38.00  9.00  12.50  28.50 \nconfinement.   \nSafety 12Assaults on staff per 100 \n9.00  4.00  4.29  6.75 \nperson-days of youth confinement. \n \n \nCLS Facility Improvement Plan # 1009 \nOutcome Measure \nOrder 08 Isolation, room \nconfinement, segregation/special \nmanagement unit use per 100 \nperson-days of youth confinement.  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 14 of 45\n \nOutcome Measure \n \nOutcome Measure  Original Value  Current Value  Average Value  Goal \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, \nsegregation/special  29.00  69.00  14.06  15.00 \n \nmanagement unit use per 100 \nperson-days of youth \nconfinement. \nA thorough and in-depth review was conducted of the April 2020 PbS data collection for both LHS \nand CLS.  During the review, outcome measure data clarification and input was sought from both \nthe facility PbS State and Site Coordinators and the assigned PbS Coach.  As a result of the review, \nthe following highlights and outcomes are noted: \n \nPbS Data Quality – In the previous report, some issues were identified as to the quality of the data \nentered for some outcome measures, including outcomes measuring around daily activity durations.  \nThrough the review of the April data reports, the Monitor is pleased to report that those issues \nappear to have been resolved.  More importantly, the new Guardian RFID system was used to record \nmuch of the data inputted for the daily Unit Log activity data.  This permitted the facility to \naccurately report the daily activity for all youth, including education, facility programs, recreation, \nleisure time, and “in sleeping rooms” (room confinement), and finally sleeping time. Using the \nGuardian RFID system also allowed for the tracking of daily activity over the entire data collection \nmonth, rather than a simple week snapshot that was reported during the previous report for the \nOctober date collection cycle.  This allowed for much more accurate data over the course of the \nentire month.  With the improved data collection, we can now get a better sense for the progress \nbeing made, which is commendable.  Before the Monitor begins to outline areas for improvement, \nit is important to recognize the efforts and positive steps forward in regard to the quality of the PbS \ndata and the overall progress in many of the outcome measures.  It is important to remember that \nPbS is a “continuous facility improvement program”, therefore overall progress is measured over \nthe period of years and numerous data collection cycles.  The trend line of the outcome measures is \nwhat is most important as it reflects the direction of the facility over time.  The April data clearly \nshows progress trends moving in the right direction for many of the outcome measures.   \nIt is important to note that the April data collection took place in the middle of the pandemic, which \ncertainly made facility operations much more challenging, particularly around the issue of reducing \nroom confinement.  In these circumstances, the easy approach would have been to put youth in their \nrooms as much as possible to promote social distancing and reduce the risk of infection.  The \nMonitor is happy to report that this did NOT occur at LHS or CLS.  It certainly appears that the \nfacility made every attempt to maintain facility operations as best possible under these challenging \nconditions.  This is highly commendable and reflects the agency and facility leadership commitment \nto improving conditions of confinement. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 15 of 45\n \nWith all that said, there are a couple of outcome measures that bear attention.  First and foremost, \nis what is unquestionably a high rate of “self-requested” confinement, which is when youth ask to \nbe in their rooms. The data reflects 838 incidents during the month of April for self-requested \nconfinement, representing 76% of all confinement for the facility during the month.  Second to that \nare 213 incidents (19% of all confinement) where youth “declined to participate in program”.  \nProgram refusals typically result in room confinement which is something not contemplated or \nallowed by the Court Order.  These two categories alone represent 95% of all confinement for the \nmonth of April.  On one hand, this is a positive as very little confinement is a result of behavior \nissues.  On the other hand, it is also a reflection of the culture, atmosphere and environment which \nresults in such self-selected confinement.  Focusing on improvement on these particular areas of \nconfinement will certainly have an immediate and positive impact on reducing overall confinement \nnumbers.  \nIt is also a positive trend that behavioral related confinement only represents 5% of all confinement \n(2% to “protect youth from other youth,” 2% to “give youth time to cool off,” 1% for “other \nresponse to misbehavior” and 1% “other response to misbehavior” and “not recorded”).  To \nillustrate this point differently, at LHS, there were 1,051 incidents of confinement unrelated to \nbehavior (838 self-requested and 213 for program refusal) compared to 46 incidents related to \nbehavior.  Similar disparity is seen at CLS, where there were 211 confinement incidents unrelated \nto behavior (148 self-requested and 63 for program refusal) compared to 20 behavior related \nincidents (11 for mental health related issues; 3 to protect other youth or staff; 2 for time to cool \noff; 1 medical; 1 rule violation; and 2 other). Focus on reducing these types of confinement through \nimproving the overall atmosphere and environment as well as tying program participation into the \nincentive and rewards program should have a positive effect.  The overall effort of the facility \nimprovement plans as well as the focus issues of the settlement agreement should also have a \npositive impact on these issues. \nAdditionally, the previous report discussed that the unit activity record for the Krueger Unit \nreflected that youth were spending approximately 20.64 hours per day in their rooms (10.5 hours \nreflected as sleeping time and 10.14 hours reflected as “in sleeping rooms,” room confinement).  \nThe activity log for the Krueger Unit also did not reflect any hours for education.   This issue seems \nto have been resolved.  The April activity log for the Krueger Unit reflects that youth are spending \n2.27 hours per day in education programing; 5.20 hours per day in leisure activity; 2.57 hours per \nday in operational activity; 10.73 hours per day in rooms for sleeping; 2.83 hours per day in rooms \n(operational confinement); with the remainder of time identified as 0.07 facility programming; and \n0.33 recreation.  \nFinally, the Monitor encourages the facility to closely review all of the PbS data and outcome \nmeasures as a means to better understand the impacts generated from the many changes occurring \nwithin the facility.  Agency and facility leadership should make it a point to review the PbS data \nwith staff at all levels, perhaps during monthly all staff briefing meetings.  This is an opportunity \nto show the positive outcomes being achieved through the various changes and efforts to reduce \nincidents of violence, confinement, and use of restraint. As a result, while much work remains to \nbe done, the data clearly shows that trend lines are moving in the right direction and providing a \nsafer environment for staff and youth. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 16 of 45\n \nUse of Restraint Outcome Measures - Both LHS and CLS show “0” incidents of use of chemical \nagents (Order 6) during the April 2020 data collection cycle, which is commendable and per the \nSettlement Agreement.  However, the rate of physical restraints (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use \nper 100 person days of confinement) at LHS and CLS remains high and significantly above the \nnational average as does the rate of mechanical restraints (Order 4 – Mechanical Restraint use per \n100 person days of confinement) usage incidents.  While the rate of physical and mechanical \nrestraint use declined at CHS, it rose slightly at LHS during the April data cycle compared to the \nOctober 2019 cycle. This is very typical of a facility transition from and eliminating the use of OC \n(pepper spray) as staff develop new skills for de-escalation and behavior response techniques.  As \nmentioned earlier, this is a continuous facility improvement process which involves complex \noperational issues.  The following two charts reveal that overall, the trends lines for both physical \nand mechanical restraint use is on a downward trend and moving in the right direction from the \nApril 2019 data collection cycle. \n \nOrder 03 \nPhysical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note: PbS defines Physical Restraints as facility authorized and trained holds used by staff to \nsubdue an otherwise uncontrollable youth in order to prevent the youth from injuring him or \nherself, or others.)   \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 17 of 45\n \n \nOrder 04 \nMechanical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note: PbS defines Mechanical Restraints as Mechanical Devices (such as handcuffs) used to \nprevent an uncontrollable youth from injuring him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints may \nonly be used for short periods of time and must be used under medical supervision.) \nThe previous Monitoring report discussed issues around the reduced use of the Care Teams which \nresulted in a higher number of restraint-usage incidents.  Care Teams are designed precisely to \nreduce the need for the use of restraints and have been effectively shown to work at facilities across \nthe country and have been shown to be effective at LHS and CLS as well. A review of various \nincident reports shows multiple situations where use of a Care Team might well have been able to \navoid escalation of the situation. The Agency and facility should continue to expand the use of the \nCare Team concept and ensure that direct care staff are training to properly use the Care Team as a \nde-escalation  and  use  of  restraint  avoidance  response.  Unfortunately,  some  staff  appear  to \nincorrectly equate ‘de-escalation’ with verbally repeating the same order to a youth, rather than \ntrying to engage the youth and resolve problems. As noted below in the PbS data, verbal de-\nescalation is also the training most frequently requested by staff.  It is critical that direct care staff \ndevelop skills around total awareness in order to recognize the early signs of pending behavior and \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 18 of 45\n \nincidents in order to engage the Care Team members at the earliest possible opportunity.  This in \nturn increases the opportunities for de-escalation and resolution of situations in a more restrained \nand effective manner.  with the use of restraint.  \nThe Department should continue to implement the core principles of the Care Team model by utilizing \nan agency strategic plan process that involves additional staff training in de-escalation techniques; \ninclude Care Team deployment information in shift debriefings in order to review the process and \nprovide on-going situational training for staff;  implement a Care Team response incident report that \nalso reflects the outcome of the response in order to better track outcomes from Care Team \ndeployments; implement the S.O.D.A.S model (Situation, Options, Disadvantages, Advantages, \nSolution) into the Care Team model; and, finally, the facility leadership team should incorporate \ndaily/weekly review of all use of force/restraint incidents to evaluate if and when the Care Team \nshould have been activated to help de-escalate a situation.  This should be used as a staff training and \nawareness process to help staff build new skills and to help change their mindsets in how they first \nreact to certain types of youth behaviors. \nIsolation, Room Confinement and Segregation Measures – Overall, the PbS outcome measures \naround isolation and room confinement are improved over the October 2019 PbS data collection \ncycle reflecting that 97.07% of room confinements are terminated in under eight hours, and slightly \nfewer in under four hours, 93.88%. These are both very commendable achievements, and both are \nslightly better than the national field averages for these outcome measures.  These rates also reflect \nan increase from the October 2019 rates. While these rates are commendable, we continue to see a \nhigh rate of initial confinements (room confinements for self-requested, program refusal or behavior \nrelated  incidents,  typically  ended  in  under  four hours)  reflected  in Order  8,  which  remains \nsignificantly higher than the national field average. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 19 of 45\n \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, segregation/special management unit use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \nThere remains an issue around Order 13 – Isolation, Room Confinement for reasons not related to \nbehavior.  These appear to primarily be incidents where youth are refusing to participate in \nprograms and education. As you can see from the following chart, self-requested and declined to \nparticipate in programs involves 95% of the non-behavior related confinement incidents at LHS \nand 91% of confinement incidents at CLS.  \n \nWhy confinement was used    Lincoln Hills    Copper Lake \nValue  Count  Percent  Count  Percent \nSelf-requested  838  76%  148  64% \nDeclined to participate in program  213  19%  63  27% \nMental Health      11  5% \nProtect other youths or staff  25  2%  3  1% \nGive youth time to cool off  20  2%  2  1% \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 20 of 45\n \nValue  Count  Percent  Count  Percent \nOther response to misbehavior  1  0%  2  1% \nNot recorded  1  0%     \nThe PbS Incident reporting data for April 2020 reflects the following important data points: \n➢  25% of the incidents occurred in the DuBois Unit; \n➢  99% of all incidents occurred within a living unit; \n➢  71% of incidents involved “failure to comply.” \n \nLHS Did the incident occur in a living unit? \nValue  Count  Percent \nYes  876  99% \nNo  11  1% \n \nCLS Did the incident occur in a living unit? \nValue  Count  Percent \nYes  149  97% \nNo  4  3% \n \n \nLHS Incident location (living units): \nValue  Count  Percent \nDuBois  223  25% \nBlack Elk  135  15% \nMiller  135  15% \nRogers  116  13% \nCurtis  103  12% \nKrueger  84  10% \nAddams  80  9% \n \nCLS Incident location (living units): \nValue  Count  Percent \nWells  96  64% \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 21 of 45\n \nValue  Count  Percent \nHughes  42  28% \nKing  11  7% \nYouth and Staff Climate Surveys – Both youth and staff appear to be more responsive in utilizing \nthe youth and staff climate surveys.  It is strongly recommended that both department and facility \nleadership take the time to thoroughly review the agency/jurisdiction count summaries for both the \nyouth and staff climate surveys.  The results can be very insightful and useful for leadership.

(It should be noted that the pandemic and restrictions \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 23 of 45\n \naround visitation impacted these results.  The facility did increase the use of technology for \nvideo visitations.) \n \nDefendants should continue to pay particular attention to each Facility Improvement Plan as each \nFIP includes a section for comments relating to the implementation status of each action step \ncompleted by the PbS Site Coordinator or assigned staff member. Ongoing FIP review comments \nare entered by Facility Administrators, Agency Directors, and the assigned PbS Coach.  This is an \nexcellent way to for the agency and facility leadership to monitor on-going progress with each of \nthe FIP goals and to provide input, guidance, and direction during the process. \nPolicies and Procedures  \n \nThere have not been any revisions made to policy and procedure since the last site visit.   \nYouth Interviews  \nThe Monitor conducted several youth interviews. Approximately sixty-two (62) youth were \ninterviewed during the site visit (formally and informally). About a half-dozen youth were \ninterviewed by Plaintiffs’ counsel by video call. There were significantly fewer requests to talk to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel. During the last site visit, by far the biggest complaint by the youth was being \nbored, the quality of the food and frequency of the same meals being served.  The Defendants \nstated that they would address this issue and consider a 4-6-week menu.  The Monitor did review \nthe new four-week menu prepared which is consistent with the Monitor’s recommendation.  \nDefendants have assessed the menu and added more items that the youth like such as: burritos, \npizza patties, pizza, corn dogs, chicken alfredo, chili dogs, and Mexican lasagna. Staff reported \nthat least favored items such as meatballs and gravy, chicken and gravy, turkey ala king, Salisbury \nsteak, and meatloaf have been removed.  Corn on the cob has been added to the menu and they \nmodified the vegetables to make them more appealing.  The Defendants should continue to discuss \nthe menus in the youth advisory committees to continue to receive input from youth as most youth \ncontinue to complain. \nThe second most  common  complaint  last visit  was that when  selected  canteen  items were \nunavailable there was no communication with or warning to the youth. Thus, the youth could not \nget canteen as deserved. Had communication occurred, they could have picked alternative items.  \nThe Monitor suggested that LHS/CLS leadership  continue to work with the vendor and the \nbusiness office to fix this communication problem and also consider an on-site mini canteen of \nitems that youth desire should their canteen order be unavailable.  The youth work hard to earn \npoints and in turn, earn canteen privileges. The issues with canteen have been going on long \nenough and should be fixed immediately.  \nThe third most common complaint last time was that the RFID bands were uncomfortable (they \nare on the thicker side). The Monitor suggested speaking with the vendor to see if there are any \ntweaks that can be made.  Unfortunately, the bands cannot be changed.   However, there were less \ncomplaints this visit. Perhaps the youth are adapting to the bands.  The overwhelming majority \ncontinue to report that they are rarely confined, if at all, were not restrained that much, and were not \nstrip searched.  \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 24 of 45\n \nThe biggest complaints from youth this visit was the food, canteen out of stock items, being bored, \nmissing school, and phone restrictions.  Youth in general did not frequently complain to the Monitor \nabout  confinement,  restraints,  being  unfairly  treated  by  staff,  or  feeling  unsafe.  Previously, \ndefendants have done an excellent job of essentially eliminating phone restrictions as recommended \nbut there were phone restrictions during this review period. The Monitor requested data as it relates \nto phone restrictions and the data shows that in CLS there were 22 one-day phone limitations in \nwhich youth could only make one phone call per day. Of the 22 youth who had restrictions, 14 of \nthem were able to make Zoom calls.  Most boys in LHS complained of having phone restrictions, \nyet the data does not show there were not any restrictions during this period. Previously the Monitor \n– and PSU staff – had recommended that phone restrictions not be used at all as a punishment except \nfor phone-related violations, and that had improved at the last visit. It is not clear why those \nrestrictions have been reinstated. The Monitor suggests that phone restrictions should not be used as \na behavior management tool at all, and –especially now since there is limited interaction due to the \npandemic. \nCovid-19 required several changes to programming and the general day to day with youth; not just \nat LHS/CLS but in every juvenile facility.  Hopefully, regular programming can resume soon, but \ntime will tell as Covid-19 continues to impact everyone’s lives. Defendants are and should continue \nto identify more resources and continue to implement the programs as recommended by the \nretained  experts.  The Defendants should take advantage of the reduced population and the \navailable staff in planning for the future and developing programs for youth and continuing to offer \nmore creative and other activities for youth while in-person interaction is limited.  \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree. As previously stated, \nthere is a challenge with adequacy of data for many areas (documentation, accuracy, consistency, \nand analysis) thus, some sections do not contain a detailed narrative.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the Court Order into \npolicy and procedure –and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach substantial \ncompliance.   \n \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 25 of 45\n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Based on data and youth interviews, \nmost youth are not being confined for three days, although there appear to be some isolated \nexamples of this occurring. If Defendants improve their quality of data and documentation \nand incorporate the Court Order into policy and procedure – and if and if they ensure that \nno youth are being confined for three or more days, they will reach substantial compliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  data  shows  that  there  are \nfrequent confinements for refusing to participate in programming. Those confinements do \nnot meet the criteria for Administrative Confinement – there is no risk of imminent physical \nharm-  and  appear  to  impermissibly  constitute  punitive  confinements.  The  Monitor \nrecommended  creating  a  policy  which  clearly  outlines  the  criteria  for  administrative \nconfinement so that staff cannot punitively confine youth. Defendants are working on said \npolicy. Defendants also need to reconsider consequences for not participating in various \nprogramming.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he \nor  she  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During this reporting period, there \nwere instances in which administrative confinement was being used for youth who did not \npose a serious risk of imminent physical harm especially in March (see data below). The \nMonitor suggested how to document this requirement in policy and in forms as well as made \nsuggestions to place youth in the day room once they no longer pose a serious risk of \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 26 of 45\n \nimminent physical harm to others.  \n \nFebruary 2020 \nCLS: 9 uses of AC. Average of 152 Minutes. 1 youth went over four \nhours. \nLHS: 59 uses of AC. Average of 168 minutes. 2 youth over four hours. \n \nMarch 2020 \nCLS: 7 uses of AC. Average of 175 minutes.  \nLHS: 69 uses of AC. Average of 240 minutes.  \n15 youth over four hours (as high as 1300 minutes) \n \nApril 2020 \nCLS: 3 uses of AC. Average of 142 minutes. 1 youth over four hours \nLHS: 40 uses of AC: Average of 191 minutes. No youth over four hours \n \nMay 2020 \nCLS: 5 uses of AC. Average of 182 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 37 uses of AC: no youth over four hours.  \nAs stated in the previous report, the Krueger Program (which is used for youth who are seen \nto have more anti-social behaviors) has been modified based on some of the Monitor’s \nrecommendations.  Since the last report, each youth who comes to Krueger and who is also \nenrolled in treatment programming has had a treatment specialist provide one-on-one \nservices in order to keep them current with their assigned treatment groups. Youth at every \nphase of the Krueger Program are afforded these services.  Although youth have behavioral \nplans developed, the program needs to be improved to include more robust behavioral plans \nand the plans need to be revisited with more frequency should a youth not be able to return \nto the home unit in an appropriate period of time.  The Monitor also suggested that the \nDefendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a youth to move through levels 1 and 2 \nand that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the criteria for referral into the program \nas well as criteria for exiting the program and ensure that youth clearly understand why they \nare being placed in Krueger and what they specifically need to do to move through the levels.  \nThe Monitor also suggested allowing youth on levels 1 and 2 to attend school in the school \narea (once education resumes in the school area) and participate in other programming if \ntheir behavior warrants.  \n \nData compiled from the Krueger Living Unit continues to be requested and evaluated by \nUnit Managers and SYC’s. An overview of data compiled from the Krueger Living Unit \nduring January through April shows: \n \nYouth Referred: 124 \nYouth Not Placed: 70 (56%) \nYouth Placed: 54 (44%) \nYouth Placed 1 Time: 48 \nYouth Placed 2 Times: 5 \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 27 of 45\n \nYouth Placed 3 Times: 1 \n \nJan-Apr 2020 (Average Number of Days for Placed Youth) \nPhase 1: 15 \nPhase 2: 4 \nPhase 3: 3 \nThe Monitor spent time (virtually) with PSU and discussed providing “intensive mental \nhealth services designed to return the youth safely to the general population.” The team did \ndevelop  a  detailed  operational  definition  and  the  Monitor  reviewed  documentation  of \nservices provided.  DBT groups have not been running because of Covid-19 but youth are \nreceiving weekly individual DBT sessions. The Sex Offender Treatment group was not \ninterrupted and is continuing. The Monitor suggested that the Defendants retain a mental \nhealth expert to evaluate the program and make recommendations to, among other things, \nensure these services are being provided, including while youth are in AC.  A tracking \nspreadsheet that identifies the treatment group that youth who enter the Krueger Program \nare engaged in at the time of their transfer into Krueger.  The tracking sheet is updated in \ncooperation with all the treatment specialists to ensure the information is communicated \nacross  the  different  staff  classifications  involved.  Policy  and  procedure  and  a  quality \nassurance  review  process  needs  to  be  implemented,  and  documentation  needs  to  be \nstreamlined. \nDue to the lack of data available, the Monitor is unable assess compliance as to the 30- \nminute safety/security checks.   \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were youth confined for over \nfour (4) hours this reporting period however, the number of youth confined for over 4 hours \nis less than the last reporting period (see response in previous question). March had a \nsignificant number of youth confined over 4 hours without meeting the requirements of this \nsection  of  the  Consent  Decree.    This  also  occurred  in  other  months.  Some  of  these \nconfinements reported and documented that youth remained on AC were not recommended \nby PSU, which also is a violation of the requirements.   \nWith  this  said,  Defendants  are  accurately  capturing  confinement  time,  number  total \nplacements,  average  confinement  time  per  month,  and  number  of  days  without  AC \nplacements. Defendants now need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring they \nare following this Court Order, draft policy, and procedure with AC placement criteria, and \ncontinue to QA this data. \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 28 of 45\n \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Most  youth  serve  the \nadministrative confinement on their home unit. Some youth are serving their confinement \non Krueger and are referred to the “Krueger Program.” Although youth have behavioral \nplans developed, the program needs to be improved to include more robust behavioral plans \nand the plan needs to be revisited with more frequency should a youth not be able to return \nto general population promptly.   \n \nThe Monitor also suggested that the Defendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a \nyouth to move through levels 1 and 2 and that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the \ncriteria for referral into the program.  Defendants’ data and documentation has improved \n(see above Krueger data). Defendants need to incorporate the court order into policy and \nprocedure and train staff accordingly. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances in April \nand May of youth being confined for over 24 hours. There were two instances in March \nwhere two youths were confined beyond 24 hours. Both youth were transferred to other \nfacilities. Defendants need to improve their quality of data and documentation with respect \nto the “commenced plan” and incorporate the Court Order into policy and procedure.  \nDefendants are close to being in substantial compliance.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 29 of 45\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated.  The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. A quality \nassurance mechanism needs to be finalized. \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. The Monitor recommended that Defendants replace the \nexisting room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for \nsecure environments.  The Defendants have completed the renovations in seven living \nunits with a plan for completion of the other cottages by July 2021. The new replacement \nfurniture is consistent with what the Monitor would expect to see in a secure facility and \nshould certainly reduce the opportunity for suicidal incidents within the youth rooms. \nThis is a huge investment by Defendants and shows their commitment to complying with \nthis provision. \nThe Monitor did not observe rooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of \nthe room. Staff can clearly see the youth through the window. Room searches are not \ntaking place as often as before due to a change in Covid-19 procedures.  The Monitor \nrecommended that searches continue to be completed and documented.  There are youth \nwho still have blankets over their heads when they nap/sleep in room and staff need to \ncontinue to redirect youth and ensure that the youth are responsive when they do their \nsafety/welfare checks.  \n \nDue to the lack of data available, the Monitor is unable assess compliance as to the 30- \nminute safety/security checks.  Defendants have purchased, installed, and are using the \nnew electronic system in all the units.  Staff have adjusted to the new system very well.  \nDefendants need to modify their policy and procedure related to safety/welfare checks.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues \nto recommend increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every \n15  minutes  when  youth  are  confined  to  their rooms  as  this  is supported  by  JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \nDefendants should be commended for the vast improvement on these safety/welfare \nchecks and for investing in the technology needed. \n \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 30 of 45\n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most youth did not complain about \naccess to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage.  If Defendants improve their \nquality of data and documentation, and incorporate the Court Order  into policy and \nprocedure, they will be in substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented but when PSU responded is not documented in a way that makes it \neasy to assess compliance.  Also, since PSU staff are not physically present on weekends and \nsome evening hours outside of the four hours they are required to do (although they \naveraged around 6.6 hours on weekends this period), it is difficult for PSU staff to engage \nyouth in a meaningful way during this time.  A quality assurance program needs to be \ndeveloped and documentation should be streamlined.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nsuggests that the Defendants consider utilizing an expert in order to further develop the \nmental health program at LHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  requested  any \ndocumentation  indicating  that  confinement  is  contraindicated  and  there  were  no \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 31 of 45\n \ninstances documented during this review period. There is a form “Psychology Input for \nSecurity Decision” which is where the contraindication would be documented and there \nis a policy (Policy 500.70.04). \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  Due to the lack of data available, the Monitor is unable assess \ncompliance as to the 30- minute safety/security checks.  The agency implemented an \nelectronic, software-based rounds checking system- RFID. There continues to be regular \nquality assurance reviews in order to increase compliance. Following an internal review \nof documentation, random days and times across all units and shifts are selected each \nmonth to perform auditing.  Any discrepancies are entered into the “Accountability \nTracking” spreadsheet to help identify staff who need more training/assistance/discipline. \nThere was no formal discipline or “Letters of Expectation” during this reporting period.  \nThere were 3 job instructions (down from 16) given during this reporting period. PSU \nstaff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone.  \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing \nthe frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. Defendants should be commended for the \nvast improvement on these safety/welfare checks and for implementing the electronic \nsystem as quickly as they did. Staff should also be commended for embracing this new \nsystem.   \n \nf.   Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary in \nnature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and implemented.  \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 32 of 45\n \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is a lack of documentation \nas to this provision. Social worker visits, mental health services, and other health services \nare provided in general.  Documentation, quality assurance, and policy and procedure \nneed to be improved/completed in order for the Monitor to fully assess compliance.  \n \nii.  Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Youth’s participation in Skills \nStreaming is tracked across sessions and reported to the youth’s Social Worker and OJOR \nfor consideration, but there is an overall lack of documentation as to specific programming \nthat occurs daily. Staff did confirm that youth in Krueger levels 1 and 2 do not receive \nrehabilitative programming that was scheduled or in process which is a violation of the \nAgreement.  Instead, these youths are limited to PSU-led small group sessions and evidence-\nbased cognitive behavioral treatment in the form of Skills Streaming. Skills Streaming is \ndesigned to support the youth’s ability to successfully re-engage in treatment programming \nwhile on Krueger phase 3 and subsequently complete their other assigned programs.  In \naddition, the PbS data shows that youth in Krueger average only 0.09 hours (just a few \nminutes) per day in programming. \n  \nDBT groups have not been running because of Covid-19 but youth are receiving weekly \nindividual DBT sessions. The Sex Offender Treatment group was not interrupted and is \ncontinuing. The Monitor suggested that the Defendants retain a mental health expert to \nevaluate the program and make recommendations to, among other things, ensure these \nservices are being provided.   \n \niii.   Educational services with the general population to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Covid-19  has  changed  how  the \neducational services are being provided to youth at LHS/CLS.  During the week of March 16, \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 33 of 45\n \n2020, school and treatment staff began planning for virtual/on-line education services to be \ndelivered to youth on the unit with staff working off-site. The educational format has been \napproved by DPI and is consistent with what other schools throughout the country have \nimplemented during COVID-19.  On March 24, the schools began providing education on \nthe units with most education staff working off-site. The schedule has been distributed along \nwith a training brief assisting with Chromebooks and logging into Edgenuity. Applicable \nstaff continue to be monitoring e-mail, conducting phone calls, and performing Zoom/video \ncalls. \n \nIn general (prior to Covid-19) educational services for general population occurred in the \nclassrooms in the school area.  Youth in the Targeted Intervention Program (“TIP”) attend \nclasses in the school area but separate from the general population. Youth in Krueger do not \nreceive educational services in the school area (except for youth on Phase 3) but remain on the \nliving unit.  The PbS data also showed approximately 2.27 hours of schooling for youth in \nKrueger, which is  slightly fewer than the average daily hours of instruction for other units.  \nUnfortunately, the average daily duration of education hours remains low for both LHS and \nCLS, at around 3 hours per day.  The Monitor feels that the facility needs to increase the \ndaily education hours as best possible as this will have a positive impact on meaningful \nprograms and reduce youth idleness. \nThe Monitor recommends that all youth regardless of status have education in the school area.  \nThe  Defendants  should  further  engage  the  education  expert  to  make  further \nrecommendations that should be implemented, including an assessment of the quality and \nbenefits of the online education system Defendants are using. Defendants should implement \nthe recommendations made by the educational consultant, including those in the June 1, \n2019 memorandum to LHS/CLS. The Defendants also need to focus on bringing more \nprogramming into LHS/CLS, especially programming culturally relevant and specific to \nthe race and genders of the youth who are at the facility.  \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  “Out  time”  has  significantly \nimproved over the last year.  In general, youth are out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.  \n(with the exceptions in Krueger discussed previously) and for youth in quarantine due to \nCovid-19 safety measures implemented by Defendants.  The Monitor regularly saw youth \nconversing with other youth and staff during out time.  In youth interviews, youth stated that \nthey are not really confined to their rooms at all.  Youth are self-confining at a higher rate \nthan the Monitor would like to see. Youth still want more structured activities when they are \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 34 of 45\n \nout of their rooms and feel they do not really do anything, which continues to be a significant \nproblem and could lead to self-confining.    Enhancing programs and meaningful activities \nfor the Krueger program should have a positive impact and allow for youth to return to their \nhome cottages more quickly. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most meals take place out of the \nroom.  Meals are now being documented for all youth   Staff are now able to document when \nthe meal is eaten in their room voluntarily or staff imposed. The Monitor did not witness \nyouth eating in their rooms but has reviewed documentation in which youth are eating meals \nin their room.  Documentation has improved from the last site visit and will further improve \nwith the RFID system.  Policy and procedure need to incorporate this section of the Court \nOrder and youth should be eating out of their rooms unless there is a substantial threat of \nphysical harm. \nvi.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving much more than the 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week in a large \nmajority of the time. PbS Unit log data, which is now tied to the Guardian RFID system, \nreflects 9.85 hours of in rooms for “sleeping” time and only 1.68 hours for “in sleeping \nrooms” (operational confinement), leaving 12.76 hours out of room for other programs and \nactivities.  This  represents  a  significant  increase  in  out  of  room  time  now  that  room \nconfinement for operational activities such as split halls, confinement for shift change, \ncounts, and medicine pass were discontinued.  Similar data is also reflected in the Krueger \nUnit, indicating that the youth assigned to the Krueger program are also spending much \nmore time out of their rooms than in previous monitoring periods.   \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. The Monitor suggested that staff ask the \nyouth to sign off that they were informed of their rights and were provided with written \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 35 of 45\n \nnotice of his/her rights.  Youth continue to receive their notification of rights/grievance \nprocedures when they are placed in administrative confinement. The process for obtaining \na youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has been proposed as a \npart  of  youth  receiving  PSU  thinking  chain  reports  during  the  first  stage  of  the \nadministrative confinement process. However, the process and forms need to be enacted and \nwritten into policy. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis more consistently. Documentation needs to continue to be completed and consistently \napplied  to  all  situations.  Documentation,  data  collection  and  reliability,  and  quality \nassurance needs to continue to be improved. Also, documentation needs to be created that \nprove a youth was promptly provided with the report upon the completion of room \nconfinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated during the previous reporting period.  There needs to be continued focus on \ntraining, skills development and coaching, programming, and continued focus on overall \natmosphere.   \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  eliminated \nduring the previous reporting period.  There needs to be continued focus on training, skills \ndevelopment and coaching, programming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 36 of 45\n \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, but data and documentation show that \nthere was an overall increase in use of mechanical restraints during this reporting period. \nIncident reports also show uses of physical restraints when alternatives, such as the use of \nCARE teams, may have been possible. Defendants need to focus on reducing the use of \nmechanical (as well as physical) restraints.  Defendants need to document and establish that \nthere were not less restrictive means available and quality assurance measures and final \npolicy and procedure are in place. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of mechanical restraints has \ndecreased in CLS and increased in LHS over the last four months.  Population is significantly \nlower over the last few months (average population of LHS/CLS December of 2019 was 116.5 \nand in May 2020 it was 86.8) \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \nOctober 2019:     36 uses \nNovember 2019:   21 uses \nDecember 2019:   33 uses \nJanuary 2020:     25 uses \nFebruary 2020:    37 uses \nMarch 2020:     38 uses \nApril 2020:     37 uses  \nMay 2020:    27 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \nOctober 2019:     10 uses \nNovember 2019:   11 uses \nDecember 2019:    5 uses \nJanuary 2020:      8 uses \nFebruary 2020:     2 uses \nMarch 2020:      7 uses \nApril 2020:      6 uses  \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 37 of 45\n \nMay 2020:     0 uses \n \nDocumentation needs to be improved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm \nexisted, and when and how that decision is reviewed. Defendants do have critical outcome \nmeasures for restraints.  Defendants need to continue to work towards reducing the use of \nmechanical restraints, develop better documentation and quality assurance measures. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nii.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage. However, as noted \nabove, restraints are being used more frequently than they should be. With quality assurance \nmeasures and continuing to focus on reducing the use of restraints, Defendants may be close \nto achieving substantial compliance with this provision. \n \n iii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With policy revisions and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants will be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 38 of 45\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. With better documentation, policy \nrevisions, and quality assurance measures, Defendants will be close to achieving substantial \ncompliance with this provision. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With better documentation, policy revisions, and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants will be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nf.   Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation. However, de-escalation training needs to be completed more often \n(regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue to develop this skill. These skills \nare also important to help staff identify and prevent situations which might lead to \ndisruption or altercations before such incidents occur Proper de-escalation cannot be \ntrained only once, or even only once a year. The Monitor continues to suggest having staff \nwho are very good at de-escalation work with staff who could use a refresher or with new staff \nespecially since a large majority are new.  Staff continue to want additional training on de-\nescalation. \n \ng.   Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be  left alone in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence that youth \nwere placed in mechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes during this reporting period. \nWith  policy  revisions  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to \nachieving substantial compliance with this provision.   \n \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 39 of 45\n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process itself is being \nanalyzed for improvement.  The length of time youth spend in restraints is now being \ndocumented as part of the Incident Debrief process. If Defendants maintain this, they will \nbe close to achieving substantial compliance.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwere two (2) strip searches in the month of March and no strip searches in the months of \nApril  and  May.  The  two  strip  searches  conducted  were  approved  by  PSU  for \ncontraband/self-harm  reasons.  The  policy  for  searches  needs  to  be  finalized  and  QA \ndeveloped. Defendants are very close to being in substantial compliance. \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwere two (2) strip searches in the month of March and no strip searches in the months of \nApril  and  May.  The  two  strip  searches  conducted  were  approved  by  PSU  for \ncontraband/self-harm reasons.   The policy for searches needs to be finalized and QA \ndeveloped. Defendants are very close to being in substantial compliance. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwere two (2) strip searches in the month of March and no strip searches in the months of \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 40 of 45\n \nApril  and  May.  The  two  strip  searches  conducted  were  approved  by  PSU  for \ncontraband/self-harm reasons. Documentation needs to be improved as to how staff are \nensuring that unintended individuals cannot view the search (detail the area where search is \noccurring, state that there are no recording devices, and document who is present in the area, \netc.)  If  documentation  and  policy  revisions  are  made,  substantial  compliance  will  be \nobtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwere two (2) strip searches in the month of March. Documentation needs to be improved \ndetailing the area where search is conducted and how other youth cannot view the youth \nbeing  strip  searched.    If  documentation  and  policy  revisions  are  made,  substantial \ncompliance can be obtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there \nwere two (2) strip searches in the month of March.  Documentation needs to be improved as \nto the gender identity of the staff conducting the search because the search is being conducted \nby someone other than a medical professional. The Monitor previously recommended form \nchanges for documentation purposes. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that \nstaff have been trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor is told by direct care \nstaff that PSU is consulted. Documentation needs to be improved.  \n \n4.  Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The  process  for  tracking  and \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 41 of 45\n \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. With continued practices and QA developed, Defendants will be in \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most staff have been trained  in \nMANDT and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. Several training \nsessions have occurred during this reporting period. The Monitor recommends increasing the \ntraining frequency for staff to increase their experience and skill levels in managing and de-\nescalating situations before they result in the use of force, restraint and/or isolation. The use \nof  force  review  process  continues  to  improve.    It  continues  to  be  more  thorough, \ncomprehensive, and timely. Corrective action plans when force was used where it could have \nbeen avoided are being done in most cases. The Monitor recommended in instances where de-\nescalation was successful, those examples should be used as a training tool for other staff \nincluding having other staff view the videos. \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of id le time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  understands  that \nchanges had to be made during the pandemic.  The Monitor’s recommendations are the same \nas last report.  Many of the recommendations that were made in the February 2018 technical \nassistance report have been implemented such as family events, yoga/Zumba, increased \ntournaments, dog therapy, more arts and music, writing contests, living unit decorating \ncontests, CREW. Youth advisory and family councils have been implemented, regularly \nscheduled, and the Monitor’s recommendations have been incorporated into the process \n(agendas, minutes, frequency, and increased staff involvement). Recreation leaders focus on \nart and music. There have been musical instruments purchased and music lab enhanced.  \nAlthough there were more activities for youth during this reporting period, there is still a \nsignificant and excessive amount of idle time.  Now that youth are basically out of their rooms \nfrom  8  a.m.  to  8  p.m.,  there  is  a  need  for  more  activities/programming.  These \nactivities/programming should be in addition to school, not as a substitute for education.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and \nvolunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for youth.  There has been \nan activities committee established. Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured \nprogram and activity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours. As mentioned previously, \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 42 of 45\n \nincreasing education hours, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED, can \ngreatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development strategies \nthrough meaningful education and vocational programming.   \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have clearly made staff \nwellness a priority and this is evident in my interactions with staff.   Defendants should \ncontinue to focus on training and developing staff in order for them to feel safe and actively \nengage with youth.  Even though education had to change due to the pandemic, there is an \nurgent need to address the teacher vacancy rate. A plan needs to be developed that will \nprovide mandated education to youth on a daily basis (certifying security staff, combining \nclassrooms, increasing student ratios than currently, reducing the number of teachers on \nleave or vacation, reaching out to community schools/substitutes etc.)  \n \nAlthough the population is lower at LHS/CLS due to Covid-19, the agency needs to develop \nmeaningful methods for reducing youth populations post-Covid-19. Even though there were \nno intakes during the majority of this reporting period, there was still a significant reduction \nin population. An analysis should be completed to understand how the population was \nreduced (not including lack of intakes) and determine how the Agency can continue to reduce \npopulation at LHS/CLS.   \n \nAs stated in previous reports, this might include expediting the OJOR process and evaluating \nyouth  for  placement  under  community  supervision,  including  intensive  community \nsupervision, as permitted by state law.  Defendants need to continue to work towards \ndeveloping smaller, geographically located Type 1 facilities and also to evaluate whether there \nare alternative kinds of facilities and/or intensive community services to which youth could \nbe released. In October 2019, the Agency submitted a request to the Joint Committee on \nFinance requesting the authority to construct two Type 1 facilities, as well as necessary \nfunding required to construct the facilities. There does not seem to be any more progress \nmade as this section. This needs to be a priority or Defendants will not be able to come into \nsubstantial compliance with this Court Order.  \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 43 of 45\n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There are no new updates. As \npreviously reported, DOC has identified sections of the Administrative Code that need to be \nmodified, but significant revisions have not yet occurred.  Defendants need to continue \ndrafting interim policies for LHS/CLS while also developing final Code revisions. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There has been an improvement in \nmeeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority of \ncases.  When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a corrective \naction plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are completed (QA \ncomponent). A framework for other QA measures relating to the consent decree was being \ncreated but has not been completed. \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  reviewed  sample \nperformance  goals,  reviewed  PbS  in  great  detail,  and  made  suggestions  for  monthly \nperformance measures and how to incorporate into policy. As discussed throughout this \nreport, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and \nto improve the quality of life for youth and staff.  The Monitor remains confident that the \nDefendants will create a competent quality assurance program especially with the addition \nof the new RFID system and dedicated personnel. \n \n \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 44 of 45\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has changed everyone’s daily life.  LHS/CLS youth and staff are no \nexception.  Significant emergency plans were developed and put into place in March of 2020.  \nEducation, programming, population, activities, and visitations had to drastically change due to the \npandemic.  Many in-person activities had to change to “virtual”.  Despite the drastic changes, the \nyouth and staff have adjusted quite well.  As previously reported, the overall atmosphere today has \nvastly improved from a year ago.  The population has significantly been reduced during this reporting \nperiod.  The Monitor recognizes that some of this is due to intakes being stopped due to Covid-19, \nbut the lack of intakes does not account for most of the reduction.  The Monitor encourages the \nAgency to look at changes put into place due to Covid-19 to see if these population reduction \nmeasures  can  be  continued.    Agency  and  facility  leadership  are  to  be  commended  for  their \ncommitment to maintaining operational activities as best possible during the Covid-19 response and \nremaining focused on reducing room confinement as best possible.  This obviously required increased \nattention on programming, social distancing and cleanliness in order to reduce risk of infection within \nthe facility while ensuring that the answer to the operational concerns was not through the use of \n“room confinement”.  \nThe Monitor feels that the facility can benefit from further implementation of the Care Team model.  \nAs noted throughout the report, the facility would also benefit from utilizing a mental health expert \nto evaluate the mental health program and reengaging the educational expert. \nThe  facility would  also  benefit from  an increased focus on reducing  idleness and  increasing \nmeaningful activities, particularly during weekends and evening hours.  This is even more important \nduring the changes to daily life due to Covid-19.  The facility should continue to work on improving \nthe behavior management system, continue with their progress in implementing DBT, providing \nimproved and increased youth incentives that will help in reducing many behavioral incidents and \nreduce the high number of self-requested confinements and program refusals.   \nContinued efforts need to be made to further engage the educational expert, reduce teacher vacancies, \nand increase educational time and quality. Regular training in de-escalation and physical restraint \ntechniques need to continue to occur. Policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be \ndeveloped as well as administrative code. Continued implementation of the new quality assurance \nprogram needs to remain a primary goal.  Much progress has been made with respect to data and \nquality assurance measures.  It is clear that the PbS data much more accurately reflects the unit \nactivities using the RFID as a means to better track these outcome measures.  The RFID system has \nbeen an important facility upgrade, particularly as it relates to data measures, but more importantly, \nto ensuring for a verifiable and easier means of tracking the youth safety and wellness checks when \nyouth are in their rooms.  The physical plant improvements need to continue as scheduled.  Although \nthere are improvements to be made, the Defendants continue to make progress- even during this \ndifficult time.  \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 119   Filed: 07/09/20   Page 45 of 45\n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n45 \n ",

Initial Placement  \nA.  Any staff member, or youth by way of self-referral, may recommend that a youth be \nplaced in clinical observation.   \nB.  Those authorized to place youth in clinical observation include Psychologist Supervisors, \nPsychologists-Licensed, Psychological Associates, Crisis Intervention Workers .   \nC.  If the staff listed in I.B. are not immediately available for consultation or for evaluation of \nthe  youth,  a  Registered  Nurse,  ADO,  Security  Director,    Security  Supervisor  or \nSuperintendent may place a youth in clinical observation. Reasonable attempts should \nbe made to consult PSU prior to placing a youth in clinical observation.  If non-PSU staff \nplace a youth in clinical observation, a Security Supervisor shall ensure that PSU staff \nare notified as soon as possible after the placement.  \nD.  If on-site, staff authorizing the initial placement shall verbally inform the youth of the \nreason for placement into clinical observation at the time of placement. When the staff \nauthorizing the initial placement is not on-site, the staff placing a youth on observation \nshall inform the youth of the reason for the placement.   \n \nII.   PSU monitoring   \nA.  Initial Evaluation   \n\nC l inical Observation   EFFECTIVE DATE  PAGE NUMBER \n2/1/2017   3 of 8  \n1.  When a clinical observation placement occurs during business hours, PSU staff \nshall evaluate the youth face to face as soon as possible, but on the same day.  \n2.  When a clinical observation placement occurs outside of business hours, PSU \non-call  staff  shall  be  consulted  via  telephone  by  the  on-site  supervisor  to \ndetermine appropriate level of monitoring and property allowance. PSU staff \nshall complete a face to face evaluation of the youth as soon as clinically \nappropriate, but no longer than 16 hours after initial placement.   \nB.  Subsequent PSU evaluations shall take place at a minimum of every working day while \nthe youth remains in clinical observation with 5, 10 or 15 minute checks. In the case of \nweekends or holidays the time period between PSU evaluations shall never exceed \nthree calendar days.  \nC.  If a youth is placed in clinical observation with constant monitoring subsequent PSU \nevaluations shall take place daily regardless of whether it is a weekend or holiday.   \nD.  PSU staff shall consult with registered nursing staff as needed when any organic causes \nfor youth’s clinical observation placement are suspected.  \nE.  PSU staff shall instruct other DJC staff regarding the clinical management of the youth.   \nF.  PSU staff shall verbally advise a youth of the results of the initial evaluation as soon as \npossible but within 24 hours of the evaluation. Youth shall be provided with written \nresults of the evaluation within ten working days unless providing paper is clinically \ncontraindicated. A copy of DOC-27C may serve as the written results of the evaluation.   \nG.  For youth under age 18 placed in observation status, PSU staff shall notify the youth’s \nparent/guardian of the youth’s observation status. \nH.  Youth  placed  in  room  confinement  under  observation  status  shall  be  provided \ntherapeutic activities such as counseling, meetings with PSU staff, and interactions with \nstaff members trained to work with youth engaged in or threatening self-harm or suicide.   \nI.  Staff making placement decisions for youth on observation status shall consider whether \nthe youth can remain safely in observation status in general population. \n \nIII.   HSU Monitoring  \nA.  PSU staff will notify a HSU staff member whenever a youth is placed on constant \nmonitoring, 5 minute monitoring, or 10 minute monitoring.   \nB.  A  Registered  Nurse  shall  complete  a  health  assessment  of  a  youth  in  clinical \nobservation status on constant monitoring, 5 minute monitoring or 10 minute monitoring, \nat least once per day to rule out any organic causes for youth’s clinical observation \nplacement and to monitor youth’s well-being.  \nC.  PSU  staff  will  notify  a  HSU  staff  member  whenever  a  youth  is  taken  off  constant \nmonitoring, 5 minute monitoring, or 10 minute monitoring.   \nIV.   Supervision   \nA.  Assignment of supervision levels  \n1.  PSU staff shall determine the level of supervision.   \n2.  PSU staff shall authorize any decrease in the level of supervision.   \n3.  If  PSU  staff  cannot  be  readily  consulted,  staff  may  increase  the  level  of \nsupervision if circumstances indicate that the youth has an increased risk of \nharm to self.   \n\nC l inical Observation   EFFECTIVE DATE  PAGE NUMBER \n2/1/2017   4 of 8  \nB.  Close observation   \n1.  Every youth who is placed in clinical observation shall, at a minimum, be placed \nin close observation status.  \n2.  Staff shall observe the activities of a youth in close observation at staggered \nintervals not to exceed 15 minutes. Observations checks shall take place at \nroom-front and be recorded on DOC-112B.   \n3.  PSU staff will assess the level of close monitoring warranted.  \ni.  15 minute - may be in the housing unit  \nii.  10 minute - in observation room   \niii.  5 minute - in observation room   \nC.  Constant observation   \n1.  Youth at high risk for imminent suicidal behavior and self-harm behaviors shall \nbe placed on constant observation.   \n2.  Constant observation involves continuous line-of-sight monitoring by a security \nstaff whose assignment is dedicated to the monitoring and well-being of the \nyouth.  Observed  self-injurious  behaviors  shall  be  immediately  reported  to \nSupervisor/designee,  PSU,  and  HSU.  Observations  shall  be  recorded  on \nDO112B at intervals not to exceed 15 minutes.   \n3.  For any youth who is placed in constant observation, PSU staff shall consider \nand document on DOC-27C whether a transfer to a state treatment facility is \nappropriate.   \nD.  A youth may require mechanical restraint while in clinical observation status.  \nE.  Youth who have a history of suicidal thoughts or feelings may be appropriate for settings \nother than clinical observation, provided that there is a treatment plan, clinical follow-up \nby PSU staff, and periodic review at multidisciplinary meetings.   \nF.  Closed circuit television monitoring may be used in addition to, but never a substitute for, \nthe above monitoring levels.   \nG.  Property Allowance   \n1.  PSU staff shall determine a youth’s allowed property in relation to the level of \nrisk and after consultation with a Supervisor.    \n2.  The following items are a starting point when determining allowed property at \nthe  beginning of  a  clinical observation  placement.

Youth in clinical observation on 15 minute observations may be housed in a \nstandard housing unit.    \nJ.  Follow-up   \nYouth who are released from clinical observation shall be interviewed by PSU staff \non the next calendar day, within the seven calendar days, and at least within thirty \ndays after release.   \nK.  Staffing   \n\nC l inical Observation   EFFECTIVE DATE  PAGE NUMBER \n2/1/2017   6 of 8  \nSecurity staffing for housing units that contain clinical observation rooms shall be \nsufficient  to  perform  the  necessary  observation  checks  and  corresponding \ndocumentation.   \nL.  Off-site Healthcare Facilities   \n1.  In the event that a youth is assessed and/or admitted to an off-site healthcare \nfacility, staff at that facility will be notified of the youth’s observation status prior \nto transfer to care. The particular facility’s policies and procedures regarding \nsuicide risk assessment and prevention, rather than those of DJC, will apply for \nthe duration of the youth’s stay.   \n2.  When the youth returns from the off-site healthcare facility, DJC staff shall \nplace the youth back in clinical observation status until evaluated by PSU staff.   \n3.  PSU staff shall evaluate a youth as soon as possible, on the same day of return \nfrom  the  off-site  healthcare  facility,  to  evaluate  risk  and  determine  the \nappropriate level of supervision.   \nV.   Extended Stays in Clinical Observation   \nA.  If  a  youth  approaches  14  days  in  clinical  observation,  PSU  staff  shall  follow  the \nprocedures outlined below and described in Wisconsin Administrative Code s. DOC 375.   \nB.

LITSCHER, et al.,  \n \n  Defendants. \n                           \n \nDEFENDANTS’ REPORT ON USE OF OC SPRAY PURSUANT TO THE \nCOURT’S PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n                           \n \nDefendants, Jon E. Litscher, John D. Paquin, Wendy A. Peterson, and Brian \nGustke  (collectively,  “Defendants”),  by  their  undersigned  attorneys,  Crivello \nCarlson, S.C., and pursuant to the Court’s Preliminary Injunction, hereby submit \nthis Report on the use of OC Spray. \nInjunction, Section C.4 \n“Based on the review in the preceding paragraph, by October 31, 2017, defendants \nshall  prepare  and  provide  to  counsel  and  the  court  a  plan  to  further  reduce  or \neliminate any remaining use of chemical agents.” \nMethodology \nThe  August  2017  report  on  the  use  of  OC  showed  that  OC  was  used  in \nresponse  to  a  variety  of  precipitating  events,  many  of  which  have  multiple \ncomponents  and,  if  not  responded  to  appropriately,  pose  a  significant  threat  to \nPage 1 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 2 of 10\nyouth and staff safety as well as the effective operation of the facility. DJC therefore \ndeveloped  a  multi-faceted  plan,  including  consideration  of  several  types  of \napproaches: \n•  Steps to reduce OC use that are directly responsive to the specific types of \nincidents previously identified as leading to use of OC. Note that many of \nthese steps have already been taken in response to other requirements in the \ninjunction. \n•  Steps to reduce the types of incidents that lead to the use of OC. \n•  Steps directly related to the use of OC and the follow-up response to incidents \ninvolving OC deployment.  \nFor  the  latter  two  categories,  DJC  reviewed  standards,  recommendations,  and \noptions from several sources, including: \n•  The PbS Blueprint section on “Responses to Misbehavior: Restraints,” which \nincludes a variety of policies and practices designed to reduce use of all types \nof restraints, including chemical agents. \n•  The LHS PbS Facility Improvement Plan for reducing use of OC, which was \ndeveloped in consultation with DJC’s PbS Coach. \n•  A Center for Children’s Law and Policy Fact Sheet on Chemical Agents in \nJuvenile Facilities (published 5/14/2012). \n•  A  plan  developed  by  the  Oklahoma  Office  of  Juvenile  Justice  in  2016  to \neliminate use of OC in its facilities within a 24-month period. \nPage 2 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 3 of 10\nPlan \nResponses to Injunction \nSection C.1. of the injunction requires that as of July 21, 2017, OC be used “only \nwhen a youth is engaging in physical harm to others or to prevent the youth from \ncausing bodily harm to another.”  Several of the most common precipitating events \nfor  OC  use  from  January  –  June  2017 did  not  necessarily  meet  this  standard. \nTherefore, several changes in practice have taken place. \n•  The  second  most  common  precipitating  event  was  “refusing  directives  to \ncease abusing property in an unsafe manner.” This included actions such as \ncovering  up  cameras  or  windows,  thereby  preventing  staff  from  properly \nperforming checks to ensure youth safety. Since the injunction, this type of \nincident has been less common, which LHS management believes is due to \nyouth being in RHU for shorter periods of time and having a more structured \nschedule of out-time while they are in RHU. When such an incident does \noccur, staff may need to enter the room to remove the items being mis-used. \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  if  the  youth  then  responds  in  a  physically \naggressive or threatening manner, the use of OC may then be warranted. \n \n•  The third most common precipitating event was “refusing to comply with \nmovement.”  LHS  staff  are  now  directed  to  use  a trained  hands-on  escort \ntechnique  to  achieve  required  movement,  after  attempts  to  gain  verbal \ncompliance  are  unsuccessful.  Again,  should  the  youth  become  physically \nPage 3 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 4 of 10\naggressive or resistive in a manner that presents a risk of bodily harm, OC \nmay then be used. \n \n•  The fourth most common precipitating event was holding arms out of the trap \ndoor,  preventing  it  from  being  closed  and  impeding  unit  operations.  LHS \nmanagement  believes  that  the  frequency  of  these  incidents  has  also \ndecreased due to youth being in RHU for shorter periods and having a more \nstructured  schedule.  Staff  attempt  to  place  youth  who  are  prone  to  this \nbehavior in rooms where they will not impede operations as much. When it \ndoes  occur,  staff  work  around  the  behavior  as  much  as  possible,  without \ngiving undue attention to the behavior, such as by using a plastic shield to \nprotect staff and youth when they must pass the youth’s door. \nPreventing Incidents That Could Lead to Use of OC \nThe steps outlined in this section of the plan are arguably the most important.  \nBecause OC can now be used only when a youth is engaging in physical harm to \nothers or to prevent the youth from causing bodily harm to another, the goal of any \nfurther  steps  to  reduce  use  of  OC  cannot  simply  be  to  reduce  the  number  of \nincidents in which OC is used. Rather, it must be to reduce the use of OC while \nmaintaining safety of youth and staff. This is primarily achieved by preventing or \ndiffusing incidents before they reach the point of potential bodily harm. Otherwise, \nthe harm to youth or staff resulting from not intervening in an aggressive incident, \nor from intervening physically without use of OC, could outweigh the effects of \nPage 4 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 5 of 10\nusing  OC  to  prevent  such  injury.  Maintaining  a  secure  and  orderly  facility  is \nessential to safety for both youth and staff. \n \nAvailable  information  from  multiple  sources  on  how  to  prevent  and  diffuse \npotentially dangerous incidents consistently follows themes of keeping youth busy \nand engaged, providing effective training for staff, and providing effective services \nfor youth. The steps outlined below are either underway or in the planning stages. \n \n•  Engaging youth in a full schedule of programming to keep youth busy:  Daytime \nschool and treatment schedules have been revised, both in general population \nand in restrictive housing. Additional activities such as basketball tournaments, \nexercise programs, and crafts have also been added, and further revisions to \nevening schedules are in process. Recruitment of dedicated Recreation Leader \nstaff is nearly complete, which will offer additional resources to ensure activities \nand programming during the evening hours, when most OC incidents occurred. \n \n•  Ensuring staff are trained on topics such as de-escalation, crisis intervention, \nadolescent development, mental health, and trauma informed care:  All new \nsecurity staff are trained on each of these topics during the Youth Counselor \nPreservice Academy, and annual update training for all security staff includes \nde-escalation  and  suicide  prevention.  In  addition,  56  CLS/LHS  staff  across \nmultiple disciplines have recently been trained in the 2-day Crisis Intervention \nPartners  training.    Treatment  staff  have  been  trained  in  Motivational \ninterviewing and a number of staff, including TIP unit staff, have been trained \nPage 5 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 6 of 10\nin  DBT.  Future  training  efforts  will  include  ethics  and  boundaries  and \nadditional trainings on the above-listed topics. \n \n•  Ensuring  staff  are  trained  on  approved  physical  force  techniques  and \nappropriate use of restraints: All security staff receive initial 40-hour training in \nPrinciples of Subject Control and 8 hours of training on incapacitating agents \n(including  exposure),  with  annual  4-hour  update  training.  Non-security  staff \nreceive 24-hour training focused on verbalization skills, threat assessment, first \nresponse, and defensive techniques. \n \n•  Ensuring  adequate  staffing,  including  enough  mental  health professionals  to \nrespond to youths’ needs: DJC is working aggressively to recruit security staff, \nincluding by holding recruitment events throughout the state and continuing \nwith local Youth Counselor Preservice Academies. LHS has added mental health \nclinicians and increased the availability of mental health services to all youth. \nAdditional positions, including Youth Counselors, nurses, and a psychologist, \nwere authorized through the 2017-19 biennial budget. \n \n•  A crisis response team, composed of staff highly skilled in verbal de-escalation, is \ncalled to non-emergency situations in an effort to resolve issues without the use \nof physical restraint: LHS is currently in the planning stages of developing these \ncrisis response teams. A related effort has recently been implemented in the \nschool with the creation of the “STAR” room, which stands for “Stop, Think, Act, \nand Review.”  Youth are referred to the STAR room by teachers in the same \nPage 6 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 7 of 10\nmanner youth are referred to any school office.  This resource is designed to \nallow  youth  to  de-escalate  or  self-regulate  if  they  become  disruptive  in  the \nclassroom.   The  STAR  Room  is  not  disciplinary  in  nature.    It  is  a  place  for \nreflection,  problem  resolution, and  at  times  a  calm  environment  to  complete \nschool assignments. \n \n•  The Targeted Intervention Program (TIP) unit, which opened in October 2017, \nbrings together several of the elements above. It is designed to serve the most \nchallenging  youth  in  a  staff-intensive,  highly  structured,  treatment-rich \nenvironment,  including  Dialectical  Behavioral  Therapy  (DBT)  which  is \nrecognized  as  one  of  the  most  effective  interventions  for  individuals  with \npersonality disorders and self-harming behaviors.  Youth in this unit are divided \ninto small groups that remain together during the daily structured schedule.   A \nYouth  Counselor  follows  each  group  and  attends  all  classes,  groups  and \nrecreational activities along with the facilitators.  The intent is to keep these \nyouth actively engaged and learning pro-social skills.  \n \n•  A  revised  incentive  program  has  been  developed  to  reinforce  and  encourage \npositive  behaviors  by  youth.  According  to  evidence-based  practice,  frequent \nreinforcement of pro-social behaviors promotes improved behavior and decreases \nunwanted behavior. The program is currently being implemented in the TIP unit \nand will be implemented in other general population housing units over the \ncourse of the next several months. \nPage 7 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 8 of 10\n \n•  A Youth Advisory Council has been developed and a Family Advisory Council is \nbeing developed in order to promote youth and family voice in facility operations. \nInclusion of client voice is recognized as a core principle in trauma-informed \norganizations. \nAvailability, Use, and Response to OC \nAnother  set  of  potential  options  are  more  specific  to  the  use  of  OC,  including \nprotocols to be followed to minimize harmful effects, ensuring adequate follow-up \nand review, and limiting the availability of OC. \n•  A continuum of responses to disruptions, with OC (or other restraints) used as a \nlast resort and de-escalating conflicts before they occur given highest priority: \nDJC  policy  clearly  states  that  “verbal  interventions/de-escalation  techniques \nreceive highest priority for resolving conflict,” and this expectation is reinforced \nthrough  training,  incident  reviews,  performance  evaluation,  and  (when \nnecessary) employee discipline. \n \n•  Medical staff maintain a list of contraindications and are consulted before any \nplanned use of force. It is important to note, however, that since OC can only be \nused when a youth is engaging in physical harm to others or to prevent the \nyouth from causing bodily harm to another, its use is more likely to be reactive \nthan  planned.  In  either  case,  youth  are  seen  by  medical  staff  following  any \nexposure to OC. \n \nPage 8 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 9 of 10\n•  When planned use of force becomes necessary, a specific protocol is followed that \nincludes video and audio recording. Reactive use of force situations are recorded \non body cameras, with handheld recording begun as soon as it can reasonably \nand  safely  be  accomplished.    All  use  of  force  incidents  are  documented  on \nincident reports, with each involved staff person writing an individual narrative. \n \n•  Each incident involving use of OC is reviewed on multiple levels, including at \nthe weekly management-level incident review meeting and as part of a use of \nforce review. PbS also recommends debriefing with the youth and the involved \nstaff, which currently occurs on a case by case and less formal basis. CLS/LHS \nwill  evaluate  options  for  including  these  youth  and  staff  debriefings  on  a \nconsistent, structured basis. \n \n•  Data on use of OC is compiled and reviewed on a regular basis as part of PbS \nand other reporting mechanisms. \nOther  potential  options  that  have  been  recommended  elsewhere  and  were \nconsidered for inclusion in this plan include further limiting who can carry OC (for \nexample, supervisors only) and storing it in a lockbox or away from the housing \nunits. These steps were determined to not be appropriate for inclusion in the plan at \nthis time, because they would preclude the use of OC when a youth is engaging in \nphysical  harm  to  others  or  to  prevent  the  youth  from  causing  bodily  harm  to \nanother.  As  noted  above,  this  could  increase  injuries  to  staff  and  youth,  either \nthrough failing to prevent an assault, failure to intervene in assaultive situations, \nPage 9 of 10   \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 86   Filed: 10/31/17   Page 10 of 10\nor through physically intervening in dangerous situations. DJC will continue to \nassess progress in preventing incidents and reducing OC, and we will continue to \nevaluate all options on a regular basis. \nDated this 31st day of October, 2017. \n \n          CRIVELLO CARLSON, S.C. \n          Attorneys for Defendants \n \n \n          By:  s/ Samuel C.

Defendants may place youth with mental health diagnoses (a mental health code \ndesignation of MH-1, MH-2a, MH-2b, or ID) in restrictive housing, but such \nplacements will be reviewed by a PSU staff member to determine whether that \nplacement is a contra indication to the youth’s mental health or if other options \nwill adequately protect the youth or staff. If such a youth remains in pre-hearing \nsecurity after the initial review process (described in I.3. below), and if he or she \nhas a designated mental health code, a review as noted in this section will occur \nimmediately by a PSU staff member. This review will be conducted in person \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 3 of 10\nunless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is personally available, in which \ncase it may occur by phone or video conferencing. \n3.  Effective July 21, 2017, defendants shall not confine youth in pre-hearing security \n(PHS) unless the youth presents an immediate and substantial risk of great bodily \nharm to self or others. Should defendants determine that such risk exists and that \nsuch  placement  is  necessary,  defendants  shall,  within  four  hours  of  such \nplacement, conduct an initial review of each youth brought to RHU for PHS to \ndetermine whether such placement is necessary and whether release of the youth \nback to general population will jeopardize the safety of the youth, staff, or facility. \nIf the decision is made to retain the youth in RHU, a second review will occur \nwithin four hours of the initial review, and release/retention will be judged by the \nactions and behavior of the youth since the initial review. A determination that a \nyouth should continue in PHS for more than four hours must be approved by the \nsuperintendent or designee. \n4.  Effective  July  21,  2017,  defendants  shall  limit  the  maximum  length  of  a \ndisposition that includes any placement in RHU for punitive purposes to seven \ndays. \n5.  Defendants  shall  immediately  begin  and,  no  later  than  July  21,  2017,  shall \ncomplete a review of the placements of all youth currently held in RHU. Any \nyouth held in such housing for reasons that violate the terms of this injunction \nshall be released as soon as practicable and without delay. The placements of the \nnamed plaintiffs currently held in RHU shall be the first to be reviewed. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 4 of 10\n6.  All uses of disciplinary RHU, both pre-hearing and post-hearing, shall be justified \nin writing and authorized by a shift supervisor, with notice to the superintendent \nor designee. Written notification of a youth’s placement in RHU shall be promptly \nprovided to the youth and shall include a description of reasons for confinement \nand the less restrictive disciplinary measures attempted. \n7.  Regardless of the length of any sentence involving placement in restrictive housing \nfor punitive purposes, there shall be a daily review of youth in RHU to determine \nwhether that youth can be released early for positive behavior. Criteria for early \nrelease will be explained to each youth. \n8.  Within three months, defendants will provide to the court and counsel for the \nplaintiffs  their  Facility  Improvement  Plan  targeting  reductions  in  the  use  of \nrestrictive  housing  established  under  the  Council  of  Juvenile  Correctional \nAdministrators’ Performance-Based Standards. \nB.  Conditions of restrictive housing \nDefendants are ordered to ensure that the conditions of restrictive housing or any \nother form of solitary confinement meet the following minimum standards: \n1.  Any youth placed in restrictive housing for whom there is not already a mental \nhealth evaluation on file must have such an evaluation as soon as possible, and in \nany  event  no  later  than  24  hours  after  being  placed  in  RHU.  If  a  youth  is \nidentified with a mental health need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, \nMH-2a, MH-2b, or ID), placements in RHU will be reviewed by a PSU staff \nmember to determine whether that placement is a contra indication to the best \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 5 of 10\ninterests of the youth’s mental health or if other options will adequately protect \nthe youth or staff. \n2.  Any youth placed in RHU for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive daily \ncontact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be face-to-face unless, \ndue to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is personally available, in which case it \nmay occur by phone or video conferencing. This provision shall go into effect on \nAugust 31, 2017, for business days and on September 30, 2017, for holidays and \nweekends. \n3.  No later than July 21, 2017, defendants shall modify property policies to allow \nyouth in RHU to have property items similar to or the same as those items \nallowed in general population. Specific items of property may be restricted as \nneeded for safety of the youth and staff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions \nwill be temporary in nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. \nA  Supervising  Youth  Counselor  or  Unit  Supervisor  shall  review  any  property \nrestrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \n4.  Youth in restrictive housing shall receive:  \na.  All regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health services, and \nother  health  services,  and  any  additional  mental  health  services \ncontemplated by this order. This provision shall go into effect no later than \nJuly 21, 2017. \nb.  Any rehabilitative programming (e.g., Aggression Replacement Training, \nJuvenile Cognitive Intervention Program, etc.) that was scheduled or in \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 6 of 10\nprocess before placement in RHU. This provision shall go into effect no \nlater than September 30, 2017. \nc.  Educational services. To the extent practicable, youth in restrictive housing \nshall receive educational services with the general population. If attending \neducational services with the general population proves unworkable due to \nan immediate and substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth in restrictive \nhousing  shall  receive  alternative  educational  services  on  days  that  the \ngeneral population receives such services. Defendants shall ensure special \neducation services for eligible youth. This provision shall go into effect no \nlater than September 30, 2017. \nd.  Additional “out time” for gross motor exercise and social interaction. No \nlater than July 21, 2017, defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such “out time” unless such conversations pose an immediate and \nsubstantial threat of physical harm to another person. Sensory stimulation \nshall  also  be  available  during  out  time,  unless  such  activities  cause \nimmediate  and  substantial  disruption  or  risk  of  physical  harm.  This \nprovision will go into effect no later than August 14, 2017. \ne.  Meals  out  of  the  cell,  absent  an  immediate  and  substantial  threat  of \nphysical harm to another person from the youth eating that meal out of the \ncell. This provision shall go into effect no later than August 14, 2017. \nf.  Minimum “out time” each day and each week. Absent an immediate and \nsubstantial threat of physical harm to another person or a direct refusal to \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 7 of 10\ncome out of his or her room, youth shall receive a minimum of 15 hours \nper week for activities identified in paragraphs a through c and 15 hours \nper week for activities identified in paragraphs d and e, for a minimum of \n30 hours of out time total per week; however, youth shall always receive a \nminimum of two hours of out time per day, absent an immediate and \nsubstantial threat of physical harm to another person or a direct refusal to \ncome out of his or her room. \n5.  Effective July 21, 2017, youth shall not be placed on control status absent an \nimmediate and substantial risk of serious physical harm to self or others. \n6.  Staff shall visually verify and document the safety and welfare of each youth held \nin RHU during the time such youth is in the cell at frequent and random intervals, \nand no fewer than two times per hour during daytime hours and four times per \nhour during evening hours. \n7.  Defendants shall notify all youth of all the above rights and of procedures for \nfiling grievances and appeals at the time of each placement in RHU. \nC. Chemical agents \nDefendants  are  enjoined  from  using  chemical  agents  in  any  manner  that  is \ninconsistent with the following: \n1.  Effective  no  later  than  July  21,  2017,  defendants  shall  use  chemical  agents, \nincluding but not limited to OC or pepper spray, only when a youth is engaging in \nphysical harm to others or to prevent the youth from causing bodily harm to \nanother.  Medical  and  mental  health  staff  should  be  consulted  as  soon  as \npracticable after the use of OC spray. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 8 of 10\n2.  Contra indications to chemical agents shall be maintained by the Health Service \nUnit (HSU) to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct. Staff must check with HSU prior to any planned use of chemical agents to \ndetermine whether any contra indications exist. \n3.  Defendants shall immediately begin a systematic review all instances of OC use in \nthe first six months of 2017 to identify patterns and trends. The review will \ninclude, at a minimum, whether the use was planned or reactive, the location, the \ndate/day/time, and other actions by the involved youth (e.g., fighting other youth, \nphysically resisting staff, covering up windows or cameras). Defendants will also \nreview the number of youth who were exposed versus the number of instances to \nidentify  ways  to  reduce  and  eliminate  use  of  chemical  agents,  determine  any \ntraining needs, and identify any alternatives that could be used on a facility-wide \nor individual basis. This review shall be completed and its results reported to \ncounsel and the court no later than August 31, 2017. \n4.  Based on the review in the preceding paragraph, by October 31, 2017, defendants \nshall prepare and provide to counsel and the court a plan to further reduce or \neliminate any remaining use of chemical agents. \nD. Mechanical restraints \nDefendants  are  ordered  to  ensure  that  the  use  of  mechanical  restraints  for  any \npurpose (other than documented mental health purposes as part of a plan to ensure the \nsafety of the youth) meets the following minimum standards: \n1.  Defendants may restrain youth during vehicular transportation on or off site.  \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 9 of 10\n2.  Under all other circumstances, there is a presumption that youth, including youth \nin  restrictive  housing,  shall  not  be  mechanically  restrained.  Defendants  may \nrestrain a youth only after an individualized determination that the youth poses \nan immediate and substantial risk of physical harm to themselves or others. This \nprovision shall go into effect no later than July 21, 2017. \n3.  Defendants shall not use mechanical restraints unless there is authorization as \nfollows: a Youth Counselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living \nunit may approve the use of mechanical restraints for up to 45 minutes. Any use \nof restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by the superintendent or \nsecurity director or their designee. Any use of restraints in excess of 90 minutes \nmust  be  authorized  by  the  division  administrator  of  juvenile  corrections  or \ndesignee. All approvals must be in writing and articulate the specific facts and \ncircumstances justifying continued restraints. This provision shall go into effect no \nlater than July 21, 2017. \n4.  Defendants shall use only the minimum level of restraints necessary to eliminate \nan immediate and substantial risk of physical harm to self or others. Restraints \nshall not include leg or ankle restraints unless the youth is presenting an active risk \nof physical harm to self or others arising from free movement of the legs. Youth \nshall not be tethered to fixed objects. This provision shall go into effect no later \nthan July 21, 2017. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 71   Filed: 07/10/17   Page 10 of 10\n5.  Defendants shall remove restraints promptly after the youth is in a safe place or no \nlonger poses an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to self or \nothers. \nEntered July 10, 2017. \nBY THE COURT: \n \n            /s/ \n            ________________________________________ \n            JAMES D.

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nFIRST REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n  \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nOn January 23, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive \nRelief, initiating the above-captioned action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The claims in this action \nrelate to the use of room confinement, chemical agents, mechanical restraints, and strip searches \nat Lincoln Hills School (“LHS”) and Copper Lake School (“CLS”). Various legal proceedings \nensued which led to the Stipulation For Consent Decree And Permanent Injunction, filed on June \n1, 2018 and entered by the Court on September 21, 2018.  \n \nThe Parties agreed that Teresa Abreu would be retained to serve as the Parties ' jointly appointed \nMonitor. The final Monitor contract was executed on October 25, 2018. Defendants provided the \nMonitor with the relevant Administrative Code provisions, policies, training documentation, as \nwell as the February 26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, \nTeresa Abreu and Jennifer Lutz as per the court order. The Monitor requested to be included on \nthe distribution list for all shift reports and any monthly reports that are required under the court \norders in this case.  The Monitor is very pleased with the level of cooperation, communication and \nresponsiveness from the parties.  Anytime the Monitor has requested documentation or explanation \neither prior to, during, or after the site visit, the parties have complied.  Additionally, when the \nMonitor  has  made  recommendations  with  regard  to  a  process  or  procedure,  document \nmodifications, or policy changes, the Wisconsin Division of Juvenile Corrections Director and \nLHS/CLS Superintendent have been receptive and when possible, modified pursuant to the \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 2 of 23\n \nMonitor’s recommendations. Plaintiffs’ have also made themselves available to the Monitor and \nhave shared any documentation that they believe would be helpful to the assessment.  The Monitor \nrequested a seven (7) day extension to file the draft status report as additional documentation was \nneeded in order to complete this report.  \n \nSITE VISIT \nThe first site visit by the Monitor took place on December 6-8, 2018.  The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit.  Materials included, but \nwere not limited to, relevant court filings, policies, procedures, training documents, resident \nhandbooks, room check logs, school schedules, recreation schedules, counselor logs, “Stop, Think, \nAct, Review,” (“STAR”) room documentation, video footage of OC spray incidents, all of the \nmonthly data submitted to the parties per this court order, training records, work rules, position \ndescriptions, employee leave data, grievance logs, behavior and treatment plans,  mechanical \nrestraint documentation, incident reports, restrictive housing documentation, and PbS data.  The \nParties were present during the site visit. Under the Consent Decree, the Monitor shall have access \nto LHS/CLS at any time for the inspections and site visits.  Access included the ability to inspect \nand photograph all youth living areas, control rooms in housing units, visiting areas, areas where \nsearches of students are conducted, any isolation or restrictive housing rooms or rooms used for \nsuch purpose, classrooms, counseling or social services rooms, and to speak with any youth in a \nprivate and confidential setting.   The Monitor did take photographs, visited the above referenced \nareas, and interviewed youth and staff.  The Monitor understands that a three-day site visit is just \na snap shot overview of LHS/CLS. \n \nIn December 2017, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (“DOC”), the Division of Juvenile \nCorrections (“DJC”) contracted with the Council of Juvenile Correction Administrators (“CJCA”) \nand the Center for Children’s Law and Policy (“CCLP”) to provide technical assistance to support \ntheir efforts in addressing the use of solitary confinement, pepper spray, mechanical restrains, and \nstrip search policy and procedures. The Monitor was part of the team that offered technical \nassistance in February 2018 and thus, had the opportunity to do a site visit and assessment of \nLHS/CLS albeit in a different capacity.  Therefore, the Monitor had familiarity with operations of \nLHS/CLS prior to this December site visit.  The Monitor assessed compliance with the Consent \nDecree as well as the implementation of recommendations in the February technical assistance \nreport. \n \nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS \n \nPhysical Plant \n \nThe general areas of the facility were clean and orderly.   LHS/CLS were decorated nicely for the \nholidays and the youth seemed to enjoy decorating the units.   A holiday decoration contest was \nunderway during the site visit and youth seemed highly motivated by the contest.  Although the \ngeneral areas were clean, the youth rooms and bathrooms were not. There needs to be a focus on \nyouth rooms being clean and organized and the bathrooms being cleaned more regularly and \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 3 of 23\n \nthoroughly.  There is a lot of graffiti and etching of glass throughout LHS/CLS.  Efforts should be \nmade to monitor youth more closely as well as painting over the graffiti and replacing etched glass \nso that visibility is improved into the youth rooms.  Murals and artwork have been added to the \nvisiting areas and a couple of the cottages. The Monitor encourages the continuation of brightening \nup the cottages with colorful paint, murals, and artwork to change the institutional  feel as \npreviously recommended in the February technical assistance report. \n \nYouth Population \n \nThe average daily population is lower than it was in February by approximately 18% (dropping \nfrom 170 to 140).  The Monitor did not observe any youth on living units in mechanical restraints \nwhich  is a  vast  improvement  from  the February technical assistance  visit. Staff should be \ncommended for making this visible change. CLS (girls) were very talkative, active on their unit, \nand were actively participating in arts and crafts.  The Monitor saw some staff engaging with \nyouth, recreation was taking place, telephone calls were being made regularly, and religious \nvolunteers were present on one of the boys’ units in which five boys were actively participating.  \nHowever, there still seemed to be a lack of meaningful programming as pointed out in the February \n2018 assessment report. That said, the facility has made some progress in reducing youth idleness \nand in-room placements but needs to continue these efforts.  Recommendations were made in the \nFebruary  2018  technical  assistance  report  that  should  be  implemented  as  to  additional \nprogramming that would be beneficial to youth. \n \nStaffing \n \nStaffing problems continue to exist, and they continue to be serious, chronic, and dangerous. There \nare 311 total positions at LHS/CLS.  Approximately 155 of these positions are “direct-care” staff \n(Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  Defendants have offered sign on \nbonuses as recommended in the technical assistance report which seemed to help in the filling of \nvacancies. Although the number of vacancies for the YC and YCA positions from February to \nDecember 2018 has significantly reduced, there are still significant staffing challenges.  The \nteacher vacancy rate is significantly higher now than in February 2018.  A focus needs to be made \non recruiting teachers. Financial incentives have been added which hopefully helps with recruiting \nefforts.  The Monitor understands that filling teacher vacancies and retention is a challenge \nthroughout the country.  \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of \nFebruary 20, 2018  November 28, 2018 \nYouth Counselor  48% (45 out of 94)  22% (23 of 105) \nYouth Counselor Adv  45% (27 of 60)  18% (9 of 50) \nTeacher  25%  (7 of 28)  39% (11 of 28) \nSocial Worker   13% (2 of 15)  14% (2 of 14) \n \n \n \nYEAR  FMLA  FMLA  FMLA  FMLA/Workman’s \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 4 of 23\n \nIntermittent total  Intermittent  Continuous  Comp Continuous \nDirect Care  Non-security  Direct Care \n2018  43  34  1  18 (13 YC’s; 5 \nYCA’s) \n2017  38    4  1 \n2016  29    1  0 \n2015  33    8  0 \n \nIn February 2018, there were approximately 48% of youth counselor positions vacant (45 of 94) \nand today there is about 22% vacancy (23 of 105).  In February 2018, there were 45% of Youth \nCounselor Advanced positions vacant (27 out of 60), and today there is 18% vacancy (9 out of 50).  \nAlthough the number of vacancies is reduced for direct care workers, the number of staff on leave \n(FMLA continuous and intermittent, Workers Comp’, and disability, etc.) are approximately 62 \nemployees of the 311 allocated positions, which is about 20%. This number is significantly higher \nwhen looking at direct care staff (YC’s and YCA’s).  Of the 155 direct care positions, 32 are vacant \nand another 18 are on some type of leave, which reflects a total vacancy of 32%. This does not \ninclude any benefit time the employees receive (vacation, sick, etc.) This means the number of \nposts needed to be covered due to vacancies is much higher than what LHS/CLS can cover. \nPerhaps non-traditional scheduling or scheduling changes can be created in the meantime or \ncombining units in order to adequately supervise youth while still meeting legally mandated \nstaffing requirements and ensuring the safety of youth and staff. \n \nIt would be very beneficial and useful for the facility to conduct a full staffing assessment to \ninclude a relief factor analysis looking at all leave types and its impact on staffing levels.   A \ncomplete staffing analysis would provide the agency with an accurate relief factor based on all \nleave types, which would then allow for a more accurate assessment of the staffing situation. The \nMonitor can assist with this assessment. \n \nIn order to try and cover the posts needed, staff have been working double shifts often.  The \nMonitor suggested tracking the number of staff working double shifts in order to better understand \nissues and also, to ensure that the same staff are not working double shifts consistently. It is \nunreasonable to  expect staff to actively  engage  with  youth, actively participate  in training, \nunderstand and change the practices of the facility when they are working so many hours per week.  \nThe Monitor spoke to over 25 staff and the majority said they are tired, frustrated, and barely see \ntheir families and friends.  Most staff live about 50 minutes from the facility which further \nexacerbates the problem.  The vast majority of staff do not feel safe and do not feel they are \nadequately trained and prepared with the alternatives to pepper stray, confinement, and restraints.  \nThe perception from staff is no one cares about them and all the focus is on the youth.  The \nDefendants will not be able to come into substantial compliance with the Court Order without \nsolving  the  staffing  issues.  Staff  wellness  needs  to  be  a  focus  moving  forward.  Several \nrecommendations were made in the February 2018 technical assistance report that should be \nimplemented.  \n \nThe jurisdiction utilizes Performance Based Standards (“PbS”) which is a program for juvenile \njustice  agencies,  facilities,  and  residential  care  providers  to  identify,  monitor,  and  improve \nconditions and services provided to youths using national standards and outcome measures. There \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 5 of 23\n \nare many PbS outcome measures including specific measures involving staff.   PbS data, outcome \nmeasure Safety 14, reflects that 59.20% of staff report fearing for their safety at LHS and 45.95% \nat CLS report fear for their safety.  Both rates are significantly higher compared to the 25.43% \nnational field average.  When asked “in your opinion, what would make this facility safer?”, staff \nresponded: \n \nLHS \nMore staff  83  66% \nTraining  67  54% \nSafety equipment  54  43% \nOther  43  34% \nLess overcrowding  16  13% \n \nCLS \nMore staff  24  65% \nTraining  23  62% \nSafety equipment  15  41% \nOther  11  30% \nLess overcrowding  4  11% \n \n \n \nFurthermore, when asked what training they would like to see, staff provided the following \nresponses: \n \nGeneral behavior management \nVerbal de-escalation \nGang training \nAdolescent development \nSafety and security \nEthics \nCultural diversity and awareness \nCommunication \nAgency policies and procedures \nAppropriate staff/youth relationships \nAppropriate use of restraints \nJuvenile rights \nUse of isolation \nIncident reporting \nAggression Replacement Therapy (ART) \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 6 of 23\n \nSuicide prevention \nCognitive behavior programs \nReporting, documenting and investigating allegations \nOf sexual abuse/victimization \nSexual assault prevention \nFunctional Family Therapy (FFT)  \nLGBTQI \nFirst aid, CPR, AED \nFire safety \n \nEfforts should be made to incorporate these trainings identified by staff.  For those trainings that \nare already implemented, perhaps the training can be offered more frequently.  There are training \nand resource recommendations made in the February 2018 technical assistance report that need to \nbe explored. The Monitor is happy to connect the Defendants with these resources. \n \nIn looking at the number one overall issue around the need for “more staff” and excessive overtime, \nrecommendations for staffing could be pulling staff from other facilities and/or contracting with a \nprivate security company to supplement the staffing at LHS/CLS. The Monitor did note that the \ndepartment is taking advantage of other agency staff, such as probation and parole staff to help \ncover posts.  This was seen as a very positive approach for both facility staff and parole staff who \nseemed to enjoy the opportunity. Defendants are encouraged to explore increasing the use of other \nagency staff and ensuring that the staff meet the required training. \n \nRecommendations for staff wellness were made in the February 2018 report and should be \nexplored further. There were many recommendations that have not been implemented including, \nbut not limited to more communication with staff regarding the reform effort, involving staff when \ndeveloping programming and policy changes, creating policy driven staff recognition programs, \nand tap into staff ‘s talents, passions, and interests (artists, musicians, yoga etc.) to bring into \nprogramming.  It is clear from the PbS data and interactions the Monitor had with staff that much \nmore focus needs to be placed on staff wellness.  This is a primary driver of the turnover issues \nand is a driving factor in the overall climate and atmosphere of the facility.  Staff unhappiness and \ndiscontent is hindering any positive relationship building with the youth. \n \nFinally, while the perceptions of staff and their fear for safety are real fears, the PbS data regarding \nstaff assaults do not reflect that the facility or staff are less safe than they were in October of 2017.  \nIn fact, according to outcome measure, Safety 12 – Assaults on Staff, there were 50% fewer staff \nassaults during the October 2018 data collection cycle than there were during the October 2017 \ncycle at LHS.  This reflected a change from eight (8) incidents down to four (4).  The incident rate \nof assaults at LHS essentially tied the national field average rate of 0.11. This also holds true when \nlooking at Safety 3 – Injuries to staff during the same data collection periods.  Again, we see a \n50% reduction in staff injuries at LHS, from eight (8) injuries in October 2017 to four (4) in \nOctober 2018.  This is data that should be shared with staff.  \n \nSince PbS data collection cycles only occur twice a year, in April and October, it is recommended \nthat the jurisdiction monitor incidents of assaults, fights, youth and staff injuries, and other critical \noutcomes measures on a monthly basis using the most recent PbS field averages as a guide to \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 7 of 23\n \ngauge the overall safety for staff and youth.  The Monitor can provide an example of a monthly \noutcomes metrics data report that has been used in other jurisdictions if requested. \n  \nQuality Assurance \n  \nData collection remains a significant problem at LHS/CLS.   Data driven decision making is critical \nto the safety and quality of life of youth and staff. Data is not being accurately recorded, adequately \ncollected  or  analyzed  for  incidents  giving  rise  to  this  litigation.    A  quality  assurance  and \nimprovement program need to be created to continuously assess not only compliance with this \ncourt order, but the quality and adequacy of the social and recreational programming provided, \nhealthcare, education, environmental health and safety, and discipline and order.  The Jurisdiction \nutilizes J Tracker which is a jail system that is being converted to a juvenile system.  The \nDefendants have stated that this system can be modified to include other data measures as \nrequested.  The Monitor suggests that the Defendants work with the vendor to include other critical \nmeasures.  Information put into the system is automatically generated but tracking of time is \nmanual. Ideally, a plan should be developed for implementation of competent data collection with \na focus on accuracy at the line staff level.  Although many data points are collected as per the court \norder, the accuracy  of the data  is unable to be  determined  for several reasons  i.e.  lack  of \ndocumentation, lack of electronic systems to automatically capture data, and lack of staff available \nwhose sole responsibility is data collection and analysis.   \n \nLHS/CLS has become a Level 2 site for PbS.  Levels of performance quantify how well a facility \nhas mastered the basics of data collection, analysis, the processes of PbS teamwork and Facility \nImprovement Plan (“FIP”) monitoring.  Level 2 means that there is a focus on the “Critical \nOutcome Measures” that PbS experts and practitioners have identified as the most important \nindicators of safety and order within a facility. The information about injuries, assaults, suicidal \nbehaviors,  isolation,  screenings,  restraints  and  staff  and  youth  fear  for  safety  that  give  an \nimmediate picture of the facilities’ safety or violence. Because the facility is at a Level 2, they can \nnow be part of the national field average.  This reflects significant progress on the part of the \nagency/facility in quality of the data being recorded and captured for PbS data collection cycles.  \nAs stated previously, the use of a monthly outcomes metric report will greatly aid in the continued \nmonitoring of critical outcomes measures and quality assurance practices. \n \nPolicies and Procedures \n \nThe policies and procedures that have been provided to the Monitor are Wisconsin Department of \nCorrections,  Division  of  Juvenile  Corrections  and  policies  specific  to  LHS/CLS.  DOC  has \nidentified sections of the administrative code that needs to be modified, but significant revisions \nhave not yet occurred.  The Monitor has been told implementation will take some time as it requires \ncertain Codes to be repealed and recreated. All policies refer back to the administrative code and \nthus modifications to the administrative code should be a priority.  \n \nPolicies are Division wide and the procedures are local. Local facilities (like LHS/CLS) can adopt \nthe Division policy “as written” for the local procedure or create their own.  If a local facility \nwanted to be more detailed than the Division policy, this would be done under facility and region \nprocedures developed by DOC.  Policies relevant to LHS/CLS need to be compliant with the \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 8 of 23\n \nfederal court orders and should contain a quality assurance section for each and every policy. After \nreview of the DOC DJC policies and procedures and local procedures, quality assurance is not part \nof the policies and reference to this litigation is not listed in the “references” section.  Policy and \nprocedure changes still need to be made as it relates to Youth Movement and Suspension of \nMovement,  Use  of  Force  (last  updated  9/28/16),  Searches  of  Youth  (updated  10/16/18), \nEmergency Response Unit, and several others.  The Monitor was pleased to see that the CARE \nteam has been implemented as recommended in the February technical assistance report, however, \na policy and procedure needs to be created which will clearly outline the mission of the CARE \nteam, identify circumstances where CARE team will be deployed, and how staff are chosen for \nthe CARE team. Also, many of the policies indicate “discuss at staff meeting.”    Many policies \nand procedures replace old policies. There should be formalized training with employee sign offs \nacknowledging receipt and understanding.  Effective proficiency testing for all training classes \nneeds to be developed.  The Monitor will continue to work with the Defendants on policy and \nprocedure. \n \nYouth Interviews \n \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and the Monitor conducted several youth interviews.   Approximately forty (40) \nyouth were interviewed during the site visit.    Several youths were able to identify staff that they \nthought were fair, consistent, and caring.  There were also staff identified as being consistently \ndisrespectful, dishonest, or manipulative. The common complaints from youth interviewed were \nlack of meaningful programming, delayed response to call lights (often indicated when a youth \nhas to use the restroom because there is no toilet in their rooms), group punishment, and too much \ntime being confined.  Youth stated most staff do not interact with them other than directing them.  \nThe Monitor agrees with the youth’s assessment of staff interaction.  This is not to say that there \nare not staff who actively engage with youth, but more staff need to engage with the youth in a \nproductive manner. Youth also said that staff showed favoritism and points were often taken away \nfor what they perceive as trivial reasons.     \n \nYouth found the grievance procedures confusing and did not really feel like their grievances were \nbeing heard or addressed. Several youths on RHU (Restrictive Housing Unit) admitted to being \nsent to the Unit because of fights with other youth, but others said they were sent for other reasons \nsuch as disrespecting staff, refusing to go into their rooms, or being in an unauthorized area or sent \nfor a “cool off” period. When interviewing youth who have been OC sprayed, they complained \nthat the decontamination process took over half an hour and sometimes longer. Currently, times of \nspray  and  times  of  decontamination  are  not  being  documented.  The  Monitor  made  a \nrecommendation as to this documentation.  All use of force incident reports should include a \nmedical assessment form indicating the date and time of the use of force medical assessment and \nany injuries or medical concerns noted during the examination.  This should be done for ALL use \nof force incidents, including physical, mechanical and chemical. This process ensures youth are \nassessed within reasonable time frames and documentation made of any injuries, conditions and \ntreatments provided. \n \nOverall, there have been significant improvements in various areas of concern, but there is still \nmore work to do.  Defendants need to revisit the February technical assistance report and develop \na plan to implement the many recommendations contained within that will improve the quality of \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 9 of 23\n \nlife and conditions for youth and staff.  There needs to be more resources, specifically, dedicated \nstaff allocated to make the necessary changes needed to improve conditions for youth and staff.  \nDefendants also need to assess whether there is a need to bring in outside national experts on a \ntemporary basis to assist in developing systems, programs, and assist in making the necessary \nchanges in order to reach substantial compliance with the court order which will vastly improve \nthe quality of life for youth and staff.  \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree. As previously stated, \nthere is a challenge with adequacy of data for many areas (documentation, accuracy, consistency, \nand analysis) thus, some sections do not contain a detailed narrative. The Monitor will work with \nDefendants on this challenge.  \n \nA.  Room Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court  's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Majority of youth are not confined \nin excess of seven days. However, there are challenges to reliability of documentation. The \nMonitor will work with Defendants on suggested form modifications and quality assurance \nprogram. \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been seven months after entry of the Court’s \norder. The Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A. It has not been ten months after entry of the Court’s \norder. The     Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time.  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 10 of 23\n \n \n2. Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative confinement may exceed four hours only under the following \ncircumstances: \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE as to administrative confinement \nmay only be used for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to others. \nThere are instances where administrative confinement was used in situations where the \nMonitor would not consider the youth to be a risk for “imminent physical harm to others.” \nThe  Monitor  will  review  confinement  of  youth  with  recommendations  to \nforms/policies/procedures and incident reviews. N/A as to the remainder of the section as \nit has not been six months after entry of the Court’s order. The Monitor will assess \ncompliance at the appropriate time.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 \nhours) when: \n \n1.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s order. \nThe Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n \ni i.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s order. \nThe Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 11 of 23\n \n8 am. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  In general, time is being \ntolled from 8 pm to 8 am.  The Monitor will review data collection, policies and procedures, \nforms,  and  quality  assurance  program  in  order  to  improve  the  current  system  of \ndocumentation. \n \nc.  Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s order. \nThe Monitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  It has not been six months after entry of the Court’s order. The \nMonitor will assess compliance at the appropriate time. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended pol icy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Policy has been amended. However, \nthe effective date of policy is inconsistent on each page.  Training on policy changes has not \noccurred to date although the Monitor has been told it has been discussed in roll call. A \nQuality Assurance measure needs to be included in the policy. \n  \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  Non-Compliance.    No  room  can  be  deemed  “suicide \nresistant.”  Most youth rooms were not clean and organized.  Youth should receive \nhygiene items, blankets, sheets etc.  Several rooms had multiple blankets/sheets covering \nlarge areas of the room making it difficult for staff to assess whether there is contraband \nthat can be harmful to youth inside the rooms or assessing youth activity while in bed.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 12 of 23\n \nMost rooms had graffiti and etching on the glass which makes it difficult for staff to \nclearly see the youth through the window. There are beds and screening in some rooms \nthat create increased suicide risk.  Additionally, room checks should be more frequent \nand accurately documented on an individual basis. The agency should consider investing \nin an electronic, software-based system to more effectively monitor and ensure that safety \nwelfare checks are being completed as required.  While not required by the court order, \nthe Monitor recommends increasing the frequency of safety welfare checks to a minimum \nof every 15 minutes when youth are confined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth on Restrictive Housing Unit \n(“RHU”) have sinks and toilets in rooms, therefore youth have immediate access.  A common \ncomplaint among youth in rooms without toilets is that staff are very slow to respond when \nthey indicate they need to use the restroom. Several youths independently stated that they \nurinate and defecate in their garbage cans.  Some youths believe that staff purposely delay \ntheir response.  Enough youth stated this that administration needs to investigate this.  There \nis no documentation to show whether this requirement is being met. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no \nlater than two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nmodified and improved. The Monitor will work with Defendants on developing a quality \nassurance program. \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need  (a mental health code designation  of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements  in room confinement will be reviewed  \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 13 of 23\n \nby a PSU  staff member to determine whether that placement  is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental  health or if other options \nwill adequately protect the youth  or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Monitor  requested  any \ndocumentation indicating that confinement is contraindicated. The Monitor was verbally \ntold  that  at  least  one  instance  (a  couple  of  months  ago)  where  confinement  was \ncontraindicated for one youth.   There is a form “Psychology Input for Security Decision” \nwhich is where the contraindication would be documented and there is a policy (Policy \n500.70.04) Again, as with all policies, a section should be created to include quality \nassurance and monitored by facility administrators. \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Room check sheets are kept in \nthe staff office and not kept on each individual door thus, contemporaneous recording is \nimpossible.  Every room should have individual room check sheets in which times are not \npre-printed.  A section should be included for staff to describe a youth’s activities while in \nroom. The room checks in RHU are preprinted with times and only contain space for staff \ninitials.  Although the requirement in this court order is “at least every 30 minutes” the \nMonitor recommends that every youth should have a visual inspection at least every 15 \nminutes at staggered intervals. This is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, \nNCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. Again, the agency should \nconsider investing in an electronic,  software-based rounds checking  system to more \neffectively monitor and ensure that safety welfare checks are being completed as required.  \nPSU Staff do visit youth daily. \n \nf.   Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary in \nnature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 14 of 23\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There appeared to be some rooms \nin RHU that were sterile. The Monitor could not confirm whether this was restricted as \nneeded for safety. A youth in RHU should have property items similar to a youth in the \ngeneral population. Documentation needs to be improved as to this requirement. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Social  worker  visits,  mental \nhealth  services,  and  other  health  services  are  provided  however,  there  is  a  lack  of \ndocumentation and quality of services is difficult to assess. \n \n11.  Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Programming  is  inconsistent.  \nThere is a lack of documentation as to specific programming that occurs on a daily basis. \nAlso, there are occasions where staffing levels do not allow for planned programming.  \n \n111.   Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Educational Services for general \npopulation occur in the classrooms in the school area. Youth in the Targeted Intervention \nProgram (“TIP”) attend classes in the school area but separate from the general population. \nYouth in RHU do not receive educational services in the school area but remain on living \nunits.  Youth who are disruptive in class are referred to the STAR room in which youth are \nencouraged to reflect on their behavior.  Youth fill out a STAR room log which asks what \nbothered them, where the incident happened, who bothered the youth, what they did, and \nasks the youth to identify what they need to be able to return to school successfully. \nTeachers told the Monitor most youth can return to class after their period of reflection.  \nSome youth receive packets to be completed on the Unit.  Youth are often “suspended” from \nschool. According to PbS activity logs, youth are engaged in educational activities for 2.92 \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 15 of 23\n \nhours a day at CLS and 3.33 hours per day at LHS.  Youth should be engaged in educational \nactivities as a primary program during normal school hours. This should be between 5-6 \nhours per school day. As reflected in the staffing section of this report, the current teacher \nvacancy rate of 39% (11 of 28 allocated positions) is mostly likely impacting the ability of \nyouth to be in school for longer periods.  There are approximately 12 youth who have high \nschool diplomas or GEDs. There are classes available in welding, business class, and \nconstruction however youth do not seem to actively engage in these programs.  The Monitor \ninterviewed three graduates who indicated that they just cleaned or sat around the Unit.  \nStaff should encourage participation and consider adding other programs that youth will \nparticipate. Educational hours need to be increased for all youth on a daily basis.  The \nMonitor recommends that all youth regardless of status have education in the school area. \n \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Youth  on  RHU  were  observed \nsitting in day room with no stimulation. Youth are only allowed out in groups of two in which \nthey rotate back into room every 45 minutes.  In youth interviews, youth stated they spend \nmost of the time in their rooms and when they are out of their rooms, they can only talk with \neach other. No other form of entertainment or programming is offered.  Recreational time \nis unstructured.  Additionally, the PbS daily activity log reflects youth spend 5.84 hours a \nday at LHS and 3.29 hours a day at CLS in “other facility programs”.  These programs need \nto be defined so that we can understand what these programs are and if these hours truly \nrepresent meaningful activities and/or programs.   \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Majority of meals take place out \nof the room but there are occasions where youth eat meals in their rooms when there is \nnot an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm.  Should a youth eat a meal in \ntheir room, the decision by staff needs to be justified, supported by documentation, and \ninstances need to be reviewed by facility administrators. \n \nv1.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 16 of 23\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Logs indicate that there are many \ninstances where youth are not receiving 3 hours of “out time” per day and 30 hours per week. \nDocumentation, data collection and reliability make it difficult for the Monitor to assess level of \ncompliance.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.   Youth do utilize the grievance \nprocedure.    From  October-November  2018,  there  were  41  “informal  complaints”,  99 \ncomplaints  dismissed,  and  19  grievances  affirmed.  The  grievance  procedure  is  very \nconfusing for youth and admittedly for staff. The Monitor suggests reviewing the grievance \nprocedure with staff and youth involvement.  The Monitor does suggest that a more robust \ntracking system be developed with a quality assurance piece that ensures grievances are \nbeing timely and appropriately addressed and communicated to youth. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation, data collection \nand reliability, and quality assurance needs to be improved. \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants need to continue to \nimplement their OC reduction plan.  There are youth still being sprayed for having their \narms out of trap door, sprayed in instances where lesser means could have been used (video \nof several instances were watched during the site visit), and spray is being used to “prevent \nself-harm” when other means can be used. The OC reduction plan should involve training \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 17 of 23\n \nstaff on a variety of de-escalation skills as well as a directive that OC should only be used \nin situations that present a serious life safety or threatening situation.  The expanded use \nof CARE Teams can greatly assist in de-escalating situations and ultimately reducing the \nuse of OC.   Additionally, as recommended in the technical assistance  report, a new \nincentive-based  behavior  management  program  that  focuses  on  rewarding  positive \nbehavior should be created which will have a direct impact on youth behavior and thus, \nreduce the need for force of any kind. The following graph reflects the combined usage of \nOC at LHS and CLS in 2018.  \n \nLHS/CLS 2018 Combined Chemical Restraint Use  \n25\n21\n20\n20 18\n14 14\n15\n12\n11\n9 9\n10 8\n5\n5\n0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nLHS/CLS Monthly OC Usage\n \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: N/A.  Compliance will be assessed by the Monitor at the time \nrequired under this section. \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Documentation  needs  to  be \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 18 of 23\n \nimproved, forms need to be modified, a quality assurance component needs to be created, \nand facility administrators need to monitor closely. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Mechanical restraints are used \nmuch less than they were previously. There needs to be a continuous effort to monitor youth \nwho are placed in mechanical restraints and consistent documentation. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \nMechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \n1. \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved and a quality assurance mechanism in place. \n \n11.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved and quality assurance mechanism in place. \n \ni ii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved and quality assurance mechanism in place. \n \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 19 of 23\n \ndiscipline. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Use of mechanical restraints has \nbeen reduced significantly. Documentation needs to be improved and quality assurance \nmechanism needs to be in place to fully assess compliance. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. \n \nf.   Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Training records indicate large \nmajority of staff (over 90%) have training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper  de-escalation.    However,  documentation  needs  to  be  improved  and  a  quality \nassurance mechanism needs to be in place. \n \n \ng.   Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No  youth shall be  left alone  in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 20 of 23\n \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Although  strip  searches  have \nsignificantly decreased, staff are doing a “hygiene” check which requires a youth to strip to \nunderwear and bra which seems to be replacing the “strip search.” This type of search \nshould only be used for the same reasons as a strip search (probable cause of youth possessing \ndrugs or weapons that could not be discovered through less intrusive means). \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \n3.  Process for strip searches. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved.  \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nd.   \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 21 of 23\n \n \ne.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Training records indicate that \nmajority of staff have been trained in trauma informed care.  Documentation needs to be \nimproved as to strip searches.  \n \n \nf.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \n4.  Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved. \n \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The majority of staff have been \ntrained in the new MANDT training and other training which includes de-escalation skills \ntraining. The Monitor recommends increasing the training frequency for staff in order to \nincrease their experience and skill levels in managing and de-escalating situations before they \nresult in the use of restraint and/or isolation.  Although there is a use of force review process, \nit needs to be thorough and comprehensive and include a corrective action plan when force \nwas used where it could have been avoided. A review of instances where de-escalation was \nsuccessful should be reviewed and used as a training tool. It is important for staff to have a \nvariety of skills that they can rely on in these types of situations and to review actual events. \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of id le time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 22 of 23\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Many recommendations were made \nin the February 2018 technical assistance report that has not been implemented. The facility \nneeds to increase meaningful program and activity hours in order to further reduce youth \nidleness hours.  As mentioned previously, increasing education hours can greatly assist in \nreducing  idleness  time  and  provide  positive  youth  development  strategies  through \nmeaningful education and vocational programming.   \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Some of the recommendations made \nin the February 2018 report have been implemented (hiring bonus for instance), but other \nrecommendations have not been implemented such as creating staff recognition and wellness \nprograms in order to retain current staff, utilizing suggested recruiting efforts, redrafting \njob descriptions and job postings which highlights the youth counselor aspect of position \ninstead of “guard” or “corrections” description, rewrite position summary, reassess current \nstaff schedules and placement, consider using ex-employees who left in good standing as \ncontractual or part time staff to fill in the gaps, assessing and ensuring staff are working \nwithin the proper and approved staffing ratios. \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:   DOC has identified sections of the administrative code that needs \nto be modified, but significant revisions have not yet occurred.  The Monitor has been told \nimplementation will take some time as it requires certain Codes to be repealed and recreated. All \npolicies refer back to the administrative code and thus modifications to the administrative code \nshould be a priority.  \n \nII.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any \nincident  that  involved  the  use  of  force;  OC  spray;  room  confinement;  or \nmechanical restraints used for more than 45 minutes (excluding during \ntransportation). The review committee will include all staff directly involved in the \nincident, their supervisors, the social worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who \nare  familiar  with  the  youth,  the  facility  director  of  security,  the  deputy \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 109   Filed: 01/14/19   Page 23 of 23\n \nsuperintendent, and the superintendent.  Within 24 hours, all available members of \nthe review committee shall meet to assess whether physical force, OC spray, room \nconfinement, or mechanical restraints were used appropriately, to discuss less \nrestrictive alternative strategies that staff could have used, and to provide an \nopportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If not all members of the \nreview committee are available for the meeting within 24 hours, the full review \ncommittee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later than one week after \nthe event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of strip searches weekly \nto ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon probable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Although reviews occur for most \nincidents, the reviews often occur well after the 24-hour timeframe.  Often the “reviews” \ndo not occur until 3-4 weeks after the incident. All staff involved are not brought together \nfor meaningful discussions.  When it has been determined lesser means could have been \nused, there is not a corrective action plan developed. The Monitor made suggestions to the \nSuperintendent as to his section. \n \nB.  Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    (Please  see  the  “general \nobservations” section of this report to the court for explanation.) \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Monitor hopes that her report is useful to the Court and the parties.   The Monitor is happy \nto answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n23 \n ",

LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nFOURTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n  \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Third Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on July 1, 2019. The Monitor’s fourth \nreport  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree,  implementation  of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from  the third site visit which took place May 31, 2019. Any \ndocumentation or updates submitted after the conclusion of the fourth site visit will be addressed \nin the fifth report of the Monitor.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe fourth site visit by the Monitor took place on September 13 through September 15, 2019. The \nMonitor reviewed materials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit. \nMaterials included, but were not limited to: updated Krueger program handbook, grievances, \ncounselor logs, staff memos, daily shift reports, video footage of use of force incidents and activity \non unit, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this court order, unit rules, work rules, \nemployee leave data, employee corrective action reports, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical \nrestraint documentation, incident reports, other housing documentation, self-assessment report and \nsupporting  documentation  including  policy  drafts,  facility  enhancement  report,  and  various \nmeeting minutes. The Parties were present during the site visit. The Monitor took photographs, \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 2 of 28\n \ntoured LHS/CLS, and interviewed youth and staff. Approximately thirty-two (32) youth and \ntwenty-eight (28) staff were interviewed formally and informally by the Parties during this site \nvisit. \nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS \nPhysical Plant \nThe general areas of the facility were very clean and orderly.  The atmosphere was very calm \nthroughout LHS/CLS.  Youth and staff seemed much more relaxed and happy than in previous \nvisits. All of the landscaping has been completed and the outdoor space is very inviting. The \nmajority of the recommendations as to physical plant modifications made in previous Monitor \nreports and the February 2018 technical assistance report have been implemented or are in progress \n(described in more detail throughout this report). The etched glass issue has been resolved by \ninstalling new windows throughout the facility.  Several other physical plant improvements have \nbeen made including, but not limited to, permanently mounted security fans in living units, Hughes \nunit perimeter fence repaired, roof deterrent system in place, new boilers in living units, cottage \nexterior window replacement, and fixing of some drainage issues.  Additional projects not yet \ncompleted are the camera upgrade, electronic rounds tracking system, electrical upgrade, and \ninstalling a new generator.  The Monitor will continue to update the Court on physical plant \nimprovements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and staff.  There is still a \nsignificant amount of graffiti in Addams and Black Elk.  The Monitor gave suggestions for \ntracking, monitoring and accountability for graffiti. Defendants will need to continue to monitor \nand cover graffiti on an ongoing basis. \nPreviously, the Defendants informed the Monitor that there was a bid for painting the interior of \nthe cottages and a youth art program to further decorate the walls with murals and artwork. There \nare several new beautiful murals and art projects that have been completed since the last site visit \nand more are currently underway throughout the facility. Renovations have been completed on \none of the girls’ units (Wells), and the girls are now in the newly renovated unit as of June 6, 2019. \nDubois and Miller are also in the process of being renovated and this will continue throughout the \nfacility.  The renovations to date are exceptional.  \nIn general, youth rooms were cleaner (most beds were made) but the bathrooms remain messy and \ndirty.  However, several maintenance issues that were observed throughout the facility during the \nlast site visit which needed attention such as bathroom leaks, faucets running, and toilets not working, \netc.  have  been  addressed.  The  Monitor  recommended  including  incentives  around  the \nroom/bathroom cleanliness in the new behavioral management system.  Defendants have included \nthis in their behavior management system and Spring and Summer Clean Up contests have occurred, \nand other incentives are planned on a regular basis. Defendants have removed and/or secured items \nthat have been used by youth in disturbances and built barriers around areas containing these objects \nin order to create a safer environment. The Monitor recommended that searches of all buildings be \nconducted to remove excessive objects, materials, equipment, furniture, etc., to enhance the safety \nand security of the units/buildings and to maintain a more orderly and safe environment.  The process \nfor area and personal searches has been updated and is being documented electronically using J-\nTracker. The Monitor previously recommended that Defendants consider replacing existing furniture \nwith furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for secure environments and the secure \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 3 of 28\n \nfurniture has been piloted in a living unit. The Monitor also noted that one or more living units had \nsecurity bars on the exterior windows to prevent such disturbance and reduce the likelihood of a \ndisturbance or escape. Additional security enhancements on Krueger and other areas have been \nimplemented. There is a schedule for the removing of existing furniture and replacement with a goal \ncompletion date of June 2020. \nSchool/Living Units Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage and toured the school on Friday.  The Monitor recommended that \n“split hall” time be eliminated, and youth remain out in the day room during medicine pass, counts, \nand shift change. As of September 3, 2019, the Defendants have ceased doing confinement for these \nreasons throughout LHS/CLS.  Another notable change, which had been implemented starting on \nSept. 3, 2019, was that the units had moved to “open dayrooms” which allowed the youth to be \nout of their rooms from at least 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. This change generally seemed to improve youth \nmorale. \nThere was an awards assembly on Friday thus, the Monitor could not observe youth in school \nduring this site visit. Below, are the Monitor’s observations: \nThe Monitor saw the majority of staff engaging with youth. As stated above, there was an awards \nceremony for the “Summer Games” event that took place (which included all the boys’ units other \nthan Krueger).  Awards were given out for both LHS/CLS youth.  The Monitor observed the \nceremony for LHS youth. The staff were sitting with youth, youth were engaged, and it was a positive \natmosphere with no incidents taking place.  It was evident that this was a joyous event for staff and \nyouth which carried into a positive atmosphere throughout the entire day. Youth attitudes overall \nwere very good during this site visit.  All the improvements in the school area made prior to the last \nsite visit are still evident. The school had positive messages throughout, artwork displayed, names \nof youth on the honor roll were displayed, windows in classrooms were no longer covered so there \nwas a clear unobstructed view which increases safety for staff and youth and the school was very \nclean. The Monitor previously recommended that the Defendants hire an education expert to \ncomplete an assessment of the educational programming at LHS/CLS. The expert was retained and \nprovided initial observations. The expert plans to return in November to further assess the education \ndepartment’s operations and make specific recommendations. The Defendants did move the girls’ \neducational programming out of the main school and into a smaller building in the Copper Lake \nsection of the facility, with far fewer amenities and facilities than in the main school.  The Monitor \nhighly recommended that the girls return to the main school as soon as possible. Defendants have \nindicated they will work towards this goal. In addition, youth on levels 1 and 2 in the Krueger \nProgram continue to attend school in classrooms on their living units. The Educational expert will \nmake recommendations to education and specifically address education for youth on Krueger.  \nAll the girls were back in Wells since the renovation project was completed. Staff were engaged \nwith the youth during free time, the unit was clean, the girls had good attitudes and were very polite \nand somewhat chatty. The safety/welfare checks were completed and up to date and staggered. One \nyouth was voluntarily in her room, but it was not documented. Staff on Wells need to make sure \nthey are logging when youth voluntarily go into and exit their rooms. The Monitor recommended \nthat the Defendants needed to focus on gender specific programming to enhance the programs and \nactivities for the girls’ facility. A Youth In Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”) subject matter \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 4 of 28\n \nexpert provided training to facility staff August 27-30, 2019. Administration should continue to \ntrain and utilize the training in their programming on a regular basis.  Feedback from the training \nwas very positive.  \nWith respect the boys’ cottages, generally, all the youth rooms were cleaner than last visit. The \nMonitor reviewed the safety/wellness documentation and it has greatly improved from the last \nvisit. Documentation complied with policy and procedure in 97% of the logs reviewed in LHS. \nStaff should be commended for the significant improvement in the safety/welfare observations and \ndocumentation. The Monitor made further recommendations to the forms that will make it easier \nfor staff to complete and would require less staffing. In previous reports, the Monitor commented \non staff placement on the unit. During this site visit, staff were placed near the youth and were \nmuch more interactive with the youth. However, now that the youth are all out of their rooms from \n8 A.M. to 8 P.M. (generally speaking), staff need to consider adjusting staff placement on the unit \nto make sure staff are aware of which youth are in the general living space, in their rooms, \nrestrooms, outdoor yard, etc. There were significantly less youth in their rooms during this site \nvisit than any of the previous site visits.  \nIn Krueger, the unit was clean. Youth rooms were messier on Krueger than during the last site \nvisit.  The Monitor observed three youth in their rooms but was told the youth were in the rooms \nat the youths’ request. Other youth were playing basketball, watching television, and making \nphone calls. Staff knew the count on the unit.  \nIn Addams, the living unit was clean and there was a beautiful mural on the wall.  There were no \nyouth on the unit as they were at recreation.  Although the graffiti was removed prior to the last \nvisit, there was significant graffiti in the youth rooms.  The bathroom was very dirty, and the \nfaucets were on slightly. The television was on in the unit despite there being no one on the unit. \nSafety/Welfare checks were unavailable since the youth were not in the cottage. \nIn Black Elk, the unit was clean and calm. There is a lot of graffiti in the rooms as was present \nduring the last site visit. Youth were playing cards, watching television, and braiding hair. Staff \nwere preparing lunch for the youth. Youth were appropriately chatty with the monitoring team and \nstaff. Four youth were in their rooms and the safety/welfare checks were completed and staggered. \nIn Curtis, the general area of the unit was clean and calm. Bathrooms were dirty. All youth were \nout of their rooms. Youth were very chatty.  Youth were watching television, making phone calls, \nand talking with each other. Safety/welfare checks were complete and staggered.  Med passes was \ntaking place and youth were appropriately receiving medication. Some of the youth rooms were \nclean and some were not. Staff were appropriately engaging with youth. \n \nThe Rogers unit was generally clean and youth rooms were generally clean. The bathroom was \nnot clean and had a strong smell of urine. Youth were watching television, playing cards, video \ngames and talking with each other.  One of the youth rooms had a strong smell of urine. Staff \nimmediately addressed this when the Monitor brought this to their attention. A few of the youth \nrooms had personal pictures on their windows. The Monitor informed the staff that the windows \ninto the youth rooms need to be unobstructed and pictures should be placed in another area of the \nroom.  Staff immediately removed the pictures. All youth were out in the day room (no one was \nconfined). Safety/welfare checks were conducted every 30 minutes or less and staggered.  Staff \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 5 of 28\n \nwere appropriately engaging with youth. \n \nIn Hughes, the unit was clean and calm. Youth rooms were generally clean. Youth were on the \ntelephone, talking with each other, and some youth were eating. The nurse was on the unit and \nengaged.  Youth were very chatty and spoke quite positively about LHS.  Youth rooms were \nmessy. Safety/welfare checks were complete and staggered. Staff were appropriately engaging \nwith youth. \n \nThe Roosevelt unit (TIP) was loud and the unit smelled. Some youth were watching television, some \nyouth were outside, were very chatty, and staff were engaged. The glass in the youth rooms has all \nbeen changed out to bigger windows. There were three youth with phone restrictions as confirmed by \nstaff. It is very important that youth have access to the telephone and be able to communicate with \nfamily.  The Monitor suggested that phone usage should not be a restriction unless there is an extreme \ncircumstance.  While  the  Defendants  use  of  phone  restrictions  as  a  sanction  has  decreased \nsignificantly during the reporting period, it is critical that eliminating phone restrictions except in \nextreme circumstances be implemented immediately. \nOnce all of the renovations in the cottages are completed, the Monitor believes this will enhance the \nsafety, well-being, and quality of life for youth and staff. The Monitor looks forward to the continued \nexpansion of the new rooms design throughout LHS and CLS. \n \nStaff and youth continue to make positive comments and have positive attitudes. The Monitor saw \nthe same positive interactions between staff and youth as the last visit.   LHS/CLS continues to have \nless of an institutional feel and the overall atmosphere has vastly improved. There is a significant \nreduction in the number of youth confined.   \n \nAdministration, staff and youth should be commended. There are still complaints from youth, \nhowever. The biggest complaints from youth were regarding the new vendor for canteen, perceived \nunfairness of how the new behavioral point system was applied, being bored due to lack of programs \nand activities, and being put on phone restrictions (which cuts them off from vital support from their \nfamilies).Due to the fact that youth have more time out of their rooms, there needs to be an even \nbigger focus on reducing youth idleness and more structured programming should be put into place.  \n \nStaffing  \nIn August 2019, Defendants hired a new Administrator who will oversee the Division of Juvenile \nCorrections.   Additionally, a new Security Director for LHS/CLS was hired in July 2019.  Direct \ncare staffing vacancy percentage has improved from the last site visit, however, staffing issues \ncontinue to exist at LHS/CLS. There are 311 total positions at LHS/CLS. Approximately 155 of \nthese positions are “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  \nThere are still a large number of staff on various leaves of absence (FMLA/Workers’ Comp, etc.) \nwhich contributes to the staffing shortages and mandated overtime. The teacher vacancy rate \nremains high but with slight improvement over the last three months. Recruiting is still a challenge. \nThis is directly impacting education for youth. The Monitor looks forward to the educational \nexpert’s assessment/report which will be available after his second site visit. \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 6 of 28\n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of   Vacancy Rate % as  Vacancy Rate % as of \nNovember 28, 2018  March 14, 2019  of May 31, 2019  Sept. 6, 2019 \nYouth   22% (23 of 105)  15% (16 out of 105)  11.5% (12 out of 105)  14% (15 out of 105) \nCounselor \nYouth  18% (9 of 50)  48% (24 out of 50)  50% (25 out of 50)  7% ( 3.5 out of 50) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  39% (11 of 28)  39% (11 of 28)  43% (12 of 28)  36% (10 of 28) \nSocial Worker  14% (2 of 14)  0% (14 of 14)  0% (14 of 14)  21.5% (3 of 14) \n \nIn order to address staffing challenged at LHS/CLS, effective April 28, 2019, security personnel \nbegan  receiving  a  $5.00/hour  add-on  for  worked  hours.  Eligible  employees  are  in  the \nclassifications  of  Correctional  Officer,  Correctional  Sergeant,  Youth  Counselor  and  Youth \nCounselor Advanced.  Additionally, most recent youth counselor academy began in August of \n2019 and has 23 members. This is a considerable increase compared to the academies earlier this \nyear. Prior to the $5.00 add-on, the vacancy rate for the Youth Counselor and Youth Counselor \nAdvance staff was at approximately twenty percent (20%). As of August, that has fallen to ten \npercent (10%) which is an overall decrease of approximately fifty percent (50%).  The Monitor \nalso recommended non-traditional scheduling. LHS/CLS has decided to implement a 12-hour \nschedule starting in November. In the last report, the Monitor recommended that the facility \nconduct a full staffing assessment to include a relief factor analysis looking at all leave types and \nits impact on staffing levels. A staffing assessment has been completed.  The Monitor made \nrecommendations to the staffing analysis.  \nThe Monitor spoke to over twenty-eight (28) staff and the majority of staff seem energetic despite \nworking many double shifts. The vast majority of staff expressed the desire to have more \nprogramming for youth.  The Monitor asked staff their thoughts on the new 12-hour schedule and \nmost staff are fine with the change. In fact, more staff were concerned that they will lose overtime \nonce the schedule changes.  In response to the Monitor’s last report, the administration conducted \nSituational Awareness Training (a POSC update training) focused on alternative techniques to \nprevent and address behavioral problems provided to staff in July and August. The facility plans \nto continue this, and other similar trainings based on staff input going forward. Staff said they \nenjoy interacting with youth and are accepting of the changes that are taking place. Staff did not \nhave a problem with youth no longer being confined during shift changes, medicine pass, or due \nto split hall. Most staff did not have a fear that the elimination of OC Spray was coming. Most \nstaff continue to show more attention to building relationships with youth and in engaging youth \nin a positive manner. \nThe Defendants have implemented many of the recommendations for staff wellness. The Monitor \ncontinues to stress the need to make staff wellness a major focus moving forward. The Monitor saw \nthat there were employees recognized as “Employees of the Month.”  The Monitor also suggested \ncreating a relaxing staff break room especially since they will be working 12-hour shifts starting in \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 7 of 28\n \nNovember.  It is important that the break room is inviting and relaxing and should not have an \ninstitutional  feel.  The  Defendants  should  continue  to  create  policy  driven  staff  recognition \nprograms,  and  tap  into  staff’s  talents,  passions,  and  interests  to bring  into  programming  as \npreviously recommended. \nThere has been improved communication with staff and youth regarding the reform effort (written \nand verbal).  Many of the communications to staff and youth have been written a positive manner, \nalthough there is a need to ensure that new policies and instructions do not focus on the court order \nas reason for changes, but rather emphasize that these changes constitute proper policy and \nprocedure.   As recommended in the technical assistance report, staff are engaged in developing \nprogramming and policy changes and are actively participating in youth and family council \nmeetings. However, staff can further be engaged in these processes.  There is too much unstructured \nfree time throughout LHS/CLS.  The Monitor made recommendations of furthering meaningful \nstaff engagement (groups on canteen issues, creating a newsletter, talent shows etc.)  \nAs part of the agency and facility commitment to improving conditions for both staff and youth, \nthey are continuing to engage in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (YICPM), which was \nexplained in the previous Monitor report.   \nThe Monitor suggested modifying the mental health (PSU) and recreational staff work schedules \nto include more evening and weekend hours. PSU work until at least 8 P.M. during the week and \nare on-call 24/7. The Defendants should continue to involve PSU staff, especially leadership, in \nmaking improvements at the facility (such as improvements to incentives, consequences, and \nworking with the OJOR system.) Currently, there is a PSU staff member who comes in each \nweekend to perform rounds and will report to the facility as needed in addition to the scheduled \nrounds. Recreation staff are working until 9 or 10 P.M. and two new Recreation Leaders were \nhired in July and September. One will focus on art and the other on music.   \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nTo address the need for a quality assurance and improvement program, the Defendants have \ncreated and now filled both QA positions (Quality Assurance Specialist and Program and Policy \nAnalyst). The goal is to continuously assess not only compliance with this court order, but the \nquality and adequacy of the social and recreational programming provided, healthcare, education, \nenvironmental health, safety, and discipline. The Monitor has begun working with the individuals \nselected for these positions.  \nDefendants have created a comprehensive quality assurance program that will greatly increase the \naccuracy and quality of data.   Defendants have developed new systems and review processes.   It \nis clear that the persons responsible for quality assurance are eager to make improvements.   The \nMonitor anticipates a huge improvement in data collection in the months to come.  During each \nsite visit, the Monitor focuses on different aspects of the operation.  During this site visit, the \nMonitor spent a lot of time going over data and discussing how data can be used in different \ncapacities in order to make decisions impacting the lives of youth and staff.  The Monitor made \nsuggestions on forms used that will allow line staff to more easily record data that can then be   \ncollected and analyzed.  The Monitor provided samples of policies which included quality \nassurance   measures.  The Defendants have created a “Quality Assurance Review” process that \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 8 of 28\n \nwill be completed every month.  The Defendants have drafted policy and procedure based on the \nMonitor’s  suggestions.    Additionally,  “Incident  Debrief  Process”  enhancements  have  been \nimplemented and continue to be developed for further improvement. Visual Monitoring, youth \ncomplaints, and CARE Team quality assurance processes have been developed and implemented. \nObservation checks, incident debrief, and searches are the next processes to be piloted. Facility \nProcedures including a QA portion for eight different processes have been drafted and are in the \nfinal stages of internal approval process. \nData recording has improved in safety/security checks, incident reports, use of force reports, \ngrievances, PSU/Medical documentation, mechanical restraints, searches, and meals in and out of \nroom on Krueger.  There needs to be a continued focus on adequacy of data collected and analysis \nof other subjects of the court order.  Defendants need to make this is a priority.  \nThe Monitor has discussed PbS in detail in previous reports, and thus, will not go into detail in this \nfourth report.  Although PbS data collection cycles occur twice annually, in April and October, the \nDefendants are looking into ways to monitor the critical outcome measures on a monthly basis, \npossibly using J-Tracker.  Facility Improvement Plans have been created after PbS Coach Site Visit \nand has been forwarded to the Monitor. \nThe Program and Policy team for the Division of Juvenile Corrections should continue to work with \nthe vendor (J-Tracker) to include other critical measures as described during the site visit and \ncontinue to work towards developing an electronic room check system. A vendor has been awarded \na contract for electronic room checks and additional tracking of other youth activity. \nPolicies and Procedures  \n \nRevisions to policy, procedure and Administrative Codes are occurring but have not been finalized. \nDJC Administrative Rules Committee had its first meeting on May 30, 2019. The process for \namending Administrative Code DOC Chapter 376 began as of September 3, 2019. The process for \namending DOC Chapter 373 will begin after public hearings on the scope statement describing \nchanges are held on September 20. All policies refer to the Administrative Code and thus \nmodifications to the Administrative Code should continue to be a priority. Two previously existing \ndivision policies have draft amendments and six facility procedures have been drafted including a \nQA portion: \n  \nTwo division policies: \n300.05.09 – Searches of Youth \n500.70.04 – Clinical Observation \n \nSix facility procedures: \n900.04.01 – CARE Team \n900.05.01 – Visual Monitoring \n900.05.02 – Mechanical Restraints \n900.05.03 – Administrative Confinement \n900.05.04 – Rapid Response Team \n900.05.05 – Incident Debrief \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 9 of 28\n \n \nInterim policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be developed.  Policies relevant \nto LHS/CLS need to be compliant with the federal court orders and should contain a quality \nassurance section for every policy. Defendants should continue to update policy and procedures \nbecause without updated policies and procedures which include quality assurance measures, \nsubstantial compliance with the court order cannot be achieved.    \nThere  should  be  formalized  training  with  employee  sign  offs  acknowledging  receipt  and \nunderstanding all policies and procedures. Effective proficiency testing for all training classes still \nneeds to be developed. The Monitor will continue to work with the Defendants on policy and \nprocedure. \nYouth Interviews  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and the Monitor conducted several youth interviews. Approximately thirty-two \n(32) youth were interviewed during the site visit (formally and informally). In previous visits, \nseveral youth wanted a more formal discussion with the ACLU attorney and/or Monitor.  There \nwere significantly less requests this visit.  In general, the major complaints from youth were the \nnew canteen vendor, perceived unfairness in how the point system was applied, being cut off from \nthe phone—and therefore often family contact—as a punishment, and the desire to have more \nthings to do. The overwhelming majority said that they were not confined much, if at all, were not \nrestrained, and were not strip searched. A few youths did like when staff did unit and rooms searches.  \nMost youth did not have complaints about staff but there were still a few youths concerned about \nhow some staff members treated them.   Most youth liked the modified behavior management \nprogram. There were a few who discussed certain situations and the Monitor and ACLU looked into \nthe allegations during and after the site visit. Because of the new policies regarding open dayrooms \n(no split out time) and doors on privilege (youth can leave their rooms without permission), \nconfinement due to split halls, counts, shift change, and medication pass is effectively ending \nconfinement outside of administrative confinement. The Monitor believes that has had an overall \npositive impact.   \nMost staff were engaged with youth in a positive manner and were placed in the vicinity of youth. \nAs mentioned, staff positioning probably needs to be reevaluated now that all youth are out of their \nrooms and have more freedom to move about.  \n \nThe Monitor observed (and youth reported) several positive interactions between youth and staff. \nDefendants have implemented more PM programming activities. PSU has also initiated a number of \nadditional groups and expanded the availability of these sessions to youth. Defendants continue to \noffer more programming however, there is still too much idle time especially during the weekend. \nDefendants are and should continue to identify more resources and continue to implement the \nprograms as recommended by the experts retained. Defendants have made significant progress in \nimproving the quality of life for youth and staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree. As previously stated, \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 10 of 28\n \nthere is a challenge with adequacy of data for many areas (documentation, accuracy, consistency, \nand analysis) thus, some sections do not contain a detailed narrative.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand procedure –and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for three days.  If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy \nand  procedure  –  and  if  this  improvement  is  sustained  -  they  will  reach  substantial \ncompliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: There is no evidence in data/reports that indicate youth are being \nsubject to punitive room confinement.  During this reporting period, the Defendants have \nimproved documentation and have issued directives and created procedures to address \nyouth behavior.   If Defendants improve their quality of data and documentation and \nincorporate the court order into policy and procedure – and if this improvement is sustained \n- they will reach substantial compliance. \n \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement.  Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 11 of 28\n \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he \nor  she  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During the last reporting period, \nthere were instances in which administrative confinement was being used for youth who did \nnot pose a serious risk of imminent physical harm. It also appeared that, rather than \nreleasing youth from confinement as soon as they no longer pose a risk, Defendants were \ngenerally treating four hours as a default minimum period of time for administrative \nconfinement. The Monitor suggested how to document this requirement in policy and in \nforms as well as made suggestions to place youth in the day room once they no longer pose a \nserious  risk  of  imminent  physical  harm  to  others.  Defendants  have  incorporated  the \nMonitor’s suggestions.  Documentation and data from July were utilized in the incident \ndebriefing  and  administrative  confinement  process  which  has  significantly  enhanced \nDefendant’s ability to track administrative confinement placements. Incident Debrief and \nadministrative  confinement  procedures  are  part  of  the  eight  procedures  drafted  and \nundergoing review prior to finalization. The Monitor suggested alternatives to confinement \nfor administrative purposes such as med pass, counts, shift change, and split hall time. As of \nSeptember 3, open dayrooms and doors on privilege have addressed many confinement \nissues  during  these  periods.    During  the  last  site  visit,  generally,  youth  who  were  in \nadministrative confinement were transferred to the Krueger program.  This has changed in \nthat now most youth serve the administrative confinement on their home unit. Some youth \nare serving their confinement on Krueger and are referred to the “Krueger Program.” The \nKrueger Program has been modified based on some of the Monitor’s recommendations, but \nthere is still more refinement that needs to happen.  Although youth have behavioral plans \ndeveloped, the program needs to be improved to include more robust behavioral plans and \nthe plan needs to be revisited with more frequency should a youth not be able to return to \nthe home unit in an appropriate period of time.  The Monitor also suggested that the \nDefendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a youth to move through levels 1 and 2 \nand that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the criteria for referral into the program \nas well as criteria for exiting the program.  Defendants conduct training, improve their \nquality of data and documentation and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure \n– and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach substantial compliance. \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 12 of 28\n \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  In a large number of instances, it \ndoes not seem that administrative confinement is being extended. In the instances where \nconfinement has been extended, a mental health associate (PSU) has authorized it. If \nDefendants improve their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the court \norder into policy and procedure – and if this improvement is sustained - they will reach \nsubstantial compliance. \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  During the last site visit, generally, \nyouth who were in administrative confinement were in the Krueger program.  This has \nchanged in that now most youth serve the administrative confinement on their home unit. \nSome youth are serving their confinement on Krueger and are referred to the “Krueger \nProgram.” The Krueger Program has been modified based on  some of  the Monitor’s \nrecommendations, but there is still more refinement that needs to happen.  Although youth \nhave behavioral plans developed, the program needs to be improved to include more robust \nbehavioral plans and the plan needs to be revisited with more frequency should a youth not \nbe able to return in an appropriate period of time.  The Monitor also suggested that the \nDefendants evaluate the length of time it takes for a youth to move through levels 1 and 2 \nand that the policy and procedure clearly outlines the criteria for referral into the program.  \nDefendants need to improve their quality of data and documentation and incorporate the \ncourt order into policy and procedure and train staff accordingly. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \npm to 8 am.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  is  no  evidence  that \nadministrative confinement has been extended beyond 24 hours, and thus there have not \nbeen  such  transfer  plans  created.  If  Defendants  improve  their  quality  of  data  and \ndocumentation, and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure, they will be in \nsubstantial compliance. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 13 of 28\n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. If Defendants improve their quality \nof data and documentation, and incorporate the court order into policy and procedure, they \nwill be in substantial compliance. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended pol icy. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 was updated on 9/19/18 and the dates contained in the policy has been corrected. \nThe Monitor suggests a more formal training and staff sign off reflecting they read and \nunderstand policy. Additionally, a quality assurance mechanism needs to be finalized.  \n \n  \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. The Monitor recommended that Defendants replace the \nexisting room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for \nsecure  environments.  The  new  replacement  furniture  which  is  in  the  Wells  unit  is \nconsistent with what the Monitor would expect to see in a secure facility and should \ncertainly reduce the opportunity for suicidal incidents within the youth rooms. There is a \nplan in place to make such changes in the rest of LHS/CLS.  \nWith respect to youth rooms, there was some change from the last site visit. Most youth \nrooms had their beds made and were cleaner than last visit. The Monitor did not observe \nrooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of the room. Room searches are \ntaking place more often.  There has been significant improvement on graffiti and etching \non the glass which has improved staff’s ability to clearly see the youth through the \nwindow. Also, on the TIP unit, the Monitor recommended that the windows to be changed \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 14 of 28\n \n(they were very small and pretty high on the door).  These new windows have been \ninstalled.  \nSafety/Welfare  checks  have  significantly  improved  and  are  now  being  done  on  an \nindividual  basis.  Safety/welfare  documentation  show  that  room  checks  are  being \ncompleted at least every 30 minutes and are staggered in the majority of cases. Defendants \nhave provided additional personnel to ensure that the checks are being done in accordance \nto policy and procedure.  There are also regular quality assurance reviews in order to \nincrease compliance.  As previously mentioned in this report, The Monitor has made \nrecommendations to the forms that will simplify the process. The Monitor recognizes that \nan electronic system is being explored by the agency, but this will take some time. \nSafety/welfare checks should continue to be a priority and progress needs to continue to \nbe made. While not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend \nincreasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when \nyouth  are  confined  to  their  rooms  as  this  is  supported  by  JDAI  standards,  PREA \nstandards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. Defendants should \nbe commended for the vast improvement on these safety/welfare checks.   \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain about \naccess to water, hygiene supplies, or night time toilet usage.  This is a huge improvement \nfrom the last visit. If Defendants improve their quality of data and documentation, and \nincorporate the court order into policy and procedure, they will be in substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nbut still needs more improvement.  Time of call to PSU staff is now being documented on \nthe incident report in most instances, but there is room for improvement. This requirement \nshould be included in the development of a quality assurance program. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 15 of 28\n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Monitor  requested  any \ndocumentation  indicating  that  confinement  is  contraindicated  and  there  were  no \ninstances documented during this review period. There is a form “Psychology Input for \nSecurity Decision” which is where the contraindication would be documented and there \nis a policy (Policy 500.70.04). \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Safety/Welfare  checks  have \nsignificantly improved and are now being done on an individual basis. Safety/welfare \ndocumentation show that room checks are being completed at least every 30 minutes and \nare staggered in the majority of cases. Defendants have provided additional personnel to \nensure that the checks are being done in accordance to policy and procedure.  There are \nalso regular quality assurance reviews in order to increase compliance. As previously \nmentioned in this report, The Monitor has made recommendations to the forms that will \nsimplify the process. The Monitor recognizes that an electronic system is being explored \nby the agency, but this will take some time. Safety/welfare checks should continue to be a \npriority and progress needs to continue to be made.  \nDefendants are holding staff accountable for this reporting period as there were  27 \n“Letters  of  Expectation”  and  two  staff  were  formally  disciplined  related  to  visual \nmonitoring. The agency is going to implement an electronic, software-based rounds \nchecking system. PSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and have increased in-person \nhours on the weekend as recommended by the Monitor.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 16 of 28\n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing \nthe frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. Defendants should be commended for the \nvast improvement on these safety/welfare checks.   \n \n \nf.   Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary in \nnature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and implemented.  \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Social  worker  visits,  mental \nhealth services, and other health services are provided.  Once documentation, the quality \nassurance program is finalized, and this requirement is clearly in policy and procedure, \nDefendants will be in substantial compliance.  \n \nii.  Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a lack of documentation as \nto specific programming that occurs daily.  The Monitor anticipates this will change once the \nKrueger Program is updated/modified according to discussions during the site visits. Also, \nthere are occasions where staffing levels do not allow for planned programming. There has \nbeen improvement in available programming, but there is still a lack of other activities for \nyouth to engage in resulting in excessive amounts of idle time. At the visit, it was stated that \nthe OJOR no longer requires specific programming such as ART to be released from LHS \nand that the programming provided in the Krueger program (such as DBT) will suffice, but \nthis needs to be verified, documented and included in policy and procedure. \n \niii.   Educational services with the general population to the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 17 of 28\n \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Educational Services for general \npopulation occur in the classrooms in the school area. Youth in the Targeted Intervention \nProgram (“TIP”) attend classes in the school area but separate from the general population. \nYouth in Krueger do not receive educational services in the school area (except for youth on \nPhase 3) but remain on living units. Additionally, during this reporting period, administration \ndecided to move the girls’ educational services out of the traditional school area and into a \nbuilding  with  far  fewer  amenities  and  facilities  than  the  main  school.  The  Monitor \nrecommends that all youth regardless of status have education in the school area.  The \neducation expert will make further recommendations that should be implemented. The \nDefendants are working on bringing more culturally relevant program into LHS/CLS. \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  “Out  time”  has  significantly \nimproved in the last three weeks of this reporting period. “Split hall” (which means a portion \nof youth are confined to their rooms while others are  out, and they rotate) ceased in \nSeptember. The Monitor regularly saw youth conversing with other youth and staff during \nout time.  In youth interviews, youth stated that they are not really confined to their rooms at \nall.   Youth still want more structured activities when they are out of their rooms and feel they \ndo not really do anything, which, as discussed elsewhere, is a significant problem. The \nKrueger program is out of pilot form, and the leadership has re-evaluated the program to \nensure compliance with the court order and technical assistance report with the Monitor’s \nassistance. More refinement to the Krueger Program needs to occur as discussed during the \nsite visit.  Enhancing programs and meaningful activities for the Krueger program should \nhave a positive impact and allow for youth to return to their home cottages more quickly. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 18 of 28\n \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The majority of meals take place \nout of the room but there are several occasions where youth eat meals in their rooms when \nthere is not an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm. The Monitor did not \nwitness youth eating in their rooms but has reviewed documentation in which youth are \neating meals in their room.  Should a youth eat a meal in their room, the decision by staff \nneeds to be justified, supported by documentation, and instances need to be reviewed by \nfacility administrators. Meals are not documented on living units except Krueger, but they \nneed to be. When reviewing the Krueger documentation, a large number of youth are eating \nin their rooms without evidence of a threat of physical harm. There are less blank entries \n(meaning staff is not documenting whether youth are eating in rooms or not)  than during \nthe last review period.  Policy and procedure needs to incorporate this section of the court \norder and quality assurance measure created. \nvi.  Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per \nweek and at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population \non a given day shall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week. This has significantly increased \nsince confinement due to split halls, confinement for shift change, counts, and medicine pass \nhas been discontinued.  Documentation and data collection need to be improved.   \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. It is not clear whether youth are \nbeing told that they can grieve their placements in room confinement at all (or being told \nthey can do so within 15 minutes of placement). There were 109 grievances filed by youth \nduring this reporting period (on a variety of issues, not just placement). This indicates many \nyouths utilize the grievance procedures.  Defendants do have a robust tracking system in \nplace.  Defendants do analyze and have created measures for youth grievances. The quality \nassurance piece needs to ensure grievances are being timely and appropriately addressed \nand  communicated  to  youth.  The  Monitor  made  recommendations  to  forms  which  if \nimplemented, should improve data collection. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 19 of 28\n \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis more consistently. In addition to improved documentation, there are significantly fewer \ninstances of room confinement.  Documentation needs to continue to be completed and \nconsistently applied to all situations, other than sleeping hours, in which youth are confined \nalone in their rooms and the reason for the confinement.  Documentation, data collection \nand  reliability,  and  quality  assurance  needs  to  continue  to  be  improved.  Also, \ndocumentation needs to be created that prove a youth was promptly provided with the \nreport upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC usage has significantly been \nreduced during this reporting period.  The Monitor made several recommendations including \nincreased training, implementing a specialized team, and ensuring incident reviews are \nmeaningful.  Defendants have/will be implementing these recommendations. The CARE \nTeam has been expanded and the specialized team is being created. Defendants should \ncontinue  to do  regular  training  on  de-escalation. Additionally, as  recommended  in  the \ntechnical  assistance  report,  a new  incentive-based  behavior  management  program  that \nfocuses on rewarding positive behavior has been created which will have a direct impact on \nyouth behavior and thus, reduce the need for force of any kind. Continued focus on training, \nskills development and coaching, continued focus on overall atmosphere should have a \npositive impact on the number of incidents requiring this type of intervention.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 20 of 28\n \nThe below graph reflects the combined usage of OC at LHS and CLS in 2019. \n \nLHS/CLS 2019 Combined Chemical Restraint Use  \n12\n10 10\n10\n8 8\n8\n6 5\n4 3 3\n2 1\n0\nJan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug\nLHS/CLS Use 2019\n \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  N/A.    It  was  not  12  months  at  the  time  of  the  site  visit. \nCompliance will be assessed by the Monitor at the time required under this section. \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visits, but logs show there are occasions where \nyouth are placed in mechanical restraints. With better documentation and quality assurance \nmeasures, and final policy and procedure, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial \ncompliance with this provision if they can document and establish that there were not less \nrestrictive means available and quality assurance measures and final policy and procedure \nare in place. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 21 of 28\n \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraints are rarely \nused. Documentation has improved over this reporting period.  Documentation needs to be \nimproved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm and when and how that \nprocess is reviewed. With better documentation and quality assurance measures, Defendants \nmay be close to achieving substantial compliance with this provision. \n \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nii.  Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative  to  when  restraints  have  been  used  and  rationale  for  usage.    With  better \ndocumentation  and  quality  assurance  measures  and  continuing  to  reduce  the  use  of \nrestraints, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this provision. \n \n iii.  During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 22 of 28\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision. \n \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With better documentation, policy revisions, and quality \nassurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance with this \nprovision.   \n \nf.   Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper de-escalation (13 trainings June-September 2019). However, de-escalation training \nneeds to be completed more often (regular, informal, refreshers) so that staff can continue \nto develop this skill. Proper de-escalation cannot be trained only once, or even only once a \nyear. The Monitor continues to suggest having staff who are very good at de-escalation \nwork with staff who could use a refresher or with new staff especially since a large majority \nare new.  \n \ng.   Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be  left alone in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  With better documentation, policy \nrevisions,  and  quality  assurance  measures,  Defendants  may  be  close  to  achieving \nsubstantial compliance with this provision.   \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 23 of 28\n \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process itself is being \nanalyzed for improvement. New data will be available.  The use of mechanical restraints \nhas been significantly curtailed and documentation including the length of time youth \nspend in restraints when the use of mechanical restraints occurs is now being documented \nas part of the Incident Debrief process. If Defendants maintains this, they will be close to \nachieving substantial compliance.  \n \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Cou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation shows that there are \noccasions where youth are strip searched, albeit at a reduced frequency. In July, there were \nzero strip searches with or without probable cause. Blanket strip searches of youth at intake \nor returning from court has ceased. Hygiene checks have been completely eliminated as of \nAugust 6, 2019.   The policy for searches needs to be finalized. Defendants are close to being \nin substantial compliance. \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation shows that strip \nsearching still occurs but on a much lesser frequency. In July, there were zero strip searches \nwith or without probable cause. Blanket strip searches of youth at intake or returning from \ncourt has ceased. Hygiene checks have been completely eliminated as of August 6, 2019.   The \npolicy for searches needs to be finalized. Defendants are close to being in substantial \ncompliance. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 24 of 28\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved as to how staff are ensuring that unintended individuals cannot view the search \n(detail the area where search is occurring, state that there are no recording devices, and \ndocument who is present in the area, etc.) If documentation and policy revisions are made, \nsubstantial compliance can be obtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  needs  to  be \nimproved detailing the area where search is conducted and how other youth cannot view the \nyouth being strip searched.  If documentation and policy revisions are made, substantial \ncompliance can be obtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation needs to be improved \nas to which staff conducted the search, that the search is by staff who is of the same gender \nidentity as the youth if the strip search is being conducted by someone other than a medical \nprofessional. The Monitor previously recommended form changes for documentation purposes. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that \nstaff have been trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor is told by direct care \nstaff and PSU is consulted. Documentation needs to be improved.  \n \n4.  Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The  process  for  tracking  and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. With continued practices, Defendants will be in substantial compliance.  \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 25 of 28\n \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most staff have been trained in the \nnew MANDT training and other training which includes de-escalation skills training. The \nMonitor recommends increasing the training frequency for staff to increase their experience \nand skill levels in managing and de-escalating situations before they result in the use of force, \nrestraint and/or isolation. All staff have completed Mandt training in 2018 and it is included \nas a component of the Youth Counselor Academy. All staff are required to attend a Mandt \nrefresher training in 2019. There are multiple sessions available to staff beginning in October \n2019. The use of force review process has improved.  It is more thorough, comprehensive, and \ntimely. Corrective action plans when force was used where it could have been avoided are \nbeing done in most cases. The Monitor recommended in instances where de-escalation was \nsuccessful, those examples should be used as a training tool for other staff including having \nother staff view the videos. \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of id le time in the \nfacility to no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable \nefforts to implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Many of the recommendations that \nwere made in the February 2018 technical assistance report have been implemented such as \nfamily  events,  yoga/Zumba,  increased  tournaments,  more  arts,  and  the  additional \nprogramming listed in the narrative part of the Third Report of the Monitor.  Youth \nadvisory and family councils have been implemented and the Monitor’s recommendations \nhave been incorporated into the process (agendas, minutes, frequency, and increased staff \ninvolvement). Recreation leaders have been hired to focus on art and music. There have been \nmusical instruments purchased.  The Monitor witnessed youth drawing and painting during \nthe site visit.  The Monitor also saw the beautiful murals and art work of the youth and staff. \nThe Health Services Unit (“HSU”) puts on monthly educational activities that youth can \nparticipate,  and  tablets  have  been  ordered  for  youth.  New  PSU  groups  have  been \nimplemented (Mindfulness, Music, Movement, and Movie).  PSU is also doing several groups \nfor the CLS students involving teamwork, leadership, and cooperation. Additionally, a \nweekly schedule of activities has been created as recommended by the Monitor. Although \nthere were more activities for youth during this reporting period, there is still a significant \namount of idle time.  Now that youth are basically out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M., \nthere is a need for more activities/programming. These activities/programming should be \nadded in addition to school, not as a substitute for education.  Also, some of the youth \ncomplained about not having music accessible to them. Perhaps, MP3 players could be more \nwidely dispersed amongst all youth.   \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 26 of 28\n \nAs recommended previously, counselors, recreation workers, social workers, PSU staff, and \nvolunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for youth. Several staff made \nsuggestions for programming such as art therapy, dog therapy, increased tournaments, job \nreadiness skills, music, balance and restorative justice, and teen court. Many of these \nsuggestions  have  been  implemented.  Administration  needs  to  increase \nmeaningful/structured program and activity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours. \nAs mentioned previously, increasing education hours, including for youth who have obtained \na diploma or HSED, can greatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth \ndevelopment strategies through meaningful education and vocational programming. The \nDefendants have retained a consultant that can assist with developing gender and culturally \nappropriate programming.  \n \nG.  Staffing.  Immediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nagreement, Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to improve staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February \n26, 2018 report and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa \nAbreu and Jennifer Lutz. Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to implement \nthe recommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Most of the recommendations made \nin the February 2018 report have been implemented such as conducting a staffing analysis, \nhiring bonuses to obtain new staff, increased wages for current staff, staff recognition, and \nstaff wellness initiatives. There still are major staffing challenges due to various employee \nleaves and teacher vacancies. Job descriptions have been updated to highlight the youth \ncounselor aspect of position instead of “guard” or “corrections” description. Defendants will \nbe moving to a 12-hour shift starting in November with the goal of assisting with the staffing \nissues.  The Monitor encourages the Defendants to closely monitor the impact.  Given the \nlong-standing staffing deficiencies, there is an urgent need to also explore methods for \npromptly reducing youth populations. This might include expediting the OJOR process and \nevaluating  youth  for  placement  under  community  supervision,  including  intensive \ncommunity supervision, as permitted by state law. The Monitor suggests utilizing a strength-\nbased model and ensuring that time spent in units like Krueger is not counted against a youth \nwho comply with the Krueger Program. The average daily population has decreased slightly, \nbut not enough to relieve the staffing issues. \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DOC has identified sections of the \nAdministrative  Code  that  need  to  be  modified,  but  significant  revisions  have  not  yet \noccurred. The process for amending Administrative Code DOC Chapter 376 began as of \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 27 of 28\n \nSeptember 3. The process for amending DOC Chapter 373 will begin after public hearings \non the scope statement describing changes are held on September 20. Interim policies for \nLHS/CLS need to be drafted while waiting for final Code revisions. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There has been an improvement in \nmeeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after an incident. An area of \nimprovement is having staff involved brought together for meaningful discussions. When \nit has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a corrective action plan \ndeveloped now but quality assurance needs to be improved. There is a new QA process \nimplemented for visual monitoring and a framework for other QA measures relating to the \nconsent decree is being created.  \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goa ls that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Critical quality assurance positions \nare now filled and will be assisting in developing a quality assurance program. The Monitor \nreviewed sample performance goals, reviewed PbS in great detail, and made suggestions for \nmonthly performance measures and how to incorporate into policy. The Monitor and the \nQA staff met and discussed various data points and reports. As discussed throughout this \nreport, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and \nto improve the quality of life for youth and staff.  The Monitor is confident that the \nDefendants will create a competent quality assurance program. \n \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 113   Filed: 10/11/19   Page 28 of 28\n \nCONCLUSION \nThere have been significant improvements to the physical plant of LHS/CLS which is providing a \nless institutionalized feel for youth and staff. Staff and youth interactions have significantly changed \nfor the better. The overall atmosphere today has vastly improved from a year ago.  Leadership, staff, \nand youth should be commended because it took a lot of hard work by all to get to the place where \nLHS/CLS is today.  Defendants have more programming for youth than LHS/CLS has ever had \navailable to youth. Confinement time has been substantially reduced. Direct- care staff vacancies have \nbeen reduced.  Critical data/quality assurance positions have been hired. As a result of the progress \nmade, it is clearly evident that these changes are having a positive impact on the overall atmosphere \nand culture of the facility.  \nContinued efforts need to be made with reducing teacher vacancies and increasing educational time \nand quality. Krueger Program needs to be refined. Regular training in de-escalation and physical \nrestraint techniques need to occur. Policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be \ndeveloped. Phone sanctions must cease. Implementing the new quality assurance program needs to \nbe a primary goal.  The physical plant improvements need to continue as scheduled.   \nAlthough there is more work to do, the Monitor is very pleased with the progress made over the last \nyear.  The Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the \nparties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n28 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n NINTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Eighth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on January 25, 2021. The Monitor’s \nninth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the eighth site visit which took place on December 17, 2020.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe ninth site visit by the Monitor took place on March 18, 2021.  Due to the pandemic, the \nMonitor limited onsite time to one day and completed necessary interviews/information gathering \nvia virtual meetings prior to and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed materials provided by \nthe parties prior to and after the site visit for the reporting period ending February 28, 2021. \nMaterials included but were not limited to: use of force videos, video footage of units, COVID-19 \nrelated memos, directives and plans, programming materials, project plans, grievances, various \nstaff memos, daily shift reports, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court \nOrder (December 2020, January 2021, and February 2021), updated unit rules, work rules, meeting \nnotes, employee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint documentation, \nincident reports, and other housing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel and the monitoring team \nwere on site during this site visit. Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted youth interviews virtually before \nthe visit, and in person during the visit. The Monitor took photographs, toured LHS/CLS, and \ninterviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to the majority of youth and \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 2 of 34\n \nstaff present and available during the site visit. Approximately forty-eight (48) youth and thirty-\nthree (33) staff were interviewed formally and informally by the Monitor during this site visit.   \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction \n \nAll of the COVID-19 modifications were still in place during this reporting period. Additionally, \nrapid antigen testing is available and in use at LHS/CLS.  In February, the facility installed a new \ninstrument for scanning temperatures upon entry to the facility moving away from hand held \ntemperate check devices.  COVID-19 vaccines have been and continue to be available for staff. \nCommunication has also been sent out to parents/legal guardians of youth (16 years of age and \nolder) to give consent to administer to those youth who meet the department of health’s guidelines.  \nAlthough March is not part of this reporting period, it is important to note that as of March 15, \n2021, youth began attending education services in the school area.  The Monitor is happy to report \nthat all staff present wore face coverings properly at all times.  More youths wore masks than last \nsite visit due to education taking place in the school area.  There have been Covid-19 positive \nyouth and staff during this reporting period.   \n  \nThe total LHS/CLS population remains low, ranging from the high 50’s to low 60’s.  There is a \npositive change in the overall atmosphere from the last visit.  There continues to be concern \nregarding programming, use of force, restraints, and other issues, however, overall, there has been \nimprovement and progress in several areas of the consent decree from the last site visit.  In the last \nreport, the Monitor stated that some of the issues reported during the last site visit could be \nalleviated or reduced if additional support staff were on site providing more normalized facility \noperations, primarily around education, treatment, mental health services, etc.  The Defendants \nhave made efforts to normalize education, treatment, and mental health services by having more \nstaff present on site which is having a positive impact on staff and youth.  \nPhysical Plant Observations \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, units, school, and many other areas were extremely neat and \nclean. The facility overall looked the best it has in the last two years. Staff and youth should be \ncommended for all their efforts.  The installation of a roof deterrent system has been substantially \ncompleted.  A room in each of the ten (10) living units has been renovated to create a dedicated \nspace that can be used for treatment or for self-calming and de-escalation.  Furnishings and décor \n(furniture, pillows, rugs, posters etc.) still need to be placed in/on some of the units. Eighty percent \n(80%) of the renovation of a large school storage room into a new art room has been completed.  \nThe new room will be used to provide a space to work with PSU on art therapy.  There are also \nsignificant modifications being made to the music room that will enhance the music programming.  \nYouth will be able to create music for themselves, family, and perform for their peers and staff \nwhile at LHS/CLS.  Youth are extremely excited about these new renovations. Additional projects \nnot yet completed are the camera upgrade, electrical upgrade, and remaining two cottage remodels \n(scheduled to be completed in June 2021).  The Monitor will continue to update the Court on \nphysical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and staff.   \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 3 of 34\n \nEducation Observations \nAs previously mentioned, on March 24, 2020, the schools began providing education on the units \nwith most education staff working off-site.  As of February 22, 2021, the school teachers returned \non-grounds to begin instruction through Zoom from classrooms.  On March 3, 2021, teachers \nbegan delivering classes in person on the units.  On March 15, 2021, a hybrid schedule for youth \nattending programming within the school building began.  Each unit has been assigned to be in the \nschool area either in the morning or the afternoon.  Youth continue to participate in the four (4) \ncore academic areas, physical education and library services. Youth participated in Physical \nEducation, Welding, Construction, Greenhouse, Library and special education services at the \nschool building and continue to do so.   \n \nDefendants continue to offer in person as well as Zoom special education resource sessions for all \nyouth identified in their IEP’s as needing those services. In terms of special education services, \ndirect resource classes do not take place during a medical isolation, however all resource sessions \nthat were missed are made up in person as soon as the youth is able to meet with staff. Except for \nmedical isolation, all resource sessions occur in person with SPED teachers either in the school \nbuilding when possible or on the living unit.  All of the student’s services are provided as identified \nin youth’s individual education plans. The school psychologist and special education teachers meet \nweekly to discuss the youth’s schedules to ensure all services are being provided.  \n \nEvery school in the state of Wisconsin, including LHS/CLS have to go through the procedural \nself-compliance assessment (PSCA) every 5 years. Defendants are coming into their 5-year cycle. \nThe assessment includes a thorough audit of IEP’s and evaluations. This audit is performed in \ncollaboration with an outside entity. The Monitor will update the Court when the evaluations are \ncompleted.  \nTwo additional educational assistants have been hired to support students’ learning through \ntutoring, facilitating a continuation of library resources, and providing intake orientations. The \nnew assistants finished their training and began working to enhance one to one student support \nservices. LHS/CLS continues to offer HSED (High School Equivalency Degree) as allowed by the \nDepartment of Public Instruction in the State of Wisconsin to youth who qualify by reading level, \nage and documented credit deficiencies. This program, in addition to the high school diploma \nprogram, has been offered since the facilities inception. Dual credit courses (post-secondary and \nhigh school courses) are also offered to youth who are interested and qualify.  \n \nFor youth on quarantine (due to a potential or suspected COVID-19 exposure), the unit essentially \noperates like a normal unit with only a movement restriction to avoid any further spread of \nCOVID-19 and therefore, the SPED teacher provides services on the unit. \n \nWhen a youth is in medical isolation, they have either tested positive or are displaying active \nsymptoms and are thus placed on medical isolation pending the result of a COVID-19 test. The \nyouth is only allowed out of his/her room when no other youth are around and therefore, SPED \nservices are either delivered remotely or made up after the youth is off of medical isolation. \nYouth, teachers, and staff were present in the school area during this site visit.  There was a very \npositive energy in the school and students and teachers alike seemed very happy to be there. There \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 4 of 34\n \nwere youth on work detail, in classrooms, in the woodworking room, welding class, and in the \ngym.  The Monitor saw the projects that the youth were working on in sewing, woodwork, welding, \ngardening, and music. These projects were very impressive.  The staff were very engaged with the \nyouth and extremely dedicated to their crafts and teaching the youth. The leadership is working on \nmodifying the Foster Grandparents program so that youth can engage with the volunteers, which \nthe youth love.  \nThe Monitor had significant concerns about the provision of education at the facilities during the \nlast site visit, including but not limited to: remote learning, the quality of education, and the lack \nof adequate hours of schooling.  The remote learning format was having a negative impact on \noverall youth behaviors due to the lack of meaningful education and treatment programs.  For this \nreporting  period,  youth  were  remote  learning  in  January  and  part  of  February.    Thus,  the \neducational issues described in the last report continued until in person learning began in February \n(teachers on units)/March (hybrid). With that said, the Monitor is very pleased to see that during \nthis site visit, youth were actively engaged in education both on and off the unit.  The youth are \nvery happy to be back in the school area and off the unit for part of their educational hours as well \nas having teachers accessible on the units. There was a much more positive energy during this site \nvisit. \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that the frequency of music, art, and recreation needs to \nincrease.   It is evident that increased teacher access, such as moving to live e-learning on and off \nthe units and in the school area, have had a positive impact on all youth. \nAs previously mentioned, the entire educational program at LHS/CLS still needs to be evaluated \nand improved. The Monitor encouraged the Defendants to engage the educational consultant further \nand work to address the concerns raised – including the need for deeper and more meaningful teacher \ninteraction with youth, enhancing/expanding the daily education hours. The Defendants are working \non engaging a consultant and continue to work on the educational programming.  The Monitor was \npleased to see significant improvements in the area of education. Although there is more to go, the \nDefendants are moving in the right direction.  \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit.  All the entrances \ninto the units, the bathrooms, and day rooms were very clean and orderly in general. There was a \nunit cleaning contest which most youth were very excited.  The vast majority of youth rooms were \nvery clean and orderly.  Youth rooms were the cleanest the Monitor has seen over the last few \nyears. Staff and youth definitely took pride in their work/living spaces.  \nThere are adequate staffing levels on the living units. The Monitor regularly saw staff engage with \nyouth.   Staff were sitting with youth eating meals, playing games, helping with school work, and \ndoing arts and crafts.  Staff were positioned near youth during this site visit. Youth attitudes overall \nwere much better during this site visit. Youth in general seemed less agitated and bored.  All the \nyouth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and were less interested in interacting with \nthe monitoring team this visit.   The Monitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel had an opportunity to \ntalk to most of the youth present in the day rooms.   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 5 of 34\n \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed on the Wells cottage. King is being utilized as the female \nquarantine unit; one (1) youth was on quarantine. The sensory rooms were calming.  The Wells unit \nwas beautifully decorated and very clean.  The girls did a great job (as always) cleaning and \ndecorating the unit with artwork and flowers.    No one was confined to their room.  The youth on \nWells and King were very happy and smiling.  The rooms on the unit were clean and orderly. The \nstaff present knew the youth very well and were very talkative with the Monitor.  \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, generally, the cottages themselves were very clean. The units \nwere much calmer than the last site visit. The Monitor did not observe any graffiti anywhere in \nLHS/CLS.  It is clear that the Defendants are monitoring this closely and continue to do an \nexceptional job resolving this issue.  \nIn Black Elk, the entry way, day room, and bathroom were very clean and unit bright.  The boys \nbroke out several windows prior to the site visit.  The youth painted murals to cover the windows \nwhile waiting for repairs.  Eight (8) youth were engaged in school work, one (1) youth was sleeping \nin his room, and (1) was doing his hair.  There were three (3) staff, one (1) teacher, and one (1) \nunit manager present. Youth rooms on this unit significantly cleaner than the last site visit and one \nof the cleanest units overall.    \nThe Curtis Unit was the cleanest unit.  The youth seemed happy and were talkative. One (1) youth is \nvery excited about going home soon. One (1) youth was in his room voluntarily.  Youth were excited \nabout the unit decorating contest (and in fact won).   Six (6) youth present on unit with two (2) staff \npresent.  \n \nThe Dubois unit was clean however, most youth rooms were not clean. The youth were in the “free \ntime” period of programming. The unit was calm. There were eight (8) youth on the unit with three \n(3) staff present. Two (2) youth were in their rooms.  Some youth were cleaning, and some youth \nwere talking with each other.  Youth very talkative with the Monitoring team, but staff were not. \nYouth seemed happier during this site visit. Youth indicated that they felt safe, their stay is better \nthan they thought it would be, would like more activities, and liked the food.   \n \nThe Roosevelt unit itself was cleaner and did not smell like during the last site visit.  Youth rooms \nwere the messiest of all the units. There was a total of six (6) youth and four (4) staff on unit. The \nunit was much more controlled than last visit.  Some youth were in group with PSU, playing games \n(cribbage with staff), and sitting and talking. Staff seemed less stressed than site visit. No youth \nwere confined or in their rooms.  \n \nThe Krueger unit is the new admissions/medical isolation unit for the boys. The unit overall were \npretty clean, and the rooms were a mix. There were nine (9) youth and three (3) staff present on the \nunit.  Two youth were in their rooms. Six (6) youth were playing Spades. Some youth were outside \nwith staff playing basketball and some youth were working on an educational packet.  Staff were \npositioned near youth which is an improvement (last site visit they were in the staff office). Youth \nhad pretty good attitudes, but staff seemed stressed and unhappy.  \n \nThe Hughes unit was clean, and the rooms were generally clean.  Youth were doing education on \nthe unit. There was a high staff presence on the unit due to recent incidents.  Specifically, there were \nsix (6) staff and teachers on the unit. One youth threw his computer across the living unit because \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 6 of 34\n \nhe was mad at some news that can came to his attention.  Staff did a good job de-escalating the \nyouth. Staff seemed exhausted and stressed.  \n \nIn general, there is overall improvement with youth and staff attitudes. Although youth were more \nengaged in activities than last visit, there is still a need for more meaningful activities, weekend \nprograms and enhanced educational hours which will help reduce the risk of youth engaging in \nanti-social behaviors when they have little else to do (like climbing on roofs, excessive horseplay, \ndestroying property, and running around unauthorized areas).  During previous site visits, the \nMonitor recommended creating and implementing a daily schedule to help with youth boredom and \ncreate  opportunity  for  structured,  meaningful  programming.    The  Monitor  worked  with  the \nDefendants on developing a weekly schedule with accountability/quality control measures.  The \nDefendants have not fully implemented the daily schedule.  There needs to be a focus on creating a \ndaily schedule that provides for meaningful activities and accountability in order to minimize the \nincidents of youth acting out. \n \nStaff are still frustrated with what is perceived to be a lack of ways to hold youth accountable as well \nas  a  lack  of  incentives  that  will  foster  improved  behaviors.  Defendants  are  developing  and \nimplementing a new behavior management system/implementing DBT and have modified canteen \nprivileges to encourage youth to behave on a daily basis. Improving the behavior management \nsystem, improving the rewards and incentives, and developing engaging programming will have a \npositive impact on the overall behavior and atmosphere issues that are driving the main issues that \nare frustrating both staff and youth.  \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately forty-eight (48) youth were interviewed prior to and during the site visit (formally \nand informally) by the Monitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Youth complained to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel about use of physical force, staff being too quick to go hands on before attempting to verbally \nde-escalate, discontent with quality of e-learning, and perceived racial biases of staff.   \n \nYouth complained to both the Monitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel about long stretches of \ndowntime and continued issues with telephones and Zoom calls. The Monitor did confirm that there \nwas a period of time where the phone issue was due to the connectivity issues not staff.  The phone \nissue has since been resolved. There were more requests to talk to Plaintiffs’ counsel while the \nMonitor was onsite talking with youth than last visit.  \n \nYouth stated in general that they feel very safe however, they felt that staff did not feel safe and that \nstaff seem intimidated by the youth. Youth had more positive attitudes and significantly less \ncomplaints during this visit than last while engaged with the Monitoring team.  \n \nThe Monitoring team saw less idle time both during site visit and while reviewing random sampling \nof video of living units.  This is an improvement from the last site visit.  Youth enjoy going outside, \nthe music lab, various contests, art, woodwork, the greenhouse, basketball games, playing games \nwith staff, and anytime they can do something off of the unit.  When asked about release dates, most \nyouth knew the timeframe of their release which is important for behavior management and also \nshows that staff are more engaged with youth. The Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage \nyouth in meaningful programming and activities.  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 7 of 34\n \n \nThe Monitor recommended in the last report that the Defendants should conduct Zoom calls in the \nvisitation area to “normalize” visitation, have youth move off of units, and have a change of \nenvironment. The Defendants have since followed this recommendation. On February 15, 2021 \nCLS/LHS implemented Zoom visiting for youth on a weekly basis. Each living unit is designated \nwith a specific day of the week for visits to occur. Visits occur 5:30 P.M.-7:30 P.M. and each youth \non a living unit is allotted one twenty (20) minute time slot. A sign-up list is posted on each living \nunit every Friday, at which time the youth may sign up for a visiting time slot the following week. \nThe Zoom visit must be completed with an approved visitor. Once youth are signed up for their \ntime slot, a video visit/Zoom link is sent to the approved visitors e-mail with the invitation date \nand time. Youth are enjoying this change.  \n \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that the Defendants should take advantage of the reduced \npopulation, the available staff in planning and preparing and developing programs for youth. The \nMonitor  is  hopeful  that  with  the  new  Program  Director,  gender  and  culturally  competent \nprogramming can be brought/introduced (even if virtually), to LHS/CLS as an interim measure. \nHowever, to the maximum extent possible, Defendants should work to move forward with \nrequirements to close LHS and move youth closer to locations where such programs and services \nare available. Providing culturally competent programming virtually should only be a stopgap, not \na long-term solution. \nStaffing  \n \nDuring this reporting period, there have been some key staffing changes.  Key Positions hired \nduring this reporting period are as follows: Psychology Supervisor, several Supervising Youth \nCounselors,  and  Nurse  Clinicians.    Youth  Counselor  Academies  Classes  are  underway  or \nscheduled. \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has increased from the last reporting period (see below).  \nThere are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS.  Approximately 153 of these positions are \n“direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  The teacher \nvacancy rate remains high (7 vacancies- same as that last two reporting periods). The Monitor \nencourages continuing to recruit teachers despite the reduced population and challenges with \nCovid-19.  Recruiting is still a challenge due to the location of the facility, overall teacher \nshortages, relatively low compensation, location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS \nwill close, and the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue.   \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \n May 13, 2020  September 19, 2020  December 9, 2020  March 1, 2021 \n     \nYouth   8.6% (10 out of 115)  18.2% (21 out of 115  23% (27 out of 115)  25% (29 out of 115) \n \nCounselor \n \nYouth  13% (5 out of 37.5)  12% (4.5 out of 37.5)  13% (5 out of 37.5)  23% (8.5 out of 37.5) \nCounselor \nAdv. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 8 of 34\n \nTeacher  32% (8 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25) \nSocial Worker  21% (3 out of 14)  21% (3 out of 14)  29% (4 out of 14)  21% (3 out of 14) \n \nThe Youth Counselor/Couth Counselor Advanced vacancies have increased during this reporting \nperiod.  The Defendants are working on modifying job descriptions, job postings, and interviewing \ntechniques in order to attract and retain the best direct care staff.  It is critical that applicants have \na clear understanding of their role at LHS/CLS.  \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over thirty-three (33) staff. Staff morale overall seemed better \nduring this site visit.  With the exception of the Krueger unit, staff were more engaged with youth, \nbody language was more open, and staff engaged with the Monitoring team and leadership more.  \nStaff continued to complain that there were less “tools” available to manage behavior, youth were \nacting out a lot, and that they are working a significant amount of overtime. Staff like the twelve \n(12) hour shifts but would like to work less overtime.  Staff also want leadership to be more present \non the units and communicate more with staff day to day. The Monitor worked with Defendants \non potential scheduling changes to assist in the number of mandated shifts.   Staff attitudes \ndepended on which unit they worked- some were very positive, and some were angry, frustrated, \nand exhausted.  During this reporting period there was one significant staff assault, that had a \nprofound impact on staff. There were also several instances of youth running around the unit and \ngrounds and destroying property and breaking windows which, as noted in multiple past reports, \nis generally caused by insufficient activities for youth.  Staff are happy that teachers and other staff \nare in person on-site but are still adjusting to moving youth for education in the school area.   \nIn  response  to  staff’s  request  for  more  communication,  there  are  regularly  scheduled \nSuperintendent Town Halls that are open to all staff.  Zoom sessions continue to occur the first \nand third Tuesdays of the month.  Staff joining from a work location are directed to do so in a \nconfidential setting, so youth do not overhear the meeting. Minutes are taken and disseminated to \nall staff. Staff are encouraged to send any questions/agenda items ahead of time and discussion-\nbased questions are also welcomed. Minutes are taken and disseminated to all staff. Staff are \nencouraged to send any questions/agenda items ahead of time in order for a more thorough \nanswer/response to be given at the meeting.  \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information.   \n \nYouth in Custody Practice Model Update/ Dialectical Behavior Therapy \n \nAs part of the agency and facility’s desire to improve conditions for both staff and youth, they are \ncontinuing to engage in the Youth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”), which was explained \nin the previous Monitor reports.  DJC recently concluded the period of technical assistance \nprovided in collaboration with the YICPM consultants. The final virtual site visit scheduled was \nheld January 13 and 14, 2021. The Core Leadership team and YICPM consultants finished \ndeveloping the framework and action plans aimed at supporting DJC sustain the cultural changes \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 9 of 34\n \nthat will come with implementing DBT as a behavioral motivation-based system of care. A panel \ndiscussion with four (4) line staff and another four (4) administrators from Utah and Massachusetts \nalso provided helpful context to reinforce efforts and provided a glimpse into how other states have \nimplemented similar systems of care and implemented large scale reform efforts.  \n \nDJC will begin the next phase of participation with YICPM by working with the principal \ninvestigator from Georgetown University. On March 3, 2021, the Assistant Administrator and \nProgram and Policy Chief conducted a video call with Dr. Woodland. The focus of the meeting \nwas to discuss the YICPM Data Component. Dr. Woodland and her team have developed the \nframework and spreadsheets to help facilities understand the different types of data they are \nlooking to collect and analyze. Next steps include doing a data inventory, reviewing outcome \nmeasures, and review additional data points that are not being currently collected.   \n \nA DBT Informed System of Care has been identified as vital to the change process. Planning \ncontinues to integrate a comprehensive revamp of a behavioral management approach coupled \nwith DBT.  Many of the enhancements that have been under development follow similar directions \ntaken by the states of Utah, Washington and Massachusetts. Components of the system of care that \nhave moved from the planning stages to completion include DBT training and skill practice for all \nstaff, a program points system and accessible tracking, youth growth team support, the framework \nfor youth to progress through the new system’s five stages. Components that continue to be worked \non include: the youth motivational incentive-based token economy, tracking of pro- social youth \nbehaviors, a pro-social point matrix, a menu of responses for noncompliant behaviors, a system \nfor tracking outcome measures, and the application of quality assurance reviews.  \nPart of the goal in introducing the DBT treatment programming-based system of care is in \nfurtherance of the transition the facility has already embraced during previous reporting periods. \nDuring the recent three-month period all facility staff, from the maintenance department through \nadministration have been trained in the therapeutic approach envisioned by the new system of care. \nTraining strategic groupings of staff continuously started in early 2021 with six (6) half-day \ntrainings over a three-week period that helped to provide clarity for staff and efficiently move the \nDBT treatment programming-based system of care forward. Even after staff have completed their \ninitial training, there will be on-going reinforcement, coaching, mentoring, and training to aid staff \nin becoming comfortable with DBT and assisting them to consistently use DBT skills when \ninteracting with youth. This approach will help to ensure that as the system takes root within the \nfacility culture, staff at all levels of the facility develop trusting relationships with youth, engage \nthem in delivering treatment, and become proficient using the behavioral motivation and shaping \nsystem.  The system will seek  to reinforce prosocial behaviors and  address non-compliant \nbehaviors with DBT and other related skills.  \nOn January 17, 2021 communication  from leadership was disseminated to designated staff \noutlining the responsibilities regarding the tracking and documentation of program points, program \nprogression, and department heads subsequently shared with their staff their responsibilities within \nthe system of tracking. The multi-disciplinary approach to information sharing throughout the \nprogram implementation has been intentional to elicit staff input and buy-in by displaying a more \ncooperative approach towards the facility-wide cultural shift the system of care, rather than just a \n“top down” mandate.  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 10 of 34\n \nYouth  that  are  already  at  CLS/LHS  will  maintain  their  existing  case  file/growth \nplan. Modifications will be made to the existing plan as the youth go through the various aspects \nand stages of the program. The documentation and notification of Primary Growth Team Members \nfor each unit/youth, and the initial stage placement was completed prior to February 15, 2021.  \nOn February 15, 2021 the new Program Points and Stage Progression system was implemented, \nand youth began weekly meetings with their multidisciplinary Growth Teams. The first week of \nGrowth Team meetings allowed an opportunity for the teams to share information with youth about \nthe new System of Care, Program Points and Stage Progression as well as highlight how the \nGrowth Teams will work with the youth to identify his/her strengths and reduce barriers by \nbuilding skills and helping the youth set and progress towards the youth’s goals.  \nThe comprehensive effort to begin implementing the system of care over the past three months \ninvolved training well-over one hundred staff members to learn both the new program points \nsystem and then complete the DBT approach to treatment trainings which concluded at the end of \nJanuary. Clinicians, administration, and direct care staff then moved on to organizing youth DBT \ngroups and staff consultation groups in February, and all of this was integrated within the system \nof care involving each and every area within the facility. With the first phase of  training \naccomplished, the facility is ready to implement the system of care and begin tracking outcome \nmeasures when facility-wide DBT groups began the week of March 22, 2021.  \nMental Health (PSU) Update \nIn the last report, the Monitor informed the Court that a mental health consultant was contracted \nto assess the overall mental health program at LHS/CLS.  It was critical that the programming, \nstaffing, and services that exist at LHS/CLS were evaluated and recommendations on improving \ntreatment and services for youth at LHS/CLS. The initial site visit took place at the end of February \n2021. Overall, the report made positive findings determining that the program is comprehensive \nfrom intake through discharge, uses evidence-based intervention services in identifying and \naddressing the needs of the youth with severe mental health, severe emotional disturbances, and \nadjustment related concerns.  \n \nClinicians incorporate a comprehensive treatment plan and use a mental health classification \nsystem  allowing  for  appropriate  mental-health  treatment.  Psychological  services  have  been \nintegrated with the medical, safety, and educational staff. Integrating PSU staff into the day to day \noperations has had a tremendous impact on youth and staff. The consultant also found that PSU \nstaff are able to effectively respond to the needs of all youth on the campus. \n \nEffective Jan 17, 2021, an administrative plan was approved to return PSU Clinicians on site for \none additional day each week. The schedule design allows for two PSU Clinicians on site until 8 \nP.M. each evening.  PSU Clinicians work remotely and through on-call to attempt to meet the \nchallenges of covering evening and weekend hours.  \n \nWeekday hours from 8 A.M.-8 P.M. have been covered by on site PSU Clinicians. With on- site \npresence increasing in January 2021, a second PSU clinician will allow for at least one clinician \nto facilitate groups and engage in staff-led activities. Having two PSU Clinicians available until \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 11 of 34\n \n8:00 P.M. also allows for one of these Clinicians to remain dedicated to emergency response and \nconsultation. In addition to having two clinicians working until 8:00 P.M., in January, PSU staff \nhas already implemented 3 new treatment groups occurring during weeknights, from 5:30-7:00. \nThe Monitor was pleased to see mental health staff actively engaged with youth during the site \nvisit and present in most use of force incidents that the Monitoring team reviewed.  \nLHS/CLS  clinical  staff  have  also  become  actively  engaged  with  youth  programming.  The \noversight of the music program has been transferred to PSU and coined as MAI (Music Art \ninitiative)  to  provide  increased  opportunities  for  therapeutic  expression.  Creative  outlet  is \nmeaningful for youth who are in prime stages of identity development. PSU has implemented three \nother evening treatment groups- two for young men focusing on communication and conflict \nresolution and one for young women focusing on teambuilding. The PSU Supervisor and several \nPSU clinicians continue to collaborate with the Music Art Initiative (MAI) Leader, administration, \nsafety, and education to continue integrating mental- health research and practice in developing \nyouth centric arts programming and projects.  \nThe Defendants should continue to involve PSU staff in making improvements at the facility (such \nas improvements to incentives, consequences, and working with the OJOR system). The Monitor \ncontinues to suggest modifying the mental health (PSU) and recreational staff work schedules to \ninclude more evening and weekend hours, especially given the lack of sufficient other structured \nactivities during those times. The Monitor continues to recommend that scheduling of PSU be \nreconsidered (rotate staff if need be, alternating weekends, etc.) or if this is not possible, then hire \nadditional PSU staff to work nights and weekends to engage with all youth.  Weekends are when \nthere is the idlest time and need for additional meaningful programming.  Adding weekend \nprogramming will also have a positive impact on reducing incidents of violence and other \nbehavioral incidents related to boredom and lack of activities. Hopefully, all of these positive \nchanges (to come) will result in an improved atmosphere for youth and staff.  \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \n \nDefendants launched its Quality Assurance Review (QAR) process in August 2019.  A report was \nable to be generated during this period in which over 98.8% of 30-minute safety/security checks \nwere recorded during this reporting period.  The Monitor (as well as the QA team) reviewed \nrandom video samplings to ensure staff were observed looking into each room while scanning the \ndoor tags.  There were 100% confirmed quality scores across the random sampling period.  \nAdditionally, in the few occasions where the safety/security checks were not completed according \nto policy, staff were held accountable in order to correct behavior.  Leadership and staff should be \ncommended for their efforts in this area. \nTo aid in the completion of quality assurance tasks, an extractable format of J-Tracker search data \nwas developed. The report format will facilitate review of search criteria as outlined in the \nfunctional policy and procedure drafts for searches of youth and facility. Data from the debrief \nreports was also made into an exportable format which will enable point in time review of the \nrequirements for mechanical restraints and AC placements. This will support Quality Assurance \nstaff’s ability to facilitate assurance measures with supervisory or professional staff before or after \nthe Safety Director, Deputy Superintendent, or Superintendent formally review the documented \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 12 of 34\n \nincident debrief form. Weekly multidisciplinary reviews of AC placements by Security and PSU \nsupervisors occurring based on the new data export that began on January 15, 2021.  \nWith the re-start of classes taking place in the school through a hybrid model as of March 15, 2021, \nrandom pat/personal searches prior to school movements will become a standard of practice. \nSafety administrative staff complete a weekly review of searches to identify if/when a strip search \noccurs. Quality Assurance staff also utilizes extractable search data from J-Tracker to confirm on \na monthly basis that search data is thoroughly completed (with reason for search, types of search, \ncontraband/items found) and that the gender of staff matches that of the youth for all pat/personal \nsearches as well.  \nThe Quality Assurance and Training staff developed a DJC Searches of Youth Training module \non Cornerstone eLearning to include policy highlights, video demonstration of proper search \ntechnique, and assessment questions. This training was assigned to all safety staff in February \n2021. Starting March 1, 2021 SYCs have been coordinating at shift change annual in-person \ncompetency checks. DJC has authored a Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) post-training assessment \nfor TIC trainings and YC academies going forward in order to bolster staff knowledge of TIC \nprinciples and augment the department’s TIC refresher training required of all department staff in \n2021.  \nFinally, the STOPS acronym (Systematic, Thorough, Objective, Preventative, and Safe) will be \nutilized to underscore best practices for searches of youth and facility-wide areas during future \ntraining opportunities that will include support from the Field Training Officers (FTO) Program.  \nFacility Improvement Plan (“FIP”) Progress \nDuring this reporting period, DJC expanded its Facility Improvement Plan (FIP) Team to utilize a \nmore multi-disciplinary approach in an effort to get input from all areas of the facility. An effort \nhas been made to select non-management staff to be the representatives for each of the areas so \nthat there is more ownership with the FIPs by staff who work with youth day to day.  The FIP \nCommittee has expanded to include the State Coordinator, Site Coordinator, PbS Data Entry Team, \nSuperintendent, Deputy Superintendent, Program Director, Safety Director or Administrative \nCaptain, QA Staff, SYCs, Health Services Unit staff, PSU staff, Education staff, Social Services \nstaff, 4- YCA/YC, CARE Team staff, Recreation staff and Field Representatives. The first monthly \nmeeting with the new group was on January 20, 2021. The committee reviewed data from the \nOctober data collection and reviewed the PbS FIPs. It was determined in consultation with the PbS \ncoach to maintain the current CLS FIP with plans to re-evaluate after the April data collection \ncycle is completed and reviewed. The LHS FIP was determined to be closed and a new FIP was \nopened.  \nThe second meeting was on February 17, 2021. During the meeting, there was an overview of the \nPbS website, walked through the FIP’s, and explained the process for adding comments/notes to \nthe FIP’s. The group discussed various in the FIP and addressed making changes to language in J-\nTracker and within divisional policies and procedures in order to match PbS language and \ndefinitions building consistency with the stated goals of DJC where the coincided with PbS. The \ngroup was informed of the Kids Got Talent and Scholarship as well as the upcoming PbS awards \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 13 of 34\n \nopportunities. Information was provided about our submissions last year and some progress was \nmade toward more submissions for this year.  \nThe next data collection period for PbS begins again April 1, 2021 and thus, PbS data will not be \nincluded in this Monitoring report.  \nPolicies and Procedures/Administrative Code \n \nThere were no new policies/procedures finalized in this reporting period.  Draft policies have been \ncreated for: Searches of Youth, Searches of Facility, Performance-based Standards, Control of \nWater Supply to Units.  \n \nDraft procedures for Room Confinement (Administrative Confinement) have been developed. On \nDecember 3, 2021 a formal training memo outlining the trainings approved by the Administrator \nwas disseminated by the facility Superintendent specifying the training priorities for facility staff \nin 2021. These priorities have been identified: \n(1) Required Training: POSC for Uniform staff, POSC for non-uniform staff, Verbal Judo \nDrills, CPR, Suicide Prevention, DBT, Diversity, and Mandt.  \n(2) Optional Training: Wellness, Fire Safety, Living Unit Basics  \nAdministrative Code  \nFirst draft created of DOC Chapter 373. Final draft of DOC 376 was submitted for approval.  \n \nOverall, there has been significant improvement in many key areas and in the overall atmosphere \nof LHS/CLS. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for seven days.  If Defendants \nincorporate the Court Order into final policy and procedure –- they will reach substantial \ncompliance.   \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 14 of 34\n \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence either in data \nor youth interviews that indicate youth are being confined for three days.  If Defendants \nincorporate the Court Order into final policy and procedure –and if this improvement is \nsustained - they will reach substantial compliance.   \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  During  the  last  site  visit, \ndocumentation and video showed that there were instances of confinement that did not meet \nthe criteria for Administrative Confinement – there was no risk of imminent physical harm \n- and appeared to impermissibly constitute punitive confinements. There is significantly less \nevidence of this during this reporting period. The Monitor previously recommended creating \na policy which clearly outlines the criteria for administrative confinement so that staff cannot \npunitively confine youth. The Monitor reiterates this recommendation.  By establishing clear \nand objective criteria, leadership can ensure that youth are not punitively confined.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer poses a risk of imminent physical harm, he \nor  she  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The use of AC was significantly \nlower  for  LHS  youth  this  reporting  period  (December-February).  There  was  a  36% \nreduction for LHS.  CLS is similar to the last reporting period due to December’s numbers.  \nIt is important to note that CLS had no AC in January and February 2021.  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 15 of 34\n \n \nSeptember 2020 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC \nLHS: 66 uses of AC. Average of 174 minutes. 1 youth over four hours.  \n16 youth at exactly four hours. \n \nOctober 2020 \nCLS: 5 uses of AC. Average of 119 minutes. 1 youth over four hours. 1 \nYouth at exactly four hours. \nLHS: 66 uses of AC: Average of 179 minutes. 7 youth over four hours. 2 \nyouth at exactly 4 hours.  \n \nNovember 2020 \nCLS: 7 uses of AC. Average of 104 minutes. No youth over 4 hours \nLHS: 82 uses of AC. Average of 143 minutes. 2 youth over 4 hours. 5 \nyouth at four hours. \n \nDecember 2020 \nCLS: 10 uses of AC \nLHS: 88 uses of AC. Average of 117 minutes. 6 youth over four hours.   \n \nJanuary 2021 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC \nLHS: 40 uses of AC: Average of 117 minutes. No youth over four hours \n \nFebruary 2021 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC \nLHS: 9 uses of AC. Average of 74 minutes. No youth over four hours \nPSU clinicians document an overview of the intensive mental health services in J- Tracker \nand on EMR. The overarching goal of providing intensive mental health services is to safely \nreintegrate the youth back into the general population immediately after placing the youth \non AC and to maintain youth success while off AC. The IMHS developed for a youth \nreintegrating from AC, are repeatedly re-evaluated and adjusted as needed.  \nPSU clinicians provide intensive mental-health services to each youth on AC through a \ndetailed process outlined in the Guidance document. Currently, all PSU clinicians have been \ntrained in DBT. All YC Academies have included overviews of DBT and facility-wide \ntraining of Skills Groups/Coaching is scheduled to start in the early part of 2021 for DBT \nSystem of Care.  \nEach youth on AC already has a youth plan (previously called Behavioral Management Plan \nBMP) developed collaboratively between PSU and the youth. These plans are preventative \nas they outline youth triggers, self-soothing strategies, and highlight treatment issues. These \nplans also provide input into the development of effective mental-health services to be \nprovided to the youth while in AC. This youth plan is also consulted when developing a \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 16 of 34\n \nspecific treatment plan for AC-specific intensive mental health services. It, along with the \nGuidance document, guides the collaborative effort amongst various staff to provide youth \nwith immediate and comprehensive mental-health services while on AC.  \nAll involved staff use the AC flow chart (within the Guidance document) to guide decision \nmaking and action while a youth is on AC. While the SYC notifies PSU soon after the youth \nis  placed  in  AC,  the  SYC  and  YC  may  reference  the  youth  plan  to  incorporate  the \nrecommendations of PSU to de-escalate agitation. As soon as possible, SYC contacts PSU. \nWhen PSU is contacted, the PSU clinician reviews the mental health needs of the youth. This \naids in the first determination of whether AC is contraindicated. PSU provides immediate \nconsultation and treatment recommendations to the SYC. By the two-hour mark, the PSU \nclinician begins a risk assessment if the youth is unresponsive to the initial treatment and \nhave not reintegrated back into general population. PSU clinicians collaborate with the \nSafety staff and continue to evaluate youth response to services.  \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit.  Majority of checks (over 98.8%) were completed within 30 \nminutes. QA has been developed and completed with use of video to confirm that checks \nwere completed in compliance with policy and this Court Order.   \n \nThe mental health expert evaluated the mental health program and had very positive \nfindings overall. Policy and procedure and a quality assurance review process needs to be \nimplemented, and documentation needs to be streamlined.   \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were six (6) youth confined \nfor over four (4) hours during this reporting period (in December) (see response in previous \nquestion). All of the confinements were recommended by PSU.  Intensive treatment provided \nto the youth included: completing thinking reports, discussing alternative, making safety \nplans,  engaging  the  youth  in  mediation,  reviewing  motivations,  and  reviewing  coping \nstrategies.  \nDefendants are accurately capturing confinement time, number total placements, average \nconfinement time per month, and number of days without AC placements. Defendants need \nto continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring they are following this Court Order, \ndraft policy and procedure with AC placement criteria, and continue to QA this data. \n \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 17 of 34\n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were no AC placements that \nwere extended. There were no transfers as a result of extended placements in administrative \nconfinement. Defendants need to improve their quality of data and documentation with \nrespect  to  the  “commenced  plan”  and  incorporate  the  Court  Order  into  policy  and \nprocedure.   \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours. Once incorporated the Court Order into policy and \nprocedure, Defendants will be in substantial compliance.   \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24  was  updated.    The  plans  developed  are  very  detailed  and  comprehensive. \nAdditional discussion and clarification should be sought surrounding observation status.  \nThe Monitor will ensure this occurs with the parties.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 18 of 34\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. The Monitor recommended that Defendants replace the \nexisting room furniture with furniture that is specifically designed and engineered for \nsecure environments.  The new replacement furniture is consistent with what the Monitor \nwould expect to see in a secure facility and should certainly reduce the opportunity for \nsuicidal incidents within the youth rooms. All youth are housed on renovated units.   \nThe Monitor did not observe rooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of \nthe room. Staff can clearly see into youth rooms now that the windows do not have etching \nand are not covered by paper/pictures.  Room searches  have occurred during this \nreporting period.  Youth rooms were very clean and organized. \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards,  and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms as this is supported by. Defendants should \nbe commended for the vast improvement on these safety/welfare checks and for investing \nin  the  technology  needed.    Although  the  Monitor,  and  available  literature,  believes \nsafety/security checks should be fifteen (15) minutes instead of thirty (30) minute checks, \ntechnically, the Defendants could reach substantial compliance if this is maintained.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation, and incorporate the Court Order into \npolicy and procedure, they will be close to reaching substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 19 of 34\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented.  Clinicians are on-site for a minimum of 6 hours each Saturday and \nSunday and the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth.  Clinicians \nworking  on  the  weekend  have  a  priority  of  service  provision  which  include \nassessing/meeting with youth on Administrative Confinement, meeting with youth on \nobservation status, attending to any crises, and conducting rounds and check-ins with \nyouth.  There are typically quite a few staff referrals, and these youth are seen as well.  The \nonly time spent in non-direct contact with youth on the weekend, is for documenting on the \nAC  and  observation  placements  (other  clinical  documentation  is  completed  on \nMonday).  The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the hours in which they are \nphysically present on weekends and evening hours in order to engage youth in a meaningful \nway during this time.   \n \nA  quality  assurance  program  needs  to  be  developed.  The  Monitor  suggests  that  the \nDefendants consider implementing the mental health expert’s recommendations to further \ndevelop the mental health program/integration at LHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation/data shows that \nevaluations are completed and within 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. \nThere were no instances of contraindication documented during this review period. PSU \nclinicians developed a protocol for on-call situations. Each primary PSU clinician reviews \nthe record, assesses the risk and designates whether the risk is low, medium, or high. The \nrisk factors considered are supported by the literature on isolation and confinement. This \ndetermination is recorded in the mental-health caseload report which is accessible to all of \nPSU clinicians. The on-call PSU clinician uses this risk level determination and considers the \ninput from the SYC placing the youth in confinement to make a determination whether the \nplacement (each time) will be deemed contraindicated.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 20 of 34\n \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants are over 98% compliant \nwith safety and security checks.  QA program has been developed. There are very few \ninstances of non-compliance.  Quality assurance measures are in place and when necessary, \nformal investigations occur.  There were no formal disciplines issued as of the conclusion of \nthe reporting period. PSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if \nneeded by phone.  \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model.  \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and utilized. Once Defendants make \nthese improvements, they will be in substantial compliance. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general.  The on-call PSU clinician \ncommunicates to all the PSU clinicians through email that a youth has been placed on AC. \nThis allows the primary clinician to provide consultation and direction as to how to return \nthe youth to a baseline, self-regulated state. The primary clinician consults with the on-call \nclinician and with the SYC/YC/CUS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the  youth plan \naddresses the issues at hand and how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. A PSU \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 21 of 34\n \nclinician follows up in the absence of the primary clinician and/or the crisis clinician. PSU \ncollaborates with the SYC and direct staff. PSU also meets with the youth while they are on \nAC and through a follow-up session. The social worker and youths’ meeting schedules are \nindividualized. Therefore, as is the case with any arising short-term scheduling conflicts (e.g., \ncourt, medical needs, OJOR, AC etc.) the social worker works with the youth to identify \navailability  if  an  AC  placement  occurs  during  regularly  scheduled  meeting.  The  AC \nplacement also provides an opportunity for the social worker and the youth to review AC \nplacement  as  outlined  in  a  new  J-Tracker  form.  With  shared  awareness  around  AC \nplacement,  Social  Workers  are  positioned  to  incorporate  cognitive-behavioral  or \nmotivational interviewing practices in revisiting goals from the Youth Growth Plan.  \nDocumentation,  quality  assurance,  and  policy  and  procedure  need  to  be \nimproved/completed. A review of the social worker roles and responsibilities need to be \nassessed. \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. During the pandemic, Defendants \nmoved to smaller-group based treatment to youth where group participation was provided \non the units. Treatment programming for youth never ceased due to Covid precautions, but \nthe size of the groups was modified to accommodate safe social distancing measures and keep \nyouth who shared a living unit assignment in groups with one another. Beginning in March, \nsome housing units now utilize the school for their group treatment sessions as determined \nby their respective living unit’s weekly schedule.  The Monitor encourages these groups to \noccur off of the living unit as much as possible.  \n  \nOnly youth who are actively in AC status due to posing a serious risk of imminent physical \nharm to others would potentially miss a treatment group. A process is in place for that \nspecific missed treatment group to be made up for the youth on an individual basis, and \nsince January 15, 2021 youth notes in J-Tracker should reflect the completion of the make-\nup session. Additionally, during the March through May reporting period, Defendants are \ndesigning and implementing a QA audit process for youth notes in J-Tracker in order \nensure this process is completed. Missing a treatment group and having a make-up session \ndoes not affect the youth in terms of any setback to their progression towards completing \nthe treatment group. This is the same process for a youth who were to miss a group due to \nany other short-term scheduling conflicts (e.g., court, medical needs, OJOR,  etc.). For \nexample, if a 2-hour placement in AC occurs during regularly scheduled Skills Streaming \ngroup time, treatment staff will re-engage the youth in making progress in their treatment \ncourse avoiding any delays in progression through the course of their assigned treatment. \nDefendants to ensure that any missed/rescheduled treatment groups  do  not negatively \nimpact a youth’s progress when possible. \n  \nIn January, DJC integrated treatment notes and social worker notes into J-Tracker, while \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 22 of 34\n \nyouth growth plans, and behavior management plans are made accessible to all staff on a \nshared  network  drive.  This  has  resulted  in  greater  information  sharing  between \nclassifications and will make accessing documentation for individualized treatment follow \nup more readily accessible for a QA. Moving forward, staff assigned to the QA role will \nconduct  random  spot  check  audits  of  J-Tracker  youth  notes  to  ensure  that  proper \ndocumentation and follow up is occurring as intended.  Defendants need to continue to focus \n(document and QA) on providing rehabilitative programming that was scheduled/in process \nbefore placement in room confinement.  \n \niii.         Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. (See education narrative for more \ndetail). In general (prior to COVID-19) educational services for general population occurred in \nthe classrooms in the school area.  COVID-19 has changed how the educational services are \nbeing provided to youth at LHS/CLS.  On March 24, 2020, the schools began providing \neducation on the units with most education staff working off-site. On February 22, 2021, the \nschool teachers returned on-grounds at the facility to begin instructing through Zoom from \nclassrooms in the school. On March 3, 2021 Teachers began delivering classes on the units. \nOn March 15, 2021, a hybrid schedule for youth attending some programming within the \nschool building began. Youth and staff will begin the transition back into the school building \nafter the challenging year of COVID-19 posing obstacles that staff and youth continue to \nwork through. Each unit has been assigned to be in the school for either the AM or PM part \nof the day, whichever includes the physical education time.  \nDJC started the process to pursue an education consultant beyond the current work with the \nULN. The purpose of the consultant would be to evaluate the current education program \nand provide a strategic plan for improvement efforts. Also, the Office of Budget and \nPrograms is concurrently working to establish a contracting process to move forward.  \nThe Monitor feels that the facility needs to increase the daily education hours as this will \nhave a positive impact on meaningful programs and reduce youth idleness.  Additionally, \nDefendants need  to  ensure  that  special  education  is  provided  while  on  administrative \nconfinement.  The Monitor’s observations during the site visit revealed that the quality of \nthe education program has improved from the last site visit.  Youth were engaged in the \nclassrooms and on the units (teachers were present on the unit). Youth were paying attention, \nsitting appropriately, and actively participating.  Youth are very interested in art, music, \nwoodworking, the greenhouse, welding, and sewing.  The instructors in these areas are \nexperts in their crafts and truly love teaching the youth their craft.  It would be extremely \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 23 of 34\n \nbeneficial to provide these types of programs to youth in the evening and on weekends. The \nDefendants  should  continue  to  focus  on  bringing  more  programming  into  LHS/CLS, \nespecially programming culturally relevant and specific to the race and genders of the youth \nwho are at the facility. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. In general, youth are out of their \nrooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.  except for youth in isolation due to Covid-19 safety measures \nimplemented  by  Defendants,  any  confinement  recommended  by  PSU,  or  any  self-\nconfinement.  The Defendants discontinued the use of “self-reflection.” The Monitor regularly \nsaw youth conversing with other youth during out time. Each unit had sensory rooms. There \nwere very few instances of youth being in their room during the site visit- those that were in \ntheir rooms, voluntarily did so.  There were less instances of self-confinement during this site \nvisit. \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were four (4) documented \ninstances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on substantial \nthreat of physical harm.  Defendants are able to track when youth eat meals in room. Policy \nand procedure need to incorporate this section of the Court Order. Defendants are close to \nbeing in substantial compliance.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving much more than the 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week. \nDefendants  incorporate  the  Court  Order  into  policy  and  procedure,  they  will  be  in \nsubstantial compliance. \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 24 of 34\n \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement. The \nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. However, the process and forms need to be \nenacted and written into policy. Once this is done and sustained, Defendants will be in \nsubstantial compliance. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis  more  consistently,  including  when  less  restrictive  means  were  attempted. \nDocumentation needs to continue to be completed and consistently applied to all situations. \nDocumentation, data collection and reliability, and quality assurance (with video review) \nneeds to continue to be improved. Also, documentation needs to be created that prove a \nyouth was promptly provided with the report upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  There needs to be continued focus on training, skills development and coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 25 of 34\n \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  eliminated.  \nThere  needs  to  be  continued  focus  on  training,  skills  development  and  coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, but data and documentation show that \nthere were uses of mechanical restraints during this reporting period. However, the use in \nLHS is trending downwards with a decrease by 63% this reporting period.  Defendants need \nto continue focusing on reducing the use of mechanical (as well as physical) restraints.  \nDefendants need to document and establish that there were not less restrictive means \navailable and quality assurance measures in every instance of the use of restraints and follow \nthe final policy and procedure that are in place.   \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Use  of  mechanical  restraints  is \nsignificantly lower this reporting period in LHS and lower in CLS. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \nMarch 2020:     38 uses \nApril 2020:     37 uses  \nMay 2020:    27 uses \nJune 2020:    20 uses \nJuly 2020:                      30 uses \nAugust 2020:    65 uses \nSeptember 2020:  38 uses \nOctober 2020:    43 uses \nNovember 2020:  26 uses \nDecember 2020:   20 uses \nJanuary 2021:    12 uses \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 26 of 34\n \nFebruary 2021:   8 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \nMarch 2020:      7 uses \nApril 2020:      6 uses  \nMay 2020:     0 uses \nJune 2020:     0 uses \nJuly 2020:      0 uses \nAugust 2020:                  0 uses \nSeptember 2020:   4 uses \nOctober 2020:     4 uses \nNovember 2020:   0 uses \nDecember 2020:     6 uses \nJanuary 2021:     0 uses \nFebruary 2021:    0 uses \nDocumentation needs to be improved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm \nexisted, and when and how that decision is reviewed. Defendants should note why the acts in \nquestion required a specific type of use of force, such as explaining why measure utilizing \nless force would have been insufficient in a specific situation. The review process should \nconsider the nuances in different situations.  Defendants do have critical outcome measures \nfor restraints.  Defendants need to continue to work towards reducing the use of mechanical \nrestraints, develop better documentation and quality assurance measures. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    There  were  five  (5)  uses  of \nmechanical restraints other than handcuffs during this reporting period. Four (4) uses were \nankle restraints and one was the “wrap” (full body restraint). The “wrap” is a restraint \ndevice that falls under this section and needs to be monitored for usage compliance. The \nwrap should only be used in situations in which PSU has ordered and/or authorized its use \nin order to prevent active self-harm. PSU did not order or authorize the wrap.  If other \nmechanical restraints are used, the Defendants need to make sure they are ordered by PSU \nto attempt to prevent active self-harm.  The Monitor reviewed the use of force involving the \nwrap and PSU was present and staff attempted to verbally de-escalate.  However, the \nDefendants need to develop policy and procedure, training, and QA measures and ensure \nPSU staff order these types of restraints. Additional discussion and clarification should be \nsought surrounding compliant usage of the wrap.   \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 27 of 34\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Leg restraints were used during this \nreporting period. In each use, the leg restraints were placed as part of a routine use of \nforce/restraint  process  in  which  the  youth  was  non-compliant  and/or  combative.  \nDocumentation has improved relative to when restraints have been used and the rationale \nfor usage. Defendants need quality assurance measures and need to continue to focus on \nreducing the use of restraints.  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.   Defendants need to focus on \nreducing  the  use  of  mechanical  restraints  and  ensuring  use  is  not  for  punishment.  \nDefendants need to make policy revisions and create quality assurance measures. \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. With policy revisions and quality assurance measures, \nDefendants will be close to achieving substantial compliance with this provision.   \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records indicate that the \nlarge majority of staff have received training in physical force, restraints, and trained in \nproper  de-escalation.  The  Defendants  are  increasing  the  frequency  of  these  trainings \n(regular, informal, refreshers). These skills are also important to help staff identify and \nprevent situations which might lead to disruption or altercations before such incidents \noccur. DBT implementation will be very beneficial to youth and staff.   \n \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 28 of 34\n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be  left  alone  in restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There was one youth who was \nplaced in mechanical restraints over 45 minutes (85 minutes). In this instance, the approval \nprocess was followed, and mental health services were provided.  With policy revisions and \nquality assurance measures, Defendants may be close to achieving substantial compliance \nwith this provision.   \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented as part of the Incident Debrief process. Defendants are close to reaching \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCou1t's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches in this \nreporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been reviewed and \nawaiting approval. A Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with \nall supervisors to outline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under \nwhich a strip search may be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search. A \nDJC “Searches of Youth” training module on the eLearning platform has been assigned to \nall safety staff in the first few months of 2021. Defendants are close to reaching substantial \ncompliance. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 29 of 34\n \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches this \nreporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches needs to be finalized.  \nDefendants are very close to being in substantial compliance. \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Once  the  policy/procedure  is \nfinalized, substantial compliance will be obtained. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches during \nthis  reporting  period.  If  documentation  and  policy  revisions  are  made,  substantial \ncompliance will be obtained. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  no  strip  searches \nconducted this reporting period. If policy revisions are made, substantial compliance will be \nobtained. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records reviewed \nindicate that all staff have been trained in trauma informed care. There were no strip \nsearches this period.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 30 of 34\n \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches during \nthis reporting period. Documentation needs to be improved and policy and procedure/QA \ndeveloped.  \n \n4.       Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The  process  for  tracking  and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. With continued practices, Defendants will be in substantial compliance.  \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants are focusing more on de-\nescalation skills.  Staff have been trained in MANDT and other training which includes de-\nescalation skills training. LHS/CLS secured Wisconsin Department of Administration grant \nfunding to allow ten (10) instructors to complete train the trainer trainings and subsequently \nprovide Eight-hour Verbal Judo training sessions to all staff who work with youth with the \ngoal of reducing risk for injury and enhancing staff confidence at effectively de-escalating \nconflict or potential violent encounters with youth.  \n \nCompetency testing was administered for all staff completing training and the scores from \nthe competency exam were tracked as part of a quality assurance measure underscoring the \nimportance  utilizing  well  trained  de-escalation  techniques.  DJC  certified  trainers  will \ncontinue to provide quarterly refresher trainings with practice scenarios to support skill \nretention and continued application of Verbal Judo skills at the facility going forward. \n \nIn addition to MANDT, Verbal Judo provides another paradigm to teach complimentary \ntechniques  and  build  de-escalation  skills  to  enhance  safety  and  treatment  supportive \nenvironments. The Monitor personally observed staff de-escalating youth with success and \nobserved several instances of de-escalation in review of video footage.  Staff are more \ncomfortable utilizing these skills, but continued focus, training, and review need to occur.  \nDefendants should include cultural diversity crisis management. Knowing these issues and \nhow they are communicated is critical to successful behavior management.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 31 of 34\n \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Defendants  are  working  on \ndecreasing idle time and providing more programming for youth. The below are some \nexamples: \n \nStaff Directed Activities LHS/CLS has encouraged staff led activities. Staff go out onto the \nunits and participate in activities with the youth. There is a calendar sign-up sheet completed \nfor each night of the week. Each unit has a monthly budget to purchase more items as needed \nto complete activities and a single staff person is designated to coordinate, monthly budget \neach to purchase incentive foods from outside the facility.  Some of the staff directed activities \nare simply putting on movies or video games which is not interactive.  There needs to be \nmore creative activities developed in partnership with the youth.  \n \nPSU Facilitated Programs/Other Programs During the March site visit, the Monitor spent a \ngreat deal of time talking with staff and youth involved in the new Music Art Initiative (MAI) \nprogram and the vocational programs, including welding and woodworking.  All three \nprograms were very impressive, and both youth and staff were highly engaged.  Youth in the \nwelding and woodworking shops were able to express learning skills and motivation for using \nthe programs and skills learned to help with long-term success when transition back into the \ncommunity.  The Monitor was highly impressed with the MAI program and the enthusiasm \nand commitment expressed by the instructor.  The instructor is able to connect with youth \nin a highly effective manner that clearly has created a positive mentoring and skill building \nrelationship.  Many youths have been able to learn to play an instrument and have written \ntheir own lyrics and music.  This program was so impressive, that the Council of Juvenile \nJustice Administrators (“CJJA”) invited the instructor to present at the CJJA Summer \nconference in August to highlight this program and the success of the youth. \nZoom Visits On February 15, 2021, CLS/LHS implemented Zoom visiting for youth on a \nweekly basis. Each living unit is designated with a specific day of the week for visits to occur. \nVisits occur 5:30 P.M-7:30 P.M and each youth on a living unit is allotted one twenty (20) \nminute time slot. Once youth are signed up for their time slot, a video visit/Zoom link is sent \nto the approved visitors e-mail with the invitation date and time.  \nMultipurpose/sensory rooms. There are now new multipurpose rooms put into use February \n22, 2021. Since the rooms are relatively new, they are expected to change and evolve as the \nfacility moves forward with them. Staff who have items, suggestions, or ideas for bettering \nthe rooms have been encouraged to bring them forward, and additional items ordered will \nbe delivered to the rooms as soon as they are received at the facility.  \nMusic Program MPC’s. Each living unit has their own “MPC” (Music) Production Station \nfor incentive youth use. There are youth in every building who have a working knowledge of \nthese already and with YouTube access. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 32 of 34\n \nWelding Projects. Youth in the welding vocational program at LHS have been learning, \ndeveloping and implementing valuable technical skills. Participants are instructed in basic \nindustrial  safety  concepts,  fundamental  arc  welding  skills,  and  introductory  metal \nfabrication. Career pathways are also explored. Students are given the opportunity to apply \ntheir developing skills to projects that benefit the workshop and institution. Youth recently \nhelped create signs for military veteran parking spaces at the facility. If possible, Defendants \nshould make this available on nights and weekends. \nFood Incentives: During this reporting period, various food incentives have also been \nimplemented  with  a  range  of  options  supported  by  Food  Service  as  ordered  by  any \nSupervisor. Supervisors may also receive support from the Business Office to procure food \nfrom an outside establishment or request specialized purchases. SYCs continue to have \ntournaments and contests across living units.   \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth.  Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \nto  further  reduce  youth  idleness  hours.  Ideally,  the  programs  mentioned  above  (and \nadditional programs such as the greenhouse, sewing, knitting, Grandparents program, etc.) \nshould be available in the evening and on weekends.  The Monitor is happy to hear that the \nbudget hold has been released for a religious service leader.  Youth missed having religious \nservices at LHS/CLS. As mentioned previously, increasing education hours and vocational \nprogramming, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED, can greatly assist \nin reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development strategies.  \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018 \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants should continue to focus on training and developing staff and evaluating their \nhiring process. As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts \nthe overall culture, atmosphere and environment of the facility.  Staff wellness has a direct \nimpact on the relationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, \nuse of restraint, and the use of isolation and confinement.  Although improved from the last \nsite visit, it is clear from the Monitor’s interactions with staff during the site visit that staff \nwellness  remains  an  issue.   High  levels  of  anxiety,  stress,  increased  working  hours  is \ncontinuing  to  impact  on  their  wellness  and,  in  turn,  negatively  impacting  the  overall \nenvironment. The Monitor will continue to work with Defendants on strategies to improve \nstaffing ratios and identifying additional strategies to positively impact staff morale/wellness.  \n \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 33 of 34\n \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.    First  draft  created  of  DOC \nChapter 373. Final draft of DOC 376 was submitted for approval.  Defendants need to \ncontinue drafting interim policies for LHS/CLS while also developing final Code revisions. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There has been a vast improvement \nin meeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority \nof cases.  When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a \ncorrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). A framework for other QA measures relating to the consent \ndecree has been created. Defendants have made huge progress as it relates to QA.       \n           \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout this report, \ndata driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and to \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 122   Filed: 04/20/21   Page 34 of 34\n \nimprove the quality of life for youth and staff.  Defendants have created a competent quality \nassurance program.  The new leadership team, dedicated QA personnel, and RFID has had \na positive impact on data collection and quality assurance.  The Monitoring team will \ncontinue to work with the superintendent to establish performance goals, analyzing data, \nand creation of corrective action plans. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThere has been vast improvement in many areas of the consent decree and overall atmosphere \nfrom  the  last  site  visit.    There  was  progress  made  in  several  initiatives  such  as \ntraining/implementing DBT, incorporating PSU more into daily operations, retaining a mental \nhealth consultant, increasing staff-led activities, additional staff training and development, in-\nperson education on and off the units, additional key staff present on-site, searches resumed, more \nnormalized visitation, CARE Team modifications, use of data in day to day decision-making, and \nimprovement made to the food, incentives, and canteen.  \n \nThe facility would benefit from an increased focus on reducing idleness, particularly during weekends \nand evening hours.  There are several very good programs with positive outcomes for youth (music, \nart, gardening, welding, etc.) that should be expanded.  The Defendants should continue to move \nyouth off of their home units as much as possible.     The facility should continue to work on improving \nthe behavior management system, continue with their progress in implementing DBT, providing \nimproved youth incentives that will help in reducing many behavioral incidents, and bringing gender \nand culturally relevant programming to LHS/CLS. Continued efforts need to be made to further \nengage the educational expert, reduce teacher vacancies, and increase educational time and quality. \nRegular training in de-escalation and assessment, evaluation, and review of use of force continuum \nneed to continue to occur.  Policies and procedures for LHS/CLS need to continue to be developed \nas well as applicable administrative code. Staff wellness needs to continue to be a priority. Lastly, \nthere needs to be a focus on moving youth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s) as per the \nCourt Order.  The Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court \nor the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n \n34 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n TENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Ninth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on April 20, 2021. The Monitor’s tenth \nreport  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree,  implementation  of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates from the ninth site visit which took place on March 18, 2021.  \nSITE VISIT  \nThe tenth site visit by the Monitor took place on June 24, 2021.  Due to the pandemic, the Monitor \nlimited onsite time to one day and completed necessary interviews/information gathering via \nvirtual meetings prior to and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed materials provided by the \nparties prior to and after the site visit for the reporting period ending May 31, 2021. Materials \nincluded but were not limited to: use of force videos, video footage of units, COVID-19 related \nmemos,  directives  and  plans,  programming  materials,  project  plans,  grievances,  discipline \ndocuments, investigations,  various staff memos, daily shift reports, all of the monthly data \nsubmitted to the parties per this Court Order (March, April, and May 2021), updated unit rules, \nwork rules, meeting notes, employee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint \ndocumentation, incident reports, and other housing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ \ncounsel and the monitoring team were on site during this site visit. Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted \nyouth interviews virtually before the visit, and in person during the visit. The Monitor toured \nLHS/CLS and interviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to the majority \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 2 of 43\n \nof youth and staff present and available during the site visit. Approximately forty-two (42) youth \nand thirty-three (33) staff were interviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.   \nOverall Quality of Life, Conditions, and Atmosphere \nIntroduction \n \nAll of the COVID-19 modifications (health screenings, intake process, and quarantine process) \nwere still in place during this reporting period.  The COVID-19 precautions have remained \nconsistent with the CDC’s guidance for congregate settings.  In person visitations will resume on \nSaturdays beginning July 10, 2021. There have been no youth COVID-19 cases and four (4) staff \ncases. COVID-19 vaccinations continue to be offered to every youth meeting the CDC guidelines.  \n  \nThe total LHS/CLS population continues to remain low, ranging in the mid to high 50s.  The \noverall atmosphere was good.  There continues to be concern regarding programming (lack of \nstructured  activities),  use  of  force,  youth  confined  to  their  rooms  due  to  being  placed  on \nobservation status (in some cases improperly), and other issues. The Monitor is also concerned \nabout inadequate accountability for staff who have engaged in improper behavior (such as \nexcessive force or verbal abuse) towards youth. However, overall, there has been improvement \nand progress in some areas of the consent decree from the last site visit (detailed throughout the \nreport).   \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, most units, school, and many other areas were neat and clean. \nAn over two-year long effort for renovating all living units including asbestos abatement, new \nflooring, painting, furniture, fans for air circulation have been completed as of May 2021.  New \nfurniture in the living unit day rooms is beginning to be installed. Three (3) living units have been \ncomplete and the eight (8) other units should be complete over the next few months.  There is new \nseating for the phone areas in all ten (10) units. The remaining two units are scheduled to be \ncompleted in August.  The renovation of a large school storage room into a new art room is \ncomplete with the exception of minor painting.  The new room will be used to provide a space to \nwork with PSU on art therapy. \n \nDefendants are continuing to prepare for the operation of on-site canteen including preparation of \nan on-site storage room with shelving; inventory tracking system; and installations of lockable \ncabinets in all twelve (12) living units.  Defendants completed installing sound reducing ceiling \ntiles in the Copper Lake School classroom to provide a more functional learning space. Although \nthe installation of the ceiling is in place, there needs to be modifications (painting/decorating etc.) \nto the room to make it feel more school-like because it currently is quite sterile. \n \nDefendants have constructed additional walls to expand the height of the unit safety booths to \nprevent youth from climbing and creating safety issues. Nine (9) units have been completed with \nplans to complete the remaining units in the next months. Additional modifications have been \nmade  to  the  lower day room offices to further prevent  climbing. Additionally, Defendants \naddressed water issues at the facility including the repair of the water tower and well in May. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 3 of 43\n \n \nThe Monitor will continue to update the Court on physical plant improvements that increase the \nsafety and quality of life for youth and staff.   \nEducation Observations \nYouth, teachers, and staff were present in the school area during this site visit.  There was a very \npositive atmosphere in the school and students and teachers alike seemed very happy to be there. \nYouth and staff complained that the school area is hot. Defendants are working on possible \nsolutions. There were youth on work detail and in classrooms.  All COVID-19 educational \nprotocols for the hybrid model which began in March 2021 reported in the last report remain the \nsame this reporting period.  Defendants continue working on procuring an educational expert. The \nMonitor urges Defendants to move promptly on this. The youth and staff continue to be very happy \nto be back in the school area and off the unit for part of their educational hours as well as having \nteachers accessible on the units.  Youth in COVID-19 quarantine (Krueger) and youth in the \nHughes Program (explained in more detail below) continue to have education on their living units.  \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that the frequency of music, art, and recreation needs to \nincrease.  The Monitor also recommends that these programs be equally available to the girls.  The \nMonitor also recommends that the girls’ classroom be painted a brighter color and have more of a \nclassroom feel.  The room is quite sterile and has an institutional feel.    \nThere were three (3) graduations this reporting period. Educators continue doing professional \ndevelopment on a regular basis. LHS/CLS were recognized as the top participating site for the \nUnjammed Learning Network (“ULN”)  program. \nPbS data shows that educational hours have increased significantly during the April 2021 data \ncollection period, 4.94 hours per day at LHS (weekdays) and  5.32 hours per day at CLS \n(weekdays). This reflects an increase of 1.19 daily average hours at LHS and 1.48 daily average \nhours at CLS compared to the October 2020 data collection cycle.  The Krueger Unit education \nhours remain lower than the other units at about 3.73 average hours per weekday which impacts \nthe overall education hours reported. This is primarily due to the education program being done \non the unit as part of the quarantine process. The new Hughes Program also has education \noccurring on the unit, but the average weekday average is much higher at 5.36 hours. The \nMonitor’s observations during the most recent site visit reveals that the hours and quality of the \neducation program has significantly improved as a result of the return to normal school operations. \nAs previously mentioned, the entire educational program at LHS/CLS still needs to be evaluated. \nThe Monitor encouraged the Defendants to engage the educational consultant further and work to \naddress the concerns raised – including the need for deeper and more meaningful teacher interaction \nwith youth and enhancing/expanding the daily education hours. The Defendants are working on \nengaging a consultant and continue to work on the educational programming.   \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit.  Overall, the units \nwere generally clean. The youth rooms were a mix of clean and messy. Overall, the cottages and \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 4 of 43\n \nyouth rooms were not as clean/orderly as the last visit.    \nThere were more than adequate staffing levels on each of the living units.  The unit populations \nranged from five (5) to twelve (12) youth. There were at least three (3) staff on each unit. Although \nthere were adequate staffing levels, staff overall were not engaged with the youth.  The Monitor \nalso reviewed video during the reporting period to view day room activities, staff placement and \nstaff engagement. In general, staff did not seem to be positioning themselves near the youth  nor \nwas staff interacting with youth. Interacting and engaging with youth would help with creating a \npositive youth-staff relationship as well as increase safety for staff and youth.   All the youth that \nthe Monitor interacted with were respectful and were more interested in interacting with the \nmonitoring team, leadership of LHS/CLS, and Plaintiffs’ counsel this visit than the last one.   The \nMonitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel had an opportunity to talk to most of the youth present in \nthe day rooms.   \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed on the Wells cottage. One youth was in the sensory \nroom with PSU staff, two (2) youth were cleaning, one (1) was doing laundry, one (1) youth was in \nher room, and one (1) was with a Foster Grandparent.  One youth who was in the day room was \nvery upset.  Staff attempted to talk and de-escalate her. The youth on Wells were quieter/less \nengaged this site visit.  The rooms on the unit were clean and orderly.  \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, generally, the cottages themselves were pretty clean. The units \nwere calm. The Monitor did not observe any graffiti anywhere in LHS/CLS.  It is clear that the \nDefendants are continuing to monitor this closely and continue to do an exceptional job resolving \nthis past issue.  \nIn Black Elk, the entry way was very messy and had a very bad odor. The day room and the youths’ \nrooms were very messy. This unit was the one that had been the cleanest unit during the last site \nvisit. There were twelve (12) youth in day room doing unstructured activities such as cards, doing \nmagic tricks, and talking.  Three (3) youth were voluntarily in their rooms. Youth were very \ntalkative with the Monitoring team.  There were three (3) staff and one (1) nurse present.  \nThe Curtis Unit was the cleanest unit.  The youth seemed happy and were talkative. There were ten \n(10) youth on the unit.  Seven (7) youth were in the day room getting ready to go Group and three (3) \nyouth were in their rooms voluntarily.  There were three (3) staff present.  \n \nThe Dubois unit was clean; however, most youth rooms were not clean. The youth were in the “free \ntime” period of programming. The unit was calm. There were eleven (11) youth on the unit with six \n(6)  staff present- three (3) direct care staff, one (1) social worker, one (1) teacher, a Supervisor, and \na PSU staff. The Growth team were conducting their weekly meeting on their unit. No youth were \nin their rooms.  Some youth were cleaning, some youth were talking with each other, one (1) youth \nwas in his Growth Team meeting, and some were on the telephone.  Youth and staff were very \ntalkative with the Monitoring team. Staff seemed to have a very good rapport with the youth on the \nunit. Staff were very engaged on this unit.   \n \nThe Krueger unit is the new admissions/medical isolation/quarantine/observation  unit for the boys. \nThe unit and rooms were very clean overall. There were five (5) youth and five (5) staff present on \nthe unit (three direct-care staff and two mental health staff).    There was no activity on the unit \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 5 of 43\n \n(even the television was turned off).  \n \nThe Hughes unit has been modified to house youth who engage in physically aggressive behavior, \npresent a danger to others, and/or exhibited behavior that caused a major disruption to the facility.  \nThe program is called the “Hughes Program” and was implemented on March 30, 2021. Youth \nhoused on this unit have a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by PSU in order to specifically \naddress their behavior.  Youth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in \nconjunction with their weekly Growth Team.  The Monitor observed a growth meeting in progress.  \nThese meetings are very productive, and the Monitor was impressed with the team approach. There \nis a three (3) step process in which youth’s participation/behavior will determine when they \ntransition back to a general population living unit.  Youth are not confined to their rooms when \nassigned to the program and are provided with additional on-unit programs and clinical services. \nYouth assigned to the program cannot go to the school area for education as all programs and \nclinical services are provided within the living unit due to the continued physical aggression and \nsafety concerns that the youth present.  Review of the unit activity logs comparing data between \nunits, indicates that the Hughes program is providing the same average hours of education, \nprograms, and out of room opportunities as the other general population units, with the exception \nof recreation time.  Hughes youth are receiving approximately 10.95 hours per day of out of room \nactivities, including education, programs, recreation, and leisure time, compared to 8.78 hours for \nyouth assigned to the Krueger Unit.  The Monitoring team offered suggestions to improving the \nprogram and provided examples of similar programs that can potentially be incorporated within the \nstructure of current program to enhance the overall impact and potentially improve services and \noutcomes.    \n \nThe Hughes unit was clean but most of the rooms were not clean.   There were eleven (11) youth \non the unit and four (4) staff present.   The youth were rambunctious on this unit.  The youth were \nsitting idle. There was no television on, no activities, and youth were cussing at staff.  \n \nIn general, youth and staff attitudes were not as positive as during the last site visit- more negative \nand detached. There is still a need for more structured and meaningful activities as youth idleness \nremains a concern, particularly on weekends. Enhancing weekend activities and programs will help \nreduce the risk of youth engaging in anti-social behaviors when they have little else to do (like \nclimbing on roofs, excessive horseplay, destroying property, and running around unauthorized \nareas).  During previous site visits, the Monitor recommended creating and implementing a daily \nschedule to help with youth boredom and create opportunity for structured, meaningful programming \nand  activities.    Utilizing  volunteers  and  other  community  organizations  is  good  method  for \nexpanding weekend programs and activities.  When looking at the PbS daily activity summary logs \nfrom the April data collection cycle, both LHS and CLS are averaging about 9.5 hours per day of \n“leisure activity” on weekends, compared to about 2.75 hours per day Monday-Friday.  The “leisure \nactivities” are long periods of time that are unstructured, mainly occurring in the dayroom areas.  \nThese are the periods in which most incidents of violence occur (PbS data reflects that 95% of all \nincidents occur on the living units).  Of these, 225 incidents or 42%, occurred on a weekend.  The \nincident report data also indicates that 239 incidents, or 45%, occurred between the hours of 8 A.M. \nand 10 A.M.(weekdays and weekends included). The Defendants have not fully implemented the \ndaily schedule.  There needs to be a focus on creating a daily schedule that provides for structured \nand meaningful activities and accountability in order to minimize the incidents of youth acting out. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 6 of 43\n \n \nStaff are still frustrated with what is perceived to be a lack of ways to hold youth accountable as well \nas a lack of incentives that will foster improved behaviors. Staff relayed concerns and frustrations \nwith the behavior management system and stated that staff have simply “given up” trying to hold \nyouth accountable.  As discussed below, however, staff as well as youth following the new system \nlikely  would  increase  safety  for  all.  Staff  are not  enforcing  the rules  as  a  means  to  avoid \nconfrontation with youth. This is all compounded by the fact that there are a significant number of \nnew staff who are still developing their skills.  This in turn is creating a challenging and potentially \nunsafe environment for both staff and youth.   \n \nAlthough staff perceive a lack of ways to hold youth accountable, this seems to be due to \nrestrictions on engaging in past practices such as confinement. Instead, Defendants are developing \nand implementing a new behavior management system, implementing DBT and have modified \ncanteen  privileges  to  encourage  youth  to  behave  on  a  daily  basis.  Improving  the  behavior \nmanagement system, improving the rewards and incentives, and developing engaging programming \nwill have a positive impact on the overall behavior and atmosphere issues that are driving the main \nissues that are frustrating both staff and youth.  Implementation of the new behavior management \nsystem is one of the most critical next steps for the agency and facilities. \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately forty-two (42) youth were interviewed prior to and during the site visit (formally \nand informally) by the Monitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Youth complained to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel about staff using excessive physical force, being confined to their rooms on “observation \nstatus” which they believe is at times being used punitively, staff being too quick to go hands on \nbefore  attempting  to  verbally  de-escalate  and  experiencing  racial  discrimination    and  racial \ncomments from staff.  Some youth also complained about Zoom calls being taken away, about being \nsubjected to group punishment even when they had complied with rules and orders and being bored. \nA few youth also indicated to Plaintiffs’ counsel there may be other situations called ‘modified \nprogramming,’ that also involve room confinement.  There were more requests to talk to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel while  the Monitor was onsite  talking with youth than during the  last visit.  Youth \nmentioned to Plaintiffs’ counsel that they had asked staff to speak to Plaintiffs’ counsel in the past \nbut were told this wasn’t possible. Defendants are working to inform staff of the proper protocols.  \n \nYouth also complained to the Monitoring team about long stretches of downtime, being bored, staff \nusing more force than necessary, going hands on instead of trying to de-escalate, staff not engaging \nwith them and not caring about them.  Youth complained about not going outside. \n \nYouth did not complain about food, education, or being let out of their rooms to use the bathroom \nwhen needed. Youth did have some very positive things to say about certain teachers, a particular \nsupervisor, and some direct-care staff.  \n \nThe Monitoring team saw more idle/unstructured time both during site visit and while reviewing \nrandom sampling of video of living units.  The Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth \nin meaningful/structured programming and activities. This has been a consistent problem since the \nMonitor began monitoring these facilities. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 7 of 43\n \nThe Monitor recommended in the last report that the Defendants should conduct Zoom calls in the \nvisitation area to “normalize” visitation, have youth move off of units, and have a change of \nenvironment. The Defendants have since followed this recommendation. Defendants also created \nan outdoor visitation space which will be very enjoyable for families and youth when in-person \nvisitation resumes in July.  \n \nThere were instances in which there were sustained findings that staff had engaged in inappropriate \nbehavior towards youth, but staff were only minimally held accountable for those violations (1 to \n3-day suspensions) and allowed to continue to work with youth.  Defendants need to have zero \ntolerance for physical, sexual, or verbal abuse towards youth, and any staff who engage in such \nbehaviors should not be permitted to work with youth. \n \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that the Defendants should take advantage of the reduced \npopulation by having the available staff in plan, prepare, and develop programs for youth. The \nDefendants need to focus on gender and culturally competent programming. Defendants should \nwork to move forward with requirements to close LHS and move youth closer to locations where \nsuch programs and services are more widely available.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nDuring this reporting period (March-May), there have been some key staffing changes.  Key \nPositions hired during this reporting period are as follows: Deputy Superintendent, Safety Director, \nYouth Counselors and Nurse Clinicians.   \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has increased from the last reporting period (see below).  \nThere are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS.  Approximately 153 of these positions are \n“direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”).  The teacher \nvacancy rate remains high (8 vacancies- similar to the that last two reporting periods). The Monitor \nencourages continuing to recruit teachers despite the reduced population and challenges with \nCOVID-19.  Recruiting is still a challenge due to the location of the facility, overall teacher \nshortages, relatively low compensation, location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS \nwill close, and the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue.   \n \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \n  September 19, 2020  December 9, 2020  March 1, 2021  May 31, 2021 \n       \nYouth   18.2% (21 out of 115)  23% (27 out of 115)  25% (29 out of 115)  36% (41 out of 115) \n \nCounselor \n \nYouth  12% (4.5 out of 37.5)  13% (5 out of 37.5)  23% (8.5 out of 37.5)  19 % (7 out of 37.5) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  28% (7 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25)  28% (7 out of 25)  32% (8 out of 25) \nSocial Worker  21% (3 out of 14)  29% (4 out of 14)  21% (3 out of 14)  36% (5 out of 14) \n \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 8 of 43\n \nThe Youth Counselor vacancies have increased during this reporting period, but Youth Counselor \nAdvanced vacancies have decreased.  Although the overall vacancies of YC/YCA increased, \nstaffing levels are adequate and meet legal requirements based on the reduced population that \nexists at LHS/CLS. The Defendants should continue to monitor employee leaves and scheduling \nto  ensure  staff  are  not  overly  mandated.  The  Defendants  are  working  on  modifying  job \ndescriptions, job postings, and interviewing techniques in order to attract and retain the best direct \ncare staff.  It is critical that applicants have a clear understanding of their role at LHS/CLS.    \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over thirty-three (33) staff. Staff morale seemed lower (although a \nlarge majority were still in good spirits) this site visit.  With the exception of the Dubois unit, staff \nwere less engaged with youth and seemed frustrated and defeated.  Staff continued to complain \nthat there were less punitive “tools” available to manage behavior, no consequences for youth \nbehavior, and staff shortages. The implementation of DBT and other best practices will improve \nsafety for staff and youth.  Staff expressed their desire to have DBT for themselves. The Monitor \nobserved several very good interactions with youth by staff and there are many committed staff \nwho truly enjoy working with youth.  \nThe PbS data for April 2021 reveals an increase in staff fear for safety concerns as well as an \nincrease in staff perceptions regarding how dangerous the facility is based on input taken from the \nStaff Climate Surveys.  Both of these outcome measures reflect increases in fear for safety concerns \nover the previous October data collection cycle. Fear for safety indicators at LHS was at 76.79% \nand at 86.84% at CLS.  Both are increases from the October 2020 data cycle.  Both indicators are \nalso significantly above the national field average of 24.43%.  This data certainly supports the staff \nand youth feedback that was provided to the Monitor during the site visit.  The Defendants recently \ncreated a position that will have staff wellness as one of the main focuses.  The Monitor looks \nforward to working with the individual selected.   \nDefendants  continue  to  work  on  increasing staff morale  but  have  much  more  work  to  do.  \nDefendants have done the following to increase staff morale: \n \n•  In March DJC handed out snacks including cheese sticks, jerky, chips, etc. to staff on \nvarious occasions making sure to include all shifts.  \n \n•  In April DJC staff wrote out inspirational messages and made care packages to send to \nAnamosa State Correctional in a pay-it-forward effort when two staff from that facility \nwere killed as the result of an inmate attack. \n \n•  For  Memorial  Day  DJC  management  and  supervisory  staff  along  with  the  CASH \ncommittee organized an ice cream sundae social for all staff and all shifts on May 26, 2021. \n \n•  For  Correctional  Employee  Appreciation  Week,  there  were  snacks,  food,  and  gift \ngiveaways each day \nThe Monitor recommended various tools that can assist with this, including staff taking ownership \nwith creating a safe environment by building rapport with youth, ensuring order on the units, \ncreating meaningful activities for youth, utilizing DBT, staff positioning, and consistent and fair \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 9 of 43\n \nprogramming and treatment of youth, to name a few without reverting to the kind of inappropriate \npunitive and excessive behaviors that occurred in the past.  \nAgency and facility leadership also should make it a point to review the PbS data with staff at all \nlevels, perhaps during monthly all staff briefing meetings.  This is an opportunity to show the \npositive outcomes being achieved through the various changes and efforts to reduce incidents of \nviolence, confinement, and use of restraint. \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information.  A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible.  \n \nYouth in Custody Practice Model (“YICPM”) Update/ Dialectical Behavior Therapy (“DBT”) \n \nDJC is continuing in the next phase of participation with YICPM by working with the principal \ninvestigator  from  Georgetown  University.  On  May  18,  2021,  the  Assistant  Administrator, \nCLS/LHS Superintendent, Program and Policy Chief, and a CLS/LHS Program and Policy Analyst \nmet to review the YICPM Data Component spreadsheet. The focus of the meeting was to begin to \nreview the spreadsheet with the specific data components listed and identify if information is \ntracked, and if so, who could provide the information. The group continued reviewing the \nspreadsheet at their most recent meeting on June 8, 2021.  \n \nSince the close of the last reporting period in February, training for direct care staff was completed \nto provide DBT Skills Coaching. On March 22, 2021, Defendants launched DBT Skills Groups \nco-facilitated by treatment and PSU staff while structuring the opportunity for safety (YC) staff to \nfirst engage as a “learner” in support of group dynamics and skill acquisition. Facilitators have \nbeen participating in weekly consultation meetings to support ongoing development and continuity \nacross the facility. To date, youth and staff have reviewed specific distress tolerance, mindfulness \nand emotional regulation skills. \n \nStarting in April, youth arriving at LHS have been introduced to group expectations, core DBT \nconcepts, and opportunities for mindfulness during pretreatment group sessions to help them \nsuccessfully transition to their assigned unit. During this time, youth also begin discussions with \nsocial services staff to guide them in identifying initial Growth Plan goals, and they learn about \nStage Progression and Program Point expectations. The youth is introduced to Growth Teams as a \nresource to help them set goals and overcome challenges which OJOR considers in  release \nplanning discussions. To enhance multidisciplinary understanding and application, DBT Skill of \nthe Week highlights have introduced leaders and staff teams to the skills that the youth will be \nlearning in the coming week. Mindfulness activities have also been strategically integrated into \nleadership and staff meetings as a means to build comfort and skill mastery in support of \nfacilitation with youth. \n \nAs Defendants continue to transition away from a correctional model and engage all staff in a \ntreatment paradigm, Defendants reconnected with a YICPM subject matter expert to provide \nFoundations of Treatment training for all safety staff across three half-day rotations in May. To \nreinforce understanding and capacity for the System of Care efforts, topics included research on \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 10 of 43\n \nrehabilitative models, foundations of safety, the functions of behavior, communicating for change, \nreshaping, relationships, youth developmental needs / the domains of wellbeing, and techniques \nfor  staff  interventions-  “I”  statements,  circle  ups,  acknowledgement  etc.  These  areas  were \nidentified to augment the support provided by Dr. Chapin during this initiative. Once DBT is fully \nintegrated into the programming, there should be improvement in many facets of the daily \noperations of LHS/CLS as well as a significant reduction in actual and perceived safety concerns. \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \n \nDefendants launched their Quality Assurance Review (QAR) process in August 2019.  During this \nreporting period, a Guardian Workgroup was commissioned. The first meeting of the group \nfocused on updating the current draft electronic rounds tracking policy with an aim of answering \noutstanding questions, updating language to align with current practice, and ultimately moving the \npolicy to a final draft stage for review by facility managers. Several sections of the Guardian \n(rounds tracking system) policy were identified for a full re-write.  During the second meeting, a \ndiscussion was commenced regarding how to effectively and efficiently train new academy staff \non the Guardian device, and also how to identify and assist staff who either ask for, or are identified \nas  needing  coaching,  mentoring,  or  retraining  on  utilizing  the  Guardian  device  to  its  full \neffectiveness. The next scheduled meeting of the Guardian Workgroup occurs the first week of \nJuly, so the effort to continue to refine the process for utilizing Guardian for youth safety checks \nand front-line data gathering also remains ongoing at the time of this report. \nFacility Improvement Plan (“FIP”) Progress \nA thorough and in-depth review was conducted of the April 2021 PbS data collection for both LHS \nand CLS.  During the review, outcome measure data clarification and input was sought from both \nthe facility PbS State and Site Coordinators and the assigned PbS Coach.  As a result of the review, \nthe following highlights and outcomes are noted: \n \nPbS Data Quality – In previous reports, some issues were identified as to the quality of the data \nentered for some outcome measures, including outcomes measuring around daily activity durations.  \nThrough the review of the April data reports, the Monitor is pleased to report that those issues \nappear to have been resolved and the data appears to be much more accurate.  More importantly, \nthe Guardian RFID system continues to be used to record much of the data inputted for the daily \nUnit Log activity data.  This continues to permit the facility to more accurately report the daily \nactivity for all youth, including education, facility programs, recreation, leisure time, “in sleeping \nrooms” (room confinement), and finally sleeping time. Using the Guardian RFID system continues \nto allow for the tracking of daily activity over the entire data collection month and is providing \nmuch more accurate data than was previously being collected.  With the improved data collection, \nthere is a better sense of the progress being made.  Before the Monitor begins to outline areas for \nimprovement, it is important to recognize the efforts and positive steps forward in regard to the \nquality of the PbS data and the overall progress in many of the outcome measures.  It is important \nto remember that PbS is a “continuous facility improvement program,” therefore overall progress \nis measured over the period of years and numerous data collection cycles.  PbS is a snapshot taken \ntwice a year, during the April and October data collection cycles and, therefore, may not match the \nthree (3) month (March, April, and May) data covered during this reporting period.  The overall \noutcomes for each may or may not differ depending upon variables. The trendline of the outcome \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 11 of 43\n \nmeasures is what is most important as it reflects the direction of the facility over time.  The April \ndata clearly shows some positive progress trends moving in the right direction for many of the \noutcome measures with some having moved in a negative direction.  This is expected given the \ncomplex operational changes occurring within the culture and atmosphere of the facility.  \nIt is also important to note that both the April 2021 data collection took place as the facility was \nbeginning  to  return  to normal  operations  after  the  pandemic,  which  certainly  made  facility \noperations much more challenging, particularly around the issue of reducing “operational” room \nconfinement.  As mentioned previously in this report, the issue around youth idleness, behavior \naccountability, and staff wellness and fear for safety remains a concern and is reflected in many of \nthe outcome measures.  \nWith all that said, there are a couple of outcome measures that warrant attention.  First and foremost, \nis what is unquestionably a continued high rate of “self-requested” confinement.  This remains an \nissue from the April and October 2020 data cycles and continues into the April 2021 cycle with \nsome progress of improvement being recognized. The data reflects 715 incidents of confinement \nuse during the month of April 2021 (610 @ LHS and 105 @ CLS).  Of these, there were a total of \n621 for self-requested confinement, representing 87% of all confinement for the facility during the \nmonth.    Program refusals typically result in room confinement, which is a violation of the Court \nOrder.  On one hand, this is a positive as very little confinement is a result of behavior issues.  On \nthe other hand, it is also a reflection of the culture, atmosphere and environment which results in \nsuch self-selected confinement.  Focusing on improvement on these particular areas of confinement \nwill certainly have an immediate and positive impact on reducing overall confinement numbers.  \nAdditionally, the previous reports discussed that the unit activity record for the Krueger Unit \nreflected that youth were spending approximately 20.64 hours per day in their rooms (10.5 hours \nreflected as sleeping time and 10.14 hours reflected as “in sleeping rooms,” room confinement).  \nThe activity log for the Krueger Unit also did not reflect any hours for education.   This issue seems \nto have been resolved.  The April 2021 data shows Krueger youth spending approximately 11.87 \nhours in their rooms for “sleeping” time and 0.63 hours in their rooms for other reasons.  Education \nhours for Krueger youth increased to approximately 3.73 hours per day (weekdays) and leisure \nactivity time decreased to 4.20 hours per day. This represents a larger portion of their day that is \nspent in more meaningful activities such as education. While the Monitor recognizes these \nimprovements, it is necessary for the facility to provide more meaningful programs and activities \nto youth during the leisure time periods. \nFinally, the Monitor encourages the facility to closely review all of the PbS data and outcome \nmeasures as a means to better understand the impacts generated from the many changes occurring \nwithin the facility.  Agency and facility leadership should make it a point to review the PbS data \nwith staff at all levels, perhaps during monthly all staff briefing meetings.  This is an opportunity \nto show the positive outcomes being achieved through the various changes and efforts to reduce \nincidents of violence, confinement, and use of restraint. Much work remains to be done.  The data \nshows fluctuating trend lines, some moving in the right direction, while others are not. These \nfluctuating trends can and should be expected as staff and youth adjust to the ever-changing \nbehavior response techniques and the skill level of staff in utilizing various training, de-escalation \ntechniques, and, as discussed earlier, in the full implementation of the behavior management \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 12 of 43\n \nsystem.  \n \nPbS Critical Outcome Measures Review: \n \nUse of Restraint Outcome Measures - Both LHS and CLS show “0” incidents of use of chemical \nagents (Order 6) during the April 2021 data collection cycle, which is commendable and per the \nSettlement Agreement.  The rates of physical restraint use (Order 3 – Physical Restraint Use per \n100-person days of confinement) at LHS and CLS declined during this data cycle but remains above \nthe national average, as does the rate of mechanical restraint (Order 4 – Mechanical Restraint use \nper 100-person days of confinement) usage incidents.  Both facilities experienced the fewest \nmechanical restraint usage during this period compared to prior data collection cycles and this \npoints to a changing culture in how staff are responding to youth behaviors.  However, physical \nrestraint usage, especially at CLS, is still very high and does tend to confirm the youths’ complaints \nthat staff frequently go “hands on. In addition, there is a relatively high rate of youth injury by \nstaff in CLS, which also seems to support these concerns. \n \nAs mentioned earlier, PbS is a continuous facility improvement process which involves complex \noperational issues.  The following two charts reveal that overall, the trends lines for both physical \nand mechanical restraint use has returned to the average levels from the October 2020 spike, and \nnow appear to be trending the right direction.  It is normal to see fluctuation in this type of data and \nthe October spike is most certainly related to temporary operational changes that were in place as a \nresult of the pandemic.   Improvement in reducing youth idleness with meaningful programs and \nactivities along with an improved behavior management program, can have a significant impact \non these outcome measures.  \n \nOrder 03 \nPhysical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 13 of 43\n \n \n(Note: PbS defines Physical Restraints as facility authorized and trained holds used by staff to \nsubdue an otherwise uncontrollable youth in order to prevent the youth from injuring him or \nherself, or others.)   \n \nOrder 04 \nMechanical restraint use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \n(Note:  PbS  defines  Mechanical  Restraints  as  Mechanical  Devices  used  to  prevent  an \nuncontrollable youth from injuring him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints may only be \nused for short periods of time and must be used under medical supervision.) \nThe previous Monitoring reports discussed issues around the reduced use of the Care Teams which \nhad resulted in a higher number of restraint-usage incidents.  Given the positive reductions in the \nuse of physical and mechanical restraints during this PbS cycle, it appears the heightened focus on \nCare Teams has had a positive impact.  Care Teams are designed precisely to reduce the need for \nthe use of restraints and have been effectively shown to work at facilities across the country and \nhave been shown to be effective at LHS and CLS as well. The Agency and facility should continue \nto expand the use of the Care Team concept and ensure that direct care staff are training to properly \nuse the Care Team as a de-escalation and use of restraint avoidance response.  It is critical that direct \ncare staff develop skills around total awareness in order to recognize the early signs of pending \nbehavior  and  incidents  in  order  to  engage  the  Care  Team  members  at  the  earliest  possible \nopportunity.  This in turn increases the opportunities for de-escalation and resolution of situations \nwithout the use of restraint. Care Team members should not be involved in the use of physical \nrestraint of a youth except in exceptional situations and only to protect the safety and welfare of \nothers as this is counterproductive to the concept and does not permit the youth to begin de-\nescalating if they believe the Care Team member may still use physical force against them.  \nThe Defendants should continue to implement the core principles of the Care Team model by utilizing \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 14 of 43\n \nan agency strategic plan process that involves additional staff training in de-escalation techniques; \ninclude Care Team deployment information in shift debriefings in order to review the process and \nprovide on-going situational training for staff;  implement a Care Team response incident report that \nalso reflects the outcome of the response in order to better track outcomes from Care Team \ndeployments; implement the S.O.D.A.S model (Situation, Options, Disadvantages, Advantages, \nSolution) into the Care Team model; and, finally, the facility leadership team should incorporate \ndaily/weekly review of all use of force/restraint incidents to evaluate if and when the Care Team \nshould have been activated to help de-escalate a situation.  This should be used as a staff training and \nawareness process to help staff build new skills and to help change their mindsets in how they first \nreact to certain types of youth behaviors. \nIsolation, Room Confinement and Segregation Measures – Overall, the PbS outcome measures \naround isolation and room confinement remained unchanged from the October 2020 PbS data \ncollection cycle, reflecting that 100% of room confinements are terminated in under eight hours at \nCLS and 94.12% at LHS, although the LHS rate was slightly, but not significantly less than the \nOctober 2020 rate.  Slightly fewer incidents of room confinement are terminated in under four hours \nat CLS, 88.89%, while the same rate holds at LHS at 94.12%. These are both very commendable \nachievements, and both are better than the national field averages for these outcome measures.  \nOrder 13 – Isolation, room confinement use for reasons other than behavior reflects increases at \nboth LHS and CLS for this data period over prior reporting periods, this may be a result of the \nincreased use of “observation status” confinements.   This issue needs to be reviewed more \nthoroughly to better understand the overall impact and duration data of these confinements. \nIt should also be noted as to the improved outcomes and reduced rates of initial room confinement \nplacements during the April data cycle. Both facilities showed reduced incidents of confinement \npractices, with LHS dropping below the national field average.    \n \nOrder 08 \nIsolation, room confinement, segregation/special management unit use per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 15 of 43\n \n \n(Note:  PbS defines confinement as any instance when a youth is separated from the youth \npopulation and placed in a room or cell alone for 15 minutes or longer. Youths are considered to \nbe confined from  the moment they are separated from others until they have rejoined the \npopulation. Youths may be transferred to a designated unit for confinement (e.g., a segregation \ndorm or program separation unit). Confinement may occur in locked or unlocked rooms but cannot \noccur in large dormitories. Any instance of confinement of 15 minutes or more is a reportable PbS \nincident event.) \nAs discussed earlier in this report, there remains an issue around Order 13 – Isolation, Room \nConfinement for reasons not related to behavior.  These appear to primarily be incidents where \nyouth are refusing to participate in programs and education. As you can see from the following \nchart, self-requested involves 92% of the non-behavior related confinement incidents at LHS and \n55% of confinement incidents at CLS.  While the use of room confinement for “self-requested” \ndeclined from the October 2020 data cycle, it still remains a very high percentage of confinement \nusage.  This continues to be a reflection from the overall behavior management system and lack of \nappropriate use of incentives and rewards.  Youth continue to refuse to go to school and elect to \nremain in their rooms and, often simply watch TV all day.  Facility staff need to focus on youth \nengagement or re-engagement strategies as well as the behavior management system in order to get \nyouth to participate in programs. The use of room confinement for “mental health” related issues \nrose significantly CLS during the month of April, rising from 11 incidents in October 2020, to 38 \nthis period.  This represents 36% of the room confinements at CLS.  The Monitor suggests that the \nfacility  and  clinical  staff  review  these  confinements  to  evaluate  their  appropriateness  and \njustification in both LHS and CLS.  \n \n \nWhy confinement was used    Lincoln Hills    Copper Lake \nValue  Count  Percent  Count  Percent \nSelf-requested  563  92%  58  55% \nMental Health  27  4%  38  36% \nProtect other youths or staff  17  3%  9  9% \n \nThe PbS Incident reporting data for April 2021 reflects the following important data points: \n➢  95% of the incidents occurring at CLS occurred in the living unit. \n➢  79% of restraints use at CLS involved the same two youth. \n➢  Zero incidents of injuries to youth from suicidal behaviors were reported. \n➢  95% of the incidents occurring at LHS occurred in the living units. \n➢  27% of the incidents occurred in the DuBois Unit (136 total incidents). \n➢  26% of incidents occurred in the Curtis Unit (130 incidents). \n➢  42% of the recorded incidents at LHS occurred on a Saturday or Sunday when there is \nsignificantly less activity.  \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 16 of 43\n \nSafety 05 \n➢  Injuries to youths by staff per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \nSafety 06 \nSuicidal behavior with injury by youths per 100 person-days of youth confinement. \n \n \nWhile there appeared to be a substantial increase in suicidal behavior with injuries, Safety 06 at \nCLS during the October 2020 data cycle, review of the actual data revealed that the number of \nincidents had declined over the last three data collection cycles.

Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Youth have stated to Counsel and \nthe Monitoring team that they have been confined for several days on “observation status” \nbut felt it was being done for punitive reasons.  The use of observation status has increased \nduring this reporting period.  It appears some of the confinement should have been AC- not \nobservation status or combination of both. Data does not indicate that youth are being \nconfined for seven days or for punitive reasons however, Defendants need to re-examine the \nuse of “observation status” to ensure that staff are not using this as a form of punitive \nconfinement.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth have stated that to Counsel \nand the Monitoring team that they have been confined for several days on “observation \nstatus.” The use of observation status has substantially increased during this reporting \nperiod. It appears some of the confinement should have been AC- not observation status or \ncombination of both. Data does not indicate that most youth are being confined for three \ndays or for punitive reasons however, Defendants need to re-examine the use of “observation \nstatus” to ensure that staff are not using this as a form of punitive confinement.  \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth have stated to Counsel and \nthe Monitoring team that they have been confined for long periods of time. The use of \nobservation status has increased during this reporting period.  It appears some of the \nconfinement  should  have  been  AC-  not  observation  status  or  combination  of  both. \nDefendants need to re-examine the use of “observation status” to ensure that staff are not \nusing this as a form of punitive confinement.  \nThe  Monitor,  counsel  for  Plaintiffs,  and  Defendants  discussed  Administrative \nConfinement/Observation Status and a plan is in place to change how these confinements \nare being utilized and ensuring compliance with this Court Order. The Monitor previously \nrecommended establishing clear criteria for administrative confinement so that staff cannot \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 24 of 43\n \npunitively confine youth and cannot confine youth for more than 24 hours if they do not pose \nan imminent danger of harm to themselves. The Monitor reiterates this requirement.  By \nestablishing clear and objective criteria, leadership can ensure that youth are not punitively \nconfined or subject to harmful isolation beyond the periods prescribed by this Court order.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The use of AC was significantly \nlower for LHS youth this reporting period (March-April).  The use of AC in CLS increased \nfrom last reporting period.  However, as previously indicated, confinement on observation \nstatus has increased this reporting period. The Monitor is unable to determine whether \nobservation status being properly utilized and whether this data is therefore accurate.   \n \nDecember 2020 \nCLS: 10 uses of AC \nLHS: 88 uses of AC. Average of 117 minutes. 6 youth over four hours.   \n \nJanuary 2021 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC \nLHS: 40 uses of AC: Average of 117 minutes. No youth over four hours \n \nFebruary 2021 \nCLS: 0 uses of AC \nLHS: 9 uses of AC. Average of 74 minutes. No youth over four hours \n \nMarch 2021 \nCLS: 9 uses of AC. Average 74 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 19 uses of AC. Average of 125 minutes. 1 youth over four hours.   \n \nApril 2021 \nCLS: 4 uses of AC: Average of 142 minutes. No youth over four hours \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 25 of 43\n \nLHS: 16 uses of AC: Average of 141 minutes. No youth over four hours \n         (4 youth exactly at four hours) \n \nMay 2021 \nCLS: 2 uses of AC: Average of 113 minutes. No youth over four hours \nLHS: 15 uses of AC: Average of 140 minutes. Two (2) youth over four \nhours \n \nPSU clinicians document an overview of the intensive mental health services in J- Tracker \nand on EMR. The overarching goal of providing intensive mental health services is to safely \nreintegrate the youth back into the general population immediately after placing the youth \non AC and to maintain youth success while off AC. The IMHS developed for a youth \nreintegrating from AC, are repeatedly re-evaluated and adjusted as needed.  \nEach youth on AC already has a youth plan (previously called Behavioral Management Plan \nBMP) developed collaboratively between PSU and the youth. These plans are preventative \nas they outline youth triggers, self-soothing strategies, and highlight treatment issues. These \nplans also provide input into the development of effective mental-health services to be \nprovided to the youth while in AC. This youth plan is also consulted when developing a \nspecific treatment plan for AC-specific intensive mental health services. It, along with the \nGuidance document, guides the collaborative effort amongst various staff to provide youth \nwith immediate and comprehensive mental-health services while on AC.   Defendants need \nto ensure that the staff on the units review these plans in order to safely manage youth. \nWhile the SYC notifies PSU soon after the youth is placed in AC, the SYC and YC may \nreference the youth plan to incorporate the recommendations of PSU to de-escalate agitation. \nAs soon as possible, SYC contacts PSU. When PSU is contacted, the PSU clinician reviews \nthe mental health needs of the youth. This aids in the first determination of whether AC is \ncontraindicated. PSU provides immediate consultation and treatment recommendations to \nthe SYC. By the two-hour mark, the PSU clinician begins a risk assessment if the youth is \nunresponsive to the initial treatment and have not reintegrated back into general population. \nPSU clinicians collaborate with the Safety staff and continue to evaluate youth response to \nservices. During youth interviews with Plaintiffs’ counsel, youth have indicated that there is \nvery little interaction with PSU.  \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit.  Majority of checks (over 98%) were completed within 30 \nminutes. The Monitor reviewed video footage for random days and times and there were \nseveral instances in which staff did not complete the checks in compliance with policy (not \nensuring they are looking into youth rooms to ensure youth are safe). Defendants already \nhad a directive created to remind staff to properly conduct safety/wellness checks while \nyouth are in room.  Policy and procedure and a quality assurance review process needs to be \nimplemented, and documentation needs to be streamlined.   \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 26 of 43\n \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \nposes a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were three (3) youth confined \nfor over four (4) hours during this reporting period (March-May 2021) (see response in \nprevious  question).  All  of  the  confinements  were  recommended  by  PSU.    “Intensive \ntreatment”  provided  to  the  youth  included:  completing  thinking  reports,  discussing \nalternative, making safety plans, engaging the youth in mediation, reviewing motivations, \nand reviewing coping strategies.  \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring for any form of room \nconfinement they are following this Court Order, draft policy and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.  As previously discussed, observation status \nwhere there is confinement needs to be looked at very closely to determine whether it is \nappropriate  or  whether  observation  status  is  being  used  as  a  substitute  for  punitive \nconfinement or administrative confinement.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were no AC placements that \nwere extended. There were no transfers as a result of extended placements in administrative \nconfinement. Defendants need to improve their quality of data and documentation with \nrespect  to  the  “commenced  plan”  and  incorporate  the  Court  Order  into  policy  and \nprocedure.   \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.   \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours. Once incorporated the Court Order into policy and \nprocedure, Defendants will be in substantial compliance.   \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 27 of 43\n \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24  was  updated.    The  plans  developed  are  very  detailed  and  comprehensive. \nDiscussion  and  clarification  have  occurred  surrounding  observation  status  during  this \nreporting period.  The Monitor will update the court on implementation of the changes in \nthe next report to the Court.  Although this provision of the Court Order only allows \nconfinement under the observation policy for youth at “imminent” risk of “serious” “self-\nharm,” It appears that it may be used (or continued) when the harm is attenuated, not \nimminent and when risk was posed to others. Also,  it may be used or continued when the \nrisk of harm is not “serious.” A robust conversation with Plaintiffs’ counsel and Defendants \noccurred during this reporting period. However, more conversations with the Parties need \nto occur as the Monitor does not think there is a meeting of the minds on observation status.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed on renovated units.   \nThe Monitor did observe rooms with multiple blankets/sheets covering large areas of the \nroom. Staff can clearly see into youth rooms now that the windows do not have etching \nand are not covered by paper/pictures.  Room searches  have occurred during this \nreporting period.  Youth rooms in general, were not as clean and organized. Many rooms \nhad several blankets, sheets, and other items that could pose a safety risk due to the \nvolume of items in the rooms. Also, the Monitor reviewed video of staff completing \nsafety/welfare checks, and several were not in compliance with policy and procedure. Staff \nneed to make sure they are looking into each room to make sure they have a visual on the \nyouths’ faces.  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 28 of 43\n \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards,  and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. If Defendants \nimprove their quality of data and documentation, and incorporate the Court Order into \npolicy and procedure, they will be close to reaching substantial compliance. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible.   PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification.  The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented.  Clinicians are on-site for a minimum of 6 hours each Saturday and \nSunday and the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth. The Defendants \nhave hired two new PSU staff.   The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the \nhours in which they are physically present on weekends and evening hours in order to \nengage youth in a meaningful way during this time.   \n \nA  quality  assurance  program  needs  to  be  developed.  The  Monitor  suggests  that  the \nDefendants consider implementing the mental health expert’s recommendations to further \ndevelop the mental health program/integration at LHS/CLS.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1 , MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 29 of 43\n \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Documentation/data shows that \nevaluations are completed and within 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. \nThere were no instances of contraindication documented during this review period. PSU \nclinicians developed a protocol for on-call situations. Each primary PSU clinician reviews \nthe record, assesses the risk and designates whether the risk is low, medium, or high. The \nrisk factors considered are supported by the literature on isolation and confinement. This \ndetermination is recorded in the mental-health caseload report which is accessible to all of \nPSU clinicians. The on-call PSU clinician uses this risk level determination and considers the \ninput from the SYC placing the youth in confinement to make a determination whether the \nplacement (each time) will be deemed contraindicated.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose.  Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants are over 98% compliant \nwith meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe.  QA program has \nbeen developed.  Quality assurance measures are in place and when necessary, formal \ninvestigations occur.  There were five (5) Letters of Expectations given to staff who did not \ncomplete safety/security checks per policy during this reporting period.  As previously \nmentioned, Defendants issued a directive to remind staff to complete checks according to \npolicy with available training if necessary.  The Monitor observed safety/wellness checks \nbeing completed on various days/times during this reporting period and observed instances \nin which staff did not make visual contact with youth. PSU staff do visit youth daily when on \nsite and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The Monitor saw several PSU staff on the \nunits during this site visit.   \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model.  \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 30 of 43\n \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth.  A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Property  restrictions  are  most \ncommonly applied by PSU for safety reasons, however forms and process for documenting \nany potential property restrictions need to be created and utilized. Once Defendants make \nthese improvements, they will be in substantial compliance. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general.  The on-call PSU clinician \ncommunicates to all the PSU clinicians through email that a youth has been placed on AC. \nThis allows the primary clinician to provide consultation and direction as to how to return \nthe youth to a baseline, self-regulated state. The primary clinician consults with the on-call \nclinician and with the SYC/YC/CUS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the  youth plan \naddresses the issues at hand and how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. A PSU \nclinician follows up in the absence of the primary clinician and/or the crisis clinician. PSU \ncollaborates with the SYC and direct staff. PSU also meets with the youth while they are on \nAC and through a follow-up session. The social worker and youths’ meeting schedules are \nindividualized. Therefore, as is the case with any arising short-term scheduling conflicts (e.g., \ncourt, medical needs, OJOR, AC etc.) the social worker works with the youth to identify \navailability  if  an  AC  placement  occurs  during  regularly  scheduled  meeting.  The  AC \nplacement also provides an opportunity for the social worker and the youth to review AC \nplacement  as  outlined  in  a  new  J-Tracker  form.  With  shared  awareness  around  AC \nplacement,  Social  Workers  are  positioned  to  incorporate  cognitive-behavioral  or \nmotivational interviewing practices in revisiting goals from the Youth Growth Plan.  \nDocumentation,  quality  assurance,  and  policy  and  procedure  need  to  be \nimproved/completed. A review of the social worker roles and responsibilities need to be \nassessed and Defendants need to evaluate how they are using social workers to ensure they \nare being advocates for the youth.  Defendants need to ensure there is accountability with \nrespect to the services provided by the social workers. \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 31 of 43\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. During the pandemic, Defendants \nmoved to smaller-group based treatment to youth where group participation was provided \non the units. This continues. Treatment programming for youth never ceased due to COVID-\n19 precautions, but the size of the groups was modified to accommodate safe social distancing \nmeasures and keep youth who shared a living unit assignment in groups with one another. \nBeginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group treatment \nsessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule.  The Monitor \nencourages these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as possible especially now \nthat  COVID-19  numbers  have significantly  reduced,  and  programming  is  being  more \nnormalized post pandemic.   \n  \nOnly youth who are actively in AC status due to posing a serious risk of imminent physical \nharm to others would potentially miss a treatment group. A process is in place for that \nspecific missed treatment group to be made up for the youth on an individual basis, and \nsince January 15, 2021 youth notes in J-Tracker should reflect the completion of the make-\nup session. Additionally, during the March through May reporting period, Defendants are \ndesigning and implementing a QA audit process for youth notes in J-Tracker in order \nensure this process is completed. Missing a treatment group and having a make-up session \ndoes not affect the youth in terms of any setback to their progression towards completing \nthe treatment group. This is the same process for a youth who were to miss a group due to \nany other short-term scheduling conflicts (e.g., court, medical needs, OJOR, etc.). For \nexample, if a 2-hour placement in AC occurs during regularly scheduled Skills Streaming \ngroup time, treatment staff will re-engage the youth in making progress in their treatment \ncourse avoiding any delays in progression through the course of their assigned treatment. \nDefendants to ensure that any missed/rescheduled treatment groups  do not negatively \nimpact a youth’s progress when possible. \n  \nAs of May 13, 2021, Corrections Program Supervisor instructed treatment staff group \nfacilitators that a special “Make-Up” note (not just standard weekly notes) shall be entered \nwhen a youth misses group due to an AC placement. This aligns with the drafted youth notes \nin J-Tracker procedure.  Supervisory staff will be able to provide guidance and oversight \nregarding “make-up” note expectations. Defendants need to continue to focus (document \nand QA) on providing rehabilitative programming that was scheduled/in process before \nplacement in room confinement.  \n \niii.         Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices.    Defendants  shall  ensure  special  education \nservices for all eligible youth. \n \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 32 of 43\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  In  general  (prior  to  COVID-19) \neducational services for general population occurred in the classrooms in the school area.  On \nMarch 24, 2020, the schools began providing education on the units with most education staff \nworking off-site. On February 22, 2021, the school teachers returned on-grounds at the \nfacility to begin instructing through Zoom from classrooms in the school. On March 3, 2021 \nTeachers began delivering classes on the units. On March 15, 2021, a hybrid schedule for \nyouth attending some programming within the school building began. Each unit has been \nassigned to be in the school for either the morning or afternoon part of the day, whichever \nincludes the physical education time. As stated previously in this report, the PbS education \ndata shows youth are receiving about 4.94 hours per day (weekdays) of education at LHS \nand 5.32 hours per day (weekdays) of education at CLS.  Classes now occur in the school \nbuilding except for youth in the Hughes unit who receive school on the unit, and youth who \nare in 5- or 10-minute observation status or AC who miss school entirely while confined to \ntheir rooms. \n \nDJC started the process to pursue an education consultant beyond the current work with the \nULN. The purpose of the consultant would be to evaluate the current education program \nand provide a strategic plan for improvement efforts. During the recent reporting period, \nDJC continued to meet with industry experts including Peter Leone with the University of \nMaryland and David Domenici with Break Free Education. Input from a variety of experts, \nas well as additional research, has allowed DJC to further refine the evaluation focus, costs, \nand timelines and draft a scope document that will be used during the actual solicitation. \nThis research has also allowed the division to identify the most appropriate procurement \nprocess to solicit the services; to craft an initial budget; and, to identify potential funding for \nthe effort.   Defendants have been working for several months to procure an expert.  \nDefendants need to expedite the process so  that educational services to youth can be \nevaluated and improved.  \n \nThere needs to be an increase in the daily education hours as this will have a positive impact \non meaningful programs and reduce youth idleness.  Additionally, Defendants need to ensure \nthat special education is provided while on administrative confinement and observation \nstatus.    Youth  were  engaged  in  the  classrooms.  Youth  were  paying  attention,  sitting \nappropriately, and actively participating.  It would be extremely beneficial to provide art, \nmusic, woodworking, the greenhouse, welding, and sewing and other types of programs to \nyouth in the evening and on weekends. The Defendants should continue to focus on bringing \nmore programming into LHS/CLS, especially culturally relevant and specific to the race and \ngenders of the youth who are at the facility. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 33 of 43\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. In general, youth are out of their \nrooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.  except for youth in isolation due to Covid-19 safety measures \nimplemented  by  Defendants,  any  confinement  required,  or  any  self-confinement.    The \nMonitor regularly saw youth conversing with other youth during out time. Each unit had \nsensory rooms. There were more instances of youth being in their room during this site visit \nthan last; those that were in their rooms voluntarily did so.   \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were four (4) documented \ninstances of youth eating in their rooms (3 in March and 1 in April) which were staff \nimposed based on substantial threat of physical harm.  Defendants are able to track when \nyouth eat meals in room. Policy and procedure need to incorporate this section of the Court \nOrder. Defendants are close to being in substantial compliance.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  are \nreceiving much more than the 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per week. (As stated \nearlier in the report, PbS definition of “room confinement” does include confinement for \npurposes of observation, even when ordered by PSU. )However, there were youth on \nobservation status that did not get at least three hours per day of out time.  \n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals.  Within one hour of a youth's placement \nin room confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement. The \nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. However, the process and forms need to be \nenacted and written into policy. Once this is done and sustained, Defendants will be in \nsubstantial compliance. \n \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 34 of 43\n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are now documenting \nthis  more  consistently,  including  when  less  restrictive  means  were  attempted. \nDocumentation needs to continue to be completed and consistently applied to all situations. \nDocumentation, data collection and reliability, and quality assurance (with video review) \nneeds to continue to be improved. Also, documentation needs to be created that prove a \nyouth was promptly provided with the report upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan.  Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  There needs to be continued focus on training, skills development and coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  eliminated.  \nThere  needs  to  be  continued  focus  on  training,  skills  development  and  coaching, \nprogramming, and continued focus on overall atmosphere.   \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 35 of 43\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor did not personally see \nany youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, but data and documentation show that \nthere were uses of mechanical restraints during this reporting period. Defendants need to \ncontinue  focusing  on  reducing  the use of  mechanical  (as  well  as physical)  restraints.  \nDefendants need to document and establish that there were not less restrictive means \navailable and quality assurance measures in every instance of the use of restraints and follow \nthe final policy and procedure that are in place.   \nAs discussed in previous sections of this report, the use of both physical and mechanical \nrestraints trended upward during the two 2020 data collection cycles.  The Monitor believes \nthis  was  a  reflection  and  combination  of  the  lack  of  meaningful  activities,  programs, \neducation and the need to enhance the behavior management system, including more robust \nand meaningful incentives and rewards for youth as well as operational changes resulting \nfrom the pandemic.  Reducing youth idleness with meaningful programs and activities along \nwith an improved behavior management program, can have a significant impact on these \noutcome measures. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Use  of  mechanical  restraints  is \nhigher in both LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \nJune 2020:    20 uses \nJuly 2020:                      30 uses \nAugust 2020:    65 uses \nSeptember 2020:  38 uses \nOctober 2020:    43 uses \nNovember 2020:  26 uses \nDecember 2020:   20 uses \nJanuary 2021:    12 uses \nFebruary 2021:   8 uses \nMarch 2021:    17 uses   \nApril 2021:    18 uses \nMay 2021:    17 uses \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \nJune 2020:     0 uses \nJuly 2020:      0 uses \nAugust 2020:                  0 uses \nSeptember 2020:   4 uses \nOctober 2020:     4 uses \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 36 of 43\n \nNovember 2020:   0 uses \nDecember 2020:     6 uses \nJanuary 2021:     0 uses \nFebruary 2021:    0 uses \nMarch 2021:               1 uses \nApril 2021:     3 uses \nMay 2021:     4 uses \n \nDocumentation needs to be improved to document that an imminent threat of physical harm \nexisted, and when and how that decision is reviewed. Defendants should note why the acts in \nquestion required a specific type of use of force, such as explaining why measure utilizing \nless force would have been insufficient in a specific situation. The review process should \nconsider the nuances in different situations.  Defendants do have critical outcome measures \nfor restraints.  Defendants need to continue to work towards reducing the use of mechanical \nrestraints, develop better documentation and quality assurance measures. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were four (4) uses of the \n“wrap” (full body restraint). The “wrap” is a restraint device that falls under this section \nand needs to be monitored for usage compliance. The wrap should only be used in situations \nin which PSU has ordered and/or authorized its use in order to prevent active self-harm. \nPSU did not order the wrap in these four instances but were consulted.  If other mechanical \nrestraints are used, the Defendants need to make sure they are ordered by PSU to attempt \nto prevent active self-harm.  Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, training, \nand QA measures and ensure PSU staff order these types of restraints.  \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage. Defendants need \nquality assurance measures and need to continue to focus on reducing the use of restraints.  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 37 of 43\n \nrestraints are not used.  Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.    Defendants  need  to  continue \nfocusing on reducing the use of mechanical restraints.  Defendants need to create and \nmonitor quality assurance measures. \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There is no evidence of \nyouth being restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staff have received training in \nphysical  force,  restraints,  and  trained  in  proper  de-escalation.  The  Defendants  are \nincreasing the frequency of these trainings (regular, informal, refreshers). These skills are \nalso important to help staff identify and prevent situations which might lead to disruption \nor altercations before such incidents occur. DBT implementation will be very beneficial to \nyouth and staff.   \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit.  No youth shall be left  alone  in  restraints.    Any use of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There were no instances of youth \nbeing  placed  in  mechanical  restraints  over  45  minutes.  Defendants  may  be  close  to \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 38 of 43\n \nachieving substantial compliance with this provision.   \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented as part of the Incident Debrief process. Defendants are close to reaching \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possesses drugs or weapons that could \nnot be discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) strip searches in \nthis reporting period- both completed in compliance with policy and procedure. The policy \nand procedure for Searches of Youth have been finalized during this reporting period. A \nStrip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all supervisors to \noutline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under which a strip search \nmay be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search. A DJC “Searches of \nYouth” training module on the eLearning platform has been assigned to all safety staff in \nthe first few months of 2021. Defendants are close to reaching substantial compliance. \n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause.  Less intrusive searches, including \nusing a metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a \ntank top or other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is \nconducted, unless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth \nthat less intrusive searches, which may include physical contact, would \ncause greater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  If \nmaintained, Defendants will be in substantial compliance next reporting period. \n \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 39 of 43\n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  If \nmaintained, Defendants will be in substantial compliance next reporting period. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) strip searches \nduring this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  If maintained, Defendants will be in substantial compliance next reporting period. \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) strip searches \nconducted this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized. If maintained, Defendants will be in substantial compliance next reporting period. \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records reviewed \nindicate that all staff have been trained in trauma informed care. There were two (2) strip \nsearches this period.  \n \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) strip searches \nduring  this  reporting  period.  Documentation  has  improved.  Policy  and  procedure/QA \ndeveloped.  If maintained, Defendants will be  in  substantial compliance next reporting \nperiod. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 40 of 43\n \n4.       Documentation.  Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants are focusing more on de-\nescalation skills.  Staff have been trained in MANDT and other training which includes de-\nescalation skills training. Future and continuing de-escalation training/modeling should be \nconducted. \n \nCompetency testing was administered for all staff completing training and the scores from \nthe competency exam were tracked as part of a quality assurance measure underscoring the \nimportance  utilizing  well  trained  de-escalation  techniques.  DJC  certified  trainers  will \ncontinue to provide quarterly refresher trainings with practice scenarios to support skill \nretention and continued application of Verbal Judo skills at the facility going forward. \n \nThe Monitor personally observed staff de-escalating youth with success and observed several \ninstances of de-escalation in review of video footage.  Staff are more comfortable utilizing \nthese skills, but continued focus, training, and review need to occur.  Defendants should \ninclude cultural diversity issues as part of crisis management training and procedures. \nKnowing these issues and how they are communicated is critical to successful behavior \nmanagement.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Programming needs improvement \n(as discussed throughout this report) and idleness remains high.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth.  Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \nto further reduce youth idleness hours. The interviewing process for a religious service leader \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 41 of 43\n \nwas occurring during this reporting period.  As mentioned previously, increasing education \nhours and vocational programming, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or \nHSED, can greatly assist in reducing idleness time and provide positive youth development \nstrategies.  \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018 \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants should continue to focus on training and developing staff and evaluating their \nhiring process. As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts \nthe overall culture, atmosphere and environment of the facility.  Staff wellness has a direct \nimpact on the relationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, \nuse of restraint, and the use of isolation and confinement.  It is clear from the Monitor’s \ninteractions with staff during the site visit that staff wellness remains an issue.  High levels \nof anxiety and stress impact on their wellness and, in turn, negatively impacts the overall \nenvironment. The Monitor will continue to work with Defendants on strategies to improve \nstaffing ratios and identifying additional strategies to positively impact staff morale/wellness.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments to administrative code.  Defendants will make all reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Drafts have been created of DOC \nChapter 373. Final draft of DOC 376 was submitted for approval by the Governor’s office.  \nDefendants need to continue drafting interim policies for LHS/CLS while also developing \nfinal Code revisions. Defendants need to create an expedited timeline for finalizing all \nregulations and submitting them for approval. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process.   Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 42 of 43\n \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent.  Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There has been a vast improvement \nin meeting the 24-hour timeline. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority \nof cases.  When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a \ncorrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). Meaningful QA also requires that the facility hold accountable \nstaff who engage in sexual, physical or verbal abuse of youth, and preclude such staff from \ncontinuing  to  work  with  youth.  There  must  be  zero  tolerance  for  such  behaviors.  A \nframework  for  other  QA  measures  relating  to  the  consent  decree  has  been  created. \nDefendants have made huge progress as it relates to QA.              \n   \n \nB.          Quality assurance.  The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of  this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout this report, \ndata driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and to \nimprove the quality of life for youth and staff.  Defendants have created a competent quality \nassurance program.  The new leadership team, dedicated QA personnel, and RFID has had \na positive impact on data collection and quality assurance.  The Monitoring team will \ncontinue to work with the superintendent to establish performance goals, analyzing data, \nand creation of corrective action plans. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThere was progress made in several initiatives such as a strong, committed leadership team, \nincreased  educational  hours,  the  quality  assurance  program,  training/implementing  DBT, \nincorporating PSU more into daily operations, additional staff training and development, continued \nin-person education on and off the units, use of data in day-to-day decision-making, and several \nkey policy and procedures being updated and completed. \n \nThe facility would benefit from an increased focus on reducing idleness, particularly during weekends \nand evening hours.  There are several very good programs with positive outcomes for youth (music, \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 127   Filed: 07/26/21   Page 43 of 43\n \nart, gardening, welding, etc.) that should be expanded.  The Defendants should continue to move \nyouth off of their home units as much as possible and outside when weather permits.  The Defendants \nshould continue to work on improving the behavior management system, continue with their progress \nin  implementing DBT,  providing  improved  youth  incentives  that  will help  in reducing  many \nbehavioral  incidents,  and  bringing  gender  and  culturally  relevant  programming  to  LHS/CLS.  \nDefendants should continue to expand the influence and impact of CARE Teams would also \nimprove critical outcome measures around the use of restraint practices, staff wellness, youth \naccountability and in reducing use of any form of room confinement. Continued efforts need to be \nmade to further engage the educational expert, reduce teacher vacancies, increase educational time \nand quality. Regular training in de-escalation and assessment, evaluation, and review of use of force \ncontinuum need to continue to occur.   Applicable administrative code needs to be finalized and \napproved. Staff wellness needs to continue to be a priority. If staff wellness does not improve, the \nDefendants will have a very difficult time making progress with the provisions of the consent decree.  \nLastly, as the Monitor continues to state in reports to the Court, there needs to be a focus on moving \nyouth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s).   \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n \n43 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n THIRTEENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Twelfth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on February 12, 2022. The Monitor’s \nthirteenth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates since the twelfth site visit which took place on January 13 and 14, \n2022. \nSITE VISIT \nThe thirteenth site visit by the Monitor took place on May 5, 2022. Due to the continuing pandemic, \nthe Monitor and Plaintiffs’ counsel limited onsite time to one day and completed necessary \ninterviews/information gathering via in-person and virtual meetings prior to and after the site visit. \nThe Monitor reviewed materials provided by the parties prior to and after the site visit for the \nreporting period ending March 31, 2022. Materials included but were not limited to: use of force \nvideos, video footage of units, video of safety and security checks, COVID-19 related memos, \nprogramming materials, discipline documents, investigations, PREA investigations, various staff \nmemos, daily shift reports, policies, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court \nOrder (January, February, and March 2022), updated unit rules, work rules, meeting notes, \nemployee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint documentation, incident \nreports, and other housing documentation.  The Monitoring team and Plaintiffs’ counsel  were on \nsite  during  this  site  visit.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  conducted  approximately  eighteen  (18)  youth \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 2 of 33\n \ninterviews virtually before and during the site visit.  The Monitor toured LHS/CLS and interviewed \nyouth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to many of youth and staff present and \navailable during the site visit. Approximately forty-one youth (41) youth and twenty-five (25) staff \nwere interviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.  \nOVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, CONDITIONS, AND ATMOSPHERE \nIntroduction \n \nThe total LHS/CLS population has steadily increased during this reporting period up to the high \n(60s) on average for this reporting period. At the time of the site visit, the population was in the \nlow 70s. It is important to note that the population level is trending upward and has significantly \nincreased over recent months. This appears to be a trend that will continue into the foreseeable \nfuture.  While the population increase is a concern, the issue is compounded by the serious staffing \nsituation of vacancies, turnover, various employee leaves, and overtime required to maintain \nsufficient staffing levels. The current staffing situation is having a profound negative impact on \ndaily operations, requiring adjustments to the daily schedules to maintain effective staffing ratios \nfor youth supervision. These adjustments have resulted in operational room confinement –that is, \nconfining youth in their rooms not based on behavior but for operational reasons (in this case short \nstaffing)- while attempting to reduce incidents of violence and maintain safety and security. \nDespite these challenges, leadership, and staff at LHS/CLS remain positive and committed to \nimproving conditions of confinement for youth and staff. Although staff attitudes remain positive, \nyouth attitudes were significantly negative.   Complaints to the monitoring team and counsel \nsignificantly increased during this reporting period and site visit. There continues to be concern \nregarding programming, use of force, quality and quantity of education, and other issues, as well \nas a significant increase in youth concerns about confinement and associated restrictions.  \n \nAll of the COVID-19 modifications (health screenings, intake process, and quarantine process) \nwere still in place during this reporting period as last site visit except masks were not mandatory.  \nThere have been ten (10) youth COVID-19 cases and forty-nine (49) staff cases during this \nreporting period. This marks a substantial increase in staff positive cases from the last report and \nslight increase in youth positive cases. COVID-19 vaccinations continue to be offered to every \nyouth and staff meeting the CDC guidelines. Defendants should reconsider requiring staff to wear \nmasks should this increase continue.  \n \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, school, and many other areas were clean and orderly. Living \nunits in general were not as clean and orderly as observed on previous site visits. Defendants \ncompleted renovating Douglass Living Unit during the last reporting period into a recreation space. \nThe Unit looks amazing with many recreational activities available for youth. Staff and youth are \nenjoying the space. Defendants added materials and supplies to the kitchen for youth to engage in \nbaking and cooking, photography, music, sewing, board games, air hockey, bags tournaments, \nbasketball, popcorn, video games, Legos, cards and more. The youth told the Monitor how much \nthey love the unit and would like to utilize the space more. Staffing challenges have made it more \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 3 of 33\n \ndifficulty to bring youth to the unit.  \nDefendants continue with the following physical plant improvements: \n•  Work began on an electrical upgrade for the greenhouse which allow the greenhouse to \naccommodate more youth programming and yield additional and varied projects, plants, \nand produce. Excavating services that require a complete thaw for digging continue this \nspring.  \n•  An additional electrical upgrade to the welding room to facilitate more welding stations \nand better equipment for the welding program has occurred. Upgrading the electrical in the \nrevamped welding shop, allows youth to train and practice their newly learned skills on \nnewer, more modern welders. In addition to the general electrical upgrade, the lighting will \nalso be enhanced in the updated space. \n•  Continued the installation of new windows and window frames in each of the twelve (12) \nliving units by completing Rogers and Hughes. The new windows and frames include \nspecialized glass that can withstand significant duress without failing. This extensive effort \nis expected to improve the environment and lighting as well as safety while reducing the \nneed to regularly replace broken windows.  \n•  Continued the lighting upgrade project throughout the facility by completing all units on \ngrounds except Krueger and Black Elk by the end of March. The final two will be \ncompleted in April. This project has changed the lighting and feel of the youth rooms and \ndayrooms, as well as improved the visibility of emergency lighting. The project removes \nthe aging lights and fixtures and replaces them with better, more efficient LED lighting.  \n•  Continued implementing additional fixed cameras throughout the facility including both \ninternal and external cameras by completing Addams, Hughes, Rogers, Miller, Wells, \nSchool and the Administration Building during the reporting period. In total, the project \nwill result in the installation of over 100 new cameras increasing youth and staff safety and \naccountability throughout the facility.  \n•  Enhanced the Music Arts Initiative by adding additional computer, software, and hardware \ncomponents. In addition to the therapeutic benefits of music arts efforts, the recreation \nleaders who are facilitating the music program have begun focusing on youth writing and \nrecording their own original music and several youths have submitted original works to the \n2022 PbS Kid Got Talent Awards Contest.  \nThe Defendants should be commended for their continuing commitment to improve the physical \nplant which improves the daily lives for staff and youth even during a very challenging time. The \nMonitor will continue to update the Court on physical plant improvements that increase the safety \nand quality of life for youth and staff.  \nEducation Observations \nThe physical appearance of the school areas and classrooms were beautiful as usual. Youth were \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 4 of 33\n \nobserved in the classrooms actively participating in education.  \nDefendants engaged three consultants to evaluate the educational programming at LHS/CLS. The \nconsultants are national experts and have been selected to evaluate key educational areas including:  \n•  Operations  \n•  Curriculum and Instruction  \n•  Academic Assessments  \n•  Special Education  \n•  Human Capital  \n•  Technology Integration  \n•  Transition  \nEvaluation work commenced on November 30, 2021, and the team spent three (3) full days on \nsite. A final report is expected in June. The Monitor looks forward to receiving the final educational \nreport and will update the Court in the next Monitor’s report. \nThe Monitor recommended in previous reports that the girls’ classrooms should be painted a \nbrighter color and have more of a classroom feel. The CLS youth picked the colors for the \nclassrooms and the Defendants have painted the rooms. Furniture, décor, etc. have been added and \nthe classrooms are in full use. The Youth really like the newly decorated space and even mentioned \nthey would like to use it more.  \nAny  youth  in  COVID-19  quarantine  and  high-risk  youth  on  levels  1  and  2  of  the  Skills \nDevelopment  Program (“SDP”)  (CLS and LHS) continue to have education in the units and not \nat the school. The Monitor continues to recommend that the frequency of music, art, and recreation \nneeds to increase. The quality of the music program is second to none and all youth would benefit \nfrom the program not just during the school day but on weekends when there is the most idle time. \nThe Monitor is happy to report that three LHS youth graduated in January. The Monitor looks \nforward to progress made with the new educational leadership and consultants. \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit. Overall, the units \nand youth rooms were significantly less clean as the last visit except the Rogers unit. The behavior \nmanagement program  should be used for youth to earn points and incentives for keeping the units \nclean and for keeping their rooms clean with beds made. Youth were also more frustrated, vocal, \nand angry than the last site visit. During the last few site visits, youth did not request to speak to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel but during this site, many youths (approximately 14) asked to speak to counsel.  \nMany  of  the  youth  concerns  dealt  with  increases  in  confinement,  and  with  conditions  in \nconfinement that the youth perceived as unwarranted. \nTypically, the Monitor reports that there are more than adequate staffing levels on each of the living \nunits. This is the first time the Monitor reports that there are inadequate staffing levels on the living \nunits, which presents very significant problems for youth and staff. The unit populations ranged \nfrom six (6) (CLS’ units) to twenty-one (21) (LHS) youth which creates significantly higher staffing \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 5 of 33\n \nratios. Defendants are trying to have supervisory staff, mental health and other staff regularly come \nto the units to increase staff presence. This is becoming increasingly difficult as the population \ncontinues to increase, and staffing numbers continue to decrease. Staff were engaged with youth \nduring this site visit. Staff attitudes were more positive than the Monitor expected considering the \nday-to-day challenges they face currently.  The Monitor reviewed video during the reporting period \nto view day room activities, staff placement and staff engagement. There were many instances in \nwhich staff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables and areas with youth, which \nmirrored what was observed during this site visit. The body language and tone were positive from \nstaff but not from most youth. All the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and \nwillingly communicated with the monitoring team but had many complaints. There were not too \nmany positive comments made to the monitoring team or plaintiffs’ counsel during this site visit. \nThe Monitoring team had an opportunity to talk to most of the youth present in the day rooms. \nThere were more youth in their rooms (self-directed or operationally confined due to staffing issues) \nthan the last site visit.  \nDuring this site visit, the girls were housed in the Wells and King Units. There were thirteen (13) \nyouth total in CLS. The King unit was used for general population and quarantine, while Wells \nhoused youth in the behavior intervention protocol. There were two staff members on each unit \n(although one staff is not typically assigned  to the unit). Neither unit was clean. Unit day rooms \nand floors were dirty, beds were not made, storage room cluttered and messy, and mopping needed \nto be done on both units. The youth rooms on CLS were quite messy which is not typical of CLS \nyouth. Some of the girls were in school and visiting with Foster Grandparents,  two girls were in \ndayroom (new intakes), and three (3) youth were in their rooms. The girls on King (in quarantine) \nwere very chatty and seemed happy. They were eager to get off of quarantine so that they can \ninteract with the other girls and participate in programming. The Monitor was told that after the site \nvisit, the youth were able to be placed in general population.  \nWith respect to the boys’ cottages, Addams and Curtis were empty units during this site visit. The \nboys were housed on Krueger, Rogers, Black Elk, Hughes, Miller, and Roosevelt. As previously \nmentioned, the Douglass unit is the new recreation unit. None of the units had adequate direct-care \nstaffing (although Defendants attempted to supplement with other classifications of staff). Youth \nwere in school, on telephones, watching television, engaging with PSU staff, preparing for DBT, \ncleaning, outside for recreation, or sitting in day room conversing with other youth (excluding \nyouth who were in their rooms and/or in the high-risk unit programming).   \nIn previous reports, the Monitor discussed the “Hughes Program.” The “Hughes Program” was \nimplemented on March 30, 2021 and was considered the “High Risk” Unit.  The Program is now \nthe Skills Development Program (“SDP”). The program continues to be housed in the Krueger unit. \nFor the purposes of this report, the unit will be referred to as  SDP. The SDP is modified \nprogramming for youth who have engaged in physically aggressive behavior, have presented a \ndanger to others, and/or exhibited behavior that caused a major disruption to the facility. Youth \nhoused on SDP unit have a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by PSU in order to specifically \naddress their behavior.  Youth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in \nconjunction with their weekly Growth Team. The Superintendent (or designee) have to approve \nplacement onto this unit. Prior to this site visit, the unit remained open, and youth were out of their \nrooms 8 A.M .to 8 P.M. like other units. However, due to the increase in population and limited \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 6 of 33\n \nstaff on the Krueger unit (and others) youth are being “operationally confined” and split into three \ngroups so that some youth can be outside/day room and others confined to their room. This means \nthat youth are spending more time in their rooms which will have negative consequences overall. \nAlthough youth were not being operationally confined until April (not during this reporting period) \nit is important to discuss the impact since the next report will not be completed until August 2022. \nDefendants need to consider options for youth who are confined to their rooms due to staffing issues \nas it is not of their doing.  Defendants should consider allowing tablets, electronics, and other \npersonal items as they will be confined to their rooms for more time that in the past. Defendants are \nworking on a plan to have all youth out of their rooms for the 30 hours per week as required by this \nCourt Order.  \n \nThe pilot of the Behavior Intervention Protocol (BIP) started in Krueger Skills Development \nProgram (SDP) on February 14, 2022. This protocol is a DBT mechanism for addressing high-\nlevel life threatening and therapy destroying behaviors. Behaviors that will result in a youth’s \nplacement on the protocol will include  physical assault, sexual assault, orchestrating violence \nagainst another person, destruction of property that poses a reasonable risk to self or others, \nrunning around the facility for longer than five minutes that requires a movement freeze. The \nintervention plan for youth is outlined in the eight (8) steps below and is designed to provide the \nintensive mental health services that our youth need in order to safely return to general population \nfollowing a significant behavioral incident/issue. \nThe Behavior Intervention Protocol consists of eight steps:  \n1.  Safety is Established. Often this step will be completed when a youth is on AC, but there \nmay be situations where the BIP is used when AC is not appropriate.  \n2.  Youth Programming moves to a 1 on 1 structure.   Youth will be required to participate \nin all of their responsibilities (i.e. school and skills group) but these activities may occur in \nan alternate location.  Youth will not be eligible for privilege activities during this time. \nThis one-on-one structure continues while the youth is on the BIP.  \n3.  Youth is encouraged to re-commit to safe and skillful behavior. This step may often \nalign with a youth’s removal from AC.  \n4.  Behavior Chain Analysis of the problem behavior is completed. A youth can start \nworking on this at any time and will be provided a BIP packet with skill-based resources \nwhen they are placed on AC. Youth will complete and review the BCA with the PSU or \nSYC assigned to the SDP, other staff may also assist.  \n5.  Skills are identified for use in future situations. \n6.  Youth demonstrates or begins to learn skills. SYCs and PSU, along with other staff, will \nbe working with youth during this time to role play, provide skill practice, and work \nthrough hypothetical situations with the youth.  \n7.  Youth makes effort to repair damage done. i.e.:  apology letters, extra duties, cleaning \nup messes made, etc.  \n8.  Youth returns to standard milieu/unit operations and privileges. Upon completion of \nthe BIP requirements, the youth will be returned to the regular unit structure. Their \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 7 of 33\n \nprivileges will be restored, and they will receive back their property items. The Growth \nTeam will convene as soon as reasonably possible to ensure that all requirements have been \nmet and will remove the youth from PAUSE at this time.  \nThe protocol also requires that youth participate in all of their responsibilities which includes \neducation and group. Although educational alternative materials across core subjects of English \nLanguage Arts, Science, Social Studies, and Math have been provided to youth, there needs to be \nmore engagement while on BIP. Defendants have made program changes after discussions with \nthe Monitor, but a deeper analysis needs to continue and other tweaks to the program especially \nwhile youth are being operationally confined. Educational consultants spent considerable time on \nthe unit and will make recommendations to education while youth are in this program.  \nThe BIP pilot committee also met with DBT consultant Dr. Chapin on March 30, 2022, to discuss \nother general observations and opportunities to make adjustments that may maximize support \nduring the pilot. The detailed BIP data has been intended to guide discussion and communication \naround program and process improvements. For example, the BIP committee discussed the \nopportunity to utilize the PAUSE structure with Growth Team follow-up versus BIP pending the \ncontext of the behaviors and the needed intervention strategies. The process has also been updated \nto ensure that the individual BIP packets are saved electronically to offer providers context in \ndeveloping  intervention  strategies  to  help  the  youth  troubleshoot,  identify  skill  practice \nopportunities, successfully return to regular programming structure, and resume progress through \nthe System of Care. The Monitor continues to work with the team on suggested adjustments to the \nprogram. Many youths have complained to plaintiffs’ counsel about the BIP, including that they \nare isolated from other youth while on BIP and unable to have any gross motor activity. Youth \nstated to Plaintiffs’ Counsel that they are completely prohibited from interacting with other youth \nat all; that they are either in their rooms or confined in a classroom with at most one staff member; \nand do not get exercise or meals with other youth. They also stated that they are not getting any \neducation beyond tablets and cannot leave the unit for anything but HSU/PSU. \nIn general, youth attitudes were not positive during the last site visit. Based on conversations with \nyouth, they seem very confused on what PAUSE is, how to “get out of BIP,” out of the Krueger or \nWells programs and feel they are being group punished by being confined more frequently and for \nlonger periods (which could be how they are viewing operational confinement).  It is important \nDefendants continually review the program and explain all of the steps so that youth have a clearer \nunderstanding of what their program status is currently. Youth are frustrated, confused as to what \nis going on with their programming, and complained about staff and how they are treated. Staff \nattitudes however were positive despite negative youth attitudes. The Monitor continues to stress \nthe need for more structured and meaningful activities as youth idleness remains a significant \nconcern, particularly on weekends and while staff availability is limited. Defendants are making \nprogress  (detailed  more  below)  but still  have work  to  do.  While Defendants  are  having  to \noperationally confine, there needs to be additional resources available to youth and more in-room \nactivities to engage youth while they are in their room.  \n \nDuring previous site visits, the Monitor has repeatedly and continually recommended creating and \nimplementing a daily schedule to help with youth boredom and create opportunity for structured \nactivities. Youth daily schedules, organized by living units across A and B week rotations, have \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 8 of 33\n \nbeen created and implemented. Evening activities led by recreation staff began on January 10, \n2022, and the full day 8A.M. to 8P.M. weekday and weekend schedule was implemented on March \n14, 2022. It incorporates the school schedule and afternoon/evening and weekend activities \nfacilitated by Youth Engagement Program (YEP) staff. In addition, Health Services Unit and \nPsychological  Services  Unit  continue  to  be  supportive  of  engaging  youth  in  specialized \nprograming which includes health group (LHS) and body image group (CLS). The YEP team \nincludes recreation leaders of the Music Art Initiative (MAI), facilitators of creative arts, cooking, \nand strategy/skill-based games, on-site Chaplin providing Spiritual Services, ITW Coordinator \nproviding cultural programming, and youth counselors providing physical recreation. In addition \nto regular team meetings, the YEP team has convened twice with leadership and CQI programming \nstaff to share ideas, questions, and creative ideas since the start of YEP in 2022. The team affirms \na shared goal to engage youth in positive youth development activities which collectively may \nproduce a safer, healthier environment for the well-being of all youth and staff.  \n \nContinuous  Quality  Improvement  (CQI)  programming  staff  have  been  actively  engaged  in \nsupporting the development of the weekday and weekend full-day schedules as well as the \ndevelopment of communication tools to provide oversight infused into regular program operations. \nThe shift report has been updated to include the schedule across living units and the A/B weekly \nrotations. Communication with SYCs has assisted in engaging their support as well as the \ndevelopment of unit specific schedules and a YEP staff absence calendar to share when unit staff \nwill need to plan for staff directed activities. A YEP Tracker has been implemented to track missed \nassignments across units, as well as excused absences. CQI staff provide a secondary layer of \nreview to share with the Treatment Program Director. Although operational confinement did not \noccur until April (which is outside of this reporting period), it is important to note that the staffing \nchallenges  and  increased  population  make  it  difficult  to  adhere  to  the  weekly  scheduled \nprogramming  and to provide the necessary staff oversight to engage youth in a meaningful way. \nThe Monitor will continue to work with Defendants on creative options for these challenges in \norder to ensure Defendants can continue to improve the behavior management system, improve the \nrewards and incentives, and develop engaging programming that will have a positive impact on the \noverall behavior and atmosphere.  \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately  forty-one  (41)  youth  were  interviewed  during  the  site  visit  (formally  and \ninformally) by the Monitoring team and approximately eighteen (18) youth were interviewed prior \nand during the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel. There were many requests to talk to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel while the Monitor was onsite talking with youth, and counsel followed up on these requests \nduring the site visit and after. \n \nIn the previous site visits, youth did not have many complaints that they expressed to the Monitor. \nDuring this site visit, many youth complained about being confined frequently and even if they had \nnot misbehaved, being denied personal property such as hygiene products and electronics, the food, \nstaff calling them names, using racial and derogatory statements, being bored, group punishment, \nissues with Zoom calls, staff taking away their points for no reason, staff allowing youth to fight and \nnot stepping in, being bored, and the facility not being as clean. During the last site visit, youth had \ngood things to say such as feeling safe, having some good staff that engage with them, and liking the \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 9 of 33\n \nrecreation unit and music program.  In contrast, youth did not make one positive comment during \nthe interviews during this site visit. This is a big concern for the Monitor as youth attitudes have not \nbeen this negative in years. It was also noted that the attitudes of youth towards staff seem to have \nworsened with an increase in overall disrespect. This seems to come from increased operational room \nconfinement, the continued lack of a robust incentives and rewards system, and staff’s interaction \nwith youth.  \n \nYouth did complain to Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to  and during the site visit (during this reporting \nperiod) about how to progress through the levels of programming in Krueger and Wells, BIP, \n“modified programming,” being confined a lot, not feeling safe, not getting adequate or meaningful \neducation, staff being too aggressive in uses of force, staff saying negative and derogatory comments, \nlack of confidentiality when youth tell staff information, inadequate recreation, and inappropriate \nsearches, The Monitor reviewed several use of force videos/mechanical restraint usage and the use \nof force/restraints observed were appropriate. \n \nThe Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more meaningful/structured \nprogramming and activities. It is clear that when staff engage with youth, youth respond positively. \nThe Monitor has witnessed numerous occasions where staff are actively engaged with youth and \nthese opportunities build positive and respectful relationships that help reduce incidents of violence \nand promote a more therapeutic and trusting environment. This is also evident in that when we see \nstaffing shortages and less opportunity for staff engagement with youth and more confinement, we \nalso see increased complaints and increased behavior incidents. The Defendants need to continue to \nfocus on gender and culturally competent programming. However, first Defendants need to \ncontinue developing a plan to safety manage LHS/CLS during this challenging time.  \n \nOn April 8, 2022, the Governor signed legislation that called for roughly $42 million to build a \nnew Type 1 juvenile correctional facility in Milwaukee County. This is a step towards the planned \nclosure of Copper Lake and Lincoln Hills schools. Several more steps in the process remain, \nincluding some that will require significant preparation and/or approvals from other state and local \nagencies. While the signing of the legislation represents a step forward, the completion of a new \nType 1 facility and the subsequent closure of CLS/LHS will still take considerable time. As \npreviously mentioned, moving youth closer to locations where needed, culturally and gender \ncompetent programs and services are more widely available, and where family visits can be more \neasily accessible, will have a positive impact on youth and will allow for a larger pool of applicants \nto fill critical roles.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nFor the first time, the Monitor observed firsthand the lack of available staff at LHS/CLS. LHS/CLS \nis in a staffing crisis. Staffing shortages have increased over this reporting period at LHS/CLS and \nacross DOC. DJC knows that its staff are the best assets towards making the programs and \ninitiatives underway in the schools and living units a success, and importantly, that staffing \nshortages increase the burden on those who work to maintain a safe and healthy environment for \nyouth and staff. Defendants are working diligently to try to attract and retain staff for these critical \nroles.  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 10 of 33\n \nDirect-care staffing vacancy percentage has increased slightly from the last reporting period (see \nbelow). There are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS. Approximately 138 of these positions \nare “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”). The teacher \nvacancy rate is the same than last reporting period (11 vacancies), or 48% of positions. There is \nstill a high number of social worker vacancies at 67%. This is a critical role that should be made a \nrecruiting priority. The Monitor encourages continuing to recruit teachers despite the reduced \npopulation and challenges with COVID-19. Recruiting is still a challenge due to the location of \nthe  facility,  overall  teacher  shortages,  relatively  low  compensation,  location  of  LHS/CLS, \nuncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS will close, and the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring \nneeds to continue.  Even with the added incentives, there is a still difficulty in hiring many \nclassifications of staff. \n \n  \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \n   September 30, 2021  December 31, 2021  March 31, 2022 \n       \n  Youth   30% (41 out of 115)  41% (44 out of 108)  41% (44 out of 108) \n \nCounselor \n \nYouth  19% (7 out of 37.5)  17 % (5 out of 30)  20% (6 out of 30) \n  Counselor \nAdv. \n  Teacher  40% (10 out of 25)  48% (11 out of 23)  48% (11 out of 23) \nSocial Worker  57% (8 out of 14)  67% (8 out of 12)  67% (8 out of 12) \n \nDuring the reporting period (January-March) staffing was challenging but not insurmountable, \nHowever, beginning in April as the youth population increased, staff shortages (much due to \nvarious employee leaves) increased. Defendants are going to have to consider some non-traditional \nstaffing options in order safely maintain the facility. This will most certainly include operational \nadjustments that limit the number of youths out at any given time to ensure proper staffing ratios, \nthus increasing operational room confinement. Youth do not understand the different types of \nconfinements. From the youths’ perspective, it does not matter whether or not it is operational – \nthey are being confined to their rooms for long periods of time, even when they have not \nmisbehaved. This will make youth more upset/oppositional. The Monitor will continue to work \nwith Defendants on this and other issues.  \nIn light of the high vacancy rates in security positions, and number of supervisory staff that are \nbeing required to fill in for vacant non-supervisory posts or required to take additional supervisory \nshifts due to vacancies, the DJC, with the approval of the Office of the Secretary, are authorizing \novertime for employees in positions classified as Supervising Officer 1 or 2, or Supervising Youth \nCounselor 1 or 2, to be paid at time and one-half (1.5x) under the following conditions: \n•  The supervisor is working additional hours for shift coverage in the following DAI or DJC \npositions:  Supervising Officer 1, Supervision officer 2, Officer, Sergeant, Supervising YC \n1, Supervision YC 2, Youth Counselor, Youth Counselor – Adv.  Additional hours for non-\n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 11 of 33\n \nshift coverage purposes (i.e., pre-shift, writing reports, etc.), will continue to be paid at the \nstraight time rate. \n•  The supervisor worked more than 40 hours in the week and the extra hours that qualify at \nthe 1.5x meet the first bullet point above. \n•  Subordinate staff are being required to work overtime due to vacancies and are receiving \ntime and a half for over 40 hours worked. \nThe Human Resources Department at CLS/LHS, along with provisions approved in the state \ncompensation  plan,  have  worked  in  combination  to  introduce  new  policies,  strategies,  and \ninitiatives intended to drive both recruitment and retention.  \nThe Human Resource Department has been actively attending three job fairs during the reporting \nperiod: one general recruitment fair, one geared toward healthcare, and one aimed at mental health \nprofessionals. Staff are scheduled to attend an additional six area job fairs in April and May. \nFinally, walk-in interviews at local job centers will be available. Walk-in interviews were held \nprior to COVID and are returning as local ordinances and mandates allow. \nOn January 2, 2022, a $2.00 per hour add-on that was approved as part of the 2021-2023 state \ncompensation plan for safety staff at CLS/LHS went into effect for youth counselors and youth \ncounselors advanced. On March 11, 2022, DOC/DJC announced to all staff that the Governor had \napproved a $3.00 per hour add-on for security staff at 24/7 facilities including Correctional \nOfficers and Sergeants, Youth Counselors and Youth Counselors-Advanced, Supervising Officer \nand Supervising Youth Counselor classes, and Corrections Program Supervisors. In addition, \nCorrections Program Supervisors and Supervising Youth Counselors 1 & 2 received parity pay in \nthe amount of $0.90-an-hour.  \nIn February 2022 DOC/DJC began to offer a $1,500 referral bonus to current employees working \nat 24/7 correctional facilities who refer candidates for hire. In developing this Referral Bonus \nProgram, DOC/DJC focused on classifications that have been determined to have a higher vacancy \nrate, or retention or recruitment difficulties. The new hire needs to be hired into one of the \nfollowing classifications: \n•  Advanced Practice Nurse Prescriber \n•  Nurse Clinician 2/2-Weekend, NC 3/3-Weekend, NC 4 \n•  Licensed Practical Nurse \n•  Nursing Assistant \n•  Nursing Supervisor \n•  Psychological Associate \n•  Psychologist – Licensed \n•  Psychologist Supervisor \n•  Treatment Specialist 1 & 2 \n•  Social Worker – Corrections & Senior \n•  Teacher \n•  Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Adv. \n•  Correctional Officer \n•  Correctional Sergeant \n \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 12 of 33\n \nIn addition to the referral bonus opportunity, a $2,000 sign-on bonus is currently being offered to \neligible employees who meet the requirements after being hired into the following classifications: \nTeacher, Social Worker & Social Worker Senior, Treatment Specialist 1 & 2. Recruitment efforts \nmentioned above led to three (3) teachers and (2) treatment specialists in the month of April.  \nDefendants are making these significant changes in order to help with staffing shortages, but these \nefforts are not solving this ongoing problem.  \nKey Positions hired during this reporting period (January-March) are as follows:  \n•  Recreation Leaders (2) \n•  Corrections Program Supervisors (1) \n•  Psychology Associate \n•   \nThe Defendants continue to struggle to hire licensed/certified social workers. The DOC has \nrecently raised the minimum pay for social workers; however, this has not increased the applicant \npool. Many social service agencies have moved towards hiring case managers that do not require \na state certification/license. LHS/CLS is moving in this direction due to their inability to recruit \nand  retain  social  workers.  Moving  forward,  Defendants  will  be  hiring  several  Treatment \nSpecialists. The goal is to have two Treatment Specialists 2’s and/or Social Workers assigned to \nevery living unit. These individuals will be responsible for all case management needs and services \nfor the youth in their units and will also facilitate all Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Groups \nfor the youth on their units. Defendants are also starting the process to hire Treatment Specialist \n1’s that will work mid-shift, evening, and weekend hours. They will be responsible for leading \ngroups with the youth in the evenings, completing daily Diary Cards with youth, in alignment with \nDBT, and will be involved in helping with BIP’s.  \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over twenty-five (25) staff. Staff morale seemed good overall \ndespite the obvious shortages at the time of the site visit. A review of video over the reporting \nperiod showed staff regularly engaging with youth. Several staff were extremely friendly and \nengaged and stated that they liked their jobs. Most staff seemed to feel as if the overall atmosphere \nwas improving, but that they continue to have no control or adequate consequences for youth \nbehaviors. Staff feel that the behavior management program is not working and lack incentives \nand consequences to promote positive behaviors. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to \nseveral mental health staff and they were very knowledgeable about the various programming and \nknew the youth and expressed how much they liked working with the youth.  It was very nice to \nsee such optimism from the staff.   The continued implementation of DBT and other best practices \nwill improve safety for staff and youth.  \nDefendants continue to work on increasing staff morale but still have much more work to do. This \nis even more critical during a time where there is not enough staff and staff are getting mandated \nregularly. Defendants have done the following to increase staff morale during this reporting period: \n \n(1) Defendants have developed the CLS/LHS Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT). The \ngoal of the CIRT is to provide peer to peer support regarding secondary trauma and critical \nincidents that occur within the facilities. The CIRT team is committed to providing \ninformation and education, reducing stress and compassion fatigue, and fostering resilience \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 13 of 33\n \nwithin peers and the work environment.  \nThe CIRT employs a comprehensive, systematic, and multicomponent approach to crisis \nintervention in order to mediate stress reactions associated with critical incidents. Since the \nCIRT Coordinator started, the facility has trained 19 staff, and three more were making \ntheir way through the training as of this reporting period.  \nThe CIRT conducted three critical incident debriefings during the reporting period and are \nusing the experience from conducting the first three to inform bi-weekly meetings that will \nwork through getting the policy and procedure for the CIRT drafted and finalized.  \n \n(2) CASH \nThe Committee Assigned to Safety and Health (CASH) holds numerous events every \nmonth hosted on behalf of the staff. This reporting period there was:  \n \n•  January 13, 2022, National Rubber Ducky Day Prize Drawing \n•  February 2, 2022, Baker’s for Brian \n•  February 9, 2022, Coffee Break Day \n•  February 15, 2022, Wisconsin Day    \n•  February 16, 2022, Treats for Teammates  \n•  March 17, 2022, St. Patrick’s Day \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information. A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible. \nFear for safety continues to be a major concern and one that impacts the overall culture and \natmosphere of the facility. Staff wellness, including training, skills development, attitudes, etc., \nimpact the overall relationship and level of positive engagement between staff and youth. When \nthis is not occurring as expected, it then has a direct impact on an increase in incidents of violence, \nuse of confinement, and use of restraints. Improving staff wellness will certainly have a positive \nimpact on the overall atmosphere and reduce turnover, which will then provide an opportunity to \ndecrease the vacancy rate, reduce employee leaves and improve staffing ratios. \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nDuring the last reporting period, CLS/LHS hired a Program and Policy Analyst-Advanced focused \non the ongoing Quality Assurance (“QA”) implementation efforts surrounding the consent decree \nand other important functions in the school and facility system of care updates.  \nSince October, the QA staff has worked to create a database that allows speedy retrieval and \nanalysis of J- Tracker data. The database’s ability to assist incident debrief analysis has given \nmanagement staff reviewing incidents more consistently accurate and timely reports. Critical \ninformation is now readily available to the leadership which so that they can make proactive, data \ndriven decisions that increases the safety of youth and staff.  Again, tremendous improvements \nhave been made in data collection and in the quality assurance program. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 14 of 33\n \nPolicies and Procedures/Administrative Code Update \nThe  mechanical  restraints  procedure  was  signed  effective  April  4,  2022.  This  procedure \naccompanies all the work to convert the use of force form into J-Tracker and will give the \nprocedural backing  to the  operational  process, documentation,  and quality assurance pieces \nbracketing our efforts to demonstrate, document, and maintain compliance with the mechanical \nrestraint provisions in the consent decree. \n \nThe DJC Policy Committee also continues to review and update policies of note to the facility. In \nthe February meeting the committee reviewed the following policies: \n300.01.04 – Administrative Duty Officer  \n300.07.01 – Health Safety Committee \n \nA group of policies reviewed in previous months by the committee were signed by administration \nand posted to the staff website in March. These included:  \n100.04.04 – Youth Identification  \n100.04.06 – Naloxone \n300.02.11 – Food Service Standards  \n300.05.03 – Transportation  \n300.11.04 – Telephone Use  \n500.30.35 – Optometry Services \n900.05.06 – Incident Debrief \n \nDefendants also look forward to the addition of a new Program and Policy Analyst, who will fill \nthe vacancy that was left last December in the PbS position at the end of April. This new analyst \nwill assist with PbS and will be an addition to the policy committee. This will be extremely \nbeneficial to ensure coinciding facility procedures to passed policies are reviewed and signed by \nthe superintendent. They will also be a key person in assisting in the completion of other facility \nprocedures being drafted for new practices in regard to the system of care and the compliance of \nthe consent decree.  \n \nOther policy projects include a systematic review of all divisional policies and facility procedures \nas the documents themselves are moved into an OnBase software system that will ensure all staff \nare accessing and reading DJC policies and procedures. The system will also help track policy \nacknowledgments, assisting with the coaching, training, and follow up components of the facilities \nquality assurance framework.  \n \nWhile transferring the documents the policies are under review for updates and sign off from the \ncurrent DJC administration. This process includes looking more closely  at the policies that \nreference administrative code 373 and 376 to ensure that they are reviewed to match the changes \nupdated in code. In addition, the committee is identifying policies that should reference one or \nmore relevant administrative codes or other guidance documents moving forward. This project as \na whole will result in revised and up to date policies and procedures, uniform and easier access to \npolicy documents for staff, and automated documentation for staff policy acknowledgment.    \n  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 15 of 33\n \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and \nDOC Chapter 373 forward. Chapter 373 was reviewed by DOC attorneys in the Office of Legal \nCounsel in March and is now back with DJC’s Administrative Code committee for further \nrevisions. Chapter 376 final draft has been completed by the committee and sent to Office of Legal \nCounsel and Division of Management Services to complete the fiscal estimate and economic \nimpact analysis before the submission of the proposed rule draft.  \nWhen considering the projected timelines for moving Wisconsin Administrative Code revisions \nthrough the rulemaking process, DJC’s advancement of both DOC Chapter 373 and DOC Chapter \n376 during the reporting period represents significant progress moving these two Chapters, most \ndirectly implicated by the consent decree, to having the amendments adopted.   Defendants need \nto continue to aggressively work towards completing the respective Administrative Code sections. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nyouth are being confined for seven days for any reason.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nmost youth are being confined for three days for any reason. \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants need to continue to re-\nexamine the use of observation status, administrative confinement, operational confinement \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 16 of 33\n \nand review incidents to ensure that staff are not using this as a form of punitive confinement. \nThe  Monitor  previously  recommended  establishing  clear  criteria  for  administrative \nconfinement so that staff cannot punitively confine youth and cannot confine youth for more \nthan 24 hours if they do not pose an imminent danger of harm to themselves. The Defendants \nhave made significant improvement in this area, but it needs to be continually reviewed to \nensure compliance with this Court Order.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement  may only be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of AC was lower for both \nCLS and LHS youth this reporting period. There were five (5) youths confined over four (4) \nhours in this reporting period. The Monitor reviewed documentation of “intensive mental \nhealth services” provided to youth in confinement. The Monitor also observed mental health \nservices being provided to a youth on AC. Defendants need to continue to assess how they \ncan more effectively provide intensive mental health services for youth \n.\n \nSeptember 2021 \nCLS: 31 uses of A.C. Average 108 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 49 uses of A.C. Average of 187 minutes. Six (6) youth over four hours.  \n \nOctober 2021 \nCLS: 45 uses of A.C. Average 147 minutes. Three (3) youth over four hours. \nLHS: 37 uses of A.C. Average of 136 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n         \nNovember 2021 \nCLS: 32 uses of A.C. Average 157 minutes.

No youth over four hours. \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 17 of 33\n \nLHS: 20 uses of A.C. Average of 163 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nJanuary 2022 \nCLS: 25 uses of A.C. Average 124 minutes. Three (3) youth over four hours. \nLHS: 21 uses of A.C. Average of 170 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours.  \n \nFebruary 2022 \nCLS: 15 uses of A.C. Average 139 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 19  uses of A.C. Average of 138 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n \nMarch 2022 \nCLS: 17 uses of A.C. Average 132 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 59 uses of A.C. Average of 138 minutes. One (1) youth over four hours.  \n \n  \nThe Monitor was able to able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was \nreadily available during this site visit. 99.29% of checks were completed within 30 \nminutes.  The  Monitor  reviewed  video  footage  for  random  days  and  times  and \nDefendants were 100% compliance with completing the checks in accordance to \npolicy. Staff did an outstanding job and should be commended for their diligence in \nensuring youth safety while in their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \npose a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were five (5) youth confined \nfor over four (4) hours during this reporting period (see response in previous question). All \nextended confinements were recommended by PSU.  \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring any form of room \nconfinement is compliant with this Court Order, draft policy, and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  was  one  (1)  transfer \n(January)  as  a  result  of  extended  placement  in  administrative  confinement.  After \nconsultation with PSU, it was determined that the youth would transfer to MJTC. As a result, \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 18 of 33\n \nthe youth was maintained on AC status pending transfer to MJTC. \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.  \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced   plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one instance in which a \nyouth was confined for over 24 hours.  \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24  is  being  utilized. The plans developed are  very detailed and comprehensive. \nDiscussion  and  clarification  have  occurred  surrounding  observation  status  during  this \nreporting period. Currently, only youth who are in imminent risk of serious self-harm to \nthemselves/risk of self-harm will be placed in observation status. The Monitor will continue \nto review and monitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As previously stated, the Monitor \nwould not deem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety \nand security measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make \nthe rooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed on renovated units.  \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 19 of 33\n \nYouth rooms were messier than the previous site visit. In previous reports, the Monitor \nnoted that many rooms had several blankets, sheets, and other items that could pose a \nsafety risk due to the volume of items in the rooms and inability to see the beds, floors, \nand  desks.  The  Defendants  issued  a  directive  in  February  and  have  made  great \nimprovements in this area and changed how property is dispersed to youth in order to \nminimize safety risks.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants are very close to substantial \ncompliance.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. Defendants have \nimproved  their  documentation  and  data  collection.  However,  youth  did  complain  to \nPlaintiff’s counsel about only getting the basic hygiene products. \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin  room  confinement,  staff  shall  engage  in  crisis  intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible. PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification. The crisis intervention technique \nis being documented. Clinicians are on-site for a minimum of 6 hours each Saturday and \nSunday and the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth. The Defendants \nhave hired new PSU staff (in April 2022) and are working on expanding on-site treatment \ntime on weekends. The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the hours in which \nthey are physically present on weekends and evening hours in order to engage youth in a \nmeaningful way during this time.  As stated in the narrative, several PSU staff were present \non the units working with youth. Additionally, the staff that the Monitor spoke to were very \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 20 of 33\n \npassionate about their work.  \n \nDefendants are continually overhauling the system of care and DBT based treatment model. \nDefendants continue to engage the DBT consultant. Treatment is going to be even more \ncritical  as  the  population  continues  to  increase  and  the  Defendants  are  having  to \noperationally confine.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental  \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE. Documentation/data  shows  that \nevaluations are completed and within 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. \nThere was one instance of contraindication documented during this review period. QA needs \nto be implemented and sustained.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose. Staff who fail to make such checks or who \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff  is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants are over 99% compliant \nwith meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe. Quality assurance \nmeasures are in place and when necessary, formal investigations occur. There  was no \ndiscipline given to staff for not completing safety/security checks per policy during this \nreporting  period.  Defendants  focused  on  communication,  accountability,  and  quality \nassurance which has led to substantial compliance as it relates to room checks (part of this \nprovision).  The  Monitor  observed  safety/wellness  checks  being  completed  on  various \ndays/times during this reporting period and observed no instances in which staff did not \nmake visual contact with youth.  \n \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 21 of 33\n \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time on evenings and weekends. Examples of \nthe crisis intervention techniques used with youth when confined can be viewed/verified in \nthe PSU On-Call and/or PSU Clinician notation box on the J-Tracker Incident Debrief \ncustom form. Examples of crisis intervention techniques include but are not limited to: \nvalidation, practice of DBT skills, processing of the incident, mediation, assistance problem-\nsolving, fostering perspective-taking, Behavior Chain Analysis (formal and informal), plans \nto address conflict/safety/skills practice, in the moment coaching skills, time away from \nstressors, body scans, mindfulness, increase insight, encourage self-reflection. The Monitor \nhas reviewed these documents.  \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did make complaints about \nproperty restrictions while in the SDP. Staff confirmed that there are property restrictions \nfor youth while they are in the SDPs. This is an area that Defendants need to re-examine. \nThere were also property restrictions applied by PSU for safety reasons.  \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general. The primary clinician consults \nwith the on-call clinician and with the SYC/YC/CPS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the \nyouth plan addresses the issues at hand and how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. \nA PSU clinician follows up in the absence of the primary clinician and/or the crisis clinician. \nPSU collaborates with the SYC and direct staff. The social worker and youths’ meeting \nschedules are individualized. The social worker works with the youth to identify availability \nif an AC placement occurs during regularly scheduled meeting. The vacancy rate for social \nworkers continues to be high and should be a priority in hiring. Social workers are critical \nto quality of care and services for the youth and effective re-entry planning.  \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 22 of 33\n \nDocumentation, quality assurance, and policy and procedure need to be improved/completed \nas it relates to social work, mental health, and other health services. Defendants need to \nensure there is accountability with respect to the services provided by the social workers, \nmental and healthcare workers.  \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. During the pandemic, Defendants \nmoved to smaller group-based treatment to youth where group participation was provided \non the units. This continues. Treatment programming for youth never ceased due to COVID-\n19 precautions, but the size of the groups was modified to accommodate safe social distancing \nmeasures and keep youth who shared a living unit assignment in groups with one another. \nBeginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group treatment \nsessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule. The  Monitor \ncontinues to encourage these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as possible. \n   \nDefendants need  to  continue  to  focus  (document  and  QA)  on providing  rehabilitative \nprogramming that was scheduled/in process before placement in room confinement. Youth \ncomplained to Plaintiffs’ counsel that school closures were affecting their ability to progress \nthrough the stages. Defendants need to ensure that any missed/rescheduled treatment groups \ndo not negatively impact a youth’s progress. \n \n  \niii.         Educational services with the general population  to the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices. Defendants shall ensure special education services \nfor all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Classes occur in the school building \nexcept for SDP youth (Krueger & Wells) on Steps 1 and 2, youth in medical isolation, youth \nwho are in 5- or 10-minute observation status, or AC.  \n \nThe education consultants completed their site visit and are preparing their report which \nwill include recommendations. The Monitor will update the Court once the report has been \nreviewed.  \n \nThe  Monitor  continues  to  suggest  that  Defendants  should  provide  more  art,  music, \nwoodworking, the greenhouse, welding, and sewing and other types of programs to youth in \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 23 of 33\n \nthe evening and on weekends Also, it would be ideal for social workers to work with youth \n.\noutside of the school day in order to have less scheduling issues and would help with any idle \ntime after school. The Defendants should continue to focus on bringing more programming \ninto LHS/CLS, especially culturally and gender relevant programs. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. In general, youth are out of their \nrooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. However, youth in operational confinement, isolation due to \nCovid-19 safety measures, any confinement required, and youth working on the BIP do \nnot/are not permitted to talk to peers or participate in regular social interaction. Additionally, \nthey do not go to the school area for education (unless on level 3 of the behavior modification \nprogram). The Monitor regularly saw youth conversing with other youth during out time \nwhen the youth were on the units in the day room.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were four (4) documented \ninstances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on substantial \nthreat of physical harm during this reporting period. Defendants are able to track when \nyouth eat meals in room and based on reports that the Monitor reviewed, the instances were \njustified as the youth posed an immediate and substantial threat. Youth did complain about \nhaving to eat meals in their rooms during this site visit.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Logs  indicate  that  youth  on \nadministrative confinement received at least 3 hours of “out time” per day or 30 hours per \nweek during this reporting period. The Monitor will note that during the next reporting \nperiod (April, May, and June) Defendants will not meet the 30-hour weekly out time \nrequirement for part of the reporting period because they are operationally confining youth \nin at least some units. Defendants did indicate they are working on a plan to meet the 30-\nhour requirement for all youth even when operationally confining.   \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 24 of 33\n \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals. Within one hour of a youth's placement in \nroom confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is a box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth of his or her rights regarding \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. Youth continue to receive their notification \nof rights/grievance procedures when they are placed in administrative confinement The \n.\nprocess for obtaining a youth signature (or two staff signatures in the event of a refusal) has \nbeen proposed as a part of youth receiving PSU thinking chain reports during the first stage \nof the administrative confinement process. Policy has been completed. Defendants are close \nto being in substantial compliance. \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth is placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \nconsistently, including when less restrictive means were attempted. Documentation, data \ncollection and reliability, and quality assurance (with video review) needs to continue but \nhas significantly improved. Also, documentation needs to be created that prove a youth was \npromptly provided with the report upon the completion of room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan. Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 25 of 33\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  \nThe Monitor did not personally see any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, yet \ndata and documentation show that there was an increase in use of mechanical restraints for \nLHS and a significant decrease in the use of mechanical restraints during this reporting \nperiod for CLS. Also, it is important to note that the only mechanical restraints used during \nthis period were handcuffs. Defendants need to continue focusing on reducing the use of \nmechanical (as well as physical) restraints.  \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Below is the number of mechanical \nrestraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \nOctober 2021:      6 uses \nNovember 2021:    9 uses \nDecember 2021:     2 uses \nJanuary 2022:      3 uses \nFebruary 2022:       6 uses \nMarch 2022:     12 uses  (1- 65 minutes) \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \nOctober 2021:               13 uses \nNovember 2021:             12 uses \nDecember 2021:     0 uses \nJanuary 2022:      5 uses \nFebruary 2022:       6 uses  \nMarch 2022:      4 uses \n \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 26 of 33\n \nIn addition to the Mechanical Restraints policy being signed into practice, DJC worked to \ndigitize its current use of force review forms and incorporate them into J-Tracker in order \nto create efficiency, new sources of data for the facility training supervisor, and most \nimportantly, to implement a strict process for reviewing mechanical restraint use.  \nThe new process for reviewing all physical restraint use includes the requirement that all \nMR cases be reviewed by a member of the Use of Force review committee, all of whom are \ntrained instructors at the facility. In addition to incorporating the old use of force review \nform fields, the new custom form in J-Tracker requires answers to the following questions \nwritten specifically from the language of the consent decree to triple check compliance when \nmechanical restraints are used.  \na.  Were the restraints least restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat \nof physical harm to the youth or others justified?  \nb.  Were restraints removed immediately when the youth regained control and \nwhen the threat of harm or the safety concern had abated? \nc.  If any restraints other than handcuffs were applied, was the determination \nthat the youth posed an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to \nothers justified? \nd.  Were restraints used for punishment or discipline? \ne.  Were any youth restrained to a fixed object? \nf.  Were any youth left not in the presence of staff while in restraints? \ng.  If any restraints application exceeded 45 minutes, was the continued use of \nmechanical restraints approved by the superintendent, security director or \ndesignee,  \nh.  If yes, was it reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter for the same approval?  \ni.  Did the  incident report associated with this use of mechanical  restraints \ncontain  an  adequate  description  of  the  events  leading  up  to  the  use  of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time the \nyouth spent in restraints? \nDefendants should continue to work on reducing the use of mechanical restraints and \ncontinue to monitor.  \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when  ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  no  uses  of  ankle \nrestraints or the wrap during this reporting period.  The only mechanical restraints used \nwere handcuffs. Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, training, and QA \nmeasures and ensure PSU staff order these types of restraints.  \n \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 27 of 33\n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation  has  improved \nrelative to when restraints have been used and the rationale for usage. Defendants have \ncreated quality assurance measures (see response above).  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used. Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Defendants  need  to  continue \nfocusing on reducing the use of mechanical restraints. Defendants need to continue to \nmonitor and assess the use of restraints and duration. The Monitor has not observed  \nmechanical restraints used for punishment/discipline on site visits, review of video, or \ndocumentation reviewed. \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staff have received training in \nphysical  force,  restraints,  and  trained  in  proper  de-escalation.  The  Defendants  are \nincreasing  the  frequency  of  these  trainings  (regular,  informal,  refreshers).  DBT \nimplementation will be very beneficial to youth and staff. Defendants have made DBT a \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 28 of 33\n \npriority and are continuing to train staff and continue working with the DBT consultant. \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living u \nnit. No youth shall be left alone in restraints. Any use of mechanical \nrestraints  in  excess  of  45  minutes  must  be  approved  by  the \nsuperintendent, security director or designee and approved by PSU \nstaff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as possible \nand no later than 2 hours following, PSU staff shall evaluate and \nprovide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) instance of a \nyouth being placed in mechanical restraints over 45 minutes. The appropriate personnel \nauthorized the use of the mechanical restraints. PSU approved and followed up within two \n(2) hours. Defendants have created a QA process for this section. Defendants also need to \nensure therapeutic interventions occur.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented  as  part  of  the  Incident  Debrief  process.  Defendants  need  to  continue \ndeveloping the behavior management program, actively engage with youth, and develop \nengaging and meaningful programming in order to reduce the use of mechanical restraints. \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possess drugs or weapons that could not \nbe discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nin this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been finalized. \nA Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all supervisors to \noutline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under which a strip search \nmay be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search.  \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 29 of 33\n \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause. Less intrusive searches, including using \na metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top \nor other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is conducted, \nunless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth that less \nintrusive  searches,  which  may  include  physical  contact,  would  cause \ngreater trauma to the youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must  ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nduring this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \nconducted this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Training records reviewed \nindicate that all staff have been trained in trauma informed care. There no strip searches \nthis period.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no strip searches \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 30 of 33\n \nduring  this  reporting  period.  Documentation  has  improved.  Policy  and  procedure/QA \ndeveloped. PSU is consulted, and it is documented. \n \n4.       Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants  are focusing on de-\nescalation skills. Staff have been trained in MANDT and other training which includes de-\nescalation skills training. De-escalation training/modeling continues to occur. \n \nThe Monitor observed several instances of de-escalation in review of video footage. Staff are \nmore comfortable utilizing these skills and regularly use these skills in each instance.  \nDefendants should include cultural diversity issues as part of crisis management training \nand  procedures.  Knowing  these  issues  and  how  they  are  communicated  is  critical  to \nsuccessful behavior management.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Programming needs improvement \n(as discussed throughout this report) and idleness—which was already high—is increasing \nwith the staffing crisis. The newly implemented schedule should help but with the staffing \nchallenges, the Defendants might not be able to fully implement the program as planned.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth. Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \nto  further  reduce  youth  idleness  hours.  Increasing  education  hours  and  vocational \nprogramming, including for youth who have obtained a diploma or HSED and who therefore \nhave even fewer activities, especially if on Krueger, can greatly assist in reducing idleness \ntime and provide positive youth development strategies.  \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 31 of 33\n \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018, \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nHowever, as stated more in depth in the narrative section of this report, Defendants are \nexperiencing significant staffing challenges. Defendants have implemented several initiatives \nto increase recruiting and retention however, these initiatives are not resulting in increased \navailable staff to a level that is needed. Additionally, the percentage of staff on various leaves \nis very high which adds to the staffing issues.   As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is \na complex issue that impacts the overall culture, atmosphere, and environment of the facility. \nStaff wellness has a direct impact on the relationship between youth and staff, directly \nimpacts the incidents of violence, use of restraint, reduces employee leave/vacancies, and the \nuse of isolation and confinement.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments  to  administrative  code.  Defendants  will  make  all  reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  DJC’s  Administrative  Code \ncommittee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter 373 \nforward. Chapter 373 was reviewed by DOC attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel in \nMarch and is now back with DJC’s Administrative Code committee for further revisions. \nChapter 376 final draft has been completed by the committee and sent to Office of Legal \nCounsel and Division of Management Services to complete the fiscal estimate and economic \nimpact analysis before the submission of the proposed rule draft. Defendants need to create \nan expedited timeline for finalizing all regulations and submitting them for approval. \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA. Incident review process. Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent. Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 32 of 33\n \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in the \nvast majority of cases. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in majority of cases. \nWhen it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is a corrective action \nplan  developed  but  follow  up  needs  to  occur to  ensure  the plans  are  completed  (QA \ncomponent). Defendants continue to make improvement in the area of quality assurance.   \n            \nB.          Quality assurance. The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout previous  \nreports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and \nto improve the quality of life for youth and staff. Defendants have created an exceptional \nquality assurance program and have made substantial progress in developing daily data to \nreview that will automatically be available in order to make real time operational decisions. \nThe Monitoring team will continue to work with the superintendent to establish performance \ngoals, analyzing data, and creation of corrective action plans. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThere was progress made in several initiatives such as a strong, committed leadership team, the \nquality assurance program improvements, training/implementing DBT, creating and implementing \na weekly programming schedule, incorporating PSU more into daily operations, the creation of the \nnew recreation center, continued in-person education on and off the units, and engaging the \neducational experts to improve the quality and quantity of education. \n \nThe Defendants are seeing an increase in the average daily population level at LHS/CLS. This \nincrease is beginning to impact daily operations significantly. There is an increase of operational \nroom confinement stemming from the population increases and the staffing challenges. While \nthese operational adjustments may be necessary to promote safety for both staff and youth, \nleadership should begin considering other options, external staffing options (with  training), \nworking with partners/courts to reduce the population, analyzing staff leave data, and continuing \nto work on staff morale.  At a minimum, programming, and youth's access to resources while \noperationally confined must increase to occupy them while they are isolated for something that is \nnot related to their behavior. Improving the overall BMP program, to include more meaningful \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 132   Filed: 06/03/22   Page 33 of 33\n \nincentives,  rewards,  and  consequences  will  go  a  long  way  toward  improving  the  overall \nenvironment and promoting a safer, more respectful atmosphere.  Lastly, as the Monitor continues \nto state in reports to the Court, there needs to be a focus on moving youth from LHS/CLS to more \nappropriate setting(s).  \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n33 \n ",

LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n FIFTEENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Fourteenth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on September 9, 2022. The \nMonitor’s  fifteenth  report  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree, \nimplementation  of  recommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and \ncomment on any observations and/or updates since the fourteenth site visit which took place on \nJuly 28 and 29, 2022. \nSITE VISIT \nThe fifteenth site visit by the Monitor took place on October 27, 2022. The Monitor and Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel were onsite for one day and completed necessary interviews and information gathering via \nin-person and virtual meetings prior to, during and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit for the reporting period \nending October 31, 2022 (August, September, and October). Materials included but were not \nlimited to: use of force videos, video footage of units, video of safety and security checks, \nprogramming materials, investigations, PREA investigations, various staff video footage of the \nschool area, video footage of administrative confinement, releases, memos, daily shift reports, \npolicies, all of the monthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order, work rules, meeting \nnotes, employee leave data, behavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint documentation, \nincident reports, and other housing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted approximately \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 2 of 34\n \ntwenty-five (25) youth interviews before and during the site visit.  The Monitor toured LHS/CLS \nand interviewed youth and staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to many of youth and \nstaff present and available during the site visit. Approximately thirty-two youth (32) youth and \ntwenty-five (25) staff were interviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.  \nOVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, CONDITIONS, AND ATMOSPHERE \nIntroduction \n \nThe total LHS/CLS population ranged during this reporting period from 76 - 85 youths. At the \ntime of the site visit, the population was at 78 youth (4 youth off site).  It is important to note that \nthe population level is not trending down in any significant way. This appears to be a trend that \nwill  continue  into  the  foreseeable  future.   While  the  population  is  a  concern,  the  issue  is \ncompounded  by  the  staffing  shortages  that  continues  to  exist  which  results  in  increased \nconfinement of youth for reasons unrelated to their behavior. Staffing has been inconsistent during \nthis reporting period.  There were days where youth did not have to be operationally confined \n(youth confined to their rooms due to inadequate staffing levels not behavior based) but there was \nstill a large percentage of time where units were short staffed, thus requiring program changes.   \n \nStaffing shortages still exist that negatively impacts daily operations, leading to adjustments to the \ndaily  schedules  to  maintain  effective  staffing  ratios  for  youth  supervision  and  resulting  in \noperational room confinement of youth, change in educational settings, overall programming such \nhas youth not being able to have outdoor recreation, music lab, recreation in the gym or the \nDouglass unit, reduced recreation in general, increased idle time, and lack of staff available to be \nCARE team members who are called upon to effectively de-escalate youth in a variety of \nsituations.  Despite these challenges, leadership, staff, and youth overall at LHS/CLS continued to \nremain positive during the site visit. The Monitor continues to be concerned about the effect the \nhigh levels of room confinement are having on youth mental health, staff use of force against \nyouth, education and general wellbeing of youth.  \n \nCOVID screenings were suspended for all of the Department of Corrections during this reporting \nperiod. Staff are responsible for self-screening, monitoring and reporting, as well as staying home \nuntil able to return to work, consistent with current CDC guidelines and recommendations. At the \ntime of the site visit there were two units in quarantine due to COVID-19.  A unit is quarantined \nafter consultation with Health Services Unit (“HSU”) due to a known COVID-19 exposure. \nQuarantined units operate the same as any other non-quarantine unit, with the exception of a \nmovement freeze, which restricts youth movement to other areas of the facility and requires that \nservices be provided to youth on the units to help prevent further potential spread of the virus. \nThere were four (4) LHS youth and eleven (11) staff who tested positive during this reporting \nperiod. \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, school, and many other areas were clean and orderly. Living \nunits and youth rooms in general were much dirtier and messier than on the previous site visit.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 3 of 34\n \nDefendants continue with the following physical plant improvements: \n•  Implemented a fully operational in-house canteen program in coordination with the rollout \nof the facility’s behavior motivation system. The first youth order was processed and \ndelivered the week of September 15, 2022.  \n \n•  Completed installation of the new youth video phone system in youth living units. Video \nphones  are  now  installed  in  all  youth  living  units  for  youth  to  better  access  and \ncommunicate with their families and community. The system is undergoing testing and \nfinalization of privacy settings before it is set to roll out for use by the youth in the coming \nmonth.  \n \n•  Implemented a new system for distributing youth clothing. This applies to youth on all \nunits. Youth receive a clean “roll” each day that includes: underwear, socks, T-shirt, \nsweatshirt, sweatpants, polo, dress pants, towel, washcloth and mesh bag. \n \n•  Installed an updated central media player system that can control content throughout each \nbuilding in the facility for education, programming and youth entertainment purposes. \n \n•  Installed game rooms in each living unit with new Xbox consoles and couch/seating areas \nin each room for youth to use (youth absolutely enjoy these new game rooms). \n \n•  Continued  the  facility  lighting  upgrade  project  throughout  the  facility  by  installing \nupgrades in the school, administration building, and the facilities exterior perimeter. While \ncontinuing to serve as a significant an upgrade to safety on the facilities grounds this \ninitiative has also improved energy efficiency. For the next phase of this project, youth \nroom lighting will be improved. The contract has been awarded, procurement of supplies \nand scheduling installation remains ahead.   \n \n•  Ongoing implementation of additional fixed cameras throughout the facility including both \ninternal and external cameras. With phase one encompassing all inhabited units completed \nin addition to the school and the administration building, facility administration continues \nto procure and install supplementary cameras as opportunities for added coverage are \nidentified.  \n  \n•  Refurbished the sidewalks and renovated the fence apron around Hughes living unit.  \n \n•  Repainted the facility chapel.  \n \n•  Replaced and upgraded facility sewage pumps. \n \n•  SYC uniforms, formerly white, have been replaced with a dark grey color, also CLS/LHS \neagle logo on the chest.  YC/YCA staff uniforms formerly blue, have been replaced with \ngreen and maroon polos with the CLS/LHS eagle logo on the chest.  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 4 of 34\n \nThe Defendants should be commended for their continuing commitment to improve the physical \nplant which improves the daily lives for staff and youth. The staff uniform change is a testament \nto the culture change commitment by leadership.  The Monitor will continue to update the Court \non physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and staff.  \nEducation Observations \nThe physical appearance of the school areas and classrooms were beautiful as usual. Hughes, \nMiller, and King youth were observed in the classrooms. Other units were going to the school area \nlater in the afternoon although Wells (which houses most of the girls), Roosevelt (on COVID \nquarantine), and Krueger units did not have education in the school building. Youth informed the \nMonitor and Plaintiffs’ Counsel that they rarely have education in the school.  Through video \nreview, the Monitor observed youth in the school area eleven (11) out of twenty-six (26) random \nschool days during this reporting period. When short staffing leads to periods of operational \nconfinement, school is then provided on the unit through a combination of direct instruction, \nworkbooks, learning packets, and Edgenuity (an online education program), in which youth do not \nhave access to live in-person instruction and interactions with subject matter teachers are severely \nlimited. Youth complained that they do not like this format and are not learning as well as they \nwere when education took place in the school area and all in-person with teachers present in every \nclass. Several youths also told counsel that the facility is not meeting specific requirements of their \nIEPs. \nAs  mentioned  in  previous  reports,  Defendants  engaged  three  consultants  to  evaluate  the \neducational programming at LHS/CLS. The consultants are national experts and have been \nselected to evaluate key educational areas including:  \n•  Operations  \n•  Curriculum and Instruction  \n•  Academic Assessments  \n•  Special Education  \n•  Human Capital  \n•  Technology Integration  \n•  Transition  \nThe education consultant’s report was finalized and reviewed.  The report indicated similar \nconcerns as those raised by the youth, including education on the units instead of in the school, \noveruse  of  Edgenuity,  and  needed  improvements  to  services  and  resources  for  youth  with \ndisabilities, with reading difficulties, or with other special education needs. Upon receipt of the \nconsultant’s final report, the education department began evaluating the recommendations in order \nto prioritize its components and develop an implementation strategy that ensures compliance \nstandards are met. Recently, the school worked to add language assigning direct oversight of \nspecial education programming into the responsibilities contained within the Teacher Supervisor \nposition description.  \n \nThe school graduated four (4) students during the reporting period, holding the most recent \ngraduation ceremony on October 27, 2022 (day of site visit). Finally, the school staff and other \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 5 of 34\n \nfacility staff members hosted a Halloween themed school celebration day, offering students the \nopportunity to celebrate the holiday while at the same time recognizing the recent contributions of \nboth students and staff to the ongoing efforts at the schools. Hopefully, as staffing levels increase, \nyouth can regularly have education in the school and off the living units.  \nLiving Unit Observations \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit (Krueger, Wells, \nKing, Hughes, Miller, Rogers, Roosevelt, and Douglass (recreation unit)). Overall, the units and \nyouth rooms, halls, living unit area, and bathrooms were much dirtier than during the last visit. \nYouth were respectful when interacting with the Monitor.  \nThe unit populations ranged from three (3) (one CLS unit) to thirteen (13) (LHS) youth.  Defendants \nare trying to have supervisory staff, mental health and other staff regularly come to the units to \nincrease staff presence. There were also new staff doing “on the job” training.  There were some \nunits that were short staffed which led to youth being operationally confined. The Monitor saw staff \nengaging with youth occasionally during this site visit, but staff were also very busy trying to \ncomplete their duties such as meal preparation, movement, safety-welfare checks, counts, and \ncompleting documentation. Due to staff being so busy, the Monitor did not see staff interacting with \nyouth as much as when there are adequate number of staff available and observed on video (more \ndetailed below). However, staff attitudes were just as positive as the last site visit.    \nAll the youth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful and willingly communicated with the \nMonitor but had some complaints (detailed below). The youth made several complaints to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel which are described below. The Monitor had an opportunity to talk to many of the youth \npresent in the day rooms and youth confined to their rooms for a variety of reasons (AC, operational, \nvoluntary, and sick).    \nSince the time onsite for the Monitoring visit is limited, the Monitor always reviews video of the \nliving units on random days and times to get a better idea of what youth and staff do on the units \nand whether staff are positioned near youth and interacting with youth in a positive way.  The \nMonitor reviewed video during the reporting period (random days and times) to view living units, \nschool, outdoor recreation, and other activities.  In every instance (50 video reviews) staff were \nengaged with youth when they were out of their rooms doing a variety of activities such as: \n•  Eating with youth at the tables \n•  Watching television with youth \n•  Playing cards with youth \n•  PSU (including psychologist) were on the units working with youth \n•  Educators were on the units including special education teachers \n•  Growth team meetings  \n•  Groups \n•  Unit staff helping youth with school work \n•  Staff and youth were outside playing ball \n•  Staff and youth were dancing \n•  Youth and staff were in the recreation unit (Douglass) playing table tennis, video games, \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 6 of 34\n \nand other games \n•  Grandparent program visiting taking place \n•  Youth and staff were in the music lab on several days \n•  Youth  were  observed  on  telephones,  arts  and  crafts,  braiding  hair,  dancing,  various \nrecreation, prepping for showers and meals \n•  Youth and staff were cleaning \nOn review of video, staff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables with youth. The \nbody language and tone were positive from staff and youth in general on video. \nDuring this site visit, the CLS youth were housed in the Wells and King Units. There were eleven \n(11) youth total in CLS. CLS units and youth rooms were slightly cleaner than at the last site visit.  \nSeven (7) out of eight (8) youth on Wells were out of their rooms. Youth were on their computers, \ntalking, doing packet education work, and doing diamond art on the unit. One youth, who was in \nprocess of moving to King, was in school. One youth was in operational confinement.  \nThe LHS youth were housed on Krueger, Rogers, Hughes, Miller, and Roosevelt. At the time of \nthe site visit, majority of the units had adequate direct-care staffing.  Krueger unit was dirty and \nrooms messy. Seven (7) youths were in their rooms. Other youth on the unit were just standing \naround talking.   The youth on Rogers were headed out of the unit to go to school.  The unit and \nbathroom were dirty, and rooms overall were messy.  The youth were energetic but polite. The \nHughes unit was calm. Youth were finishing their lunches when the Monitor was on the unit.  \nYouth were sitting at the tables talking. Medicine pass was occurring, and other youth were in the \nvideo game room playing video games.  The Miller unit had (what was thought of at the time) a \nCOVID-19 outbreak, so the unit was on quarantine. Unit was messy, and rooms were a mix of tidy \nand messy. Youth were very chatty and happy. Youth were playing video games, one youth was \nreading in his room, and three youth were cleaning. Roosevelt had the COVID-19 positive youth.  \nThe unit smelled bad and was dirty. Rooms were generally messy. Three youth were out of their \nroom watching television and one youth was sleeping. \n \nThe Krueger and Wells living units operated as the Skills Development Programs (“SDP”) at LHS \nand CLS respectively during this reporting period. The Krueger and Wells units are considered the \n“High Risk” Units. The SDP is modified programming for youth who have engaged in physically \naggressive behavior, have presented a danger to others, and/or exhibited behavior that caused a \nmajor disruption to the facility.  \n \nThe SDP ran on a three-group schedule seven days per week beginning in April 2022, however \nthis was transitioned to two-groups in July. The Krueger and Wells SDP units only have education \non the unit.  \n \nAs previously reported, DBT is provided to youth in the SDP incorporating individualized \nplanning along with the in-person group work already assigned to youth in the SDP so that they \nare engaging in DBT skills and receiving feedback on a daily basis. Youth assigned to the SDP \nhave a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by PSU in order to specifically address their behavior. \nYouth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in conjunction with their \nweekly Growth Team. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 7 of 34\n \n \nThe Defendants have not been able to follow the daily schedule on days with staffing shortages.  \nThere needs to be a focus on creating additional activities for all youth while operationally confined- \neven youth in the SDP. Under the current program, youth in SDP have less access to property in \ntheir rooms than most other youth in the facility. Also, on days when there is adequate staff, \nDefendants need to focus on following a daily schedule that provides for structured and meaningful \nactivities and accountability (off the unit as much as possible) to minimize the incidents of youth \nacting out and ensuring staff are adhering to the schedule absent an emergency.  Defendants also \nneed to continue to focus on the new behavioral motivation system.  In time, the program will heed \npositive results as the Monitor has seen in other jurisdictions.  \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately  thirty-two  (32)  youth  were  interviewed  during  the  site  visit  (formally  and \ninformally) by the Monitor and approximately sixteen (16) youth were interviewed extensively \nprior to and during the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel and several more informally during the tour. \n(Counsel did not go to the units with actual or assumed COVID outbreaks but youth were informed \nthey could set calls with counsel.) \n \nIn general, youth attitudes were as positive during this site visit as previous visits, based on the \nMonitor’s interaction with youth. However, youth only wanted to talk briefly to the Monitor \nbecause they did not want to miss out on their meals, recreation outside, education, telephone calls, \nand video games.   \n \nDuring the last site visit, youth seemed nervous about the new behavior motivation system.  The \nbiggest complaint by far this site visit was the fact that the youth did not like the new behavior \nmotivation system.  The youth also indicated they liked the old system because they could “buy” \nthe things they wanted versus now—where they are required to earn the things that they wanted \nthrough following the rules/being on good behavior and exhibiting pro-social skills.  \n \nThe Monitor was surprised that the youth did not complain to her as much about having to be on \n“split” halls or being bored in their rooms like they did during the last visit.  The Monitor talked to \neach youth who were in their rooms to ask how they felt about being in their rooms and whether \nthey have activities to do.  No one complained to the Monitor, but they did complain regularly to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel during the three months leading to the visit and to some extent during the visit.  \nSo, perhaps the lack of complaining to the Monitor is simply that youth have somewhat accepted \nthat this is the new “normal” with respect to operational confinement due to staffing challenges, not \nthat youth are not adversely affected by the increased confinement. Youth also said that they rarely \ngo down to the school for education and rarely get off from their living units.  Based on the youths’ \nfeedback, the Monitor reviewed video to see if this is in fact the case.  What the Monitor observed \nis inconsistency due to staffing challenges. When there were adequate staffing levels, youth went \nto school, were outside, in music lab, in the recreation unit, and out of their rooms.  However, on \ndays were there was insufficient staff, youth were in fact on the units including education.  There \nwere weeks where there were inadequate staffing levels on six of the seven days, and some with as \nfew as one or two. Staffing is unpredictable due to same-day callouts for a variety of reasons (sick, \nFMLA, Workers’ Comp etc.).   \n \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 8 of 34\n \nIt is important that Defendants continually communicate the new behavior motivation program and \nwhat the expectations are of youth and staff.  Since this is a new program which will take time to \nfully implement with fidelity and consistency. Defendants need to make sure through a rigorous \nquality assurance process that the program is being implemented consistently and in accordance \nwith training, policy, and procedure.  Defendants should continue to include the youth voice for \ninput and development of meaningful incentives and rewards through the youth council.  The \nMonitor believes this new system of care will have a positive impact on the culture of the facility \nand focus on youth’s positive behavior in time.  Although the Monitor saw a lot of positive \ninteractions with youth and staff, the Monitor continues to stress the need for more structured and \nmeaningful activities as youth idleness remains a significant concern, particularly on weekends and \nwhile staff availability is limited and when youth are confined in their rooms. While Defendants \noperationally confine, there needs to be additional resources available to youth and more in-room \nactivities to engage youth- even for youth on Skills Development Program. The significant hiring \nin the youth counselor classifications (described in more detail below), should provide for more \navailable staff which will hopefully result in youth spending more time out of their room, off units, \nand in the school area.  \n \nAs mentioned above, youth complained to Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to and during the site visit (during \nthis reporting period of August-October) about operational confinement (being in their rooms most \nof the day). One youth stated that the confinement was affecting their mental health.  A few youths \ncomplained that their “out time” was impacted by the previous group’s refusal to go in their rooms \nand the time is not made up . Youth in SDP continue to complain about having nothing to do. Youth, \nespecially the girls, complained about staff using force when they did not need to and other \ninappropriate behavior. Youth also reported that refusing to go into their room almost always ends \nup in staff using force against them. Youth in Krueger noted that it is hard to achieve perfect behavior \nto pass through the levels and out of that more restrictive unit, particularly as it feels like staff are \nprovoking or testing them. And, as noted above, youth complained heavily about education provided \nin their rooms or on the unit via packets or Edgenuity. Youth had more varied and detailed \ncomplaints to Plaintiffs’ counsel than to the Monitor while onsite.  \n  \nDuring rounds of the units, the Monitor observed that most youth were in generally good spirits and \nengaged in some type of activity or were on their way to or from their living units for school or \nrecreation.  Even those confined to their rooms were in most cases working on education through \nthe Edgenuity tablets, sleeping (if sick- a few had COVID-19), or were drawing/writing.  The \nMonitor asked those youth who were in their rooms at the time of the site visit if they were bored \nand their response was “no.” One youth showed me the bracelets she made while in her room and a \ncouple other youth showed me the diamond art they were doing while in their rooms.  Several youths \nin CLS stated that they wanted more/better hygiene products. Youth commented that they rarely \nwent to the school area and had restrictions on outside exercise.  Almost all youth complained to the \nMonitor and Plaintiffs’ counsel that they did not like the new behavioral motivation program.  They \ndid not like the fact that they had to earn their privileges based on behavior. The Monitor spoke to a \nyouth who was in AC and he indicated he did see mental health while on AC status. Youth continue \nto ask for additional incentives to have in their rooms to help occupy their time especially youth who \nwere confined to their rooms for much of the day. Youth are only allowed to have Chromebooks \nin their rooms during school hours. Defendants should consider expanding that time to occupy \ntime and for additional learning opportunities.  \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 9 of 34\n \n \nThe Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more meaningful/structured \nprogramming and activities. It is clear that when staff engage with youth, youth respond positively. \nOnly one youth complained about staff to the Monitor during this site visit. The Defendants need to \ncontinue to focus on gender-specific and culturally competent programming. However, first \nDefendants need to continue developing a plan to safely manage LHS/CLS during this challenging \ntime.  \n \nThe Defendants continue to make progress on closing LHS/CLS.  On August 9, 2022, Governor \nEvers announced that the state selected a site and purchased property in Milwaukee for the purpose \nof building a new Type 1 secure juvenile facility. Approval from the City of Milwaukee, and \nnotification to the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance, among others is required.  These \nvarious approval processes still have to happen before the state can seek approval from the State \nBuilding Commission for authority to construct the new facility, a design is finalized, and the \nbuilding project is put out for bids.  \n \nSome of these remaining steps may require months of preparation. As a result, completion of any \nnew Type 1 facility and transition of LHS/CLS to a minimum adult facility will still require \nconsiderable time and planning. As previously mentioned, moving youth closer to locations where \nnecessary cultural- and gender-competent programs and services are more widely available, and \nwhere family visits can be more easily accessible, will have a positive impact on youth and will \nallow for a larger pool of applicants to fill critical roles.  \n \nStaffing  \n \nOn many days, LHS/CLS had staffing shortages during this reporting period. Staff vacancies and \nleaves continue to be high during this reporting period at LHS/CLS and across DOC. Staffing \nshortages increase the burden on those who work to maintain a safe and healthy environment for \nyouth and staff. Defendants are working diligently to try to attract and retain staff for these critical \nroles and have truly created significant incentives for new and existing employees in order to help \nwith attracting new talent and retaining current staff.  \nThe youth counselor staffing vacancy percentage is much lower than the last reporting period (see \nbelow) which is great news.  The new youth counselors will have to finish the requisite training \nthus, this increased staff should have a positive impact at LHS/CLS during the next reporting \nperiod. There are 311 total positions (“FTEs”) at LHS/CLS. Approximately 138 of these positions \nare “direct-care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advanced (“YC/YCA”). The teacher \nvacancy rate is higher than last reporting period (6 vacancies), or 32% of positions which is not \nthe direction the Monitor hoped for.  With limited educators, Defendants will have continued \ndifficulty with increasing the quality and quantity of education for youth. Social worker vacancies \nremain the same, which at 75% is very high. This is a critical role that should be made a recruiting \npriority. Recruiting in general is still a challenge due to the location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as \nto when/if LHS/CLS will close, and for educators, the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring \nneeds to continue.  Even with the added incentives, there is a still difficulty in hiring many \nclassifications of staff. \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 10 of 34\n \n                                                                                                                                                            YCTYCAPoeoooodauuusuvcntint.hht shis eeo e rlnlo o rr   V424a108 c %%% aMn   (((ac461yr4 1oc   Roouhuuta      3 ttot   1eoof,  ff %32  1020 03)2a 8)2s )   of  V422a006c %%%aJn  u(( c(65l4yy  3oo  R3 uuo1tta u  ,oot te2 ffo   0%31f2 0912 ))a0   s8 )o f V223a211Oc%%%acn   t(((oc626by 0 oo e Ruour tuta 3  toot1 efof,    f%122 9980 4))2a  )2s   of \nSocial Worker  67% (8 out of 12)  75% (9 out of 12)  75% (9 out of 12) \n \n \nYouth  understand  operational  confinement  or  “split  halls”  as  they  commonly  referred  to \noperational confinement. From the youths’ perspective though, it does not matter whether or not \nit is operational – they are being confined to their rooms for long periods of time, even when they \nhave not misbehaved. The Monitor and Plaintiffs’ counsel recommended that youth be provided \nadditional things to do while being operationally confined.  Defendants continue to be resistant to \nproviding anything additional to youth on operational confinement while on SDP.  \n \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that a staffing assessment for the direct care positions and \nposts be completed and made suggestions to have other classifications trained like the direct care \npositions in order to meet PREA requirements so that they may be considered full time, direct-care \nstaff and factored into the staffing ratios.  The Monitor will continue to work with Defendants on \nthis and other issues. \n \nBeginning on October 23, 2022, the $5 pilot add-on based on staff vacancy rates will be replaced \nwith a $5 pilot add-on that will continue while CLS/LHS remains in operation as a youth facility.   \nEmployees in the Correctional Officer, Sergeant, Probation and Parole Agent, and Probation and \nParole Agent Senior classifications are eligible for the add-on if they are assigned or volunteer for \nsafety shifts at the facility with from the employee’s supervisor. Correctional Officers, Sergeants, \nProbation and Parole Agents, and Probation and Parole Agent Senior employees who assist with \nsafety shifts at CLS/LHS will also continue to receive the $5 add-on. The continuation of the $5 \nadd-on highlights the importance of staffing the facility in order to safely and successfully work \nwith the youth placed in our care.   \n \nSpecific efforts to recruit staff during this reporting period participated in by the HR staff at the \nfacility included: \n \n•  Rhinelander Job Center Virtual Job Fair \n•  Wausau Job Center Walk-In Interviews \n•  Rhinelander Job Center Walk-In Interviews \n•  CLS/LHS specific Billboard created \n•  UW Stevens Point Job Fair \n•  Lincoln County Fair \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 11 of 34\n \nKey positions hired during the reporting period August 1, 2022 through October 31, 2022: \n \n•  Twenty-one (21) Youth Counselors \n•  Three (3) Supervising Youth Counselor 2 \n•  One (1) Teacher \n•  Juvenile Ed Director \n•  Psychology Associate \n•  Nurse Clinician 2 \n•  Treatment Specialist 2 \n \nThe struggle to hire licensed/certified social workers continues. DJC has not been able to hire a \nsocial worker since 2018. The DOC had raised the minimum pay for social workers, but this has \nnot helped in LHS/CLS garnering any applicants even after the increase.  Many social services \nagencies have moved towards hiring case managers that do not require a state certification/license, \nand unfortunately LHS has also moved in this direction due to the inability to recruit and retain \nsocial workers.   \n \nSince the hiring of the CIRT Coordinator at the end of 2021, that position has worked to \nincorporate the combined efforts of CIRT’s aim with that of the Committee Assigned to Safety \nand Health (CASH) Team. During the current reporting period the CIRT Coordinator position and \nthe CASH committee have served to upgrade services provided to staff, and the staff’s awareness \nof the resources available to them. The CIRT Coordinator and CASH Team continue to advocate \non behalf of staff to engender a shared atmosphere prioritizing employee wellness through a series \nof outreach, meetings, and special staff events.  \n \nOne simple but responsive solution to better facilitate employee wellness events was proposed by \nthe CASH committee and implemented during the reporting period. During past employee events \nstaff in any classification, on any unit, were invited to participate in special events. However, very \noften safety staff, and staff in other classifications working the unit during these events were unable \nto leave their post. Staff consistently voiced that they appreciated the events but would rather be \nable to take time away to eat, congregate, and experience the social benefit of the event itself. Now \nfor special events  involving  these types of gatherings, the CIRT  coordinator  facilitates the \nscheduling of staff willing to rotate through unit coverage to relieve staff to come and participate. \n \nDefendants continue to focus on staff wellness. Below are the employee wellness events occurring \nduring this reporting period: \n \nAugust 8, 2022: Kepro (employee assistance program) sponsored webinar on stress management \ntechniques and active self-care. \n \nAugust 30 & 31, 2022: CASH Team giveback event: Free Ice Cream Sundae Bar for staff.  \n \nSeptember 16 through 30, 2022: CASH Team organized a fitness challenge to spread awareness \nfor suicide prevention and remind staff of their QPR suicide prevention skills. If you see the \nwarning signs, ask the question and save a life. Co-workers challenged each other to see who can \nput on the most miles on their pedometer or put in the most time exercising. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 12 of 34\n \n \nSeptember 27 & 28, 2022: CASH Team giveback event: Free Tailgate and Tacos for staff.  \n \nOctober 12 through 24, 2022: CASH team organized the Change Wars! The participating facility \nmanagement team member that gets the most money donated in their name will wear a hot dog \ncostume to serve staff at the “HalloWeenie” giveback later in October. Donations went to fund a \nlocal charity. \n \nOctober 25 & 26, 2022: CASH Team giveback event: Free “HalloWeenie” hotdogs for staff. \n \nOctober 31, 2022: Treats for Teammates fundraiser hosted by the CASH Team. Treats donated \nby staff, for staff, and sold for just $1 serve as a fundraiser for the CASH Team. Staff treat \nthemselves or designate a co-worker and the CASH team delivers the treats to them on shift. The \nCASH Team also provided whistles and glow sticks in the entryway lobby for staff with little ones \ntrick-or-treating this year. \n \nThe facility management team plans to distribute and collect a survey on a semi-annual basis in \norder to encourage and effectuate meaningful discourse between staff and supervisors. Offering \nthe staff survey on an ongoing basis will grant staff the ability to express their perspective and \nexperience in a forum that management can utilize to implement changes and make progress \ntoward maintaining a healthy and safe work environment for those who work in the facility.   \n \nThe BMS implementation has been responsive to past concerns raised by staff regarding youth \naccountability.  When staff were asked what accountability looks like to them the top answers \nincluded:  effective  consequences;  a  standard/structure;  rewards  for  reinforcement  of  good \nbehavior; youth taking responsibility for their actions or choices; and immediately addressing \nbehaviors. The new BMS system provides effective consequences within a structured system that \nissues the youth a weekly behavior grade. This grade then determines what rights and privileges \nthat youth have for the following week. As long as pro-social behaviors and non-compliant \nbehaviors are identified and recorded the BMS will provide accountability and responsibility for \nthe youth’s actions.  \nThe Monitor spoke to over twenty-five (25) staff. Staff morale seemed good overall at the time of \nthe site visit. A review of video over the reporting period showed staff regularly engaging with \nyouth. Staff were less talkative this site visit due to being busy on units- not because their attitudes \nwere negative.  \n \nDJC has continued to develop the facilities system of care model by developing and implementing \nanother one of its four core components- the behavioral motivation program, which also focuses \non a youth’s progress in their education and treatment plans. This model involves a focus on \npositive youth outcomes and an improved behavior motivation program. As stated in the last \nreport, the goal of the pilot for the new system of care was to develop a team atmosphere amongst \ngroups of living units, consistent post assignments, and to reduce overall ordering. Given current \nstaffing levels it was not possible to match each team with a single unit, so those teams were set \ninto four categories: LHS General Population; LHS Skills Development and Intake; CLS Skills \nDevelopment & General Population; and RRT/Control/School Patrol. Some auxiliary posts such \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 13 of 34\n \nas Care Team, Recreation and Visitation that were evenly distributed to balance out the teams.  \n \nThe LHS General Population units and the CLS/LHS Skills Development units will have two \nprimary YCA’s and four primary YC’s. King & Roosevelt will have four primary YC’s. The Wells \nYCA will become Wells/King. The keys within the RRT/Control group will remain at the time \nthey currently are. Within the General Population team and both the LHS/CLS Skills Development \nteams: \n     \n•  YC’s who are working 0630 - 1830 transitioning to 0800 - 2000.  \n•  YC’s who are working 1830 - 0630 transitioning to 2000 - 0800.  \n•  YC’s who are working 1030 - 2230 transitioning to 0800 – 2000. \n•  YC’s who are working 1430 - 0230 transitioning to 1600 – 0400 mid-shift or 2000 – 0800.  \n•  YCA’s would transition to 0800 – 2000. \n \nThe staff survey showed a strong preference to move towards this new scheduling format and thus, \nthe schedule described above and in the Fourteenth Report to the Court was implemented on \nAugust 1, 2022.  The implementation of the new staff schedule on August 1, 2022 was designed \nwith alleviating staffing concerns and creating a better work environment in mind, but it was also \ntailored to the youth schedule. The scheduled aims to have the most, and the most consistent, \nstaffing during the youth’s normal waking hours. Prior to the change the 12-hour schedule had \nstaff working shifts beginning at 6:30AM and ending at 6:30PM, now the staffing pattern is based \naround the same 8:00AM-8:00PM waking hours built into the youth’s daily schedule.  \n \nThis allows more staff to be on, particularly from 4:00PM to 8:00PM when youth are typically \nback on their units. The shift has also helped to reduce the times that modified programming is \nrequired, particularly in the afternoon when one or more buildings can come off of modified due \nto relief staff arriving at 4:00PM instead of 6:30PM. The new youth counselors hired during the \nreporting period will only serve to bolster the number of staff able to help this scheduling \nadaptation serve the staff and youth alike as the facility moves toward as much consistent normal \nprogramming as staffing can allow.  \nThe Monitor is very supportive of this new system of care once fully implemented.  There is \ndefinitely an adjustment period for youth and staff.  Youth prefer the “old system” because they \ncould buy various privileges instead of having to earn through good behavior.  \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information. A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible. \nImproving staff wellness will certainly have a positive impact on the overall atmosphere and reduce \nturnover, which will then provide an opportunity to decrease the vacancy rate, reduce employee \nleaves and improve staffing ratios. PbS data and survey results will be available in the next Report \nto the Court and the Monitor will be able to assess the effectiveness of all the programming and \nstaffing changes with more objective data.  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 14 of 34\n \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \nThe Program and Policy Analyst-Advanced focused on the ongoing Quality Assurance (“QA”) \nimplementation efforts surrounding the consent decree and other important functions in the school \nand facility system of care updates.  \nDefendants began using the newly digitized use of force review form in May 2022.  The process \nstill  requires  incident  review  for  all  physical  restraint  uses,  but  it  includes  the  additional \nrequirement that any incidents involving the use of mechanical restraints be automatically assigned \nthe additional facility level use of force review. The J-Tracker use of force form retains all relevant \nfields of information from the prior department form, but also includes questions specific to \nmechanical restraints. Finally, it serves as at least a retrospective confirmation/communication \nbetween the reviewer and the youth’s clinician ensuring PSU was either present at the time of the \nincident or responded within the two-hour timeframe when mechanical restraints exceed 45 \nminutes. \n \nCritical information is now readily available to the leadership which so that they can make \nproactive, data driven decisions that increases the safety of youth and staff.  Again, continuous \nimprovements have been made in data collection and in the quality assurance program. \n \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and \nDOC Chapter 373 forward. The committee has completed another round of revisions to the draft \nof Chapter 373.  This included incorporating aspects that coincide with the new Behavioral \nMotivation System’s development  and implementation.  The DJC committee is scheduled to meet \nwith DJC Administration in early November for a final review of the chapter before it is sent for \napproval by the Office of Legal Counsel and subsequently to the Secretary. \n \nThe Chapter 376 final draft has been completed by DJC’s Administrative Code committee, \napproved by the Secretary, and most recently reviewed by the Legislative Reference Bureau \n(LRB). DJC’s administrative rules committee reviewed the LRB’s analysis and recommendations \nduring the reporting period, responded to them, and thus has concluded its internal drafting \nprocess. With the approval of the Office of Legal Counsel the LRB can submit the proposed \nlanguage and the amended Chapter 376 can move to the public commenting period required by \nthe rulemaking process. \n \nThe advancement of both DOC Chapter 373 and 376 during 2022, but particularly during this \nreporting period, marks significant progress moving these two chapters implicated by the consent \ndecree toward publication.  \n \nPolicy and Procedure Update \n \nThe DJC Policy Committee continues to review and update policies of note to the facility.  \n \nIn the August meeting the committee reviewed the following policies:  \n•  100.04.03 - Network Access for Youth in a DJC Facility  \n•  300.05.02 – Equipment Inventory  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 15 of 34\n \n•  300.05.12 – Youth Counts  \n•  300.05.13 – Lockdown  \n \nIn the October meeting the committee reviewed the following policies: \n•  300.02.15 – Youth Property  \n•  300.04.03 – Incentives   \n•  300.05.24 – Internal and External Communications System for Emergencies   \n \nFacility procedures updated and signed during the reporting period include:  \n•  900.02.02 - Damaged Property  \n•  900.02.03 - Closing Youth Accounts Upon Release  \n•  900.02.04 - Collection Safeguarding Disbursing and Reporting of Monies  \n•  900.02.05 - Safety Glasses  \n•  900.02.06 - Inventory Control and Distribution of Uniforms  \n•  900.02.07 - Requisition and Purchase of Supplies and Services  \n•  900.02.08 - School Meals Sold  \n•  900.02.09 - Capital Items Inventory  \n•  900.03.01 - Staff Professional Behavior  \n•  900.03.02 - Timesheets  \n•  900.03.03 - Reporting Unscheduled Absences  \n \nPolicy Database & Acknowledgement Tracking \n \nDefendants  need  to  continue  to  aggressively  work  towards  completing  the  respective \nAdministrative Code sections. The National Institute of Corrections recommends that a central \npoint of access for policies is available to staff. For this reason, hundreds of Division and local \npolicies and procedures that were being stored on the local intranet for employee access, have been \nmigrated into a software system called OnBase for use. \n \nOnBase allows those who manage policies to go through a more efficient process when uploading, \nediting, and rescinding policies and procedures. In turn, it provides employees a tool for policies \nto be to more easily searched and retrieved. Lastly, the OnBase system has a tool where policies \ncan be distributed and assigned to certain employee groups using Document Knowledge Training \nCompliance (DKTC). DKTC will allow those who manage polices a way to assign and track when \npolicies have been read by specific employees. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 16 of 34\n \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data does not indicate that \nyouth are being confined for seven days for any reason.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data indicates one (1) youth \nwas confined for over 3 days but not for punitive reasons.  \n   \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Defendants  need to continue to \nexamine use of all forms of confinement and review incidents to ensure that staff are not \nusing  any  form  of  confinement  as  punitive  confinement.  The  Monitor  previously \nrecommended establishing clear criteria for all confinement so that staff cannot punitively \nconfine youth and cannot confine youth for more than 24 hours if they do not pose an \nimminent danger of harm to themselves. For the first time, the Monitor QA’d whether youth \ncame out of their room for administrative confinement at the time indicated in reports. Out \nof twelve (12) reviews, five (5) matched the report which means seven (7) others did not.  \nAlthough the Monitor cannot tell why the youth did not come out of room, Defendants need \nto make sure that youth are not being kept in their room longer for punitive reasons.  \n \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only  be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to  \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 17 of 34\n \nfollowing circumstances: \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of AC was slightly lower for \nCLS (3 month look back) and almost double for LHS youth this reporting period. One youth \nin LHS was confined for 74.30 hours (over 3 days). There were eleven (11) youths confined \nover four (4) hours in this reporting period. Defendants need to continue to assess how they \ncan more effectively provide intensive mental health services for youth \n.\n \nApril 2022 \nCLS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 160 minutes.

The Monitor reviewed video footage for random days and times \n(115 instances) and  Defendants were 100%  compliance with completing  the checks  in \naccordance to policy. Staff did an outstanding job and should be commended for their \ndiligence in ensuring youth safety while in their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 18 of 34\n \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \npose a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  eleven  (11)  youth \nconfined for over four (4) hours during this reporting period (see response in previous \nquestion). Some extended confinements were not recommended by PSU.  \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall, ensuring any form of room \nconfinement is compliant with this Court Order, draft policy and procedure with AC \nplacement criteria, and continue to QA this data.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Three (3) youth were placed on \nextended placement in administrative confinement pending transfer out of the facility.  One \n(1) youth was pending discharge from facility and two (2) transferred to MJTC.   \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to 8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.  \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Three (3) youth were placed on \nextended placement in administrative confinement pending transfer out of the facility.  One \n(1) youth was pending discharge from facility and two (2) transferred to MJTC.   \n \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 19 of 34\n \nshall amend DJC Pol icy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and shall \ntreat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended policy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC Clinical Observation policy \n500.70.24 is being utilized. The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. Only \nyouth who are in imminent risk of serious self-harm to themselves/risk of self-harm will be \nplaced in observation status. The Monitor will continue to review and monitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor would not deem any \nroom in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety and security \nmeasures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make the rooms \nmore suicide resistant. All youth are housed on renovated units. Youth rooms were not \nclean overall. Rooms were very cluttered in general which poses risks when surface areas \ncannot be easily viewed.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the  Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants continue be close to substantial \ncompliance.  \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor about access to water, regular hygiene supplies, or nighttime toilet usage. Some \nyouth complained to Plaintiffs’ counsel, however. The Monitor reviewed random video \nfootage of living units in evening hours and observed several instances in which youth were \ngiven access to the toilet upon request. Defendants have improved their documentation and \ndata collection.  \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 20 of 34\n \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin room confinement, staff shall engage in challenges intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible. PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation has been improved \nas to who from PSU was notified and time of notification (although there were a few reports \nthat did not contain this information). The challenges intervention technique is being \ndocumented. Clinicians are on-site for a minimum of 6 hours each Saturday and Sunday \nand the majority of this time is spent meeting directly with youth.  There is no change to \nPSU on-site schedule.   The Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the hours in \nwhich they are physically present on weekends and evening hours in order to engage youth \nin a meaningful way during this time.  Because confinement can create or exacerbate mental \nhealth problems, treatment is going to be even more critical as the population continues to \nremain higher if the Defendants are operationally confining. \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental  \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  In  general,  documentation/data \nshows that evaluations are completed (if there is not already a mental health evaluation) \nwithin 24 hours after being placed in room confinement. The Monitor is told youth on \noperational confinement are being seen by PSU and evaluated for contraindication, but the \nMonitor has not seen documentation for youth on operational confinement and whether they \nare evaluated for contraindication.  There were no instances of contraindication documented \nduring this review period. Defendants need to ensure that they are meeting the criteria in \nthis  section  and  document  any  and  all  room  confinement  including  operational  room \nconfinement.  \n \ne.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant \nto  current  policy  at  least  every  30  minutes  in  all  cases,  and \ncontemporaneously record the actual time of such checks in a log \nkept for that purpose. Staff who fail to make such checks or who \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 21 of 34\n \nfalsify such records may be subject discipline. Any youth placed in \nroom confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall receive \ndaily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be \nface-to-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is \npersonally available, in which case it may occur by phone or video \nconferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: Defendants were between 98.62%- \n99.89% compliant with meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check timeframe. \nQuality assurance measures are in place and when necessary, formal investigations occur. \nThere were no formal job instructions for not completing safety and security checks. The \nMonitor observed safety/wellness checks being completed on various days/times on every \nunit during this reporting period and observed no instances in which staff did not make \nvisual contact with youth per policy- 100% of the checks were compliant. \n \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time on evenings and weekends. Examples of \nthe challenges intervention techniques used with youth when confined can be viewed/verified \nin the PSU On-Call and/or PSU Clinician notation box on the J-Tracker Incident Debrief \ncustom form. Examples of challenges intervention techniques include but are not limited to \nvalidation, practice of DBT skills, processing of the incident, mediation, assistance problem-\nsolving, fostering perspective-taking, Behavior Chain Analysis (formal and informal), plans \nto address conflict/safety/skills practice, in the moment coaching skills, time away from \nstressors, body scans, mindfulness, increase insight, encourage self-reflection. The Monitor \nhas reviewed these documents.  When the monitor was reviewing unit activity via video on \nrandom days and time, PSU was observed providing youth with services.   \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \nf.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth continue to complain about \nproperty restrictions while in the SDP. This is an area that Defendants need to re-examine. \nYouth in SDP do not get the same property as youth in general population which is not \nconsistent with this required provision. Additionally, while youth are on operational room \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 22 of 34\n \nconfinement, regardless of level or being on SDP, the Monitor recommends that youth be \nprovided with activities to do that would encourage physical movement in rooms, arts, crafts, \nmusic etc.  \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general.  It is difficult to assess whether \nthese services are being provided while youth are in operational room confinement because \nDefendants do not track operational room confinement time per youth. The Monitor saw \nsocial workers, mental health and health services being provided to youth during the site \nvisit and in random video review. The primary clinician consults with the on-call clinician \nand with the SYC/YC/CPS/SW staff regarding specifics ways the youth plan addresses the \nissues at hand and how it can be adopted when the youth is on AC. A PSU clinician follows \nup in the absence of the primary clinician and/or the challenges clinician. The vacancy rate \nfor social workers continues to be extremely high and vacancy rates remains the same at \n75%. Social workers are critical to quality of care and services for the youth and effective \nre-entry planning.  \nDefendants need to ensure there is accountability with respect to the services provided by \nthe social workers, mental and healthcare workers.  \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants moved to smaller group-\nbased  treatment  to  youth  where  group  participation  was  provided  on  the  units.  This \ncontinues. Beginning in March, some housing units now utilize the school for their group \ntreatment sessions as determined by their respective living unit’s weekly schedule. The \nMonitor continues to encourage these groups to occur off of the living unit as much as \npossible.  \n   \nDefendants  need  to  continue  to  focus  (document  and  QA)  on  providing  rehabilitative \nprogramming  that  was  scheduled/in  process  before  placement  in  room  confinement \nincluding operational confinement. Defendants need to ensure that any missed/rescheduled \ntreatment groups do not negatively impact a youth’s progress. \n \n  \niii.         Educational  services with  the general  population to  the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 23 of 34\n \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices. Defendants shall ensure special education services \nfor all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. When short staffing leads to periods \nof operational confinement school is then provided on the unit through a combination of \ndirect instruction, workbooks, learning packets, and Edgenuity. Youth complained about not \ngoing down to the school area for class and being “stuck” on the units. Through video review, \nthe Monitor observed youth in the school area eleven (11) out of twenty-six (26) random \nschool days during this reporting period which is less than 50% of available school time. \nYouth were on their units utilizing packets or on their computers completing education, which \nyouth consistently noted was considerably more difficult.  Youth did computer and packet-\nbased work alone in their rooms when they were being operationally confined.  Youth told \ncounsel that they could not meaningfully learn because of these actions.  \n \nThe  education  consultants  completed  their  report  which  included  recommendations.  \nDefendants are working on implementing many of the recommendations. There needs to be \nmore instruction by teachers and not self-instruction or instruction on Edgenuity, more \nassistance for students with disabilities or reading problems, and mor education in the school \narea which is more representative of a typical educational setting in the community.  \n \nThe  Monitor  continues  to  suggest  that  Defendants  should  provide  more  art,  music, \nwoodworking, the greenhouse, welding, and sewing and other types of programs to youth in \nthe evening and on weekends The Monitor was happy to see during the site visit and through \n.\nrandom video review that during this reporting period, youth were able to access many of \nthese programs when staffing allowed. The youth expressed how much they like these \nactivities to the Monitor.  The Monitor understands that with the staffing challenges and \nmovement  freezes,  these  types  of  programming  are  difficult  to  continue.  However, \nDefendants need to think of other activities to do while on the unit when it is necessary to \nkeep youth on their units for safety reasons.  This is especially true for youth who are \noperationally confined who have nothing to do for the several hours a day.  Defendants have \nbegun asking youth and staff for ideas of activities while in their rooms.  Defendants provided \nsome of their recommendations such as stress balls and additional art supplies.  However, \nthe Defendants should continue to focus on bringing more programming into LHS/CLS, \nespecially culturally and gender relevant programs. \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 24 of 34\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. When staffing is not an issue, youth \nare regularly out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. However, this is not the case during \nthe  time  Defendants  operationally  confined  youth  due  to  staffing  challenges.  Youth  in \noperational  confinement,  isolation  due  to  Covid-19  safety  measures,  any  confinement \nrequired, and youth working on the BIP do not participate in regular social interaction. \nAdditionally, youth are not going to the school area for education unless staffing levels allow.  \nYouth on SDP do not go the school area for education area period.  Youth did complain about \nnot getting exercise or recreational activities to Plaintiffs’ counsel.  The Monitor regularly \nsaw youth conversing with other youth during out time when the youth were on the units in \nthe day room.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were twenty-two (22) \ndocumented instances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on \nsubstantial threat of physical harm during this reporting period. Defendants are able to \ntrack when youth eat meals in room and based on reports that the Monitor reviewed, it \nappears these instances were justified. \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Due  to  staffing  challenges \n(operational confinement) Defendants admit that there are instances where youth were not \ngetting out three (3) hours per day or thirty (30) hours per week.  Defendants do not track \nthis on an individual basis, so the Monitor cannot determine how many youths are not getting \nat least 3 hours of out-time per day or 30 hours per week.  Defendants are tracking groups \nof youth per unit based on scheduling.  There also were instances in which youth are \ntechnically out of AC but remain in room because it their group’s turn to remain in rooms \nfor operational confinement. This is adding additional confinement time for youth that can \nlead to them getting fewer than 3 hours per day or 30 hours per week of out time. Defendants \nneed to reevaluate and consider allowing the youth out of their rooms once AC is ended.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals. Within one hour of a youth's placement in \nroom confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is  a  box on the incident \ndebriefing form that is checked if staff informed the youth his or her rights regarding \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 25 of 34\n \ngrievances and appeals and time of notification. A few forms did not have the box checked \nthat youth were notified of their right within 15 minutes. During the reporting period the \nquality assurance and policy staff worked to make a series of changes to the DOC forms \nutilized for documenting this provision. In the interim, the DOC-1844 Youth Statement still \nrecords that the youth was informed of their rights to grievance and appeal orally within 15 \nminutes, and on paper within one hour. This provision’s completion is quality assured by \nrequiring the youth’s signature acknowledging receipt of the notifications, or in the event of \nthe youth’s refusal to acknowledge receipt, two staff signatures bearing witness to the youth \nhaving been provided the notification of rights.  \n \nStaff have been working to transition the checkbox denoting that the notification of rights \nwas properly completed, along with the youth’s signature or the signatures of the witness \nupon a youth’s refusal, currently on the DOC-1844 to the DOC-2942 AC Notification of \nRights.  \n \nThe DOC-2942A was developed and moved into J-Tracker operation designed to draw the \nrequired information for the written report directly from the incident debrief form, as soon \nas the SYC overseeing the incident has completed their required fields for a major incident. \nOnce the SYC has completed their required fields, a response assignment can be generated \nby the SYC to the unit staff where the youth on AC is housed. Upon receipt of the response \nassigned, unit staff are then able to generate the DOC-2942A and deliver it to the youth. \n \nThe new process and forms have been drafted into an updated Incident Debrief procedure. \nNext steps will require finalizing the debrief procedure, then reinforcing the notification of \nrights process update while staff work to operationalize delivery of the required written AC \nsummary report to the youth. \n \nYouth who are confined due to staffing issues are not given these notifications of rights.  \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth  is  placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Court  Order  requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \nconsistently except in cases of operational confinement, including when less restrictive \nmeans  were  attempted.  Documentation,  data  collection  and  reliability,  and  quality \nassurance (with video review) needs to continue especially for AC. Also, documentation \nneeds to be created that prove a youth was promptly provided with the report upon the \ncompletion of room confinement including operational room confinement.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 26 of 34\n \n \n1.  OC reduction plan. Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  OC  has  been  completely \neliminated.  \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  The Monitor did not personally \nsee any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit, however, data and documentation \nshow that there was an increase in use of mechanical restraints for both LHS and CLS. \nDefendants need to continue focusing on reducing the use of mechanical (as well as physical) \nrestraints.  \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regains control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Below is the number of mechanical \nrestraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \n \nMarch 2022:                12 uses   \nApril 2022:    17 uses \nMay 2022:      9 uses \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 27 of 34\n \nJun 2022:                         8 uses  \nJuly 2022:    13 uses \nAugust 2022                  10 uses \nSeptember 2022:           11 uses   \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \n \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \n \nMarch 2022:      4 uses \nApril 2022:      2 uses \nMay 2022:    12 uses \nJun 2022:                       15 uses  \nJuly 2022:      6 uses \nAugust 2022                   10 uses \nSeptember 2022:           16 uses  \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \n \n \nDefendants should continue to work on reducing the use of mechanical restraints and \ncontinue to monitor. The total use of mechanical restraints at CLS is roughly equal to the \nuse at LHS although the population is only about one-sixth (1/6) of LHS.   \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  five  (5)  uses  of \nrestraints other than handcuffs (ankle restraints) during this reporting period.  They were \nordered by security staff as youth posed an immediate and substantial threat of physical \nharm to others. PSU did not order the ankle restraints to prevent-self harm. Defendants \nneed to develop policy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  five  (5)  uses  of \nrestraints other than handcuffs (ankle restraints) during this reporting period.  They were \nordered by security staff as youth posed an immediate and substantial threat of physical \nharm to others. Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, training, and QA \nmeasures. \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 28 of 34\n \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used. Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  has  not  observed \nmechanical restraints used for punishment/discipline on site visits, review of video, or \ndocumentation  reviewed.    The  mechanical  restraints  policy  and  a  subsequent  facility \nprocedure was finalized April 4, 2022. The Incident Debrief QA process, and the more recent \nUse of Force Review QA process updates have overlapped to provide QA staff, POSC \ninstructors, and facility administration a triple layered system for scrutinizing all uses of \nmechanical restraints. Defendants are close to reaching substantial compliance. Defendants \nneed to continue focusing on reducing the use of mechanical restraints. Defendants need to \ncontinue to monitor and assess the use of restraints and duration.  \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. All safety staff equipped with \nmechanical restraints are trained specifically in the use of physical force, and restraints, and \non proper de-escalation techniques. Ongoing internal trainings like POSC refreshers are \ndepartment requirements for all safety staff, and that facility has invested to provide \nadditional systems trainings including Mandt and Verbal Judo as examples related to this \nspecific provision.  \n \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 29 of 34\n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living \nunit.  No  youth  shall  be  left  alone  in  restraints.  Any  use  of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were no instances of a youth \nbeing placed in mechanical restraints over 45 minutes. Defendants have created a QA \nprocess for this section. Defendants also need to ensure therapeutic interventions occur.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has been \nadded to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been modified. \nThe length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is now being \ndocumented  as  part  of  the  Incident  Debrief  process.  Defendants  have  developed  the \nbehavior motivation program. Defendants should actively engage with youth and develop \nengaging and meaningful programming in order to reduce the need to use incidents of \nviolence which requires the use of mechanical restraints. \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.  Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possess drugs or weapons that could not \nbe discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) strip search \nin this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been finalized. \nA Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all supervisors to \noutline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under which a strip search \nmay be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search. It was conducted for \nprobable cause of contraband used in self-harm.  Contraband was in fact found. \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause. Less intrusive searches, including using \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 30 of 34\n \na metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top \nor other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is conducted, \nunless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth that less \nintrusive  searches,  which  may  include  physical  contact,  would  cause \ngreater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) strip search \nthis reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized. It \nwas conducted for probable cause of contraband used in self-harm. Contraband was in fact \nfound. \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) strip search \nthis  reporting  period.  It  was  conducted  in  a  private  area.  QA  has  been  developed. \nContraband was in fact found. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) strip search \nduring this reporting period. No youth was near the youth being strip searched.  QA has \nbeen developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) strip search \nconducted this reporting period. The staff conducting the strip search was the same gender. \nQA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) strip search \nthis period the staff conducting the search was trained in trauma informed care.  \n \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 31 of 34\n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) strip search \nduring this reporting period. Staff was aware of the mental health status  prior to the search \nas youth regularly attempts to self-harm. Staff did find contraband that could have been \nused in self-harm. Documentation has improved. Policy and procedure/QA developed.  \n \n4.       Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants do provide de-\nescalation training to new and current staff.  All safety staff are trained specifically on proper \nde-escalation  techniques  and  are  provided  with  additional  systems  trainings  including \nMandt and Verbal Judo. In addition to the internal refresher trainings all staff are required \nto maintain their POSC certification. Defendants need to continue to focus on de-escalation \nskills.   \n \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Programming needs improvement \n(as discussed throughout this report) and idleness—which was already high especially during \ntimes of staff shortages.  \nAs recommended previously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social \nworkers, PSU staff, and volunteers can be utilized in creating and leading programming for \nyouth. Administration needs to increase meaningful/structured program and activity hours \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 32 of 34\n \nto  further  reduce  youth  idleness  hours.  Defendants  need  to  create  additional  in-room \nactivities for youth while they are being operationally confined.   \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018, \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants have made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested in improving staffing ratios and staff morale, \nbut  the  staffing  challenges  has  curtailed  any  progress  in  this  area.  Defendants  have \nimplemented several initiatives to increase recruiting and retention. Defendants have reduced \nthe vacancy rate for youth counselor positions from 40% to 21% this period which is \nsignificant.  The Monitor recommends that a formal staffing assessment be completed.  A \nstaffing assessment will provide the jurisdiction with an updated analysis needed to properly \nmaintain mandatory posts for each facility as well as identify any specific needs based on \nfacility designs, populations, and staffing ratio needs based on incidents of violence and other \nunique circumstances to each facility. Staffing assessments also take into consideration the \naverage leave usage for all types of leave used on an annual basis, to include vacations, sick \nleave, Worker’s Compensation, FMLA, and leave associated with annual training.  Ensuring \nthat each facility has the appropriate number of FTE’s to effectively manage the facility also \nhas a direct impact on staff wellness and reducing fear for safety concerns.   As stated in \nprevious  reports,  staff  wellness  is  a  complex  issue  that  impacts  the  overall  culture, \natmosphere, and environment of the facility. Staff wellness has a direct impact on the \nrelationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, use of \nrestraint, reduces employee leave/vacancies, and the use of isolation and confinement.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments  to  administrative  code.  Defendants  will  make  all  reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  DJC’s  Administrative  Code \ncommittee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter 373 \nforward. The committee has completed another round of revisions to the draft of Chapter \n373.  This included incorporating aspects that coincide with the new Behavioral Motivation \nSystem’s development and implementation.  The DJC committee is scheduled to meet with \nDJC Administration in early November for a final review of the chapter before it is sent for \napproval by the Office of Legal Counsel and subsequently to the Secretary. \n \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 33 of 34\n \nThe Chapter 376 final draft has been completed by DJC’s Administrative Code committee, \napproved by the Secretary, and most recently reviewed by the Legislative Reference Bureau \n(LRB).  DJC’s  administrative  rules  committee  reviewed  the  LRB’s  analysis  and \nrecommendations during the reporting period, responded to them, and thus has concluded \nits internal drafting process. With the approval of the Office of Legal Counsel the LRB can \nsubmit the proposed language and the amended Chapter 376 can move to the public \ncommenting period required by the rulemaking process. \n \nThe advancement of both DOC Chapter 373 and 376 during 2022, but particularly during \nthis reporting period, marks significant progress moving these two chapters implicated by \nthe consent decree toward publication.  \n \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process. Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent. Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review al l uses of \nstrip searches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon \nprobable cause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in the \nvast majority of cases absent weekends. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in \nmajority of cases. When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is \na corrective action plan developed but follow up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). Defendants continue to make improvement in the area of \nquality assurance.   \n            \nB.          Quality assurance. The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. As discussed throughout previous \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 137   Filed: 12/06/22   Page 34 of 34\n \nreports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court Order and \nto improve the quality of life for youth and staff. Defendants have created an exceptional \nquality assurance program and have made substantial progress in developing daily data to \nreview that will automatically be available in order to make real time operational decisions. \nThe Monitoring team will continue to work with the superintendent to establish performance \ngoals, analyzing data, and creation of corrective action plans. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe population remains consistent with the last reporting period.  Staffing issues remain but should \nimprove once the newly hired direct-care staff complete their required training. Youth are still \nbeing confined to their rooms, education is still occurring on the units on many days, youth are \nreceiving reduced outdoor recreation time on many days. The new system of care/behavior \nmotivation program was implemented in August, which the Monitor anticipates will have a \npositive impact on conditions of confinement for youth over time.  \n \nWhile operational confinement is not ideal, given the staffing challenges during many days in this \nreporting period, it does appear to be necessary in many instances.  Until the staffing challenges \nare resolved, Defendants will have difficulty in continuing their progress with many of the areas \nof  this  Consent  Decree.  The  recommendations  of  the  educational  consultant  should  be \nimplemented to improve the quality and quantity of education. There also needs to be a focus on \nensuring youth are being let out of administrative confinement when they no longer pose a threat \nto others per this Court Order.   \n \nLastly, as the Monitor continues to state in reports to the Court, there needs to be a focus on moving \nyouth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s) or diverting them from confinement entirely.  \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns by the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n34 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n EIGHTEENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Seventeenth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on July 5, 2023. The Monitor’s \neighteenth report will focus on assessing compliance with the Consent Decree, implementation of \nrecommendations  in  the  February  2018  technical  assistance  report,  and  comment  on  any \nobservations and/or updates since the seventeenth site visit which took place on May 25, 2023. \nSITE VISIT \nThe eighteenth site visit by the Monitor took place on October 5, 2023. The Monitor and Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel were onsite for one day and completed necessary interviews and information gathering via \nin-person and virtual meetings prior to, during, and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the parties prior to, during, and after the site visit for the reporting period \nending September 30, 2023 (June, July, August, and September 2023). Materials included but were \nnot  limited to use of force videos, video footage of units, video footage of administrative \nconfinement, video of safety and security checks, programming materials, investigations, daily \nshift reports, policies, program material, youth handbook, behavior grade incentives, all of the \nmonthly data submitted to the parties per this Court Order, meeting notes, employee leave data, \nbehavior and treatment plans, mechanical restraint documentation, incident reports, and other \nhousing documentation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted approximately thirty-seven (37) youth \ninterviews before and during the site visit. The Monitor toured LHS/CLS and interviewed youth \nand staff. The Monitor had the opportunity to talk to many of the youth and staff present and \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 2 of 27\n \navailable during the site visit. Approximately twenty-six (26) youth and twenty-two (22) staff were \ninterviewed by the Monitor during this site visit.  \nOVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, CONDITIONS, AND ATMOSPHERE \nIntroduction \nThe total LHS/CLS population increased during this reporting period. The population in June was \naveraging in the low 40s and steadily increased over this reporting period to the high 50s.  At the \ntime of the site visit, the population was 55 youths (3 youth off site).  Staffing levels have improved \noverall from last period. Although direct-care staffing vacancy rates have improved, on most days, \nonly 47% of staff report to work due to various employee leaves. However, the current population \nallows for the facility to operate without operational confinement with minimum staffing levels. \nLeadership, staff, and youth overall at LHS/CLS continue to have positive interactions with each \nother and the general atmosphere during the site visit was calm. Although youth and staff attitudes \nwere positive in general, youth raised significant consistent concerns to Plaintiffs’ counsel more \nthan on the last site visit, which is discussed in more detail below. The uses of administrative \nconfinement were significantly lower this period for LHS and CLS. Mechanical restraint usage \nwas lower this reporting period for both LHS and CLS but there were more instances of youth in \nmechanical restraints for more than 45 minutes in LHS. This is significant considering the average \ndaily population was higher in this reporting period. The overall operations of LHS/CLS continue \nto be moving in a positive direction and Defendants continue to make progress in areas of the \nprovisions of this Agreement.  \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, school, and many other areas were very clean and organized. All \nunits and the vast majority of youth rooms were clean and organized.  Staff and youth should be \ncommended for their continued commitment to making LHS/CLS  “homelike” environments.  \n \nDefendants continue with the following physical plant improvements: \n•  The living unit boilers, water heaters, and electric panels have been replaced in eight of \nten units to date. \n•  All the dayroom televisions were replaced with larger models for youth use. \n•  Televisions were installed in the upper day classroom of the units for staff to use with \nyouth. \n•  Classrooms in the school were equipped with 80” monitors that serve as great instructional \ntools. \n•  The new asphalt project has started.  \n•  New living unit sidewalks and stairways have been completed. \n•  New dish sterilizers have arrived and are being installed on each living unit. \n•  The newly renovated training center with the administration building is complete. \n•  Project request approved to update the main kitchen’s dishwasher and sink space. \n•  Project request submitted for complete renovations to living unit bathrooms. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 3 of 27\n \n•  The Music and Arts Initiative is continuing to build out and expand its video production \nstudio space along with its capabilities. \n \nDefendants should be commended for their continuing commitment to improving the physical \nplant which improves the daily lives of staff and youth. The Monitor will continue to update the \nCourt on physical plant improvements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and \nstaff.  \nEducation Observations \nMost students were in the school area at the time of the site visit. The physical appearance of the \nschool  areas  and  classrooms  were  beautiful  as  usual.  The  education  department  has  made \nnumerous updates during this reporting period, including changes to services provided to youth \nwho require administrative confinement and youth who are in the Skills Development Program \n(SDP). The units housing SDP have an upper day classroom dedicated to school classes where \nlicensed Special Education (SPED) teachers are placed for specific social/emotional learning \n(SEL) support, although students who are confined to their rooms have only intermittent access to \nany teachers and lack live instruction. SDP units have a SPED teacher in addition to a general \neducation teacher. Step 2 SDP youth now come to the school with their home unit.  \n \nDuring the reporting period the Teacher Supervisor began to attend Growth Team Meetings for \nthese youth, where they discuss needs of the youth and help reiterate the school expectations to \nhelp set the youth up for successful reintegration. When a SPED youth is placed in SDP, the \nTeacher Supervisor notifies the parent/guardian of the youth, and the education department \ncontinues to monitor the youth’s AC placements as an indicator for potential IEP updates. The \nTeacher Supervisor has implemented this process during the reporting period by either sending out \nan email to the parent/guardian when a youth is placed in SDP or by contacting the family members \ndirectly  by  phone.  A  number  of  responses  have  indicated  that  this  is  a  positive  line  of \ncommunication and that parents/guardians are appreciative of these updates regarding their youth’s \nparticipation in school.  \n \nCurrent staffing levels and population levels allow for most youth to regularly have education in \nthe school and off the living units and Defendants continue to implement the recommendations of \nthe educational consultants. But unfortunately, educational staff vacancy rate continues to worsen \n(11 out of 22 positions are vacant).  While on site, there was a unit (CLS) that did not have a \nteacher present in class. Compounding this problem, youth who must complete education on the \nunit complained to Plaintiffs’ counsel that they do not learn much and teachers do not really teach \nany material. Moreover, SDP youth confined to their rooms are expected to learn on Chromebooks \nwithout live instruction while they are in their rooms. On the positive side, youth did praise \nteachers in the regular school building, and one noted that his teacher came on her day off to help \nKrueger youth. Adequate staffing levels are key to providing quality education.  \n \nLiving Unit Observations  \nThe Monitor visited each cottage that youth were housed in during the site visit (Roosevelt, \nKrueger, Wells, Adams, Black Elk, Curtis, Rogers,  Miller, and Hughes). Overall, the units and \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 4 of 27\n \nyouth rooms, halls, living area, closets, and bathrooms were very clean. Youth were respectful \nwhen interacting with the Monitor, Plaintiffs’ counsel, and facility leadership. All the living units \nwere extremely calm. Youth were appropriately engaged with each other. The Monitor was \nimpressed that every person in the leadership knew the youths by name. It is evident that leadership \nregularly visits and converses with the youth. \nThe unit populations ranged from four (4) to nine (9) youth. The Monitor saw staff engaging with \nyouth during this site visit and the months preceding it during a review of random videos. All the \nyouth that the Monitor interacted with were respectful. Youth were more talkative than last site visit.  \nSince the time onsite for the Monitoring visit is limited, the Monitor always reviews videos of the \nliving units on random days and times to get a better idea of what youth and staff do on the units \nand whether staff are positioned near youth and interacting with youth in a positive way. The \nMonitor reviewed videos during the reporting period (random days and times) to view living units, \nschool, outdoor recreation, and other activities. In most instances (18 videos over several hours \neach) staff were engaged with youth when they were out of their rooms doing a variety of activities \nsuch as: \n•  Eating with youth at the tables. \n•  Watching television with youth. \n•  Playing cards with youth.  \n•  Conducting growth meetings. \n•  Youth in classrooms. \n•  Youth interacting with social workers, CARE team, mental health, and volunteers. \n•  Youth outside playing basketball. \n•  Youth in the Douglass recreation center. \n•  Youth and staff were in the music lab.  \n•  Youth were observed on telephones. \n•  Youth and staff were observed playing chess. \n•  Youth cleaning the units. \nOn review of video, staff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables with youth. The \nbody language and tone were positive from staff and youth in general on video. The Defendants \nneed to continue to focus on meaningful and structured programming. Youth continue to complain \nthat they have nothing to do in and out of their rooms. \nDuring this site visit, the CLS youth were housed in the Wells Unit. The unit was decorated nicely \nfor Halloween and very clean. There were six (6) youth total in CLS at the time of the site visit. \nCLS unit and youth rooms were clean. Four (4) youth were on the unit and two (2) youth were in \nschool. Youth on the unit were not permitted to attend school in the building due to their status in \nthe SDP but were sitting and talking. Most youth had positive attitudes and engaged with leadership \nand the monitoring team. There was adequate staff in CLS- three (3) staff on the unit. However, \nthere was not a teacher available for the CLS youth in the classrooms, which prevented them from \nengaging in schoolwork.  \nThe LHS youth were housed in Roosevelt, Krueger, Adams, Black Elk, Curtis, Rogers, Miller, \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 5 of 27\n \nHughes. At the time of the site visit, the units had adequate direct-care staffing. All units were \nextremely  clean  and  organized.  Three  (3)  youths  were  in  their  rooms  for  administrative \nconfinement in Krueger. Other youth on the units were in outdoor recreation, standing or sitting, \ntalking, playing cards, on the telephone, playing chess with staff, and cleaning. \n \nThe Krueger and Wells living units housed youth in the SDP at LHS and CLS respectively during \nthis reporting period. The SDP is modified programming for youth who have engaged in physically \naggressive behavior, have presented a danger to others, and/or have exhibited behavior that caused \na major disruption to the facility.  \n \nAs previously reported, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy “DBT” is provided to youth in the SDP \nincorporating individualized planning along with the in-person group work already assigned to \nyouth in the SDP so that they are engaging in DBT skills and receiving feedback on a daily basis. \nYouth assigned to the SDP have a “Supplemental Youth Plan” created by PSU to specifically \naddress their behavior. Youth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in \nconjunction with their weekly Growth Team. The Monitor observed youth engaged with their \nhome units during the transition period.  \n \nOne concern the Monitor has is that there is too much idle time for youth. There needs to be a \nfocus on creating additional activities for all youth, especially while operationally confined and \nregardless of behavior status (i.e., even youth in the SDP). Youth complained to the Monitor and \nPlaintiffs’ counsel that they are bored and need more activities. Additional activities for youth are \nespecially important in Krueger considering they are confined more than the general population \nunits. SDP includes a PAUSE in which youth are unable to progress through the levels until they \nmeet certain expectations. For LHS PAUSE youth, they are rotated in and out of their rooms. As \nrecommended in the last report, Defendants need to think of alternatives to having two groups for \nPAUSE modified program confinement in SDP. Although the Monitor discussed suggestions, \nDefendants continue to rotate youth in and out of their rooms while on PAUSE in SDP even though \nthe Monitor believes that there is adequate staffing to support the youth being out of their rooms.  \n \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately  twenty-two  (22)  youth  were  interviewed  during  the  site  visit  (formally  and \ninformally)  by  the  Monitor  and  approximately  thirty-seven  (37)  youth  were  interviewed \nextensively prior to and during the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel and several more informally \nduring the tour.  \nIn general, youth attitudes were more positive than the last site visit in the Monitor’s opinion. The \nMonitor had an opportunity to talk to many of the youth present in the day rooms. Youths’ major \ncomplaint to the Monitor was being bored. However, youth also informed the Monitor that they \nwanted more school time, wanted to go outside more, wanted staff to engage with them more, and \ndid not like the behavior motivation system. Multiple youth reported to Plaintiffs’ counsel that the \nteachers who come down to lower day when youth are out do not teach any lessons, do not care, \nand  merely  distribute  optional  work.  The  youth  described  a  very  chaotic  environment  not \nconducive to actual learning. On the positive side, youth did praise teachers in the regular school \nbuilding, and one noted that his teacher came on her day off to help Krueger youth. Youth reported \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 6 of 27\n \nthat there is very little to do in their rooms. They stated that they are allowed reading and writing \nmaterial, but that is not enough to keep them occupied. One youth wished he could draw and \nmerely wanted a few “reference pictures” to help him. Another youth noted that it wouldn’t be as \nbad to be in the room if they had electronics, but now they’re just “just looking at the wall or \ntalking to themself.” Youth also report that there is little to do even during their limited “out time.” \nYouth are not allowed to go outside or make phone calls during “school hours,” but youth \nrepeatedly pointed out how unfair this is given that no actual instruction or learning is taking place \nduring those hours currently.  \nYouth also reported to the Monitor and repeatedly to Plaintiffs’ counsel that they have many \nconcerns about the behavior motivation system (\"BMS\"). There was a significant increase in the \nnumber of youths who made these complaints to Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to and during the site visit. \nYouth complained that staff apply violations inconsistently. For example, some staff let things \nslide while other staff will assign a “high violation,” which automatically puts the youth on \nPAUSE. Youth are upset that they are often put on PAUSE for unnecessary reasons, such as based \non their body language alone. In almost every call with counsel, youth bring up how unfair they \nfeel the BMS is. Youth feel staff are quick to exercise their power and hand out “negative” points \nbut rarely recognize youth with positive points. Data on youth at CLS/LHS during the monitor \nvisit shows the aggregate percentage of prosocial versus noncompliant behaviors to be 84.5% \nprosocial and 15.5% noncompliant. Expanding to cover the entire reporting period that ratio \nincreased to 90% / 10% which is an appropriate ratio.  \n \nIt is important that Defendants continually communicate the details of the new behavior motivation \nsystem and what the expectations are of youth and staff since youth do not seem to have a uniform \nunderstanding of it. Defendants need to make sure through a rigorous quality assurance process that \nthe  system  is  being  implemented  consistently  and  in  accordance  with  training,  policy,  and \nprocedure, especially with the number of new staff onboarding and with the number of youth \ncomplaints of inconsistency.  Defendants should continue to include the youths’ voices for input \nand development of meaningful incentives and rewards through the youth council. One youth told \nthe Monitor that he made a recommendation to the unit’s representative to bring to the council.  \n \nThere needs to be additional resources available to youth and more in-room activities to engage \nyouth, especially for youth on Skills Development Program. The significant hiring in the youth \ncounselor classifications and population level has provided for more available staff resulting in \nyouth spending more time out of their rooms, off unit, and in the school area and no operational \nconfinement other than youth placed on a Program Pause in SDP.  \n  \nThe Monitor continues to encourage staff to engage youth and have more meaningful/structured \nprogramming and activities. The Defendants need to continue to focus on gender-specific and \nculturally competent programming.  \n \nUpdate Type I Facility \n \nOn August 9, 2023, Governor Evers announced that the Wisconsin State Building Commission \napproved funding for several key projects across the state, including the construction of a Type 1 \nJuvenile Correctional Facility in Milwaukee County and the planning and development of a second \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 7 of 27\n \nType 1 facility in Dane County.  \n \nThe construction of the new facility and planning and development for a second will make it \npossible for more youth to be located closer to their homes and will move the state forward in \nbeing able to close CLS/LHS. The projected timeline for completion of the Type 1 facility located \nat W. Clinton Avenue in Milwaukee remains on track for 2026. Moving youth to smaller facilities \ncloser  to  their  homes  will  facilitate  greater  family  involvement,  connection  to  school  and \ncommunity, and should improve outcomes. \n \nStaffing  \n \nThe staffing levels (excluding educational staff) at LHS/CLS have improved slightly during this \nreporting period. Staff vacancies have been slightly reduced however, employee leaves continue \nto be high during this reporting period at LHS/CLS and across DOC. On average, LHS/CLS is \noperating at 47% of staffing levels. Defendants are working diligently to try to attract and retain \nstaff for these critical roles and have truly created significant incentives for new and existing \nemployees to help with attracting new talent and retaining current staff.  \nThe Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advance staffing vacancy percentages are lower than the \nlast  reporting  period  (see  below).  There  are  311  total  positions  (“FTEs”)  at  LHS/CLS. \nApproximately 122 of these positions are “direct care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor \nAdvanced (“YC/YCA”). There has been an improvement in the vacancy rate for youth counselors \nthis period and there are no social worker vacancies, which is huge improvement from a year ago. \nHowever, there is a shortage of Treatment Specialists and teachers. Treatment Specialists 2 lead \nDBT groups and are responsible for program PAUSES, behavior chains, other treatment responses \nto behavior, and participate in Growth meetings. The shortage results in staff having to be assigned \nto two or more units. Ideally, Treatment Specialists should be assigned to one unit so that they can \nfocus on a smaller group of youth. The teacher vacancy rate is higher than the last reporting period \n(11 vacancies), or 50% of positions, which is not the direction the Monitor hoped. With limited \neducators, Defendants will have continued difficulty with increasing the quality and quantity of \neducation for youth. These vacancies are having a negative impact on the youth. Recruiting in \ngeneral is still a challenge due to the location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if LHS/CLS \nwill close, and for educators, the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to continue.  \n  \n \nPosition  Vacancy Rate % as of  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \nJanuary 31, 2023  April 30, 2023  October 1, 2023 \n     \nYouth   24% (23 out of 94)  14% (13 out of 94)  6% (6 out of 94) \n \nCounselor \n \n \nYouth  32% (9 out of 28)  25% (7 out of 28)  25% (7 out of 28) \n \nCounselor \nAdv.   \nTeacher  32% (6 out of 19)  36% (8 out of 22)  50% (11 out of 22) \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 8 of 27\n \n                 Social \n64% (7 out of 11)  0% (0 out of 6)  0% (0 out of 6) \n  Worker \n \nRecruiting efforts for this period include: \n \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews - Rhinelander Job Center - 6/12/23 \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews - Wausau Job Center - 6/13/23 \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews - Wausau Job Center - 7/25/23 \n•  YC Walk-In Interviews - Rhinelander Job Center - 7/27/23 \n•  Recruitment booth - Lincoln CO Fair 8/16 to 8/20/23 \n \nDefendants continue to focus on staff wellness. The Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) \nbegan conducting rounds during shift this reporting period to broaden their outreach and raise \nawareness about resources available to staff through CIRT. The facility has many staff who are \nrelatively new in addition to CIRT itself being a more recently implemented initiative, so team \nmembers have sought to make all staff aware of CIRT. This has been very well received by many \nstaff. \n \nThe most recent quarterly CIRT meeting was held in July 2023. Topics included scheduling \nrefresher  training  for  the  current  CIRT  membership  with  the  same  Critical  Incident  Stress \nManagement trainer who initially helped certify CIRT members to sharpen and retain their \nacquired skills. CIRT resource materials, including the CIRT brochure and various handouts, were \nupdated to reflect current membership and resources available to staff. Finally, the team members \nconducted mock defusing and debriefing scenarios followed by review and discussion amongst \nthe team to again help sharpen and hone their skills in confronting what can often present as \nchallenging scenarios. The session concluded with an emphasis on the importance of self-care and \nits contribution to a wider climate of staff wellness.  \n \nThe Committee Assigned to Safety and Health (CASH) utilized its past event planning and \nfundraising experience to expand its outreach by developing a Coworker Care fund. When facility \nstaff become aware that a coworker or their family may be experiencing particularly tough \ncircumstances, the situation can be brought to the attention of CASH. As staff came to the CASH \nwith these instances, they gauged it as a real indication of how much people care and want to \nsupport one another at the facility. Beginning in July, CASH planned four different fundraising \nevents and made arrangements to help people on all shifts enjoy the meal and participate, even if \ntheir schedules did not allow them to be present in the courtyard at the scheduled times. All \nproceeds  went  to  a  separate  fund  designated  for  disbursement  to  staff  that  experience  an \noverwhelmingly tough time. Through its first four events the fund raised over $2,000. \n \nAdditional staff wellness activities included: \n \n•  July 11and  July 12, 2023: Burgers in the courtyard! A $5 donation purchased staff a burger, \nchips, pickle, and a drink. \n•  July 19 and 20, 2023: BBQ in the courtyard! A $5 donation purchased staff a sandwich, \nchips, pickle, and a drink. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 9 of 27\n \n•  July 4th Pie in the Face Day. \n•  CASH put on the 4th of July Face Full of Pie Fundraiser for the first time in 2022.  \n•  The pie throwing celebration was held August 3 and raised over $500 again this year. \n•  Keep Calm and Back the Pack- During football season, all staff can wear jeans along with \ntheir team’s apparel on Gameday or the Friday before a game in support of their favorite \nteam. \n \nThe Monitor spoke to over twenty-two (22) staff. Staff morale seemed very good overall at the \ntime of the site visit. A review of video over the reporting period showed staff regularly engaging \nwith youth. Staff were more talkative on this site visit. The new staff who were on-the-job training \nexpressed their excitement to begin their positions. Staff also said to the Monitor that they felt safe \nat the facility. One staff playing chess with a youth told the Monitor that the youth was teaching \nher how to play because she did not know how when she came to the LHS.  \nThe Monitor continues to stress the need to continue making staff wellness a major focus moving \nforward and continue to communicate with staff on any initiatives, changes to programming, and \ngeneral information as well as sharing positive outcome measure data. A major component of staff \nwellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible and are properly trained for the environment and \nyouth demographics. It appears that Defendants have improved in this area based on observations \nand conversations with staff.  Improving staff wellness will certainly have a positive impact on the \noverall atmosphere and reduce turnover, which will then provide an opportunity to decrease the \nvacancy rate, reduce employee leaves and improve staffing ratios.  \nUse of Force Reviews \n \nThe Monitor reviewed several uses of force incidents during this reporting period. Appropriate \nforce was used in each instance. However, it would have been helpful to have the CARE team \npresent to attempt to de-escalate the situation in some instances and in two instances staff could \nhave responded quicker. In the last report the Monitor encouraged the Defendants to fully \nimplement the Mandt system strategies and techniques designed to support de-escalation and lower \nthe potential of staff or youth injury. The Monitor also recommended that the Defendants should \nincorporate facility expectations for the use of Mandt techniques and set a target date to discontinue \ntraining staff in POSC. The Monitor is happy to report that POSC will be discontinued during the \nnext reporting period and starting in 2024, only MANDT will be trained.  \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \n \nThe Quality Assurance Program at LHS/CLS continues to be second to none. DJC has a program \nthat other jurisdictions should model. Critical information is readily available to the leadership \nwhich allows them to make proactive, data driven decisions that increases the safety of youth and \nstaff.  The QA team has greatly expanded data collection and quality using Guardian RFID during \nthis and last reporting periods. Examples of confinement tracking, as well as the most detailed and \nreliable out time records related to three (3) hours daily and thirty (30) hours weekly. During the \nlast reporting period, Defendants have developed data for the requirements of this Court Order. \nThe dashboard has been more refined during this reporting period. This is an especially useful tool \nto assess compliance with this Court Order. Again, continuous improvements have been made in \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 10 of 27\n \ndata collection and in the quality assurance program.  \n \nAdministrative Code Revisions Update \n \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and \nDOC Chapter 373 forward. During this reporting period the committee met with the Office of \nLegal Counsel (OLC) to discuss the current draft of Chapter 373. The committee continues to \nrefine Chapter 373 and incorporate OLC recommendations. The committee also received the final \nedits from OLC regarding Chapter 376 and is now in the process of reviewing suggested edits and \nfinalizing  the  draft.  When  considering  the  projected  timelines  for  moving  Wisconsin \nAdministrative Code revisions through the rulemaking process, DJC’s advancement of both DOC \nChapter 373 and DOC Chapter 376 during the reporting period represents progress moving these \ntwo Chapters, most directly implicated by the consent decree, to having the amendments adopted. \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data shows one youth  was \nconfined for seven (7.35)  days pending transfer out of LHS. However, this was not for \npunitive reasons.  \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data indicates that one youth \nwas confined for four (4.79) days pending transfer out of LHS. However, this was not for \npunitive  reasons.  The  Monitor  still  suggests  Defendants  limit  any  extended  room \nconfinement such as this, especially for youth with mental health needs. \n \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 11 of 27\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.  Defendants  need to continue to \nexamine their use of all forms of confinement and review incidents to ensure that staff are \nnot using any form of confinement as punitive confinement including High-Risk Program \nPAUSE stage. Confinement is not appropriate during the PAUSE stage of the High-Risk \nProgram.  The  Monitor  continues  to  recommend  that  the  Defendants  reassess  the \nconfinement for youth for the PAUSE stage of the program. Additionally, when there are \nextended periods of time for youth transferring to MJTC, Defendants rotated youth pending \ntransfer in and out of their room with restraints. These are very limited circumstances, \nhowever; the Monitor recommends the parties discuss this further and that Defendants \ndocument any restraints as required by the Consent Decree.  \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only  be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of AC was lower for  both \nCLS and LHS this period. No CLS youth were confined administratively for more than four \n(4) hours. Approximately the same number of youths were confined for over (4) four hours \nduring this reporting period for LHS. However, there were instances where LHS youth were \nconfined for longer period of times pending transfer to MJTC due to bed availability. \nDefendants need to continue to examine use of all forms of confinement and review incidents \nto ensure that staff are not using any form of confinement as punitive confinement including \nthe SDP PAUSE stage. Confinement is not appropriate during the PAUSE stage of the SDP \nProgram. Defendants need to reconsider confining youth during the PAUSE stage of the \nprogram. Additionally, when there are extended periods of time for youth transferring to \nMJTC, defendants rotated youth pending transfer in and out of their room with restraints. \nThese are very limited circumstances however; the Monitor recommends the parties discuss \nthis further and that Defendants document any restraints as required by the Consent Decree.  \n \nJanuary 2023 \nCLS: 3 uses of A.C. Average 113 minutes. No youth over four hours. \nLHS: 30 uses of A.C. Average of 151 minutes. No youth over four hours.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 12 of 27\n \n \nFebruary 2023 \nCLS: 3 uses of A.C. Average 128 minutes.

Average 109 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 19 uses of A.C. Average 108 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \n \nApril 2023 \nCLS: 10 uses of A.C. Average 120 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 57 uses of A.C. Average 194 minutes. Six (6) youth over 4 hours with   \none youth confined for 2164 minutes (approximately 36 hours). \n \nMay 2023 \nCLS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 117 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 46 uses of A.C. Average 163 minutes.  Three (3) youth over 4 hours. \n \nJune 2023 \nCLS: 4 uses of A.C. Average 114 minutes.

Average 127 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 30 uses of A.C. Average 148 minutes. One (1) youth over 4 hours. \n \nAugust 2023 \nCLS: 3 uses of A.C. Average 54 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 48 uses of A.C. Average 647 minutes. Seven  (7) youth over 4 hours. One \nyouth in for 6905 minutes- 4.79 days,  one youth in for 10593 minutes (7.35 \ndays) \n \nSeptember 2023 \nCLS: 8 uses of A.C. Average 115 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 27 uses of A.C. Average 236 minutes.  1 (1) youth over 4 hours. \n \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit. 99.19%- 99.49% of checks were completed within 30 minutes \nduring this reporting period. The Monitor reviewed video footage for random days and times \n(30  reviews)  and  Defendants  were  100%  compliance  with  completing  the  checks  in \naccordance with policy. Staff did an outstanding job and should be commended for their \ncontinued diligence in ensuring youth safety while in their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 13 of 27\n \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \npose a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were seventeen (17) youth \nconfined for over four (4) hours during this reporting period (see response in previous \nquestion). Five (5) youth had their initial AC placement extended but all five were released \nprior to requiring a second four-hour extension at the eight-hour mark. The number of \noverall placements is consistent with the last reporting period, however, the amount of time \nin placements from the last reporting period was higher. Documentation shows that PSU \napproved the extended time in each case.  \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall. Defendants created excellent \nquality assurance measures and data during this reporting period.  \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Twelve  (12)  youth  were \nplaced on extended placement in administrative confinement pending transfer out of the \nfacility (8-MJTC, 1- juvenile commitment expired, 2 no longer posed a threat so although \nthere was a plan commenced to transfer, the youths’ behavior was such that they could \nremain at LHS, 1 remained on AC).  There were plans commenced to return the youth to \ngeneral population/transfer to another facility. PSU was involved in all instances.  \n \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to 8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.  \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were seven (7) youths \n(excluding the one youth where their juvenile commitment expired) confined beyond 24 \nhours who were transferred. See comments in the above section. \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 14 of 27\n \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol policy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and \nshall treat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended \npolicy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC  Clinical Observation \npolicy 500.70.24 is being utilized. The plans developed are very detailed and comprehensive. \nOnly youth who are at imminent risk of serious self-harm to themselves/risk of self-harm \nwill be placed in observation status. There were 42 youth in observation status this period. \nYouth were regularly seen by mental health per documentation. The Monitor will continue \nto review and monitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor would not \ndeem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety and \nsecurity measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make the \nrooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed in renovated units. Youth rooms were \noverall very clean. The rooms were very organized allowing staff to clearly see into the \nroom, perform room searches more effectively, and ensure to the extent possible that there \nare no dangerous items in room.   \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants are in substantial compliance. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 15 of 27\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor or Plaintiffs’ counsel about access to water, regular hygiene supplies, or nighttime \ntoilet usage. Defendants have improved their documentation and data collection.  \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin room confinement, staff shall engage in challenges intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible. PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants continue to properly \ndocument who from PSU was notified, time of notification, and the intervention technique \nutilized with the youth.  \n \nExamples of the crisis intervention techniques used with youth when confined can include, \nbut are not limited to: processing of the incident, coping ahead/safety plans, in the moment \nskills  coaching/practice  of  DBT  skills  including  mindfulness,  recommitment  to  goals, \nvalidation,  time  away  from  stressors  or  time  for  reflection/refusing,  fostering  insight, \nimplementation  of  established  Youth  Plan,  assistance  problem-solving,  increase  self-\nawareness/awareness of body sensations as indicators, Behavior Chain Analysis (formal and \ninformal) and Thinking Report, encourage self-reflection/identify vulnerabilities, consistent \nredirection/limits, Behavior Intervention Protocol fostering insight/skill identification/skill \npractice, and plans to address conflict/safety/skills practice. \n \nClinicians are on-site for 6 hours each Saturday and Sunday. The Monitor continues to \nsuggest that PSU increase the hours in which they are physically present on weekends and \nevening hours to engage youth in a meaningful way during this time. Because confinement \ncan create or exacerbate mental health problems, treatment is going to be even more critical \nas the population continues to remain higher if the Defendants are confining youth to their \nrooms for any reason. The Monitor also suggests that specific PSU clinicians should work \nwith the same youth to establish continuity (when possible) and should primarily work on \nthe units. If possible, Defendants should consider putting PSU staff offices on the unit like \nthey did with the Supervisors’ offices. This will reinforce to the youth and staff that they \nare “one team” servicing the youth and could be readily present to mitigate any situations.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 16 of 27\n \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Documentation/data  shows  that \nevaluations are completed (if there is not already a mental health evaluation) within 24 hours \nafter being placed in room confinement. Youth on operational confinement are being seen \nby PSU and evaluated for contraindication. The documentation has improved, and the \nMonitor has seen documentation for youth on operational confinement and whether they are \nevaluated for contraindication. There were no instances of contraindication documented \nduring this review period. \n \n     e.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant to \ncurrent policy at least every 30 minutes in all cases, and contemporaneously \nrecord the actual time of such checks in a log kept for that purpose. Staff who \nfail to make such checks or who falsify such records may be subject discipline. \nAny youth placed in room confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall \nreceive daily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be face-\nto-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is personally available, \nin which case it may occur by phone or video conferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE:  Defendants  were  between \n99.19%- 99.49% compliant with meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check \ntimeframe.  Quality  assurance  measures  are  in  place  and  when  necessary,  formal \ninvestigations occur. There were no formal job instructions for not completing safety and \nsecurity checks. The Monitor observed safety/wellness checks being completed on various \ndays/times on every unit during this reporting period and observed no instances in which \nstaff did not make visual contact with youth per policy- 100% of the checks were compliant. \nStaff met or exceeded the 30-minute timeframe, looked into room, and the intervals were \nstaggered.  \n \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time in the evenings and weekends doing \ngroups  and  having  one-on-one  sessions  with  youth.  The  Monitor  also  continues  to \nrecommend that PSU staff, like Supervisors, have offices on the unit and work with the same \nyouth when possible.  \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n \ne.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population.  Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 17 of 27\n \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  While  youth  are  on \noperational room confinement/modified programming, regardless of level in the behavior \nmanagement program or their status on SDP, the Monitor recommends that youth be \nprovided with activities to do that would encourage physical movement in rooms, arts, crafts, \nmusic etc. Based on the Monitor’s recommendation, as of February 2023, youth on SDP \ntransitioned to level “C” from “D” affording youth better hygiene products and fans. Thus, \nall youth on level C receive the same property regardless of where they are housed. Youth \ncomplained to both the Monitor and Plaintiffs’ counsel about having nothing to do in their \nrooms. Defendants should continue to evaluate items allowed in youth rooms to keep them \noccupied. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Social worker visits, mental health \nservices, and other health services are provided in general. The Defendants are working on \ncreating  a  report  with  underlying  documentation    in  order  to  more  efficiently  assess \ncompliance levels Defendants need to ensure there is accountability with respect to the \nservices provided by the social workers, mental and healthcare workers.  \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants moved to smaller group-\nbased  treatment  to  youth  where  group  participation  was  provided  on  the  units.  This \ncontinues. The Defendants are working on creating a report with underlying documentation  \nin  order  to  assess  compliance  levels  more  easily.  Defendants  need  to  ensure  that  any \nmissed/rescheduled treatment groups do not negatively impact a youth’s progress.  \n \n  \niii.         Educational  services with  the general  population to  the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 18 of 27\n \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices. Defendants shall ensure special education services \nfor all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The education consultants completed \ntheir  report  which  included  recommendations.  The  education  department  has  made \nnumerous updates during the reporting period to school services (described in the education \nsection of this report).  \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staffing levels are  appropriate this \nperiod. Youth are regularly out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. Monitor regularly saw \nyouth conversing with other youth during out time when the youth were on the units in the \nday room. During this reporting period, Defendants implemented a change for youth who are \non AC pending transfer when the transfer is delayed. When there are extended periods of \ntime for youth transferring to MJTC, defendants rotated youth pending transfer in and out \nof their room with restraints in order for them to receive their 30 hours per week and 3 hours \nof out times. The alternative would be for youth to be confined continuously for days pending \ntransfer. These are very limited circumstances however; the Monitor recommends the \nparties discuss this further.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were forty-two (42) \ndocumented instances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based on \nsubstantial threat of physical harm during this reporting period. Defendants can track \nwhen youth eat meals in their rooms and based on reports that the Monitor reviewed, it \nappears these instances were justified.  \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. According to Defendants’ tracking, \nthere were fourteen (14) youth who did not receive 3 hours of out time per day and six (6) \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 19 of 27\n \nyouth who did not receive at least 30 hours per week. The facility continues to confine youth \non SDP who are also on PAUSE. During the last period, Defendants were strategizing on \nhow to continue with PAUSE in SDP without rotating youth in and out of their rooms. The \nMonitor recommends reconsidering this practice when staffing levels allow for all youth on \nPAUSE to remain out of their rooms.  \n \nDefendants now track out time on an individual basis using RFID, so the Monitor can \ndetermine how many youths are not getting at least three (3) hours of out-time per day or \nthirty (30) hours per week independently. Defendants are close to being in substantial \ncompliance with this provision.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals. Within one hour of a youth's placement in \nroom confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The DOC-2942A was developed and \nmoved into J-Tracker operation designed to draw the required information for the written \nreport directly from the incident debrief form, as soon as the SYC overseeing the incident \nhas completed their required fields for a major incident. Once the SYC has completed their \nrequired fields, a response assignment can be generated by the SYC to the unit staff where \nthe youth on AC is housed. Upon receipt of the response assigned, unit staff are then able to \ngenerate the DOC-2942A and deliver it to the youth. The new process and forms have been \ndrafted into an updated Incident Debrief procedure. There is a photo uploaded showing staff \ngiving the notice to youth with time stamp. Defendants would be in substantial compliance \nbut the youth who are confined due to staffing issues/PAUSE are not given these notifications \nof rights.  \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth  is  placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Court Order requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \nconsistently, including when less restrictive means were attempted.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan. Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 20 of 27\n \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  did  not \npersonally see any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit. Data and documentation \nshow that there was significant decrease in use of mechanical restraints for LHS and a \ndecrease for CLS. The Monitor reviewed several uses of force videos and there were no \ninappropriate uses of mechanical restraints observed. Defendants do need to monitor any use \nof restraints while youth are awaiting transfer to another facility. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regain control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Below  is  the  number  of \nmechanical restraints uses in LHS and CLS this reporting period. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \n \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \nNovember 2022:              1 use \nDecember 2022:              4 uses \nJanuary 2023:                 3 uses \nFebruary 2023:             21 uses \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 21 of 27\n \nMarch 2023:                    2 uses \nApril 2023:                    12 uses \nMay 2023:              15 uses \nJune 2023:                       9 uses (1 over 45 mins) \nJuly 2023:                        8 uses (2 over 45 mins) \nAugust 2023:                 10 uses(1 over 45 mins) \nSeptember 2023:    2 uses (1 over 45 mins) \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \n \nOctober 2022:    13 uses \nNovember 2022:    4 uses \nDecember 2022:              2 uses \nJanuary 2023:                 1 use \nFebruary 2023:     1 use \nMarch 2023:                    4 uses \nApril 2023:                1 use \nMay 2023:      1 use \nJune 2023:                       1 use \nJuly 2023:                        4 uses \nAugust 2023:                   0 uses \nSeptember 2023:    0 uses \n \nDefendants have significantly reduced the use of mechanical restraints in LHS compared to \nthe last four-month reporting period. CLS is slightly lower than the last reporting period. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were three (3) uses of \nrestraints other than handcuffs (ankle) during this reporting period. Defendants have \ndeveloped policy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were three uses of \nrestraints other than handcuffs (ankle) during this reporting period. They were ordered by \nsecurity staff as youth posed an immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to \nothers. Defendants need to develop policy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 22 of 27\n \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used. Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor has not observed \nmechanical restraints used for punishment/discipline on site visits, review of video, or \ndocumentation reviewed.  \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained on proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. All safety staff equipped with \nmechanical restraints are trained specifically in the use of physical force, and restraints, and \nin proper de-escalation techniques.  \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living \nunit.  No  youth  shall  be  left  alone  in  restraints.  Any  use  of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 23 of 27\n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE FOR THIS PERIOD. There \nwere five (5) instances of a youth being placed in mechanical restraints for over 45 minutes \nand it was approved by the Deputy Superintendent. Defendants have created a QA process \nfor this section.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has \nbeen added to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been \nmodified. The length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is \nregularly documented as part of the Incident Debrief process.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.   Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possess drugs or weapons that could not \nbe discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches in this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been \nfinalized. A Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all \nsupervisors to outline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under \nwhich a strip search may be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search.  \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause. Less intrusive searches, including using \na metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top \nor other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is conducted, \nunless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth that less \nintrusive  searches,  which  may  include  physical  contact,  would  cause \ngreater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  zero  (0)  strip \nsearches this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 24 of 27\n \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis  reporting  period.  It  was  conducted  in  a  private  area.  QA  has  been  developed. \nContraband was in fact found. \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches during this reporting period. No youth was near the youth being strip searched. QA \nhas been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nconducted during this reporting period. The staff conducting the strip search was the same \ngender. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis period the staff conducting the search was trained in trauma informed care.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches during this reporting period. Policy and procedure/QA developed.  \n \n4.       Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 25 of 27\n \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure have been finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants do provide de-\nescalation training to new and current staff.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor and Defendants have \nhad many conversations/meetings regarding increased programming.  As recommended \npreviously, counselors, religious services leader, recreation workers, social workers, PSU \nstaff,  and  volunteers  can  be  utilized  in  creating  and  leading  programming  for  youth. \nDefendants  should  continuously  work  to  increase  meaningful/structured  program  and \nactivity hours to further reduce youth idleness hours.  \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018, \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants made significant effort \nin implementing the strategies suggested for improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants  have  implemented  several  initiatives  to  increase  recruiting  and  retention, \nparticularly in the social worker classification which has resulted in all the social worker \npositions being filled. As stated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that \nimpacts the overall culture, atmosphere, and environment of the facility. Staff wellness has \na direct impact on the relationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of \nviolence, use of restraint, reduces employee leave/vacancies, and the use of isolation and \nconfinement. During the recent site visit, the Monitor observed staff utilizing the staff \nwellness room. Defendants also added a staff workout space. The staff all seemed in good \nspirits, engaged with the youth, and had great things to say about the youth and their day-\nto-day work life. The Monitor could not find one staff that did not have a positive attitude. \nDefendants need to conduct an analysis into employee leaves since 47% of staff on any given \nday are out on some sort of leave.  \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 26 of 27\n \n \n \nH.  Amendments  to  administrative  code.  Defendants  will  make  all  reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCES  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  DJC’s  Administrative  Code \ncommittee continues working on moving both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter 373 \nforward. During this reporting period the committee met with the Office of Legal Counsel \n(OLC) to discuss the current draft of Chapter 373. The committee continues to refine \nChapter 373 and incorporate OLC recommendations. The committee also received the final \nedits from OLC regarding Chapter 376 and is now in the process of reviewing suggested \nedits and finalizing the draft. \n \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process. Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent. Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review all uses of strip \nsearches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon probable \ncause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in \nthe vast majority of cases absent weekends. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in \nmajority of cases. When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is \na corrective action plan developed but follow-up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). Defendants QA program is exceptional and continues to further \ndevelop  the  program  to  include  compliance  measures  with  this  Court  Order.  New \ndashboards  have  been  created  during  this  reporting  period.  The  QA  team  should  be \ncommended for all the hard work and dedication to creating an extremely robust system that \nhas increased the safety for youth and staff by allowing leadership to make proactive \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 144   Filed: 10/30/23   Page 27 of 27\n \ndecisions and analyze many key data points on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.  \n            \nB.           Quality assurance. The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze  data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  As  discussed  throughout \nprevious reports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court \nOrder and to improve the quality of life for youth and staff. Defendants have created an \nexceptional quality assurance program and have developed daily data to review that will \nautomatically be available to make real-time operational decisions. Defendants continue to \nfurther develop the program to include additional compliance measures with this Court \nOrder and created new dashboards during this reporting period. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe population remains low overall but did increase during this reporting period by approximately \ntwenty-five percent (25%). In general, staffing vacancy rates improved slightly, but employee \nleaves remained high at forty-seven percent (47%) on any given day. Defendants also need to \ndevelop strategies to improve teacher vacancies since fifty percent (50%) of the positions are open. \nLack of teachers has a detrimental impact on youths’ education as articulated by youth to both the \nMonitor and Plaintiffs’ counsel.  \n \nThe recommendations of the educational consultant should continue to be implemented to improve \nthe quality and quantity of education. Defendants need to continue to focus on programming, de-\nescalation training, and ensuring that the new system of care/behavior motivation system is being \nimplemented consistently. The Monitor continues to recommend that PSU and the CARE team \nhave a bigger presence on the units as this can mitigate any incidents of violence and subsequent \nuse of force as well. Once the Mandt system strategies and techniques are fully implemented, this \nshould lower  the potential of staff or youth injury.  \n \nLastly, as the Monitor continues to state in reports to the Court, there needs to be a continued focus \non moving youth from LHS/CLS to more appropriate setting(s) or diverting them from confinement \nentirely. Overall, the Monitor continues to see significant progress in most areas. \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns of the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n27 \n ",

Case No.:  17-CV-47 \n \nJON E. LITSCHER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Wisconsin Department \nof Corrections, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n NINETEENTH REPORT OF THE MONITOR \n \n \n Teresa Abreu, Monitor, hereby submits this status report.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Eighteenth Report of the Monitor was filed with the Court on October 30, 2023. The Monitor’s \nnineteenth  report  will  focus  on  assessing  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree,    and \nimplementation of recommendations in the February 2018 technical assistance report and will also \ncomment on any observations and/or updates since the eighteenth site visit which took place on \nOctober 5, 2023. \nSITE VISIT \nThe nineteenth site visit by the Monitor took place on March 14, 2024. The Monitor and Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel were onsite for one day and completed necessary interviews and information gathering via \nin-person and virtual meetings prior to, during, and after the site visit. The Monitor reviewed \nmaterials provided by the Parties for the reporting period ending February 29, 2024 (October 2023, \nNovember 2023, December 2023, January 2024, and February 2024). Materials included but were \nnot  limited to use of force videos, video footage of units, video footage of administrative \nconfinement, video of safety and security checks, programming materials, investigations, data, \ndaily shift reports, various written directives, program materials, all of the monthly data submitted \nto the parties per this Court Order, meeting notes, employee leave data, behavior and treatment \nplans, mechanical restraint documentation, incident reports, and other housing documentation.  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel conducted approximately forty-five (45) youth interviews for the site visit. The \nMonitoring team toured LHS/CLS and interviewed youth and staff. The Monitoring team had the \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 2 of 30\n \nopportunity to talk to many of the youth and staff present and available during the site visit. \nApproximately  twenty-four  (24)  youth  and  twenty-six  (26)  staff  were  interviewed  by  the \nMonitoring team during this site visit.  \nOVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, CONDITIONS, AND ATMOSPHERE \nIntroduction \nThe total LHS/CLS population in October 2023 averaged fifty-five (55) youth and has stayed \nconsistent over this reporting period to the low to mid-fifties. At the time of the site visit, the \npopulation was fifty-four (54) youths (three youth off site). Staffing levels have improved overall \nfrom last period. Although the direct-care staffing vacancy rates have improved this reporting \nperiod, there was still an average daily operational vacancy rate of 35%, which is reflective of \ndaily unanticipated leave. All of the recruitment and retention efforts have had a positive impact. \nLeadership, staff, and youth overall at LHS/CLS continue to have positive interactions with each \nother and the general atmosphere during the site visit was calm. Although youth and staff attitudes \nwere positive in general, youth raised significant consistent concerns to Plaintiffs’ counsel which \nis discussed in more detail below. The number of unique uses of administrative confinement \n(“AC”)  and  mechanical  restraints  were  significantly  lower  this  period  for  LHS.  AC  was \nsignificantly higher for CLS and Mechanical restraint usage was relatively consistent for CLS. The \noverall operations of LHS/CLS continue to be moving in a positive direction and Defendants \ncontinue to make progress in areas of the provisions of this Agreement.  \nPhysical Plant Observations \n \nThe entrance, grounds, visitation, school, and many other areas were clean and organized. All units \nand most youth rooms were clean and organized. Staff and youth should be commended for their \ncontinued commitment to creating “homelike” environments.  \n \nDefendants continue with the following physical plant improvements: \n \n•  Began water well improvement and power upgrade; \n \n•  Final completion of asphalt to commence April 2024, currently all inside roads are \ncompleted; \n \n•  Roosevelt Living Unit recreation yard is slated to be completed the summer of 2024; \n \n•  Replacing and updating various entry doors and overhead doors around the facility;  \n \n•  Updating of the Freon detection system is in progress; \n \n•  Continued implementing additional fixed cameras throughout the facility including both \ninternal and external cameras by replacing all the old security cameras in the CLS living \nunit. Additional cameras were procured during the reporting period. Overall, the additional \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 3 of 30\n \nnumber and quality of cameras are enhancing views and expanding into areas that were \npreviously blind spots; \n•  Continued to enhance the Music Arts Initiative by adding additional computer, software, \nand hardware components. There are also additional Apple work spaces for digital art and \ncontent creation. The initiative continues to display its therapeutic benefits and more and \nmore youth have been assisted by the Rec Leaders to engage in writing, performing, and \nrecording their own original music as well as music videos and promotional materials that \ncan leave with them when they transition out of the facility; \n•  Completed the electrical upgrade to the welding room that will facilitate more welding \nstations, better equipment, and better lighting for the welding program. Completed \nreplacing living unit boilers, water heaters, and electric panels. \nDefendants continue their commitment to improving the physical plant which improves the daily \nlives of staff and youth. The Monitor will continue to update the Court on physical  plant \nimprovements that increase the safety and quality of life for youth and staff.  \nEducation Observations \nMost students were in the school area at the time of the site visit. The physical appearance of the \nschool areas and classrooms were beautiful as usual. Youth and teachers were engaged in the \nclassrooms. Youth were in the gym playing basketball and were in woodshop with the teacher and \nstaff.  \n \nFor youth who are in Skills Development Program (“SDP”) Pause and Step 1, the school provides \na SPED teacher, and education services via electronic means (Chromebook) or with paper packets \ndepending on youth preference. In addition, the school provides a dedicated education assistant \nand youth attend class in the living unit. While in an SDP unit, High School Equivalency Diploma \n(“HSED”)  and graduate youth are provided the same school options as other youth so they can \nfully participate in the scheduled school day. Youth placed in the SDP participate in treatment \ngroups as assigned, but their education is self-guided either in the living unit or in their rooms with \nthe same access to teachers aids. \n  \nFor all general population youth and SDP Step 2 youth, all youth (except those who have \ngraduated) receive educational classes daily (Monday-Friday) in the school building. Youth who \nare enrolled in HSED classes, participate in those specific classes as well as physical education \nwith other youth, treatment groups, and opportunities for employment/work. Youth who are \ngraduates are assigned work during school hours and also participate in physical education and \ntreatment groups. \nA spreadsheet has been created that monitors AC placements for youth as an indicator for potential \nIEP updates. When a youth has 10 days/60 hours of AC placement during school hours a \nmanifestation determination meeting occurs to determine if the youth’s behavior is related to their \ndisability, and if there are modifications to the youth’s IEP that could help the student be more \nsuccessful.  \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 4 of 30\n \nCurrent staffing levels and population levels allow for most youth to regularly have education in \nthe school and off the living units and Defendants continue to implement the recommendations of \nthe educational consultants. Educational staff vacancy rate improved from 11 out of 22 vacant \npositions in the last reporting period to 9 out of 22 vacant positions.  Although slightly improved, \nthe vacancy rate is higher than the Monitor would like to see. Youth who must complete education \non the unit or in their rooms complained to Plaintiffs’ counsel that they do not learn much,  teachers \ndo not really teach any material and instruction was disjointed. Moreover, SDP youth confined to \ntheir rooms are expected to learn on Chromebooks or paper packets without live instruction while \nthey are in their rooms. Similarly, youth on Roosevelt who have a D or have graduated from school \ncomplained about having nothing at all to do during the day. \n \nLiving Unit Observations  \nThe  Monitoring  team  visited  each  cottage  that  youth  were  housed  in  during  the  site  visit \n(Roosevelt, Krueger, Dubois, Black Elk, Curtis, Rogers, Miller, Hughes, King, and Wells). \nOverall, the units, youth rooms, halls, living area, closets, and bathrooms were very clean. Youth \ndid complain to Plaintiff’s counsel that the toilets in Miller consistently smelled of mold prior to \nthe site visit.  \nYouth  were  respectful  when  interacting  with  the  Monitor,  Plaintiffs’  counsel,  and  facility \nleadership in general. All the living units were calm except Roosevelt. Youth were appropriately \nengaged with each other. Only two (2) youth were in their rooms (voluntarily).  \nThe unit populations ranged from two (2) to eight (8) youth. The Monitoring team saw staff \nengaging with youth during this site visit and the months preceding it during a review of videos on \nrandomly selected days. All the youth that the Monitoring team interacted with were respectful. \nYouth were less talkative to the Monitoring team than last site visit.  \nSince the time onsite for the Monitoring visit is limited, the Monitor always reviews videos of the \nliving units on random days and times to get a better idea of what youth and staff do on the units \nand whether staff are positioned near youth and interacting with youth in a positive way. The \nMonitor  reviewed  videos  during  the  reporting  period  to  view  living  units,  school,  outdoor \nrecreation, and other activities. In most instances (16 videos over several hours each) staff were \nengaged with youth when they were out of their rooms doing a variety of activities such as: \n•  Eating with youth at the tables; \n•  Watching television with youth; \n•  Playing cards with youth;  \n•  Conducting growth meetings; \n•  Youth in classrooms; \n•  Youth interacting with social workers, CARE team, mental health, medical staff, and \nvolunteers; \n•  Youth outside and in the gym playing basketball; \n•  Youth in the Douglass recreation center; \n•  Youth and staff were in the music lab; \n•  Youth were observed on telephones; \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 5 of 30\n \n•  Youth and staff were observed playing chess; \n•  Youth cleaning the units; \n•  Youth and staff doing art projects; \n•  Youth graduating with several staff congratulating him. \nOn review of video, staff were engaged with youth and positioned at or near tables with youth. The \nbody language and tone were positive from staff and youth in general on video.  \nDuring this site visit, the CLS youth were housed in the Wells and King Unit. There were seven (7) \nyouth total in CLS at the time of the site visit. CLS units and youth rooms were clean. The two (2) \nyouth assigned to King were out in the dayroom. One staff was playing cards with the two youths. \nThe Wells unit had five (5) youth assigned. Three (3) were on the unit and two (2) were in the \nschool. Youth on the unit were not permitted to attend school in the building due to their status in \nthe SDP but were sitting and talking. Most youth had positive attitudes and engaged with leadership \nand monitoring teams. There were adequate staffing levels in CLS.  \nThe LHS youth were housed in Roosevelt, Krueger, Dubois, Black Elk, Curtis, Rogers, Miller, \nand Hughes. All units were clean and organized. Two (2) youths were in their rooms voluntarily \non Curtis. Other youth on the units were eating lunch, in recreation, standing or sitting, talking, \nplaying cards, playing games with staff, and cleaning. The Miller unit had pictures of youth doing \ndifferent activities which created a nice environment. It would be great to expand this to the other \nunits. At the time of the site visit, the units had adequate direct-care staffing. \n \nThe Krueger and Wells living units housed youth in the SDP at LHS and CLS respectively during \nthis reporting period. The SDP is modified programming for youth who have engaged in physically \naggressive behavior, have presented a danger to others, and/or have exhibited behavior that caused \na major disruption to the facility. During the site visit, youth on these units were out of their rooms.  \n \nAs previously reported, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy “DBT” is provided to youth in the SDP \nincorporating individualized planning along with the in-person group work already assigned to \nyouth in the SDP so that they are engaging in DBT skills and receiving feedback on a daily basis. \nThe Program consists of three steps: (1) PAUSE, (2) Step 1, and (3) Step 2.  \n \nWhile on PAUSE youth must participate in all offered treatment meaningfully and to the best of \ntheir ability (determined by Treatment Team). The Treatment Team is heavily involved in the \nprogram, assisting the youth in identifying and addressing underlying motivations for anti-social \nor otherwise disruptive behavior, increasing insight and self-reflection, and learning/practicing \nskills to better respond to challenging emotions, experiences, and situations/environments. Youth \nwill initially process the incident/behaviors that necessitated an SDP placement through the \ncompletion of any applicable Behavior Chain Analysis (BCA). This information then informs each \nyouth’s individual treatment needs and goals created in consultation with the Treatment Team. \nYouth must show the ability to follow facility rules and expectations. Youth must demonstrate that \nthey are making efforts to meet their treatment goals. Youth will be removed from Modified \nProgramming once the Growth Team determines that the youth has demonstrated sufficient skill \ndevelopment to safely be removed from PAUSE. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 6 of 30\n \nYouth assigned to the SDP have their “Youth Plan” amended by PSU to specifically address their \nbehavior. Youth placed in this program are evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team in conjunction \nwith their weekly Growth Team. The Monitor observed youth engaged with their home units \nduring the transition period and observed growth meetings in video review. The Monitor saw \nseveral  examples of mental health and social workers engaging  with  youth.  PSU regularly \nidentifies triggers and documents those triggers and appropriate actions or responses for staff to \nfollow within the SDP’s. Although this information is accessible to unit direct care staff, it does \nnot appear that staff regularly access or review the information. Defendants will be implementing \na process to ensure staff are regularly reviewing each youth’s plan.  \n \nIn the last report, the Monitor was concerned with too much idle time. During this visit, youth did \nnot complain to the Monitoring team about being bored, but some did to Plaintiffs’ counsel \nparticularly youth on extended AC placements that lasted for days, or youth who had graduated \nand had nothing to do while in the unit on SDP or in Roosevelt. The Monitor saw youth engaged \nin some sort of activity during video reviews a substantial percentage of the time.  \n \nYouth Interviews  \n \nApproximately twenty-four (24) youth  were interviewed during the site visit  (formally and \ninformally) by the Monitor and approximately forty-five  (45) youth were interviewed extensively \nprior to, during, and after the site visit by Plaintiffs’ counsel. \nIn general, youth attitudes were positive in the Monitor’s opinion. The Monitoring team had an \nopportunity to talk to many of the youth present in the day rooms. None of the youth made complaints \nto the monitoring team outside of liking certain meals better than others. Youth were quieter with \nthe Monitoring team than on the last visit, which could just be a product of timing.  \nMultiple youth  reported to Plaintiffs’ counsel that they were isolated for prolonged periods of time \nwhile on operational and/or administrative confinement. Youth who were in AC pending transfer \nhad many complaints such as only being allowed to leave their room once a day for approximately \nthirty (30) minutes, being isolated from other youth, not allowed to shower every day, receiving \nonly one telephone call a day, not being provided with adequate education or mental health \nservices, wearing belt restraints and handcuffs during the limited out-time and not receiving  any \nrecreation. Youth complained about the impact on their mental health while in AC coupled with \nbeing bored, stressed, having nothing to do, and not knowing when they were going to be released \nfrom confinement.  \nYouth also reported repeatedly to Plaintiffs’ counsel that they have many concerns about the \nbehavior  motivation  system  (\"BMS”).  Youth  complained  that  particular  violations  were \nunfounded, overblown, and/or provoked by staff, and that it was unfair to have to keep restarting \nthe orientation program (which currently includes modified room confinement). Youth wish that \nthey would be given warnings before violations and feel violations are often arbitrary. Defendants \nneed  to  make  sure  through  a  rigorous  quality  assurance  process  that  the  system  is  being \nimplemented consistently and in accordance with training, policy, and procedure, especially with \nthe number of new staff onboarding and with the number of youth complaints of inconsistency.  \nData on youth at CLS/LHS during the monitor visit shows the aggregate percentage of prosocial \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 7 of 30\n \nversus noncompliant behaviors to be 83% prosocial and 17% noncompliant which is an appropriate \nratio.  \nYouth complained that family video visits did not work. Management confirmed there were issues \nwith the system or families did not know how to use the system, but they were able to work through \nthe issues. It was confirmed that youth did receive family video calls during this reporting period.  \n \nThe  Monitor  continues  to  encourage  staff  to  engage  youth  and  continue  to  have \nmeaningful/structured programming and activities. Defendants also need to provide more activities \nfor youth to do while confined in their rooms for any reason. The Defendants need to continue to \nfocus on gender-specific and culturally competent programming.  \n \nUpdate Type I Facility \n \nFollowing established Wisconsin Department of Administration (“DOA”) rules, the DOA opened \nthe project for bid seeking contractors to construct the new site as of March 25, 2024. Final bids \nare due May 8, 2024, meaning construction on the project can begin in the second half of 2024. The \nprojected  timeline  for  completion  of  the  Type  1  facility  located  at  W.  Clinton  Avenue  in \nMilwaukee remains on track for the second half of 2026. Moving youth to smaller facilities closer \nto their homes will facilitate greater family involvement, and connection to school and community, \nand will improve outcomes for youth. \n \nStaffing  \n \nThe staffing levels at LHS/CLS have improved during this reporting period. Staff vacancies have \nbeen significantly reduced; however, employee leaves continue to be relatively high during this \nreporting period at LHS/CLS and across DOC. The direct care staff vacancy rate has also improved \nin this reporting period. Defendants have created significant incentives for new and existing \nemployees to help with attracting new talent and retaining current staff.  \nThe Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor Advance staffing vacancy percentages are lower than the \nlast  reporting  period  (see  below).  There  are  311  total  positions  (“FTEs”)  at  LHS/CLS. \nApproximately 122 of these positions are “direct care” staff (Youth Counselor/Youth Counselor \nAdvanced, collectively  (“YC/YCA”). There has been significant improvement in the vacancy rate \nfor youth counselors and youth counselor advance this period. However, there is a shortage of \nTreatment Specialists (5 out of 7 are vacant) and teachers. Treatment Specialists 2 lead DBT \ngroups and are responsible for program PAUSES, behavior chains, other treatment responses to \nbehavior, and participate in Growth meetings. The teacher vacancy rate is lower than the last \nreporting period (9 vacancies), or 40% of positions, which is still higher than the Monitor hoped. \nWith limited educators, Defendants will have continued difficulty with increasing the quality and \nquantity of education for youth. These vacancies are having a negative impact on the youth. \nRecruiting in general is still a challenge due to the location of LHS/CLS, uncertainty as to when/if \nLHS/CLS will close, and for educators, the year-round school calendar and thus, hiring needs to \ncontinue.  \n  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 8 of 30\n \n                 Position  Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of Vacancy Rate % as of \n \nApril 30, 2023  October 1, 2023  February 1, 2024 \n \n     \nYouth   14% (13 out of 94)  6% (6 out of 94)  3% (3 out of 97) \nCounselor \nYouth  25% (7 out of 28)  25% (7 out of 28)  0% (0 out of 27) \nCounselor \nAdv. \nTeacher  36% (8 out of 22)  50% (11 out of 22)  40% (9 out of 22) \nSocial \n0% (0 out of 6)  0% (0 out of 6)  28.5% (2 out of 7) \nWorker \nRecruiting efforts for this period include: \n \n•  New State of Wisconsin Compensation Plan; \n•  4% General Wage Adjustment for all employees (provided they meet the requirements); \n•  YC/YCA received base pay increase of $4/hour; \n•  YC/YCA placed in new pay structure; \n•  NC 2 sign-on bonus extended for 1 year; and \n•   UWSP All Career/Internship Fair. \n \nDefendants continue to focus on staff wellness. The Critical Incident Response Team (“CIRT”) \nholds a refresher meeting every quarter. Additional staff wellness activities included: \n \n•  Jeans and football apparel are allowed for every gameday and Friday from season start \nthrough the Superbowl; \n•  Caramel Apples for all staff on both keys; \n•  Pink day for breast cancer awareness; \n•  Purple day for domestic violence awareness; \n•  Treats for teammates fundraiser; \n•  Halloween costumes on Halloween;  \n•  Stress Awareness week we handed out coffee, cocoa, and tea to staff on both keys; \n•  Made veterans magnets for all veterans; \n•  Pancake breakfast fundraiser; \n•  Handed out treats to staff that had to work on Thanksgiving;  \n•  Chicken soup cookoff; \n•  Staff Secret Santa; \n•  Ugly Sweater Days; \n•  Winter Drawing Event;  \n•  Handed out goodie bags to all staff; \n•  Put out Treats for staff working Christmas Eve and Christmas Day; \n•  Continued to hand out Christmas goodie bags to staff; and \n•  Staff family night Valentines Day event for both work keys. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 9 of 30\n \nThe Monitoring team spoke to over twenty-six (26) staff. Staff morale was exceptionally good \noverall at the time of the site visit. A review of video over the reporting period showed staff \nregularly engaging with youth. Staff were just as talkative on this site visit. Staff were extremely \nfriendly from the moment you walked through the front door. The new staff who were on-the-job \ntraining expressed their excitement to begin their positions, stated the training was good, and \ngenuinely were happy with their decision to join the team. Staff also said to the Monitoring team \nthat they felt safe at the facility and loved their jobs. Staff had one complaint which was they \nmissed all the overtime they used to get. This is a good complaint to have because this means that \nstaff are not exhausted or overworked and will better engage with youth in a positive way.  \nDefendants have made staff wellness a major focus, which is evident in the positive attitudes of \nstaff. A major component of staff wellness is ensuring staff feel as safe as possible and are properly \ntrained for the environment and youth demographics. Defendants have improved in this area based \non observations in person and on video review and conversations with staff. \nUse of Force Reviews \n \nThe Monitor reviewed several uses of force incidents during this reporting period. Appropriate \nforce was used in each instance. The CARE team was present to attempt to de-escalate the situation \nin several instances. In the last report the Monitor encouraged the Defendants to fully implement \nthe Mandt system strategies and techniques designed to support de-escalation and lower the \npotential of staff or youth injury. As of January 1, 2024 The Mandt System became the primary \nmodel. In January of 2024, DJC announced it would no longer be utilizing or sending academy \nrecruits through training in the Principles of Subject Control (“POSC”) curriculum and yearly \nphysical intervention refreshers for current staff will be Mandt only. \n \nDJC began the process of implementing Mandt long before its official replacement of POSC in \nJanuary 2024. Now it serves as the sole model for prevention and de-escalation that staff can use \nto safely manage behaviors in our juvenile correctional setting. The focus of The Mandt System is \non building healthy relationships between all stakeholders in human services settings to facilitate \nthe development of an organizational culture that provides the emotional, psychological, and \nphysical  safety  needed  to  teach  new  behaviors  that  can  replace  behaviors  that  are  labeled \n‘challenging.’ The Mandt goal, which DJC has embraced, is to foster a workplace culture that is \nsupportive. \n \nSome of the ways DJC has measured the effectiveness of Mandt implementation is by looking at \nthings such as workplace injuries, restraint use (physical & mechanical), and the overall safety of \nboth staff and youth. In a two-year comparison of 2022 and 2023 there has been a 44% decrease \nin the use of mechanical restraints, a 32% decrease in use of force incidents, and a 50% decrease \nin AC placements. There has also been a reduction in workplace injuries. Although incident data \ncan fluctuate month to month due to complex precipitating factors, overall, as a facility, there is \nan overall decrease in the frequency, duration, and use of both physical and mechanical restraints. \nSignificantly, when comparing PbS survey data of staff who reportedly feared for their safety \nworking at the facility, there has been a dramatic improvement. That statistic has decreased from \nan all-time high on the LHS side near 80% in 2019, to 36% in 2022, down all the way to \napproximately 16% in October 2023, after Mandt implementation. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 10 of 30\n \nQuality Assurance (“QA”) \n \nThe Quality Assurance Program at LHS/CLS continues to be second to none. DJC has a program \nthat other jurisdictions should model. Critical information is readily available to the leadership \nwhich allows them to make proactive, data driven decisions that increases the safety of youth and \nstaff. The QA team has greatly expanded data collection and quality using Guardian RFID during \nthis and last reporting periods. During the last reporting period, Defendants developed data to \ncomply with the various sections of this Court Order. The dashboard was refined during the last \nreporting period. The dashboard is now fully developed. This is an especially useful tool to assess \ncompliance with this Court Order.  \n \nAdministrative Code Revisions Update \n \nDJC’s Administrative Code committee continues moving both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC \nChapter 373 forward. The Department of Corrections submitted its final draft proposed rule order \nfor CR 24-003 (DOC Chapter 376), relating to Safety in Type 1 Secured Correctional Facilities, \nto the legislature March 1, 2024. The statement of scope for this rule was approved by the Governor \non August 26, 2021, and approved by Secretary Kevin Carr on September 29, 2021. The legislature \nnoted that they officially received the rule into the record on March 5, 2024, beginning their 30-\nday passive review period prior to Legislative Committee Hearings scheduled for April 10, 2024. \n \nRevisions to the draft of Chapter 373 have been expedited during the reporting period in order for \n373 to remain in keeping with provisions from 376, specifically those prohibiting punitive \nconfinement. The latest round of changes is now back with the DOC’s Office of Legal Counsel \nfor final review and formatting before its submission to the legislature can be completed similar to \n376.  \n \nDJC’s advancement of both DOC Chapter 373 and DOC Chapter 376 during the reporting period \nrepresents significant progress toward having the amendments adopted.  \n \nPolicy Updates \n \nThe DJC Policy Committee continues to review and update policies of note to the facility. The \nfollowing policies have been reviewed through the policy committee and approved  by \nadministration: \n \n•  100.07.04 – Tornados  \n•  100.07.05 – Emergency Procedures for Chemical Spills, Gas leaks, or similar \nemergencies  \n•  100.04.09 – American with Disabilities Act  \n•  100.04.01 – DNA Collection and Documentation  \n•  100.01.16 - Training and Conference Requests and Travel Reimbursement  \n•  100.01.10 – Review by Committee on Inmate and Youth Deaths  \n•  100.01.01 - Issuance of DJC Policies and Procedures  \n•  300.01.08 – Facility tours  \n•  300.02.14 - Sale of Facility Goods at DJC Facilities  \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 11 of 30\n \n•  300.04.06 – Mail  \n•  300.05.16 – Contraband  \n•  300.08.01 – Death of Youth  \n•  300.08.09 – Emergency Services CPR and AED Use  \n•  500.10.31 – Clinical Performance Enhancement  \n•  500.30.01 – Injury and Significant Illness Notification  \n•  500.30.20 – Involuntary Administration of Psychotropic Medication  \n•  500.30.21 – Voluntary Psychotropic Medication  \n•  500.60.03 – Tuberculosis Testing Program – Employee  \n•  500.60.05 – Employee Hepatitis B Vaccination Program  \n \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nBelow is the Monitor’s assessment of compliance with the consent decree.  \n \nRoom Confinement \n \n1.  Punitive Confinement. \n \na.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g) effective \nimmediately  upon  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, no punitive room confinement shall exceed seven days. \nDefendants shall calculate the seven-day period by including both \npre-hearing and post-hearing room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Data shows that out of 176 \nadministrative confinement uses reviewed, four (4) incidents lacked detail in articulating \nreasons for the placement on administrative confinement and staff were issued formal job \ninstructions but were not found to be punitive. Of note, fifteen (15) youth were transferred \nto MJTC and only 33% of those were transferred from the status of “AC pending transfer”, \nwhile  67% were transferred from general population which is an open day room.  \nDefendants need to continue to examine their use of all forms of confinement and review \nincidents to ensure that staff are not using any form of confinement as punitive confinement \nincluding High-Risk Program PAUSE stage. Confinement is not appropriate during the \nPAUSE stage of the High-Risk Program if youth behavior does not warrant confinement. \nThe Monitor continues to recommend that the Defendants reassess confinement for youth \non PAUSE and all confinement placements. Additionally, for part of this reporting period, \nfor youth who were confined in AC pending transfer, Defendants rotated youth in and out \nof their room with restraints. For the last few months of this reporting period, youth were \nno longer rotating in and out of their rooms at all during AC pending transfer; nor were they \npermitted to talk with other youth or receive daily basic programming like recreation, \neducation, showers, etc. The Parties will be further discussing this issue. Defendants did \ninform the Monitor that they will resume the practice of rotating youth in and out of their \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 12 of 30\n \nrooms. The Monitor also stated that youth should be provided with recreation, showers, \nphone calls, meaningful education, and additional out time when youth’s behavior allows (in \nconsultation with mental health). Defendants need to limit any extended room confinement \nsuch as this, especially for youth with mental health needs. Defendants may be in partial \ncompliance during the next reporting period if they continue the practices identified in this \nparagraph. \n \nb.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), \nEffective seven months after entry of the Court’s order incorporating \nthis Agreement, punitive room confinement shall be limited to three \ndays, including both pre-hearing and post-hearing room   confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See, previous response.  \n \nc.  Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C) (3) (g), effective \nten  months  after  entry  of  the  Court's  order  incorporating  this \nAgreement, punitive room confinement shall be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. See, previous response.  \n2.  Administrative Confinement. Administrative confinement may only  be \nused for a youth who poses a serious risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers. Subject to the terms and provisions of Section V(C)(3)(g), effective \nsix months after entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, an \ninitial period of administrative confinement may not exceed four hours for \na youth posing a risk of imminent physical harm to others. When the youth \nis in room confinement to prevent a risk of imminent physical harm to \nothers, Defendants shall engage in visual checks at least every 30 minutes, \nas specified in current policy, and shall provide intensive mental health \nservices designed to return the youth safely to the general population. If at \nany point the youth no longer pose a risk of imminent physical harm, he or \nshe  must  be  immediately  returned  to  general  population.  Time  in \nadministrative  confinement  may  exceed  four  hours  only  under  the \nfollowing circumstances: \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The use of AC was lower for  LHS \nthis  period  but  significantly  higher  for  CLS.  Seven  (7)  CLS  youth  were  confined \nadministratively for more than four (4) hours. Approximately the same number of youths \nwere confined for over (4) four hours during this reporting period for LHS. However, there \nwere instances where LHS youth were confined for longer periods of times pending transfer \nto other facilities due to bed availability. Defendants need to continue to examine use of all \nforms of confinement and review incidents to ensure that staff are not using any form of \nconfinement as punitive confinement including the SDP PAUSE stage. Confinement is not \nappropriate during the PAUSE stage of the SDP Program unless youth’s behavior warrants \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 13 of 30\n \nit. Defendants need to reconsider confining youth during the PAUSE stage of the program. \nAdditionally, when there are extended periods of time for youth transferring to MJTC or \nanother facility, Defendants rotated youth pending transfer in and out of their room with \nrestraints. These are very limited circumstances however; the Monitor recommends the \nparties discuss this further and that Defendants document any restraints as required by the \nConsent Decree.  \n \nMay 2023 \nCLS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 117 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 46 uses of A.C. Average 163 minutes. Three (3) youth over 4 hours. \n \nJune 2023 \nCLS: 4 uses of A.C. Average 114 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 16 uses of A.C. Average 1631 minutes. Six (6) youth over 4 hours. One \n(1) youth 2180 minutes (approximately 36 hours). \n \nJuly 2023 \nCLS: 14 uses of A.C. Average 127 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 30 uses of A.C. Average 148 minutes. One (1) youth over 4 hours. \n \nAugust 2023 \nCLS: 3 uses of A.C. Average 54 minutes.

One \n(1) youth in for 6905 minutes 4.79 days,  one (1) youth in for 10593 minutes \n(7.35 days). \n \nSeptember 2023 \nCLS: 8 uses of A.C. Average 115 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 27 uses of A.C. Average 236 minutes. One (1) youth over 4 hours. \n \nOctober 2023 \nCLS: 14 uses of A.C. Average 112 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 11 uses of A.C. Average 117 minutes. One (1) youth over 4 hours. One \n(1) youth 720 minutes. \n \nNovember 2023 \nCLS: 12 uses of A.C. Average 125 minutes. No youth over 4 hours. \nLHS: 28 uses of A.C. Average 884 minutes. Two (2) youth over 4 hours. 15, \n020 minutes, 6085 minutes. \n \nDecember 2023 \nCLS: 26 uses of A.C. Average 117 minutes. One (1) youth over 4 hours. 430 \nminutes. \nLHS: 25 uses of A.C. Average 433 minutes. One  (1) youth over 4 hours. 7871 \nminutes.  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 14 of 30\n \nJanuary 2024 \nCLS: 61 uses of A.C. Average 180 minutes. Six (6)  youth over 4 hours. (six \nunique youth accounted for 61 uses). \nLHS: 25 uses of A.C. Average 433 minutes. One (1) youth  over 4 hours (131 \nhours). \n \nFebruary 2024 \nCLS: 27 uses of A.C. Average 131 minutes. No  youth over 4 hours.  \nLHS: 18 uses of A.C. Average 519 minutes. Four (4) youth  over 4 hours. One \n(1) youth for 85 hours. \n \nThe Monitor was able to assess compliance with 30-minute checks as data was readily \navailable during this site visit. 97.9%- 99.70% of checks were completed within 30 minutes \nduring this reporting period. The Monitor reviewed video footage for random days and times \n(25 reviews) and Defendants were 100% compliant with completing the checks in accordance \nwith policy. Staff did an outstanding job and should be commended for their continued \ndiligence in ensuring youth safety while in their rooms.  \n \na.  Administrative confinement may be extended four hours with one \nadditional four-hour extension thereafter (for a total of up to 12 hours) \nwhen: \n \ni.  A  psychologist,  psychology  associate  or  psychiatrist \nrecommends continued confinement because the youth \npose a risk of imminent physical harm to others, and \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were seventeen (17) \nyouth confined for over four (4) hours during this reporting period (see response in previous \nquestion). The only  instance that continued beyond four hours that did not receive a \ndocumented four-hour extension approval was a youth was determined would be moved to \nAC pending transfer status. The number of overall placements is consistent with the last \nreporting period.  \nDefendants need to continue to focus on reducing AC overall. Defendants created excellent \nquality assurance measures and data. \n \nii.  A plan is commenced to either promptly return the youth to \ngeneral population or transfer the youth to another facility. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Fourteen (14) youth were \nplaced on extended placement in administrative confinement pending transfer out of the \nfacility on 16 occasions (7-MJTC, 3 Lincoln County SD, 1 adult commitment transferred to \nthe division of adult institutions, 1 juvenile commitment expired (release), and 4 no longer \nposed a threat so although there was a plan commenced to transfer, the youths’ behavior \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 15 of 30\n \nwas such that they could remain at LHS, 1 remained on AC).  There were plans commenced \nto return the youth to general population/transfer to another facility. PSU was involved in \nall instances. Providing youth on AC pending transfer status with daily out of room time for \nprograms, education, recreation, showers, etc., will also provide additional opportunities for \nthe PSU to continuously reassess the AC pending transfer status for potential return to \ngeneral population pending transfer.  \n \n \nb.  Administrative confinement time limits may be tolled from 8 pm to 8 \nam. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Time is being tolled from 8 \nP.M. to 8 A.M.  \nc.   Administrative confinement may only be extended beyond 24 \nhours to effectuate transfer of the youth to another facility under a \ncommenced plan. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Fourteen (14) youth were \nplaced on extended placement in administrative confinement pending transfer out of the \nfacility on 16 occasions (7-MJTC, 3 Lincoln County SD, 1 adult commitment transferred \nto the division of adult institutions, 1 juvenile commitment expired (release), and 4 no \nlonger posed a threat so although there was a plan commenced to transfer, the youths’ \nbehavior was such that they could remain at LHS, 1 remained on AC).  There were plans \ncommenced to return the youth to general population/transfer to another facility. PSU was \ninvolved in all instances. However, Defendants should continue to assess confinement \nplacements for youth confined while pending transfer. Defendants may  be in partial \ncompliance during the next reporting period. See comments in the above section. \n \nd.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all situations involving \nroom confinement of any youth based on the risk of harming others \nand shall supersede any rule or policy to the contrary. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \n3.  Youth at imminent risk of serious self-harm. Effective immediately \nUpon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement, Defendants \nshall amend DJC Pol policy #500. 70.24 as set forth in Appendix A and \nshall treat youth at risk of self-harm in compliance with that amended \npolicy. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. DJC  Clinical Observation \npolicy 500.70.24 is being utilized. The plans developed are detailed and comprehensive. Only \nyouth who are at imminent risk of serious self-harm to themselves/risk of self-harm will be \nplaced in observation status. There were 58 youth in observation status this period. Youth \nwere regularly seen by mental health per documentation. The Monitor will continue to \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 16 of 30\n \nreview and monitor the practice.  \n \n4.  Conditions of Room Confinement. Effective immediately upon entry of \nthe Court's order incorporating this Agreement, the following conditions \nshall apply to youth in any form of room confinement: \n \na.  Any cell designated to house youth in room confinement must be \nsuicide resistant and protrusion free. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor would not \ndeem any room in any facility as being “suicide proof,” however there are safety and \nsecurity measures that can be put into place to reduce the risk of suicides and to make the \nrooms more suicide resistant. All youth are housed in renovated units. Youth rooms were \noverall exceptionally clean. The rooms were very organized allowing staff to clearly see \ninto the room, perform room searches more effectively, and ensure to the extent possible \nthat there are no dangerous items in room.  \nAs stated in every report, while not required by the Court Order, the Monitor, the JDAI \nstandards, PREA standards, NCCHC, ACA standards, and the Best Practice Model \nrecommends increasing the frequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 \nminutes when youth are confined to their rooms, and checks must be done properly. \nHowever, based on the language of this section, Defendants are in substantial compliance. \n \nb.  Youth in room confinement shall have prompt access to water, \ntoilet facilities, and hygiene supplies, either in their rooms or upon \nrequest to a staff member via intercom or some other accessible and \nconstantly monitored form of communication within approximately \n15 minutes of such request. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Youth did not complain to the \nMonitor or Plaintiffs’ counsel about access to water, regular hygiene supplies, or nighttime \ntoilet usage. Youth made several complaints regarding room confinement to Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel which is detailed in the narrative section of this report.  \n \nc.  Staff must notify a PSU staff member as soon as possible, and no later \nthan two hours after placement, when a youth is placed in room \nconfinement. A youth must have access to any needed mental health \ntreatment while in room confinement. During the time that a youth is \nin room confinement, staff shall engage in challenges intervention \ntechniques designed to return the youth to general population as soon \nas possible. PSU interventions during this time shall not consist only \nof conversations with youth through a locked door. \n \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 17 of 30\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Defendants  continue  to \nproperly document who from PSU was notified, time of notification, and the intervention \ntechnique utilized with the youth.  \n \nExamples of the crisis intervention techniques used with youth when confined can include, \nbut are not limited to: processing of the incident, coping ahead/safety plans, in the moment \nskills  coaching/practice  of  DBT  skills  including  mindfulness,  recommitment  to  goals, \nvalidation,  time  away  from  stressors  or  time  for  reflection/refusing,  fostering  insight, \nimplementation  of  established  Youth  Plan,  assistance  problem-solving,  increase  self-\nawareness/awareness of body sensations as indicators, Behavior Chain Analysis (formal and \ninformal) and Thinking Report, encourage self-reflection/identify vulnerabilities, consistent \nredirection/limits, Behavior Intervention Protocol fostering insight/skill identification/skill \npractice, and plans to address conflict/safety/skills practice. \n \nClinicians are on-site for 6 hours each Saturday and Sunday. There is PSU coverage from \n0730-2000 Monday-Friday; weekends at least 6 hours per day. Youth are seen per their MH-\ncode (per policy: MH-2 at least every two weeks; MH-1 at least once monthly); however, \nMH-0 youth are seen at least once monthly as well as opposed to per request as indicated by \npolicy. Despite the minimum requirements, youth are seen far more frequently by PSU staff, \nfor many, often on a daily basis. Youth continue to have contact with PSU at Growth Teams \nas well as in DBT groups. As of May 2022, additional daily rounds by PSU staff are also \nconducted on all units when operational confinement youth are in more than two groups. \nYouth in SDP are seen daily for rounds. Clinicians working on the weekend, have a priority \nof  service  provision  which  include  assessing/meeting  with  youth  on  Administrative \nConfinement,  meeting  with  youth  on  observation  status,  attending  to  any  crises,  and \nconducting rounds and check-ins with youth. There are typically quite a few staff referrals, \nand these youth are seen as well. The only time spent in non-direct contact with youth on the \nweekend  is  for  documenting  on  the  AC  and  observation  placements  (other  clinical \ndocumentation is completed on Monday).  \n \nThe Monitor continues to suggest that PSU increase the hours in which they are physically \npresent on weekends and evening hours to engage youth in a meaningful way during this \ntime. Because confinement can create or exacerbate mental health problems, treatment is \ngoing to be even more critical as the population continues to remain higher if the Defendants \nare confining youth to their rooms for any reason. The Monitor also suggests that specific \nPSU clinicians should work with the same youth to establish continuity (when possible) and \nshould primarily work on the units. If possible, Defendants should consider putting PSU \nstaff offices on the unit like they did with the Supervisors’ offices. This will reinforce to the \nyouth and staff that they are “one team” servicing the youth and could be readily present \nto mitigate any situations. The Monitor saw many contacts with PSU during video review \nof random days of this reporting period.  \n \nd.  Any youth placed in room confinement for whom there is not \nalready a mental health evaluation must have such an evaluation as \nsoon as possible, and in any event no later than 24 hours after being \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 18 of 30\n \nplaced in room confinement. If a youth is identified with a mental \nhealth need (a mental health code designation of MH-1, MH-2a, \nMH-2b, or ID), placements in room confinement will be reviewed \nby a PSU staff member to determine whether that placement is a \ncontraindication to the youth 's mental health or if other options will \nadequately protect the youth or staff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Documentation/data shows \nthat evaluations are completed (if there is not already a mental health evaluation) within 24 \nhours after being placed in room confinement. Youth on operational confinement are being \nseen by PSU and evaluated for contraindication. The documentation has improved, and the \nMonitor has seen documentation for youth on operational confinement and whether they are \nevaluated for contraindication. There were no instances of contraindication documented \nduring this review period. \n \n     e.  Staff must visually and in person check safety of youth pursuant to \ncurrent policy at least every 30 minutes in all cases, and contemporaneously \nrecord the actual time of such checks in a log kept for that purpose. Staff who \nfail to make such checks or who falsify such records may be subject to discipline. \nAny youth placed in room confinement for any period in excess of 24 hours shall \nreceive daily contact with a mental health provider. This contact shall be face-\nto-face unless, due to staffing limitations, no PSU staff is personally available, \nin which case it may occur by phone or video conferencing. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE:  Defendants  were  between \n97.9%-99.70% compliant with meeting the thirty (30) minute safety and security check \ntimeframe.  Quality  assurance  measures  are  in  place  and  when  necessary,  formal \ninvestigations occur. There were no formal job instructions for not completing safety and \nsecurity checks. The Monitor observed safety/wellness checks being completed on various \ndays/times on every unit during this reporting period and observed no instances in which \nstaff did not make visual contact with youth per policy- 100% of the checks were compliant. \nStaff met or exceeded the 30-minute timeframe, looked into room, and the intervals were \nstaggered.  \n \nPSU staff do visit youth daily when on site and are available 24/7 if needed by phone. The \nMonitor continues to encourage more on-site time in the evenings and weekends doing \ngroups  and  having  one-on-one  sessions  with  youth.  The  Monitor  also  continues  to \nrecommend that PSU staff, like Supervisors, have offices on the unit and work with the same \nyouth when possible.  \n \nWhile not required by the Court Order, the Monitor continues to recommend increasing the \nfrequency of safety/welfare checks to a minimum of every 15 minutes when youth are \nconfined to their rooms as this is supported by JDAI standards, PREA standards, NCCHC, \nACA standards, and is the Best Practice Model. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 19 of 30\n \n \ne.  Any youth in room confinement shall have property items similar to \nor the same as items allowed in general population. Specific items \nof property may be restricted as needed for safety of the youth and \nstaff on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions will be temporary \nin nature until these items can be safely returned to the youth. A \nSupervising Youth Counselor or Unit Supervisor shall review any \nprope1ty restrictions on a daily basis and document the review. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  While  youth  are  on \noperational room confinement/modified programming, regardless of level in the behavior \nmanagement program or their status on SDP, the Monitor recommends that youth be \nprovided with activities to do that would encourage physical movement in rooms, arts, crafts, \nmusic etc. Based on the Monitor’s recommendation, as of February 2023, youth on SDP \ntransitioned to level “C” from “D” affording youth better hygiene products and fans. Thus, \nall youth on level C receive the same property regardless of where they are housed. Youth \ncomplained to Plaintiffs’ counsel about having nothing to do in their rooms. Defendants \nshould continue to evaluate items allowed in youth rooms to keep them occupied. \n \ng.  Youth in room confinement shall receive: \n \nAll regularly scheduled social worker visits, mental health \n1. \nservices, and other health services. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Social worker visits, mental \nhealth services, and other health services are provided. The Defendants created a report with \nunderlying documentation  in order to more efficiently assess compliance levels Defendants \nneed to ensure there is accountability with respect to the services provided by the social \nworkers, mental and healthcare workers.  \n \nii.      Any  rehabilitative  programming  (e.g.,  Aggression \nReplacement Training, Juvenile Cognitive Intervention \nProgram, etc.) that was scheduled or in process before \nplacement in room confinement. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants moved to smaller \ngroup-based treatment to youth where group participation was provided on the units. This \ncontinues. The Defendants created a report with underlying documentation  in order to \nassess  compliance  levels  more  easily.  Documentation  showed  that  Defendants  are  in \nsubstantial compliance.  \n \n  \niii.         Educational  services with  the general  population to  the \nextent practicable. If attending educational services with the \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 20 of 30\n \ngeneral population proves unworkable due to an immediate \nand substantial threat of physical harm or an unreasonable \nrisk of significant disruption to classroom instruction, youth \nin room confinement shall receive alternative educational \nservices on days that the general population receives such \nservices. Defendants shall ensure special education services \nfor all eligible youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. The education consultants completed \ntheir  report  which  included  recommendations.  The  education  department  has  made \nnumerous updates during the reporting period to school services (described in the education \nsection of this report).  \n \niv.  Additional \"out time\" for gross motor exercise and social \ninteraction. Defendants shall permit youth to talk to peers \nduring such \"out time\" unless such conversations pose an \nimmediate and substantial threat of physical harm to another \nperson. Sensory stimulation shall also be available during \n\"out  time,\"  unless  such  activities  cause  immediate  and \nsubstantial disruption or risk of physical harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE. Staffing levels are  appropriate this \nperiod. In general, youth are regularly out of their rooms from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. The Monitor \nregularly saw youth conversing with other youth during out time when the youth were on the \nunits in the day room. During the last reporting period, Defendants implemented a change \nfor youth who are on AC pending transfer when the transfer is delayed. When there are \nextended periods of time for youth transferring to MJTC or other placements, Defendants \nrotated youth pending transfer in and out of their room with restraints in order for them to \nreceive their 30 hours per week and 3 hours of out times. The alternative would be for youth \nto  be  confined  continuously  for  days  pending  transfer.  Defendants  reverted  back  to \ncontinuously confining youth in AC pending transfer. Although some discussions were had \nbetween the Defendants, Plaintiff’s Counsel, and the Monitoring team, additional discussions \nneed to take place and the Monitor recommends changes to the current practice.  \n \nv.  Meals out of the cell, absent an immediate and substantial \nthreat of physical harm to another person from the youth \neating that meal out of the cell. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were twenty-three \n(23) documented instances of youth eating in their rooms which were staff imposed based \non substantial threat of physical harm during this reporting period which is almost 50% \nless from last period. Defendants can track when youth eat meals in their rooms and based \non reports that the Monitor reviewed, it appears these instances were justified.  \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 21 of 30\n \nvi.    Minimum \"out time\" from the cell of at least 30 hours per week \nand at least 3 hours per day. Time in general population on a given day \nshall be credited to those hours. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  During  this  reporting  period \n97.96% of LHS youth and 100% of CLS youth received 30 hours of out time per week. 98.9% \nof LHS youth and 99.5% of CLS youth received at least 3 hours of out time per day. The \nMonitor recommends reconsidering this practice when staffing levels allow for all youth on \nPAUSE to remain out of their rooms (i.e., not confined on PAUSE). \n \nDefendants now track out time on an individual basis using RFID, so the Monitor can \ndetermine how many youths are not getting at least three (3) hours of out-time per day or \nthirty (30) hours per week independently. Once the practice changes for youth in pending \ntransfer and Program PAUSE, Defendants are close to being in substantial compliance with \nthis provision. As addressed in previous provisions, it is imperative for youth placed in AC \npending transfer to receive daily programming consistent with meeting the out of room time \nrequirements of this provision. Furthermore, providing the out of room time will provide \nadditional opportunities for PSU to continuously reassess the youth for potential return to \ngeneral population.  \n \n5.  Notification of Rights. Within 15 minutes of a youth's placement in room \nconfinement, facility staff shall orally inform the youth of his or her rights \nregarding grievances and appeals. Within one hour of a youth's placement in \nroom confinement, facility staff shall provide the youth with written notice \nof his or her rights regarding grievances and appeals. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  DOC-2942A  was \ndeveloped and moved into J-Tracker operation designed to draw the required information \nfor the written report directly from the incident debrief form, as soon as the SYC overseeing \nthe incident has completed their required fields for a major incident. Once the SYC has \ncompleted their required fields, a response assignment can be generated by the SYC to the \nunit staff where the youth on AC is housed. Upon receipt of the response assigned, unit staff \nare then able to generate the DOC-2942A and deliver it to the youth. The new process and \nforms have been drafted into an updated Incident Debrief procedure. There is a photo \nuploaded showing staff giving the notice to youth with time stamp.  \n \n6.  Documentation. Whenever a youth  is  placed in room confinement, \nfacility staff shall create a written report documenting the necessity of \nroom  confinement,  the  less  restrictive  measures  attempted  before \nplacement in room confinement, and the length of time the youth spent \nin room confinement. The youth must be promptly provided with this \nreport immediately upon its completion. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Court Order requires \ndocumentation of all forms of room confinement, and Defendants are documenting this \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 22 of 30\n \nconsistently, including when less restrictive means were attempted.  \n \nB.  OC-Spray and Other Chemical Agents \n \n1.  OC reduction plan. Effective immediately upon entry of the Court's order \nincorporating this Agreement, the Defendants shall continue to implement OC-\nSpray reduction plans, attached, and incorporated hereto as Append ix B, as \noutlined in the preliminary injunction. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \n2.  Prohibition on use of OC-Spray and other Chemical Agents. Subject to the \nterms and provisions of Section V(C) (3)(g), within twelve (12) months of entry \nof the Court 's order incorporating this Agreement, the use of OC spray and \nother chemical agents will be prohibited. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. OC has been eliminated.  \n \nC.  Mechanical Restraints. The following provision shall be effective immediately \nupon entry of the Court's order incorporating this Agreement: \n \n1.  Prohibition on types and uses of mechanical restraints. \n \na.  Under all circumstances, there is a presumption that youth shall not \nbe mechanically restrained. \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:    SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  The  Monitor  did  not \npersonally see any youth in mechanical restraints during site visit. Data and documentation \nshow that there was significant decrease in use of mechanical restraints for LHS. The Monitor \nreviewed several uses of force videos and there were no inappropriate uses of mechanical \nrestraints observed. Defendants do need to monitor any use of restraints while youth are \nawaiting transfer to another facility. Defendants need to ensure that they are documenting all \nuses of restraints, including those implemented for youth whose AC has been extended \npending transfer. \n \nb.  Restraints may only be used if staff determine that they are the \nleast restrictive means of addressing an imminent threat of physical \nharm to self or others and must be removed immediately when the \nyouth regain control and when the threat of harm or the safety \nconcern has abated. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 23 of 30\n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  Below  is  the  number  of \nmechanical restraints uses in LHS and CLS the prior and current reporting periods. \n \nUses of mechanical restraints LHS: \n \nFebruary 2023:             21 uses \nMarch 2023:                    2 uses \nApril 2023:                    12 uses \nMay 2023:              15 uses \nJune 2023:                       9 uses (1 over 45 mins) \nJuly 2023:                        8 uses (2 over 45 mins) \nAugust 2023:                 10 uses (1 over 45 mins) \nSeptember 2023:    2 uses  (1 over 45 mins) \nOctober 2023:                  2 uses \nNovember 2023:              0 uses \nDecember 2023:     4 uses \nJanuary 2024:                 1 use \nFebruary 2024:               4 uses (1 over 45 mins) \n \nUses of mechanical restraints CLS \n \nFebruary 2023:     1 use \nMarch 2023:                    4 uses \nApril 2023:                1 use \nMay 2023:      1 use \nJune 2023:                       1 use \nJuly 2023:                        4 uses \nAugust 2023:                   0 uses \nSeptember 2023:    0 uses \nOctober 2023:      0 uses \nNovember 2023:             0 uses \nDecember 2023:    1 use \nJanuary 2024:                7 uses (1 over 45 minutes) \nFebruary 2024               1 use \n \nDefendants have reduced the use of mechanical restraints in LHS compared to the last four-\nmonth reporting period. The use of mechanical restraints in CLS is higher than the last \nreporting period. \n \nc.  No mechanical restraint device other than handcuffs may be used \non youth while they are in the facility, except: \n \ni.  Mechanical restraints may be used when ordered by PSU to \nattempt to prevent active self-harm. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) use of \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 24 of 30\n \ntrans board placement ordered by PSU during this reporting period. Defendants have \ndeveloped policy and procedure, training, and QA measures. \n \nii.         Mechanical restraints may be used if the youth poses an \n             immediate and substantial threat of physical harm to others. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There was one (1) use of \ntrans board placement ordered by PSU during this reporting period. Defendants have \ndeveloped policy and procedure, training, and QA measures.  \n \n iii.          During transportation, the facility may use handcuffs and, in \nrare  instances  when  necessary  for  articulated  reasons \nnecessary to prevent an imminent threat of harm to youth \nand/or staff, additional restraints such as waist chains or leg \nrestraints. When youth are being transported for release to a \nnon-locked environment, there shall be a presumption that \nrestraints are not used. Restraints may be used during such \ntransportation to prevent a threat of harm to youth and/or \nstaff. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. See above. \n \nd.  Mechanical restraints shall never be used for punishment or \ndiscipline. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The Monitor has not observed \nmechanical restraints used for punishment/discipline on site  visits, review of video, or \ndocumentation reviewed.  \n \ne.  Youth may never be restrained to a fixed object, unless specifically \nordered by PSU to attempt to prevent active self-harm \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There is no evidence of youth \nbeing restrained to a fixed object. Policies have been finalized and quality assurance \nmeasures created. \n \nf.  Only staff who have been specifically trained in the use of physical \nforce and restraints and trained in proper de-escalation techniques \nmay place a youth in mechanical restraints. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. All safety staff equipped with \nmechanical restraints are trained specifically in the use of physical force, and restraints, and \nin proper de-escalation techniques.  \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 25 of 30\n \n \ng.  Any use of mechanical restraints, except during transportation or \nfor  mental  health  purposes,  must  be  authorized  by  a  Youth \nCounselor, Youth Counselor Advanced, or supervisor in a living \nunit.  No  youth  shall  be  left  alone  in  restraints.  Any  use  of \nmechanical restraints in excess of 45 minutes must be approved by \nthe superintendent, security director or designee and approved by \nPSU staff, and reviewed every 45 minutes thereafter.  As soon as \npossible  and  no  later  than  2  hours  following,  PSU  staff  shall \nevaluate and provide therapeutic interventions to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were two (2) instances \nof a youth being placed in mechanical restraints for over 45 minutes and it was approved \nby the Deputy Superintendent. Defendants have created a QA process for this section.  \n \n2.  Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of restraints in the \nfacility, including a description of the events leading up to the use of \nrestraints, the less restrictive alternatives attempted, and the length of time \nthe youth spent in restraints. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Mechanical restraint use has \nbeen added to the Incident Debrief process and the Incident Debrief process has been \nmodified. The length of time youth spent in restraints and events leading up to the use is \nregularly documented as part of the Incident Debrief process.  \n \nD.  Strip Searches. The following provisions are effective immediately upon entry of the \nCourt's order incorporating this Agreement. \n \n1.   Prohibition on strip searches without probable cause. Facility staff \nmay not conduct a strip search of any youth unless there is probable cause \nto believe that the individual youth possess drugs or weapons that could not \nbe discovered through less intrusive means. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches in this reporting period. The policy and procedure for Searches of Youth have been \nfinalized. A Strip Search Quarterly Training Brief was developed and shared with all \nsupervisors to outline all the necessary criteria and documentation requirements under \nwhich a strip search may be completed. Only supervisors can authorize a strip search.  \n2.  Strip searches with probable cause. Less intrusive searches, including using \na metal detector, pat down, or allowing the youth to change into a tank top \nor other clothing, must be attempted before a strip search is conducted, \nunless it is determined by PSU in consultation with the youth that less \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 26 of 30\n \nintrusive  searches,  which  may  include  physical  contact,  would  cause \ngreater trauma to the youth. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  There  were  zero  (0)  strip \nsearches this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has been \nfinalized.  \na. When a strip search is conducted, staff must ensure that no \nunintended individuals are able to view the search, including by \nvideo or other recording device. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis reporting period.  \n \nb.  Under no circumstance may a youth be strip searched within view of \nanother youth. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.  There  were  zero (0) strip \nsearches during this reporting period. No youth was near the youth being strip searched. QA \nhas been developed. The policy for searches has been finalized.  \n \nc.  Strip searches may only be conducted by individuals of the same \ngender identity as the youth being searched unless the search is \nconducted by a medical professional. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nconducted during this reporting period. QA has been developed. The policy for searches has \nbeen finalized.  \n \nd.  Strip searches must be conducted by staff trained in trauma  \ninformed practices. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There were (0) strip searches \nthis period.  \n \ne.  If a youth with a known or suspected mental health diagnosis or \nhistory of sexual abuse objects to a strip search, staff must consult \nwith mental health practitioners before conducting the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. There  were  zero (0) strip \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 27 of 30\n \nsearches during this reporting period. Policy and procedure/QA developed.  \n \n4.       Documentation. Facility staff must document all uses of strip searches, \nincluding the reason for the search and any drugs, weapons, or other items \ndiscovered through the search. \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The process for tracking and \ndocumenting all searches including the probable cause for any necessary strip search and \nthe weapons, drugs, or other items discovered has been incorporated into J-Tracker as of \nSeptember 1, 2019. Policy and Procedure have been finalized. \n \nE.  De-escalation Training. Within three months following entry of the Court's \norder incorporating this agreement, all staff in the facility shall receive de  \nescalation training by a nationally recognized provider. De-escalation training \nshall be provided at least annually thereafter. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants do provide de-\nescalation training to new and current staff.  \n \nF.  Programming. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this \nagreement, the Defendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and \nstrategies to increase programming and reduce the hours of idle time in the facility \nto no more than the PbS field average.  Defendants shall make reasonable efforts \nto implement the recommendations.  \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE/UNKNOWN.  The  Monitor  and \nDefendants have had many conversations/meetings regarding increased programming and \nDefendants have implemented the recommendations. Defendants have attempted to obtain \nthe PbS field average to assess compliance level, but PbS will not release this information or \nis not capturing the data in this manner, therefore the Monitor cannot assess compliance \nwith part of this section. \n \nG.  Staffing. Immediately upon entry of the Court's order incorporating this agreement, \nDefendants shall request that the Monitor provide assistance and strategies to \nimprove staffing ratios, and/or use strategies identified in the February 26, 2018, \nreport and recommendations of Mark Soler, Michael Dempsey, Teresa Abreu, and \nJennifer  Lutz.  Defendants  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  implement  the \nrecommendations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. Defendants made significant \neffort in implementing the strategies suggested for improving staffing ratios and staff morale. \nDefendants have implemented several initiatives to increase recruiting and retention. As \nstated in previous reports, staff wellness is a complex issue that impacts the overall culture, \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 28 of 30\n \natmosphere, and environment of the facility. Staff wellness has a direct impact on the \nrelationship between youth and staff, directly impacts the incidents of violence, use of \nrestraint, reduces employee leave/vacancies, and the use of isolation and confinement. The \nMonitor could not find one member of staff who did not have a positive attitude.  \n \n \nH.  Amendments  to  administrative  code.  Defendants  will  make  all  reasonable \nefforts to amend the administrative code to impose restrictions on any juvenile \ncorrectional facilities operated by DOC that codify the material terms of this \nAgreement as they relate to: (l) Room Confinement, (2) OC-Spray and Other \nChemical Agents, (3) Mechanical Restraints and (4) Strip Searches. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  PARTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  DJC’s  Administrative  Code \ncommittee continues moving both DOC Chapter 376 and DOC Chapter 373 forward. The \nDepartment of Corrections submitted its final draft proposed rule order for CR 24-003 \n(DOC Chapter 376), relating to Safety in Type 1 Secured Correctional Facilities, to the \nlegislature March 1, 2024. The statement of scope for this rule was approved by the Governor \non August 26, 2021, and approved by Secretary Kevin Carr on September 29, 2021. The \nlegislature noted that they officially received the rule into the record on March 5, 2024, \nbeginning their 30-day passive review period prior to Legislative Committee Hearings \nscheduled for April 10, 2024. \n \nRevisions to the draft of Chapter 373 have been expedited during the reporting period in \norder for 373 to remain in keeping with provisions from 376, specifically those prohibiting \npunitive confinement. The latest round of changes is now back with the DOC’s Office of \nLegal Counsel for final review and formatting before its submission to the legislature can be \ncompleted similar to 376.  \n \nDJC’s advancement of both DOC Chapter 373 and DOC Chapter 376 during the reporting \nperiod represents significant progress toward having the amendments adopted.  \n \n \nIV.  DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. \n \nA.  Incident review process. Defendants will establish a review process for any incident \nthat involved the use of force; OC spray; room confinement; or mechanical restraints \nused  for  more  than  45  minutes  (excluding  during  transportation).  The  review \ncommittee will include all staff directly involved in the incident, their supervisors, the \nsocial worker assigned to the youth, PSU staff who are familiar with the youth, the \nfacility director of security, the deputy superintendent, and the superintendent. Within \n24 hours, all available members of the review committee shall meet to assess whether \nphysical force, OC spray, room confinement, or mechanical restraints were used \nappropriately, to discuss less restrictive alternative strategies that staff could have \nused, and to provide an opportunity for staff training and/or redirection if needed. If \nnot all members of the review committee are available for the meeting within 24 \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 29 of 30\n \nhours, the full review committee shall meet or confer as soon as possible and no later \nthan one week after the event. The review committee shall also review all uses of strip \nsearches weekly to ensure that all such searches were conducted only upon probable \ncause. \n \nCOMPLIANCE STATUS: SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. The 24-hour timeline is met in \nthe vast majority of cases absent weekends. Informal reviews occur right after an incident in \nmajority of cases. When it has been determined lesser means could have been used, there is \na corrective action plan developed but follow-up needs to occur to ensure the plans are \ncompleted (QA component). Defendants QA program is exceptional and continues to further \ndevelop  the  program  to  include  compliance  measures  with  this  Court  Order.  New \ndashboards  have  been  created  during  this  reporting  period.  The  QA  team  should  be \ncommended for all the hard work and dedication to creating an extremely robust system that \nhas increased the safety for youth and staff by allowing leadership to make proactive \ndecisions and analyze many key data points on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.  \n            \nB.           Quality assurance. The superintendent shall establish performance goals, \nincluding compliance with the terms of this settlement; shall analyze data on \nwhether those goals are met; and shall put in place immediate corrective action to \naddress goals that are not being met. \n \nCOMPLIANCE  STATUS:  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE.  As  discussed  throughout \nprevious reports, data driven decisions are critical to come into compliance with this Court \nOrder and to improve the quality of life for youth and staff. Defendants have created an \nexceptional quality assurance program and have developed daily data to review that will \nautomatically be available to make real-time operational decisions. Defendants developed \nthe program to include additional compliance measures with this Court Order and created \nnew dashboards during this reporting period. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe population remains low overall. In general, staffing vacancy rates improved and the number \nof employee leaves on any given day is less than the last reporting period. Although the teacher \nvacancy rate has improved this period, it remains high at forty percent (40%). Defendants  need to \ndevelop strategies to improve teacher vacancies. Lack of teachers has a detrimental impact on \nyouths’ education. Defendants  need to  continue to  focus  on gender  and  culturally relevant \nprogramming  and  ensuring  that  the  system  of  care/behavior  motivation  system  is  being \nimplemented consistently. The Monitor continues to recommend that PSU and the CARE team \nhave a bigger presence on the units as this can mitigate any incidents of violence and subsequent \nuse of force as well. Although it is a very small percentage of youth, the current operational \npractices around youth who are confined to AC while pending transfer to another facility and youth \non PAUSE need to ensure that youth are getting the required out time, programming, showers, \nmental health, education services and all other basic rights. The Monitor continues to state in reports \nto the Court, there needs to be a continued focus on moving youth from LHS/CLS to more \nappropriate setting(s) or diverting them from confinement entirely. Although there are a few areas \nto improve upon, Defendants are close to being in substantial compliance with most provisions of \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:17-cv-00047-jdp   Document #: 147   Filed: 04/05/24   Page 30 of 30\n \nthis Agreement. \n \nThe Monitor is happy to answer any questions or address any concerns of the Court or the parties. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/S/ Teresa Abreu \nTeresa Abreu \nMonitor \n \n30 \n ",
