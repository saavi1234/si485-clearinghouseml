    "summary": "<p>On June 27, 2017, pre-trial detainees at the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s office filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the magistrate judge of the Criminal District Court alleging unlawful bail setting practices. Plaintiffs claimed that defendant violated the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause by keeping them in jail post-arrest when they could not afford the bail set by defendant. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant’s practice of regularly setting a $2,500 minimum financial condition, without considering arrestees' inability to pay or other non-financial alternatives, violated plaintiffs’ fundamental rights.  Plaintiffs further claimed that defendant violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause by holding a dual role of determining pre-trial release conditions and managing the court's finances, thereby creating an institutional conflict of interest and depriving plaintiffs of a neutral tribunal. By requiring detainees pay their bail amounts as a commercial surety instead of in cash, plaintiffs allege that defendant enforced a mechanism whereby bail payments generated revenue for the court and directly benefited defendant’s office. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgement. </p><p>The next day, plaintiffs moved to certify their class for all similarly situated detainees who were unable to pay the financial condition imposed by defendant as a requirement for their immediate release. </p><p>In July 2017, defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint for two reasons. First, the defendant claimed that that putative class members whose criminal proceedings had ended no longer had standing and were therefore unlikely to be injured. Secondly, the defendant claimed that because there were ongoing state court criminal proceedings against named plaintiffs and other class members, a federal proceeding would interfere with the state court’s ability to handle these proceedings. </p><p>On August 25, 2017, Judge Eldon E. Fallon denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, reasoning that there were still named and proposed class members with ongoing criminal cases who had ongoing and actual injuries. The court also found that the plaintiffs did not have an adequate opportunity to raise issues of bond policies in the relevant state courts, and so the issue of federal proceedings interfering with state court did not apply. </p><p>On November 7, 2017, the defendant again moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the defendant magistrate judge was not the proper defendant on plaintiffs’ claim of unconstitutionality. </p><p>Over the next several months, the parties engaged in settlement talks but did not reach an agreement. The court denied the defendant's second motion to dismiss in December, 2017.</p><p>On March 16, 2018, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The class was certified as: \"all presumptively innocent arrestees who are now before or will come before Defendant Magistrate Judge of Orleans Parish Criminal District Court for proceedings concerning pretrial release or detention and who are unable to pay the financial condition that Defendant imposes as a requirement for their immediate release.\" 2018 WL 1365809.</p><p>On August 06, 2018, Judge Eldon E. Fallon granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and provided the declaratory relief requested. The Court stated that the defendant's bail procedures had not provided notice of the importance of the issue of the criminal defendant’s ability to pay, and consideration of alternative conditions of release, or application of a legal standard in the determination of the necessity of pretrial detention. Hence, these procedures violated plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights.  On August 14, 2018, Judge Fallon issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and providing declaratory relief as follows:</p><p>(i) in the context of hearings to determine pretrial detention Due Process requires: (a) an inquiry into the arrestee’s ability to pay, including notice of the importance of this issue and the ability to be heard on this issue; (b) consideration of alternative conditions of release, including findings on the record applying the clear and convincing standard and explaining why an arrestee does not qualify for alternative conditions of release; and (c) representative counsel;</p><p>(ii) defendant's institutional incentives created a substantial and unconstitutional conflict of interest when he determined their ability to pay bail and set the amount of that bail.</p><p>The defendant filed a notice of appeal on August 21, 2018, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. (Docket No. 18-30954). The defendant appealed only the determination that his setting of bonds that help fund his court violated due process. </p><p>On June 13, 2019, Judge Fallon entered an Order governing the protocol that the defendant will use in determining the conditions of pre-trial release for arrestees. The order directed the defendant to consider the need for pre-trial release or detention based on the flight risk and/or danger posed by the arrestee. The defendant must also consider whether there are any nonfinancial conditions of release that would satisfy concerns of public safety and/or future appearances at court. The order also instructed that if a financial condition for release is set and the arrestee cannot meet it, the court must provide clear and convincing evidence that the financial condition is necessary to guard against risks of flight and danger to public safety. </p><p>On August 29, 2019, the appeals court affirmed the decision of the district court (Circuit Judges Patrick Higginbotham, Edith Jones, and Gregg Costa). See 937 F.3d 525 (2019). The appeals court concluded that the defendant had a direct and personal interest in maintaining the fiscal health of his court through the generation of bonds fees. The defendant also held a dual role because he generated and appropriated funds for the court through his bail procedures. The appeals court found that the combination of the dual role and personal interest in benefitting from bond fees “may make the magistrate ‘partisan to maintain the high level of contribution’,” thus violating due process. </p><p>On September 12, 2019, the defendant filed a motion for rehearing en banc in the appeals court. This motion was denied by the appeals court on October 1, 2019. </p><p>This case is now closed. </p><p></p>",

Fallon \nMagistrate Judge Michael B. North \nv. \n(Class Action) \nHARRY E. CANTRELL, Magistrate Judge of \nOrleans Parish Criminal District Court, \nDefendant. \nORDER \nConsidering the Parties’ Joint Motion for Entry of Consent Judgment filed in the above-\ncaptioned matter; \nIt is hereby ORDERED that, by agreement of the Parties, Magistrate Harry E. Cantrell \nwill use the following protocol when determining the conditions of pretrial release for arrestees \nappearing before him and that use of the following protocol complies with this Court’s August \n14, 2018 Declaratory Judgment: \nDuring preliminary instructions to all arrestees the judicial officer shall: Notify \narrestees of their constitutional right to pretrial liberty. State that if a secured money \nbail is considered as a condition of release, then judicial officer will ask questions \nabout  their  finances.  If  the  Court  intends  to  collect  this  information  via  sworn \ndeclaration (see step #4), then introduce the form and notify arrestees that defense \ncounsel will assist them in completing the form or if the form has already been \ncompleted by the defendant in a meeting with pretrial services, inform the arrestees \nthat they will have an opportunity to review the completed form with defense counsel. \nRepresentation by Counsel: All arrestees have a right to be represented by counsel \nwhen a judicial officer determines conditions of release. If an arrestee has not been \nbrought to Court for a First Appearance hearing due to an apparent mental or physical \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 158   Filed 06/13/19   Page 2 of 4\nincapacity—e.g., detoxification or placement on suicide watch—the judicial officer \nwill appoint counsel if the arrestee has not already retained counsel to appear on their \nbehalf.  The judicial officer may order release of the person and set conditions of \nrelease in the person’s absence. If setting a secured bail in an arrestee’s absence, the \njudicial officer will ensure that the arrestee’s name is placed on the docket for the next \nday’s First Appearance Hearing, not to exceed 24 hours from the missed appearance. \nIf the arrestee remains in custody at the time of the next day’s First Appearance \nHearing, the person will be brought before the judicial officer at that time, unless the \nmental or physical incapacity persists and prevents the arrestee’s appearance in court. \nIn such instance, the arrestee’s name will again be placed on the docket for the next-\nin-time First Appearance Hearing, until he has regained capacity or has consented to a \nwaiver of his appearance. If the next day’s first appearance hearing for an initially \nabsent arrestee will be held before a different section of Magistrate Court, e.g., a \ncommissioner’s hearing on a Saturday, Sunday, or court Holiday then the arrestee \nshall also be placed on Magistrate Cantrell’s next available docket for consideration \nof the conditions of release imposed in the event the arrestee continues in custody.  \nThe judicial officer will then proceed with the following steps to determine conditions \nof release. \n1. Judicial  officer  hears  argument  and  evidence  from  the  government  and \ndefense counsel concerning the charged offense(s) and the need for conditions \nof  pretrial  release  or  pretrial  detention,  including  the  arrestee’s  potential \ndanger to the community or risk of flight, and any conditions of release that \ncould mitigate any risk posed. The arrestee or their counsel shall have the \nopportunity to confront the government’s evidence and to present their own.\n2. For those arrestees who are present, first determine whether the person should \nbe released from custody with only the standard conditions in La. Code Crim. \nProc. art. 320(B) (2019).\n• If Yes—End inquiry and order release\n• If No—Continue\n3. Determine whether a nonfinancial condition of release, or combination of \nnonfinancial  conditions,  would  satisfy  the  judicial  officer’s  concerns  for \npublic safety and/or future appearance at court.\n• If  nonfinancial  condition(s)  are  sufficient  to  satisfy  judicial  officer’s \nconcerns, order arrestee’s release on such conditions.\n• If judicial officer is considering a financial condition to satisfy judicial \nofficer’s concerns, continue. \n2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 158   Filed 06/13/19   Page 3 of 4\n4. Remind arrestee that accurate answers to the Court’s questions are important \nto the Court deciding whether to require secured bail and, if so, the amount of \nbail. Then inquire into:\n• Income\n• Assets\n• Expenses\ni. Rent or mortgage\nii. Utilities\niii. Dependents\niv. Medical expenses\nv. Transportation costs\nvi. Payments on loans, credit cards, or other debts\nvii. Other expenses\n• Amount of bail defendant states he can afford \nIn place of an oral inquiry, the arrestee’s counsel may also proffer or the \ncourt may choose to obtain this financial information through a written form \nsworn by the arrestee and entered into the record. \n5. Considering  the  financial  information  obtained  in  the  preceding  step, \ndetermine whether a financial condition of release is a necessary component of \nthe individual’s conditions of release, and if so, set a financial condition.  If \nthe  person  cannot  pay  the  financial  condition  that  the  court  determines \nnecessary, then the court must explain by clear and convincing evidence on \nthe record why the government has demonstrated that no other alternative \nconditions of release are sufficient to reasonably guard against the person’s \nflight from prosecution or to reasonably ensure the safety of the community \nduring the pretrial period.2\n6. If the defendant objects to the bail set, ask counsel for arrestee whether the \narrestee may have additional evidence relevant to dangerousness, flight risk or \nalternative conditions of release that is currently unavailable to them.\n• If yes, offer arrestee more time to present his evidence by holding the \nhearing open until their attorney notifies the Court that they are able to \npresent such evidence after the current hearing. Defense counsel shall have \n72 hours within which to so notify the Court; on a showing of good cause, \nthe Court may allow an additional 48 hours to collect such evidence. The \narrestee’s case shall be reset for hearing no later than 48 hours after notice \nis received from counsel. \n2 The “clear and convincing” evidence must be individualized.  The following factors, standing alone, cannot \ncomprise clear and convincing evidence of dangerousness or flight risk: (a) the statute for which the arrestee’s \nalleged violation resulted in their arrest, (b) the location of the arrestee’s primary residence, or (c) the arrestee’s \nhomelessness or lack of a permanent physical address. \n3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 158   Filed 06/13/19   Page 4 of 4\n• If no, conclude the hearing.\nIt is ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ previously filed motion for injunctive relief, R. Doc. \n138,  be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE AS MOOT.\n  It is further ORDERED that this case shall be administratively closed subject to the \ncontinuing jurisdiction of this Court to enforce compliance with the terms of this Order. \nNew Orleans, Louisiana this 13th day of June, 2019 \n    __________________________________\n    The Honorable Eldon E.

That case was brought against all the judges of the Orleans Criminal District \n \nCourt, contending that their “administrative supervision over [the Fund], while simultaneously overseeing the collection \nof fines and fees making up a substantial portion of [the Fund], crosses the constitutional line.” Cain v.

CANTRELL, Magistrate Judge   \nof Orleans Parish Criminal District Court,   \n   \nDefendant.   \n   \n   \n \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n1.  Defendant Magistrate Judge Cantrell is responsible for setting bail for persons \narrested in Orleans Parish. Defendant Cantrell consistently and unlawfully imposes secured \nfinancial conditions of release in an amount that arrestees cannot afford without any inquiry into \nor findings concerning the arrestee’s ability to pay.  He routinely states that he will not consider \nimposition of non-financial alternative conditions of release.  As a result, the money-based orders \nof post-arrest release that he imposes constitute de facto orders of pretrial detention for those \nunable to pay — orders that are issued without the legal and factual findings and procedures \nrequired for a valid order of pretrial detention. \n2.  Moreover, Defendant Cantrell has an institutional financial conflict of interest in \nevery secured money bond that he imposes because he acts both as a supposedly neutral judicial \nofficer and as an executive responsible for managing the funds generated by each bail order that \nhe sets.  Louisiana law provides that if (and only if) an arrestee uses a commercial surety, the \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 2 of 27\njudges of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court receive 1.8% of the amount of that bond into \nthe court’s General Fund, which Defendant Cantrell and the other judges control.  As a result \nDefendant Cantrell refuses to allow arrestees to post cash bail.  He instead requires that financial \nconditions be paid through a for-profit bail bond (“a commercial surety”), and routinely in amounts \nlarger than $2,500.  \n3.  These  policies  and  practices  result  in  imminent  and  ongoing  violations  of \nfundamental rights. Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated arrestees, \nseek a declaration that Defendant Cantrell’s conduct violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n4.   This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02, \nand the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.   \n5.   Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nParties \n6.   Named Plaintiff Adrian Caliste is a 55-year-old man currently in the custody of the \nOrleans Parish Sheriff’s Office.  On June 20, 2017, Mr. Caliste appeared before Defendant Cantrell \nin the Magistrate section of Orleans Parish Criminal District Court. Defendant Cantrell imposed a \nsecured bond Mr. Caliste cannot afford to pay as a condition of release. He remains in custody \nsolely because he cannot afford to pay the amount of money required for his release. Mr. Caliste \nrepresents himself as an individual and a Class of similarly situated people who are all subject to \nthe Defendant’s post-arrest money-based detention scheme. \n2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 3 of 27\n7.  Named Plaintiff Brian Gisclair is a 33-year-old man currently in the custody of the \nOrleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. On June 20, 2017, Mr. Gisclair appeared before Defendant \nCantrell in the Magistrate section of Orleans Parish Criminal District Court. Defendant Magistrate \nCantrell imposed upon Mr. Gisclair a secured bond he cannot afford to pay as a condition of his \nrelease. He remains in custody solely because he cannot afford to pay the amount of money \nrequired for his release. Mr. Gisclair represents himself as an individual and a Class of similarly \nsituated people who are all subject to the Defendant’s post-arrest money-based detention scheme. \n8.  Defendant Harry E. Cantrell is the elected Magistrate Judge for Orleans Parish \nCriminal  District  Court. Defendant  Cantrell has statutory responsibility for setting bail and \ndetermining the conditions of release for pretrial arrestees in Orleans Parish. Defendant Cantrell \nsets bail upon arrest, prior to the issuance of an indictment, prior to the acceptance of charges by \nthe Orleans Parish District Attorney, and before a criminal proceeding is assigned to a particular \nsection of the Criminal District Court.  He is responsible for determining and modifying conditions \nof release on an ongoing basis until a case is assigned to a Section of the Criminal District Court.  \nIn concert with his fellow judges of the Criminal District Court, Defendant Cantrell acts in an \nexecutive capacity to control the expenditures of the Criminal District Court’s funds. Defendant \nCantrell is sued in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as the presiding Magistrate \nJudge for the Criminal District Court. \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 4 of 27\nFacts \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Continuing Detention Under Orders of Defendant Cantrell. \n \nAdrian Caliste \n \n9.  Plaintiff Adrian Caliste is a retired laborer who has lived his entire life in New \nOrleans. Most of his family, including his elderly father, siblings, children, and grandchildren live \nin New Orleans.  \n10.  Mr. Caliste’s primary source of income is his monthly Social Security retirement \nbenefit. \n11.  Mr. Caliste spends several days a week as a caretaker for his 92-year-old father. \n12.  Mr. Caliste was arrested on June 19, 2017, on allegations of possession of drugs, \npossession of drug paraphernalia, and traffic violations. \n13.  On June 20, 2017, Mr. Caliste appeared in the Magistrate Section of the Orleans \nParish Criminal District Court.   \n14.  Defendant Cantrell asked Mr. Caliste if he could afford a lawyer. When Mr. Caliste \nsaid that he could not, Cantrell appointed the office of the Orleans Public Defender to represent \nMr. Caliste.  \n15.  Magistrate Cantrell made no further inquiry into Mr. Caliste’s ability to afford any \nparticular  amount  of  secured  bail  or  whether  non-financial  conditions  of  release  would  be \nappropriate before imposing a total $5,000 secured bail upon Mr. Caliste. On two misdemeanor \ncharges, Defendant Cantrell set Mr. Caliste’s bail at $2,500 per charged offense.  \n16.  Mr. Caliste’s public defender argued for Mr. Caliste to be released on his own \nrecognizance, but Magistrate Cantrell imposed a secured money bail. \n4 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 5 of 27\n17.  Mr. Caliste can afford neither the $5,000 bail nor the 12–13% of that total that a \nbail bondsman would charge to act as a surety. As a result, he waits in jail until he receives his \nnext retirement benefit, which he hopes his family will use to pay a for-profit bonding company. \n18.  Mr. Caliste remains in the custody of the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. \n19.  Neither Magistrate Cantrell nor any judge of the Orleans Parish Criminal District \ncourt has made a finding that Mr. Caliste poses either a substantial risk of flight or an imminent \ndanger to the community. \nBrian Gisclair \n20.  Plaintiff Brian Gisclair is a father of three who was laid off from his full-time job \nabout four months ago. Since that time, he has been working sporadically for temporary staffing \nagencies. \n21.  Mr. Gisclair is a resident of Westwego, Louisiana, where he has lived for all of his \nlife. He shares custody of his three children. \n22.  Mr. Gisclair was arrested on June 19, 2017, on a single nonviolent misdemeanor \ncharge of possession of drugs. \n23.  On June 20, 2017, Mr. Gisclair appeared before Magistrate Cantrell, who appointed \nthe Orleans Public Defender to represent Mr. Gisclair because of his indigence. \n24.  Mr. Gisclair’s public defender argued that he should be released on his own \nrecognizance, but Magistrate Cantrell instead imposed a $2,500 bail.  \n25.   Magistrate Cantrell ordered this $2,500 secured money bail without inquiry into \nMr. Gisclair’s ability to afford this amount of bail. \n26.  Magistrate Cantrell did not make any inquiry into whether non-financial conditions \nof release would be suitable to ensure Mr. Gisclair’s return to court.  \n5 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 6 of 27\n27.  Mr. Gisclair cannot afford to pay his $2,500 bail, nor can he afford the 12–13% fee \na commercial surety would charge him. \n28.  As a result of his incarceration, Mr. Gisclair has already missed a previously \nscheduled job interview. \n29.  Mr. Giclair remains in the custody of the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office \n30.  Neither Magistrate Cantrell nor any judge of the Orleans Parish Criminal District \ncourt has made a finding that Mr. Gisclair poses either a substantial risk of flight or an imminent \ndanger to the community.  \n \nB.  Defendant Cantrell’s  Practice of  Imposing  Secured  Financial  Conditions of  Release \nWithout Conducting Any Inquiry into Ability to Pay or Consideration of Non-financial \nAlternatives. \n \n31.  Defendant  Cantrell  regularly  sets  a  $2,500  minimum  secured  money  bond \nirrespective of the particular facts in the case before him, and without regard to the circumstances \nsurrounding the arrestee appearing before him.  He routinely refuses to entertain arguments for a \nlower financial condition of release and informs regularly appearing defense lawyers not to even \nmake them. Defendant Cantrell frequently informs defense attorneys that these bail settings “are \nnot an adversarial hearing.” \n32.  Defense  counsel  seeking  alternative  non-financial  conditions  of  release  or \nmonetary bonds in amounts lower than $2,500 have been advised explicitly that Defendant \nCantrell does not set financial conditions of release below $2,500: \n6 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 7 of 27\n \n \nTr. of Hr’g at 3:29, State v. Mishana Johnson, No. M-559675 (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct.  Dec. \n27, 2016). \n33.  In another recent case, an arrestee was accused of “negligent injuring” in the \ncleaning of his gun. All involved parties agreed that the injuring was an accident. The accused was \na chef at a local university, responsible for supporting his fiancé and ten-year-old daughter. The \ndefense sought a monetary bond of $500. Defendant Cantrell stated,  \n \nDefendant Cantrell then imposed a secured money bond in the amount of $15,000.  Tr. of Hr’g at \n3:19–29, State v. Jermaine Thomas, No. M-559871 (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct.  Jan. 5, 2017).  \n34.  And in the case of a woman accused of theft,  \n \n7 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 8 of 27\n \nTr. of Hr’g at 3:11–13, State v. Chinette Armstead, No. M-559278, (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct.  \nDec. 19, 2016).  \n35.  Defendant Cantrell refuses to consider defense arguments on bail amounts, in \nflagrant violation of the Due Process Clause:  \n \nTr. of Hr’g at 4:2–17, State v. Angie Williams, No. M-561958 (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct. \nMarch 20, 2017). \n36.  In one recent case of a deaf and mute woman with no prior criminal history charged \nwith solicitation of prostitution and believed by Judge Cantrell to be homeless, Defendant Cantrell \n8 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 9 of 27\nagain confirmed that he would set the bond at $2,500 regardless of any evidence presented by \ndefense counsel:  \n \nTr. of Hr’g at 3:1–21, State v. Lakiesha Myles, No. M-561626 (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct. \nMarch 9, 2017). \n37.  Despite being told that the court would refuse to  consider the evidence, the \nwoman’s public defender insisted on putting information forward to dispute the facts alleged by \npolice and to show that the accused had, in fact, lived in New Orleans with her mother and three \n9 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 10 of 27\nchildren  for  seven  years.  True  to  his  word,  Defendant  Cantrell  refused  to  consider  those \ncircumstances before requiring a secured monetary amount that she could not afford.  \n \n10 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 11 of 27\n  \nId. at 4:7–29, 5:1–5. \n \nC.  Defendant Cantrell’s Policy of Refusing to Consider Non-financial Conditions of \nRelease. \n \n38.  Defendant Cantrell often arbitrarily refuses to consider Releases on Recognizance \n(“ROR”) or release on other non-financial conditions of release. In another recent case, he declared \na person ineligible for consideration for ROR (contrary to state and federal law), asserting that the \nman was involved in a domestic dispute, despite there being no evidence for that claim. Tr. of Hr’g \nat 2:11–13, 4:12–16, State v. Eddie Green, No. M-561572, (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct. March \n6, 2017). \n39.   Not only does Defendant Cantrell refuse to consider non-financial alternatives for \nthose unable to pay and refuse to set lower financial conditions for those who cannot afford $2,500, \nbut Defendant Cantrell also threatens to hold defense counsel in contempt of court for advocating \nfor non-financial conditions or a lower money bond amount.  Defense counsel is placed in the \nimpossible position of having to weigh her own personal freedom against her obligation to \nadvocate for her client’s constitutional right to a meaningful bail hearing.  The threat of jail time \nin retaliation for an attorney’s basic oral advocacy would have a chilling effect on even the most \nzealous advocate and constitutes a gross abuse of authority.  \n11 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 12 of 27\n \n12 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 13 of 27\n \nTr. of Hr’g at 4–5, State v. Gavin P. Morgan, No. M-559682 (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct. Dec. \n27, 2016).  \n40.  On June 20, 2017, Magistrate Cantrell threatened a defense lawyer with contempt \nin response to his advocacy for a client to be released on recognizance. In addition to threatening \nthe attorney with contempt, Magistrate Cantrell went so far as to threaten to revoke a release on \nrecognizance that he’d granted to another of that attorney’s clients earlier in the day. \nD.  Defendant Cantrell’s Institutional Financial Interest to Require High Dollar Commercial \nSurety Bonds. \n \n41.   The judges of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court depend on approximately \n$1 million per year from the fees assessed on for-profit surety bonds that they impose.   \n42.  In Orleans Parish, the Sheriff collects a $3.00 fee on every $100.00 of liability \nunderwritten by a commercial surety (bond company). La. R.S. § 22:822(A)(2).  \n43.  Of  the  $3.00  fee  collected  on  every  $100.00  of  liability  underwritten  by  a \ncommercial surety, \ni.  $1.00 is allocated directly to Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to be \nmanaged by the judges. \n13 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 14 of 27\nii.  $2.00 is divided as follows: \n1.  40% to Orleans Parish Criminal District Court Judicial Expense \nFund;  \n2.  20% to Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office;  \n3.  20% to Orleans Parish District Attorney;  \n4.  20% to Orleans Parish Office of the Indigent Defender. \nLa. R.S. §§ 22:822(B)(3), 13:1381.5. \n44.  No such fee is levied against arrestees who utilize secured personal sureties, post a \ncash bail, or are released on recognizance or other non-financial conditions of release.  \n45.  The Orleans Parish Criminal District Court deposits the 1.8% fee it receives from \ncommercial surety bonds into the court’s General Fund, from which it pays for the salaries and \nbenefits of court staff, travel for judicial conferences, office supplies, phone service, building \nmaintenance, legal research, and various other day-to-day expenses. \n46.  In 2013, an accountant for the Criminal District Court addressed the New Orleans \nCity Council, stating that the revenue from the 1.8% bond fee was “critical” to the Court’s ability \nto meets its monthly payroll expenses. \n47.  In recent years, this 1.8% fee on commercial surety bonds has accounted for 20–\n25% of the court’s General Fund, or about one million dollars. Thus, a significant portion of the \ncourt’s revenue depends upon criminal defendants posting bond through commercial sureties. \n48.  In 2015, 97% of those defendants in Criminal District Court who were assessed a \nfinancial bail obtained their freedom through a commercial surety. Only 3% paid their full bail in \ncash.  \n14 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 15 of 27\n49.  Spending from the General Fund is controlled by the judges of the court en banc, \nin which Defendant Cantrell has an equal vote. \n50.  The deposit of the 1.8% fee on commercial surety bonds into the General Fund for \nOrleans Parish Criminal District Court creates a conflict of interest for Magistrate Judge Cantrell.  \n51.  Defendant Cantrell’s office directly benefits from the collection of the 1.8% fee. \nThe infrastructure of his court—from the salary of his staff to the paper in his printer—depends \nupon the continued generation of money from for-profit commercial surety fees, which are entirely \ndependent on his judicial decisions.  As an executive who manages these expenditures along with \nthe other judges, Defendant Cantrell’s dual executive and judicial roles destroy the judicial \nneutrality that is a vital component of the American legal system. \nE.  Defendant Cantrell’s Policy of Refusing to Accept Secured Money Bail That Does Not \nGenerate Revenue for the Court. \n \n52.  Defendant  Cantrell  routinely  refuses  to  set  cash  bonds.  He  instead  requires \nindividuals to rely upon a commercial surety, thereby ensuring that his court can generate 1.8% of \nthe bail amount in fees that he and the other judges manage as executives.  \n15 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 16 of 27\nTr. of Hr’g at 3:1–21, State v. Jesus Medel, No. M-561052 (Orleans Parish Crim. Dist. Ct. Feb. \n16, 2017) and State v. Lorenzo Cortrina, No. M-561047 (Orleans Parish Crim. Distr. Ct. Feb. 16, \n2017).1  \n \n                                                 \n1 A typo in the transcript misidentifies Mr. Lorenzo Cortrina as “Mr. Cartena.” \n16 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 17 of 27\nSee also,  \n \n \nTr. of Hr’g at 6:11–17, State of Louisiana v. Joseph Dunckley, No. M-559319 (Orleans Parish \nCrim. Dist. Ct. December 19, 2016). \n53.  Defendant Cantrell’s policy and practice of refusing to consider ability to pay, \nrefusing to consider non-financial alternatives, imposing de facto orders of detention without the \nprocess and legal standards required, refusing to set any secured money bond amount below \n$2,500, and institutional financial conflict of interest violate the Due Process and Equal Protection \nclauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  \n54.  The named Plaintiffs and the class they represent are all people that Defendant \nCantrell has deemed appropriate for immediate release. They would each be released immediately \nif they were able to pay a for-profit surety the amount of money required by Defendant Cantrell. \n55.  At no point does Defendant Cantrell conduct any proceedings concerning whether \na person has the ability to pay the amount of money that he requires.  Nor does he make any inquiry \ninto or findings concerning whether there is any other non-financial condition or combination of \nconditions that could reasonably assure an arrestee’s appearance of the safety of the community.  \nNor does he conduct any of the proceedings required for a valid order of pretrial detention, \n17 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 18 of 27\nincluding an adversarial hearing at which findings concerning a person’s danger to the community \nor risk of flight are made pursuant to clearly defined legal standards required by federal law. \n56.  Under Defendant Cantrell’s money-based practices, those arrestees wealthy enough \nto pay are released almost immediately after Defendant Cantrell sets their bail.  Some poorer \narrestees eventually make arrangements with private bail bond companies, after spending days or \nweeks in jail.  And many others, who are too poor to come up with enough money, are left to \nlanguish in jail until the resolution of their case.   \nF.  Defendant Cantrell’s Bail Practices as an Ineffective Means of Ensuring Public Safety or \nCriminal Defendants’ Appearance at Trial.  \n \n57.  The empirical evidence shows that there is no relationship between requiring \nsecured money bail as a condition of release and defendants’ rates of appearance in court. \n58.  Other jurisdictions, including the City of New Orleans Municipal Court, employ \nnon-monetary conditions of release, including unsecured or “signature” bonds, stay-away orders, \ncurfews, or home detention. \n59.  Other courts also employ less restrictive methods of maximizing public safety and \ncourt appearances when necessary to guard against a particular risk, including unsecured bond, \nreporting obligations, phone and text message reminders of court dates, rides to court for those \nwithout  transportation  or  a  stable  address,  counseling,  drug  and  alcohol  treatment,  batterer \nintervention programs, anger management courses, alcohol monitors, or, in extreme cases of \nparticular risk, electronic monitoring, among other services. \n60.  Defendant Cantrell is permitted by state law to use these alternatives but, as a matter \nof routine, chooses not to consider them for impoverished arrestees. \n61.  Defendant Cantrell’s policies have ramifications for the entire Orleans community \nand criminal justice system.  \n18 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 19 of 27\n62.  Pretrial detention causes unnecessary lost employment, lost housing and shelter, \nand creates instability in care for dependent children and parents.  It also unnecessarily subjects \ndetained individuals to violent conditions in the Orleans jail, causing harm to arrestees’ physical \nand mental health. This increases community costs and make a person less stable and healthy upon \ntheir ultimate release. \n63.  Individuals who are detained pretrial — instead of released on money bail or on a \npersonal bond — have worse case outcomes in every measurable way, even when controlling for \nall other factors.2 \n64.  Setting a secured money bail without an inquiry into ability to pay and in an amount \nhigher than a person can afford by definition defeats the purpose of money bail — to incentivize a \nperson to return to court — and removes any legitimate (let alone compelling) state interest in the \nsetting of a financial condition.  Nor is setting money bail without findings concerning ability to \n                                                 \n2 Megan Stevenson, Distortion of Justice: How the Inability to Pay Bail Affects Case Outcomes 18 (May 2, 2016), \navailable at https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/research/details.cfm?research_id=14047; Arpit Gupta, et al., The \nHeavy Costs of High Bail:  Evidence from Judge Randomization 45 J.

The named Plaintiffs brings this action, on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated, for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common \nbasis. \n66.  A class action is a superior means, and the only practicable means, by which the \nnamed Plaintiffs and unknown Class members can challenge the Defendant’s unlawful post-arrest \ndetention scheme. \n67.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n68.  This  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy \nrequirements of those provisions. \n69.  The Plaintiffs propose the following class seeking declaratory relief only: \nall presumptively innocent arrestees who are now before or who will come \nbefore Defendant for proceedings concerning pretrial release or detention \nand who are unable to pay the financial condition that Defendant Cantrell \nimposes as a requirement for their immediate release. \n \nA.  Numerosity.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n70.  Each arrestee is presented with the Defendant’s standard money-bond options of \npay or jail.  Arrestees are held in jail for varying lengths of time depending on how long it takes \nthem to make the payment that the Defendant requires for their release, or to obtain a commercial \nsurety.    \n20 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 21 of 27\n71.  The  number  of  current  and  future  arrestees  subjected  to  these  policies  is \ninnumerable.  Over thirty thousand individuals are arrested in Orleans Parish annually. Defendant \nCantrell establishes post-arrest but pre-indictment release conditions for a large portion of those \narrestees. Including future arrestees, the proposed Class contains thousands of people.  \nB.  Commonality.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).   \n72.  The relief sought is common to all members of the Class, and common questions \nof law and fact exist as to all members of the Class.  The named Plaintiffs seeks relief concerning \na determination as to whether the Defendant’s policies, practices, and procedures violate the rights \nof the Class members. \n73.  These common legal and factual questions arise from one central scheme and set \nof policies and practices:  the Defendant’s post-arrest detention scheme and the procedures (or lack \nthereof) that he follows when imposing financial conditions of release.  The Defendant operates \nthis scheme openly and in materially the same manner every day.  The material components of the \nscheme do not vary from Class member to Class member, and the resolution of these legal and \nfactual  issues  will  determine  whether  all  of  the  members  of  the  class  are  entitled  to  the \nconstitutional relief that they seek. \nAmong the most important, but not the only, common questions of fact are:  \n  Whether Defendant has a policy and practice of refusing to conduct an inquiry into \nability to pay prior to requiring secured financial conditions of release; \n  Whether Defendant has a policy and practice of refusing to consider ability to pay \nprior to requiring secured financial conditions of release; \n  Whether Defendant has a policy and practice of routinely refusing to consider non-\nfinancial conditions of release in many cases; \n  Whether Defendant requires secured financial conditions of release without making \nany findings that those conditions are the least restrictive condition necessary to \nmitigate any particular risks identified; \n  Whether  Defendant  has  a  policy  and  practice  of  regularly  imposing  secured \nfinancial conditions of release arbitrarily in amounts of $2,500 and above; \n  Whether Defendant has a policy and practice of refusing to allow posting of cash \n21 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 22 of 27\nbonds, thereby requiring utilization of a commercial surety company; \n  Whether Defendant Cantrell and the other judges of the Orleans Parish Criminal \nDistrict Court exercise control over the expenditure of funds generated through the \n1.8% fee on commercial surety bonds set by Cantrell; \n  Whether the funds generated from the fee on commercial surety bonds are used by \nDefendant Cantrell and his fellow judges to fund the operations of the Orleans \nParish Criminal District Court. \n \n74. Among the most important common question of law are: \n  Whether requiring a financial condition of pretrial release without inquiry into and \nfindings  concerning  a  person’s  ability  to  pay,  and  without  consideration  of \nalternative  non-financial  conditions  of  release,  violates  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; \n  Whether Defendant’s institutional financial conflict of interest in the imposition of \nsecured financial conditions of release violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due \nProcess Clause.  \n \nC.  Typicality.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).   \n75.  The named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the \nClass, and they have the same interests in this case as all other members of the Class that they \nrepresent.  Each of them suffers injuries from the failure of the Defendant to comply with the basic \nconstitutional provisions:  they are each confined in jail because they could not afford to pay the \nDefendant’s required bond amount.  The answer to whether the Defendant’s scheme of policies \nand practices is unconstitutional will determine the claims of the named Plaintiffs and every other \nClass member. \n76.  If the named Plaintiffs succeed in the claim that the Defendant’s policies and \npractices  concerning  post-arrest  detention  violate  their  constitutional  rights,  that  ruling  will \nlikewise benefit every other member of the Class.   \nD.  Adequacy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).   \n77.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  adequate  representatives  of  the  Class  because  their \ninterests in the vindication of the legal claims that they raise are entirely aligned with the interests \n22 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 23 of 27\nof the other Class members, who each have the same basic constitutional claims.  They are \nmembers of the Class, and their interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the \nother Class members.   \n78.  There are no known conflicts of interest among members of the proposed Class, all \nof whom have a similar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights in the face of their \nunlawful treatment by their local government. \n79.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Roderick and Solange MacArthur \nJustice Center in New Orleans (“MacArthur Justice Center”)3 and Civil Rights Corps4 who have \nexperience in litigating complex civil rights matters in federal court and knowledge of both the \ndetails of the Defendant’s scheme and the relevant constitutional and statutory law.   \n80.  The efforts of Class counsel have so far included investigation of Defendant’s \nmoney-based pretrial detention system, interviews of jail inmates and attorneys practicing in the \narea,  consultation  with  local  and  national  experts,  and  research  regarding  the  legality  of \nDefendant’s secured money-bail regime. \n81.  Class counsel have studied the way that post-arrest detention systems function in \nother cities and counties in order to investigate the wide array of lawful options in practice for \nmunicipal entities. \n                                                 \n3 The MacArthur Justice Center is a non-profit public interest law firm.  Undersigned counsel Katie Schwartzmann, \nthe co-Director of the MacArthur Justice Center, has practiced law in Louisiana for twelve years and has litigated a \nwide variety of complex civil matters in state and federal court.  She is presently class counsel for thousands of \nprisoners in the Orleans Parish Prison. Undersigned counsel Eric Foley, staff attorney at the MacArthur Justice Center, \nworked for two years as a federal judicial clerk in the District Court of Puerto Rico before beginning his practice of \nlaw in Louisiana in 2011. He has litigated civil rights cases at the trial and appellate stages in state court.  \n4 Civil Rights Corps is a non-profit civil rights organization based in Washington, D.C.  Counsel from Civil Rights \nCorps has been counsel in nearly twenty similar federal civil rights class action lawsuits.  \n23 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 24 of 27\n82.  Class  counsel  also  have  experience  litigating  similar  challenges  in  other \njurisdictions and years of experience litigating complex and important cases in Louisiana federal \ncourts. \n83.  As a result, counsel have undertaken significant efforts toward becoming intimately \nfamiliar with the Defendant’s scheme and with all of the relevant state and federal laws and \nprocedures than can and should govern it.  The interests of the members of the Class will be fairly \nand adequately protected by the named Plaintiffs and their attorneys.   \nE.  Rule 23(b)(2). \n84.  Class action status is appropriate because the Defendant, through the policies, \npractices, and procedures that make up his post-arrest money-based release and detention scheme, \nacts in the same unconstitutional manner with respect to all class members.  Defendant has created \nand applied a scheme of post-arrest detention and release procedures that requires presumptively \ninnocent arrestees to pay a bond of at least $2,500 to a commercial surety to secure their release.  \nDefendant  releases  those  who  can  pay  and  detains  those  who  cannot,  without  considering \nalternative non-financial conditions of release or conducting the constitutionally required inquiry \ninto ability to pay.  Impoverished arrestees who remain detained eventually have their first \nappearance before a judge, but it may be months before a case is accepted by the District Attorney \nand assigned to a Criminal District Court section. Thus, impoverished arrestees are kept illegally \nin  jail  for days, weeks, and months as a result of the Defendant’s policies, practices, and \nprocedures.  Each further day of wealth-based detention results in irreparable harm. \n85.  The Class therefore seeks declaratory relief as to Defendant’s policies, practices, \nand procedures, which are unconstitutional in materially the same way for every class member.  \nBecause  the  putative  Class  challenges  the  Defendant’s  scheme  as  unconstitutional  through \n24 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 25 of 27\ndeclaratory relief that would apply the same relief to every member of the Class, Rule 23(b)(2) \ncertification is appropriate and necessary.   \nClaims for Relief \nCount One:  Defendant’s Policies and Practices Violate Plaintiffs’ Rights By Jailing \nThem Solely Because They Cannot Afford a Money Payment Without an Inquiry Into and \nFindings Concerning Their Ability to Pay or Consideration of Non-Financial Alternative \nConditions of Release. \n \n86.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1–85.   \n87.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses have long \nprohibited keeping a person in jail solely because of the person’s inability to make a monetary \npayment.  Defendant violates Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights by keeping them in jail after arrest \nwhen they cannot afford to pay the amount of money set by the Defendant without an inquiry into \nand findings concerning their ability to pay and without consideration of alternative non-financial \nconditions of release.   \nCount Two:  Defendant’s Institutional Financial Conflict of Interest in the \nImposition of Secured Financial Conditions of Release Violates Due Process \n \n88.  The Due Process Clause ensures the fundamental neutrality of American judicial \nproceedings.  Defendant Cantrell’s dual role as a judge determining conditions of pretrial release \nand as an executive in charge of managing the Court’s finances creates an institutional conflict of \ninterest that deprives Plaintiffs of their right to a neutral tribunal.  In Defendant Cantrell’s \ncourtroom, Defendant imposes these secured financial conditions of release that Defendant and \nthe other judges of the Criminal District Court know will result in their collecting and controlling \n1.8% of the bond amount into a fund that they manage.  This creates an intolerable judicial \nfinancial conflict of interest and results in a proceeding that lacks the basic neutrality required in \nAmerican law.   \n \n25 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 26 of 27\nRequest for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the other Class members request that this Court issue the \nfollowing relief: \na.  A declaratory judgment that the Defendant violates the named Plaintiffs’ and Class \nmembers’ constitutional rights by promulgating and enforcing policies that result in \njailing Plaintiff and Class members and keeping them in jail solely because they are \npoor and cannot afford to pay an amount of money to secure release. \nb.  A declaratory judgment that Defendant Cantrell has a conflict of interest that violates \nthe  Due  Process  rights  of  defendants  appearing  before  him  where  he  imposes \ncommercial surety bonds as a condition of release, fees on such commercial surety \nbonds generate substantial revenue for the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, and \nCantrell has executive authority of the fund in which those fees are deposited. \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 1   Filed 06/27/17   Page 27 of 27\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n/s/ Katie M.

CANTRELL  *        SECTION “L” (5) \n \n \nORDER & REASONS \n \n  Before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify a Class Action. R. Docs. 5, 87. \nDefendant opposes the motion. R. Docs. 21, 95. Having considered the parties’ arguments and \nthe applicable law, the Court issues this Order & Reasons. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n  On June 27, 2017, a group of Plaintiffs filed suit against Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell. \nThis case arises from Defendant Magistrate Judge Cantrell’s allegedly unlawful practice of \nimposing unreasonably expensive secured financial conditions of release upon arrestees without \ninquiring about their ability to pay. R. Doc. 1 at 1. Plaintiffs are two criminal defendants who \nwere in the custody of the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. R. Doc. 1 at 2-3. Defendant Harry \nCantrell is the Magistrate Judge for Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, where he is \nresponsible for setting bail upon arrest, and has a role in managing the expenditures of the \nJudicial Expense Fund. R. Doc. 1 at 3.  \n  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant routinely sets a $2,500 minimum secured money bond. \nPlaintiffs contend Judge Cantrell sets bond without considering the facts of the case to determine \nwhether a lower bond amount or an alternative condition of release might be appropriate. R. Doc. \n1 at 6. Plaintiffs further aver that Defendant requires the use of a for-profit bail bond and does \nnot allow arrestees to post cash bail. R. Doc. 1 at 2. Under Louisiana law, 1.8% of a bond \namount collected from a commercial surety (but not from any other type of bond) is allocated \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 99   Filed 03/16/18   Page 2 of 5\ndirectly to the Court for its discretionary use; Plaintiffs contend that this policy involves a \nconflict of interest. R. Doc. 1 at 2. Plaintiffs argue that refusing to consider ability to pay, \nalternative conditions of release, or a lower bond, as well as the resulting institutional financial \nconflict, violate the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. R. \nDoc. 1. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgement that Defendant’s bond policy, which results in the \ncreation of a modern “debtor’s prison,” is a violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and a \ndeclaration that Defendant’s financial conflict of interest violates their Due Process rights. R. \nDoc. 1 at 26.    \nII.  PRESENT MOTION \n  Plaintiffs have filed a Motion to Certify a Class Action. R. Doc. 5. Plaintiffs maintain that \nDefendant applies the same allegedly unconstitutional practices to the entire class, their claims \nare representative of the class claims, the named plaintiffs’ stake in the controversy is sufficient \nto represent the class, and all members of the class will seek declaratory relief. R. Doc. 5-1 at 3.  \n  Conversely, Defendant argues that class certification is unnecessary because Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are moot. R. Doc. 95. Defendant argues that he has agreed to follow a bail setting \nprotocol that resolves Plaintiffs’ claims. R. Doc. 95 at 2. Further, Defendant argues that the \nconflict of interest claim is currently in litigation before Judge Vance. R. Doc. 95 at 4.  \nIII.  LAW & ANALYSIS \n  Class actions permit representative plaintiffs to litigate their claims on behalf of members \nof the class not before the court. The purpose of a class action is to avoid multiple actions and to \nallow claimants who could not otherwise litigate their claims individually to bring them as a \nclass. See Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 349 (1983). A district court has \ngreat discretion in certifying and managing a class action. See Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, \nLLC, 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. 1999). The party seeking class certification bears the burden of \nproving all the requirements set out in Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 99   Filed 03/16/18   Page 3 of 5\n  Here, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2). R. Doc. 5-1 at 1. A class may be \ncertified under Rule 23(b)(2) if it meets the four prerequisites found in Rule 23(a) and an \nadditional requirement found in Rule 23(b)(2). The four prerequisites for certifying a class \ninclude: (1) numerosity (a class so large that joinder of all members is impracticable); (2) \ncommonality (questions of law or fact common to the class); (3) typicality (named parties’ \nclaims or defenses are typical of the class); and (4) adequacy of representation (representatives \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class). Mullen, 186 F.3d at 623 (quoting \nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997)).   \n  If the four prerequisites of 23(a) have been demonstrated, plaintiffs must satisfy one of \nthe elements of 23(b). Rule 23(b)(2) provides for certification of class actions if “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). “If the plaintiffs s[eek] only injunctive and declaratory relief, \n[there is] no trouble certifying the proposed class[].” Broussard v. Foti, No. 00-2318, 2001 WL \n699525, at *2 (E.D. La. June 18, 2001).  \n  Plaintiffs in this case satisfy the requirements of 23(a). Plaintiffs satisfy the numerosity \nrequirement because there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of potential class members. See \nMullen, 186 F.3d at 624 (finding that a class sized between 100-150 members generally satisfied \nthe numerosity requirement). Commonality is satisfied because the claims of each class member \nrest on common fact questions surrounding Defendant’s policies and practices of setting bail in \nstate criminal cases. Further, the claims share a common question of law: whether these policies \nand practices violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. \nTypicality is met because the claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of, if not identical to, the \nclaims as well as the defenses of the class. See id. at 625 (quoting Lightbourn v. County of El \nPaso, 118 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir. 1997)); Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 99   Filed 03/16/18   Page 4 of 5\n1992) (holding that a plaintiff’s claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice giving \nrise to the claims of other class members and is based on the same legal theory as the class \nmembers); see, e.g., R. Docs. 87-3, 87-4 (transcripts from Judge Cantrell’s hearings). Finally, the \nnamed plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class and Plaintiffs’ counsel \nare certainly adequately experienced. See Mullen, 186 F.3d at 626 (stating that named plaintiffs \nare inadequate representatives only if they have conflicts with interests of the other class \nmembers). Finally, the Plaintiffs request only declaratory relief for the entire class. Therefore, \nthey have satisfied the Rule 23(b)(2) standard.  \n  Defendant argues that the Court should not certify the class because Plaintiffs’ claims are \nmoot. While Defendant has not filed a motion to dismiss, the Court will address the argument. \nGenerally, “any set of circumstances that eliminates actual controversy after the commencement \nof a lawsuit renders that action moot.” Ctr. For Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d \n655, 661 (5th Cir. 2006). Usually voluntary cessation of a challenge practice does not render a \ncase moot. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC) Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 \n(2000).  \n  However, “[a] case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that \nthe allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” Id. (quoting United \nStates v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)). When arguing that a \ncase or issue is moot, the defendant “bears [a] formidable burden.” Id. at 190. “Allegations by a \ndefendant that its voluntary conduct has mooted the plaintiff’s case require close[] examination.” \nEnvtl. Conservation Org. v. City of Dallas, 529 F.3d 519, 528 n.4 (5th Cir. 2008). “The \noverarching goal is to determine whether the defendant’s actions are mere “litigation posturing” \nor whether the controversy is extinguished.” Fontenot v. McCraw, 777 F.3d 741, 748 (5th Cir. \n2015).  \n  Here, Defendant Cantrell has not met his formidable burden. While the Court encourages \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 99   Filed 03/16/18   Page 5 of 5\nJudge Cantrell to continue pursuing settlement of these issues by agreeing to conform his bail \npractices to the requirements of Constitutional law, the Court has seen no formal recorded \nstatement, such as a consent judgment or settlement agreement, of such a commitment and no \nevidence that such practices and procedures have already been changed. Therefore, it is not \nabsolutely clear that the allegedly unconstitutional bail practices will not recur.  \n  Additionally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ conflict of interest claims are covered in \nCain et al. v. City of New Orleans et al., No. 15-4479, currently before Judge Vance. While the \nclaims pending in the Cain case are similar and relevant to the claims in the instant lawsuit, they \nare distinctly different claims. In Cain, Plaintiffs challenge practices by the Criminal District \nCourt and its collections department regarding the handling of nonpayment of fines and fees. \nHere, Plaintiffs challenge Defendant’s practices regarding setting bail. In Cain, Plaintiffs claim a \nconflict of interest exists in the collection of those fines and fees. Here, Plaintiffs claim a conflict \nof interest exists in the setting and collecting of bail amounts. These claims are clearly \ndistinguished and resolution of ones set of claims will not determine resolution of the other. \nTherefore, the case pending before Judge Vance is no reason to prevent or delay class \ncertification here.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class, R. Doc. 5, is hereby GRANTED.  \n \nNew Orleans, Louisiana this 16th day of March, 2018. \n \n \n________________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n ",

WHY THIS MOTION HAS MERIT \n \n  Federal question jurisdiction is invoked via 42 USC §1983 by two named plaintiffs but the \nsuit also identifies the state criminal cases of eleven others who may also be plaintiffs or potential \nclass members.1 The question raised by this motion is whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, a \nprerequisite to proceeding.2 There are two concerns -- standing3 and abstention, as federal courts \nmay not entertain actions that seek to impose a federal audit of ongoing state criminal proceedings.4 \nAs an Article III court and in a case seeking declaratory relief, a “case” or “controversy” brought by \na person alleging facts showing a substantial and continuing controversy between the parties must \n                                                            \n1 Rec.

That, coupled with \nthe fact that the defendant is a sitting state court judge, requires this Court to decline jurisdiction.7  \nAdmittedly, this Court has an unflagging obligation to adjudicate controversies before it.8 This \nobligation is, however, tempered by the more important considerations of comity and federalism \nwhen, as here, important state interests are involved.9  The state concerns are its criminal law, its \nability to enforce its criminal laws, and the right of its courts to issue orders and judgments without \ninterference from federal courts.10  Ongoing criminal proceedings have always been deemed an \nexceptional and important state interest requiring abstention.11   \nII.  OPERATIVE FACTS AND STATE COURT CRIMINAL RECORDS \n  Plaintiffs are two named individuals: and perhaps eleven others. They claim that Magistrate \nJudge Harry E. Cantrell is violating their civil rights (1) by refusing to lower or eliminate plaintiffs’ \nbonds in the state court criminal proceeding and unconstitutionally keeping them in jail because they \nare too poor to pay for their release and (2) by having an “executive” interest in the commercial \nsurety tax imposed by state law and used by the Orleans Criminal District Court as a whole to \npartially court operations in accordance with state law.12 Plaintiffs want a class certified of: \n                                                            \n5 Ruiz v.

Rec. Doc. 1 p. 20. \n \nThey further seek the following declaratory relief: \na.  A declaratory judgment that the Defendant violates the named \nPlaintiffs’  and  Class  members’  constitutional  rights  by \npromulgating and enforcing policies that result in jailing Plaintiff \nand Class members and keeping them in jail solely because they \nare poor and cannot afford to pay an amount of money to \nsecure release. \n \nb.  A declaratory judgment that Defendant Cantrell has a conflict of \ninterest  that  violates  the  Due  Process  rights  of  defendants \nappearing  before  him  where  he  imposes  commercial  surety \nbonds as a condition of release, fees on such commercial surety \nbonds  generate  substantial  revenue  for  the  Orleans  Parish \nCriminal District Court, and Cantrell has executive authority of \nthe fund in which those fees are deposited.13 \n \n  Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts suggesting, or even hinting, that the state court criminal \naction was brought in bad faith or with the purpose of harassing the federal plaintiffs.14 Nor have \nthey  pled  or  suggested  that  any  state  statute  is  “flagrantly  and  patently  violative  of  express \nconstitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence, and paragraph, and in whatever manner and \nagainst whomever an effort might be made to apply it”, or that Magistrate Judge Cantrell has waived \nthe Younger Doctrine.15 \n                                                            \n13 Rec.

Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 446 \n(1977); DeSpain v.

STANDARDS FOR FRCP 12(B)(1) MOTION \n  Motions pursuant to FRCP 12(b)1 allow a party to challenge subject matter jurisdiction. \nLack of subject matter jurisdiction may be found in any one of three instances: (1) the complaint \nalone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the \ncomplaint  supplemented  by  undisputed  facts  plus  the  Court’s  resolution  of  disputed  facts.17 \nPlaintiffs have the burden of proving jurisdiction exists and this burden is constant throughout the \nlitigation.18 Since standing is jurisdictional it is properly raised via FRCP 12 (b)(1). The same is true \nfor Younger Abstention.19 \n   \n                                                            \n16 Although courts are generally not permitted to review materials outside of the pleadings in a FRCP motion, there are \nexceptions, as here, when plaintiffs refer to documents that are central to the claim. Additionally, these are state court \nrecords and are matters of public record and this Court may take judicial notice of them. Collins v.

STANDING REQUIRES A PERSON WITH AN INTEREST IN THE CLAIM \n  Standing must exist at all phases of the litigation, whether the plaintiff seeks damages or, as \nhere, declaratory relief.  In Bauer, 341 F.3d 352,20 plaintiff had a pending probate proceeding and \nsought declaratory relief regarding certain Texas probate requirements.  The probate proceeding \nconcluded before the declaratory judgment action ended; a motion was filed urging no standing.  \nThe Fifth Circuit granted the motion on grounds that plaintiff no longer faced any threat of injury.   \nIn Society of Separationist, Inc. v. Herman,21 plaintiff, a prospective juror, sought declaratory relief on \nFirst Amendment grounds after refusing to take the oath during voir dire.  The Fifth Circuit \ndismissed for want of standing because plaintiff faced no real or immediate threat that she would \never encounter the judge again. “This Court and others have often held that plaintiffs lack standing \nto seek prospective relief against judges because the likelihood of future encounters is speculative.”22  \n  In Cain v. City of New Orleans,23 ongoing litigation in which Magistrate Judge Cantrell and the \nother judges of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court are defendants, claim is made that the \nplaintiffs, who owed court-assessed costs and fees after pleading guilty to crimes, were treated \nunconstitutionally. Judge Vance held that two of the named plaintiffs, who had paid their debts and \nno longer owed them, lacked standing to proceed, as their interest was too speculative for the Court \nto assume that in the future any one of them might be arrested, convicted, and assessed costs they \ncould not pay and consequently be imprisoned for nonpayment: \nAny prospect of future injury assumes that Variste and Long will again be \ncharged with violations of Louisiana criminal law, will again be assessed with \ncourt costs that they cannot pay, and will again be arrested and imprisoned \nfor  nonpayment.    But  the  Court  must  assume  that  the  plaintiffs  “will \n                                                            \n20 Bauer, 341 F.3d 352. \n21 Soc'y of Separationists, Inc. v.

The City of New Orleans et al, USDC Eastern District of Louisiana, Civil Action No. 15-4479 \n{00656519 - v1}  5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 12-1   Filed 07/17/17   Page 6 of 9\n \nconduct  their  activities  within  the  law  and  so  avoid  prosecution  and \nconviction as well as exposure to the challenged course of conduct.”24  \n   \n  A plaintiff bringing a lawsuit bears the burden of demonstrating three separate elements of \nstanding: plaintiff must: (1) have an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and actual or \nimminent; (2) establish a causal connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct; and (3) \ndemonstrate a likelihood, not merely a speculation or conjecture, that the injury will be redressed if it \nprevails in the action.25  Plaintiffs with no ongoing state criminal case cannot, as a matter of law, \nmeet this burden. No other interest they might express is sufficient, as a person not charged or \nthreatened with prosecution has no standing to compel or enjoin enforcement of state penal laws.26  \nA claim to have the government act in accordance with law or the personal satisfaction from seeing \nthe government comply with law does not create standing.27  A claim for reimbursement of litigation \ncosts  will  not  suffice.28    “A  plaintiff's  purely  academic  interest  or  abstract  disagreement  with \ngovernmental policy does not establish the requisite particularized and concrete injury.”29 Plaintiffs \ncannot show a concrete and particularized injury; they do not have standing. \nV.   ABSTENTION BASED ON YOUNGER V. HARRIS \n  The Fifth Circuit holds that the Younger doctrine applies when three conditions are met and, \nonce satisfied, the federal court must abstain and decline jurisdiction: “(1) the federal proceeding \ninterferes with an ongoing state judicial proceeding; (2) the state has an important interest in \nregulating the subject matter of the claim; and (3) the plaintiff has an adequate opportunity in the \n                                                            \n24 Alana Cain, et al v.

ONGOING STATE COURT PROCEEDING \n  The first requirement is satisfied—there are ongoing state court criminal proceedings as to \nthe named plaintiffs/putative class representatives and, by extension, the proposed class members.32 \nA federal proceeding must not interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding.  Interference \nexists  whenever  the  requested  relief  would  interfere  with  the  state  court’s  ability  to  conduct \nprocedural proceedings, regardless of whether the relief targets the conduct of the proceeding \ndirectly.33  Younger involved a criminal proceeding and held that a federal court cannot interfere with \na pending state court proceeding absent extraordinary circumstances.34   \nb.  ENFORCEMENT OF STATE CRIMINAL LAWS ARE IMPORTANT STATE INTERESTS \n \n  The second inquiry is whether the state has an important interest in regulating the subject \nmatter of the claim. Louisiana has a strong interest in enforcing its criminal laws. The Fifth Circuit \nhas held that abstention is required when state criminal proceedings are currently pending against a \nfederal plaintiff.35   The Fifth Circuit holds abstention is proper.36   \n   \n                                                            \n30 Bice, 677 F.3d at 716; quoting Middlesex Cty.

OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE/ELIMINATE BAIL EXISTS IN THE STATE PROCEEDING \n \n  The third inquiry is whether the federal plaintiff has an adequate opportunity in the state \nproceeding to raise their constitutional challenge. “Adequate” refers to whether the state tribunal \naffords an opportunity for presentation of the federal claim, not whether that claim will prevail.37  \nLouisiana affords a variety of ways in which the issue may be addressed.  There is no question that \nthese plaintiffs have viable remedies under state law and that they are taking advantage of them. \n  The recent case of El v. Louisiana38 is directly on point. El was charged by the Jefferson \nParish District Attorney with certain crimes. El maintained he was sovereign and not subject to state \nlaw. He sued the Governor, the State, and the District Attorney. His case did not survive a FRCP \n12(b)6 motion. His claim against the District Attorney, like the claim against Magistrate Judge \nCantrell, was specifically subject to Younger v. Harris because of the ongoing state criminal proceeding \nwhere he had the right and ability to urge his constitutional issues \nFinally, to the extent that plaintiff asks this Court to enjoin state \ncriminal proceedings pending against him, the request is denied. It \nappears that there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding in the \nTwenty-Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson, \nLouisiana, against plaintiff, the state has an important interest in \nadjudicating  plaintiff’s  criminal  charges,  and  any  viable \nconstitutional challenges plaintiff may have may be raised in the \nstate proceeding. Finally, plaintiff shall not be permitted leave to \nfile an amended complaint against defendant Connick.39  \n \nVI.   CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED \n  \n  Subject-matter jurisdiction is required before this Court can proceed to the merits. The \nburden  to  prove  subject  matter  jurisdiction  rests  with  plaintiffs.  Those  plaintiffs  who  are  not \ndefendants in ongoing state criminal proceedings lack standing for lack of concrete interest and \n                                                            \n37 Ballard v.

CANTRELL, Magistrate Judge \nof Orleans Parish Criminal District Court,   \n \nDefendant.   \n \n   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO \nDEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS \nPlaintiffs Adrian Caliste and Brian Gisclair oppose Defendant Magistrate Harry Cantrell’s \nmotion to dismiss (ECF No. 12). Magistrate Cantrell has raised a lack of standing and also \nargued that this Court should abstain from hearing Plaintiffs’ claims. Both arguments fail, and \nDefendant’s motion to dismiss should therefore be denied. \nI.  Factual Summary  \nDefendant Cantrell is the Magistrate of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court. In that \ncapacity, Cantrell conducts first appearances and establishes the conditions of release for \narrestees under the jurisdiction of the Orleans Criminal District Court. (Complaint, ECF No. 1 ¶ \n8.) Cantrell retains the authority to determine conditions of release until an indictment has been \nissued or a bill of information filed and the case assigned to a section of the court, which often \ntakes months. (Id.)  Magistrate Cantrell routinely requires secured financial conditions of $2,500 \nper charge, regardless of the circumstances of the individual defendants appearing before him, \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 2 of 12\n   \nand he refuses to permit argument or to consider evidence that would weigh in favor of lower \nmonetary bail amounts or non-financial alternatives to secured money bail. (Id. at 6, 8–13) \nThe Orleans Parish Criminal District Court receives a 1.8% fee on every commercial \nsurety bond issued in the parish. (Id. at 13–14.) This generates about $1,000,000 per year, nearly \none quarter of the court’s General Fund budget. (Id. at 14 ¶ 47.) The $1,000,000 collected from \nthis fee on commercial surety bonds funds the court’s operations, including the operating costs \nfor the Magistrate Section. (Id. ¶ 45.)  Along with his fellow judges of the Criminal District \nCourt, Magistrate Cantrell exercises complete executive control over the General Fund. (Id. at 15 \n¶ 49.)  \nPlaintiffs Adrian Caliste and Brian Gisclair were both arrested on nonviolent \nmisdemeanor charges and brought before Defendant Cantrell on June 20, 2017, for their first \nappearances and bail determinations. (Id. at 4–5.) On each of their charges (one for Mr. Gisclair \nand two for Mr. Caliste), Magistrate Cantrell required a secured financial condition of $2,500. \n(Id.) Consistent with his policy, Magistrate Cantrell made no inquiry into the ability of either \nman to pay this amount or whether alternative conditions of release would have served the \ngovernment’s purposes. (Id.)   Accordingly, he made no findings on either issue.   \nII.  Standard of Review for Motions Challenging Jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). \nA case should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) only where “the court lacks the \nstatutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.” Home Builders Ass’n of Miss., Inc. v. \nCity of Madison, 143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir. 1998). Challenges under Rule 12(b)(1) may be \neither facial or factual. Superior MRI Svcs., Inc. v. Alliance Healthcare Svcs., Inc., 778 F.3d 502, \n504 (5th Cir. 2015). A facial challenge is one in which the facts as alleged in the complaint are \ntaken as true, similar to a 12(b)(6) standard. See Paterson v. Weinberger, 644 F.2d 521, 523 (5th \n2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 3 of 12\n   \nCir. 1981). “A motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should only be granted if \nit appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claims entitling \nhim to relief.” In re FEMA Trailer Formaldehyde Prods. Liability Litig., 668 F.3d 281, 287 (5th \nCir. 2012).  A factual challenge under 12(b)(1) challenges an underlying fact necessary for the \ncourt’s jurisdiction, such as prudential standing or the citizenship of a party in a case being heard \nunder the court’s diversity jurisdiction. See Superior MRI Svcs., Inc., 778 F.3d at 504.  \nMagistrate Cantrell has not raised a factual challenge to this Court’s jurisdiction over the \nrepresentative Plaintiffs’ claims. He has appended to his motion to dismiss the docket entries for \nvarious people who are not the Plaintiffs (ECF No. 12-3), and challenged the “standing” of those \nindividuals. The standing of individuals who are not Plaintiffs is irrelevant, as discussed in \nSection III(A) below. The remainder of Magistrate Cantrell’s motion, which argues for abstention \nunder Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), disputes none of the facts as alleged by Plaintiffs \nand is a facial challenge that can be resolved solely with reference to the Complaint. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.   The Named Representative Plaintiffs Have Standing. \n \nMagistrate Cantrell first argues that some criminal defendants appearing before him, \nwhose transcripts were cited as examples of his policies and practices in the fact section of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint, have had their cases resolved since the Complaint was filed.  He argues \nthat they have now lost “standing” to pursue this litigation. (ECF No. 12 at 1 (“[P]laintiffs lack \nstanding because some state criminal proceedings have concluded. . . .”).) Magistrate Cantrell \n3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 4 of 12\n   \nattached to his motion docket entries in the criminal cases cited by Plaintiffs and the docket \nentries for the Plaintiffs themselves. (ECF No. 12-3.)1  \nThis argument fails because the individuals who Defendant Cantrell alleges to lack \nstanding are not Plaintiffs in this litigation. There are two named Plaintiffs to this litigation: \nAdrian Caliste and Brian Gisclair. Defendant does not dispute that those two individuals have \nstanding and has made no argument that the named Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge their \nmoney-based post-arrest detention.  The transcripts of proceedings before Defendant Cantrell \nthat were cited in Plaintiffs’ complaint were merely examples of the unconstitutional conduct that \nhelp to establish Defendant Cantrell’s policies and practices. Whether those other individuals \nhave “standing” to sue Defendant Cantrell has no bearing on the question of whether Mr. Caliste, \nMr. Gisclair, and the class of similarly situated people that they represent have standing. Mr. \nCaliste and Mr. Gisclair were detained pursuant to financial conditions of release at the time they \nfiled their Complaint and Motion for Class Certification and therefore have standing under long-\nestablished federal law to challenge the money-based procedures that led to their unlawful \ndetention.2 Defendant does not even dispute this point.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Both the exhibit and Cantrell’s memo in support of his motion note that the representative Plaintiffs, Mr. Caliste \nand Mr. Gisclair, continued to have open cases in the Magistrate section of Orleans Criminal District Court. \n2 While using the word “standing, Defendants appear to be attempting actually to invoke the concept of mootness.  \nBut even if Defendant had made a mootness challenge referencing those other arrestees or to the named Plaintiffs’ \nclaims, such an argument would be foreclosed by decades of Supreme Court precedent. See Cty. of Riverside v. \nMcLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52 (1991) (holding that a representative plaintiff’s challenge to the county’s failure to make \nprompt probable cause determinations was not moot even though the plaintiffs received probable cause determinations \nor release from custody prior to class certification); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110 n.11 (1975) (holding that the \ntermination of a class representative’s pretrial detention did not moot the class members’ claims challenging the length \nof pretrial detention without a prompt probable cause hearing). In such cases, the claims are so “inherently transitory” \nthat the trial court would not be able to certify a class before the named representative’s claim became moot.  As a \nresult, class certification will relate back to the filing of the complaint. Riverside, 500 U.S. at 52; see also Sandoz v. \nCingular Wireless LLC, 553 F.3d 913, 919 (5th Cir. 2008); Edwards v. Cofield, No. 3:17-cv-321-WKW, 2017 WL \n3015176, at *2–3 (S.D. Ala. July 14, 2017) (holding that the representative plaintiff’s release from jail did not moot \nclass-action claims challenging county’s post-arrest detention practices).  \n4 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 5 of 12\n   \nB.  Younger Abstention is Inappropriate in this Case. \nDefendant next contends that this Court should decline jurisdiction to remedy the \nconstitutional violations in this case based on the principles announced in Younger v. Harris, 401 \nU.S. 37 (1971), in which the Supreme Court established a doctrine by which federal courts \nshould abstain from enjoining criminal proceedings in state courts.  But, as an initial matter, “a \nfederal court’s ‘obligation’ to hear and decide a case is ‘virtually unflagging.’”  Sprint \nCommc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S. Ct. 584, 591 (2013) (quoting Colo. River Water Conservation \nDist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976)).  Abstention is thus the exception and applies \nnarrowly.  It is not warranted here.   \nYounger abstention requires three factors be met:  (1) that there be the potential for undue \ninterference with an ongoing state court proceeding; (2) that an important state interest be \nimplicated by that proceeding; and (3) that there be an adequate opportunity to raise the relevant \nclaim in that proceeding. Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423, \n432 (1982). Apart from the Middlesex factors, the Supreme Court has long recognized an \nexception to Younger abstention if the state proceeding is in a biased tribunal. See Gibson v. \nBerryhill, 411 U.S. 564 (1973). In this case, the third Middlesex factor is not met, since the \nPlaintiffs lack an adequate opportunity to raise these claims before Defendant Cantrell. Second, \nDefendant Cantrell suffers is biased by an institutional financial conflict of interest when he \nadjudicates financial conditions of release. Thus abstention is inappropriate on either of these \nindependent grounds. \n \n \n5 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 6 of 12\n   \n1.  Younger Abstention is Inappropriate Because the Magistrate Section of \nOrleans Criminal District Court Does Not Provide an Adequate Opportunity \nfor Plaintiffs to Raise their Claims. \n \nPlaintiffs and those similarly situated lack an adequate opportunity to challenge the \nlegality of their wealth-based detention in the Magistrate Section of Orleans Criminal District \nCourt.  Magistrate Cantrell does not permit argument or evidence on the question of ability to \npay, and he routinely refuses to consider alternative non-financial conditions of release. \n(Complaint, ECF No. 1 at 6, 8–13)  He also declines to make appropriate findings or to employ \nany of the procedures required under state and federal law for the entry of a valid order of \npretrial detention.  When attorneys attempt to present any of these arguments, he has threatened \nto hold them in contempt.  (Id. at 11–13.) \nFederal courts may not abstain when arrestees challenge the lack of an adequate hearing \ninto the legality of their post-arrest detention. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 108 n.9 (1975). \nThe Gerstein plaintiffs (as here) challenged a pretrial practice, specifically their detention \nwithout a prompt probable-cause determination.  420 U.S. at 106–07.  The Supreme Court held \nthat Younger did not apply to a claim that a prompt hearing into the validity of their detention \nwas required, because the claim “was not directed at the state prosecutions as such, but only at \nthe legality of pretrial detention without a judicial hearing, an issue that could not be raised in \ndefense of the criminal prosecution.”  Id. at 108 n.9.  The Gerstein opinion was an affirmation of \nthe Fifth Circuit’s rejection of Younger abstention to challenges to pretrial detention: “If these \nplaintiffs were barred by Younger from this forum, what relief might they obtain in their state \ncourt trials? Since their pre-trial incarceration would have ended as of the time of trial, no \nremedy would exist.” Pugh v. Rainwater, 483 F.2d 778, 782 (5th Cir. 1973), aff’d in part, rev’d \nin part sub nom Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975).     \n6 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 7 of 12\n   \nThis analysis is so straightforward that Younger abstention arguments have consistently \nbeen rejected in similar cases.  See, e.g., ODonnell v. Harris Cty., Tex., 227 F. Supp. 3d 706, 734–\n39 (S.D. Tex. 2016), recons. denied, No. CV H-16-1414, 2017 WL 784899 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 1, \n2017).  As the Middle District of Tennessee recently commented, “Gerstein stands for the \nprinciple that when it comes to the adequacy of the state court proceedings as an opportunity to \naddress constitutional harms, the opportunity must be available before the harm is inflicted.”  \nRodriguez v. Providence Cmty. Corrs., 15 F. Supp. 3d 758, 766 (M.D. Tenn. 2015). Multiple \nDistrict Courts have rejected Younger abstention in similar pretrial detention challenges. See \nWalker v. City of Calhoun, Ga., No. 4:15-CV-0170-HLM, 2017 WL 2794064 (N.D. Ga. June 16, \n2017) (denying application of Younger due, in part, to fact that challenging constitutionality of \npretrial detention was not a challenge to underlying criminal case and could not be raised in \nthose cases); Welchin v. Cty. of Sacramento, No. 2:16-cv-00185-TLN-KJN, 2016 WL 5930563, \nat *6–9 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2016) (refusing to abstain in a similar challenge to a money-based \nbail schedule system that involved several days of post-arrest detention prior to any judicial \nproceedings at which plaintiffs could raise their constitutional claim); Buffin v. City and Cty. of \nSan Francisco, Case No. 15-cv-04959-YGR, 2016 WL 374230, at *2–5 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 1, 2016) \n(same).  \nAs alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, Magistrate Cantrell routinely refuses to consider the \nability of arrestees’ to pay the secured money bails he imposes or to even entertain any argument \non the subject:  “First of all, this Court never goes any lower than $2,500; okay. So you’ll know \nthat for reference. You don’t have to ask me for that anymore.” (ECF No. 1 at 7.) He has \nexplicitly stated to defense counsel that he will not consider arguments to lower secured surety \nbonds. When a defense attorney attempted to argue for a lower surety bond for his client, \n7 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 8 of 12\n   \nMagistrate Cantrell responded, “You can give me some information[,] but I’m going to set her \nbond at $2,500.” The attorney persisted: “So the bond will be set at $2,500 regardless of the \ninformation given?” Cantrell replied, “Yes.” (Id. at 9.) Cantrell goes so far as to threaten defense \nattorneys with contempt if they attempt to present argument for lowered bail amounts or non-\nfinancial conditions of release. (Id. at 11–13.)  \nPlaintiffs are simply unable to raise their Equal Protection and Due Process arguments \nbefore Magistrate Cantrell. Until a bill of information is filed, an arrestee for whom Cantrell has \nset bail has no means of challenging this bail determination before another judge. If the arrestee \nfiles a motion for bail reduction, Magistrate Cantrell would be the only judge to hear his motion. \n(ECF No. 1 at 3.)  Even if arrestees could later demonstrate to a different court section that their \ndays or weeks of post-arrest wealth-based detention was unconstitutional, the state court judge \ncould not remedy those harms that would already have been suffered. By the time such a state-\ncourt forum is available to them, they may already have been detained for weeks or months on a \nsecured money bail order that has been required without consideration of their ability to pay or of \nnon-financial alternative conditions of release.   \n2.  Younger Abstention is Inappropriate Where the State Proceeding Before \nMagistrate Cantrell is Inherently Biased. \n \nApart from the Plaintiffs’ inability to even raise their Constitutional claims, Magistrate \nCantrell’s inherent institutional financial conflict of interest precludes Younger abstention, even \nif the Middlesex factors were met.  \nIn Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564 (1973), the Supreme Court addressed the question of \nwhether a federal court should abstain from hearing a claim for injunctive relief against a state’s \nprofessional licensing board where the plaintiffs alleged that the board had a financial bias. The \nGibson Court ruled that “the predicate for a Younger v. Harris dismissal was lacking, for . . . the \n8 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 9 of 12\n   \nState Board of Optometry was incompetent by reason of bias to adjudicate the issues pending \nbefore it.”  Gibson, 411 U.S. at 577.3  The Supreme Court has since reaffirmed this principle that \nYounger does not prevent a federal court’s vindicating constitutional rights when a state tribunal \nis biased. See, e.g., Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 124 (1975) (“The policy of equitable \nrestraint expressed in Younger v. Harris, in short, is founded on the premise that ordinarily a \npending state prosecution provides the accused a fair and sufficient opportunity for vindication of \nfederal constitutional rights.”)  \nFederal Circuit Courts have found abstention inapplicable in cases alleging biased state \ntribunals. See Esso Standard Oil v. Lopez-Freytes, 522 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2008) (denying \nabstention where state administrative adjudication was biased by deposit of fines in accounts \ncontrolled by adjudicative body); Trust & Inv. Advisers, Inc. v. Hogsett, 43 F.3d 290 (7th Cir. \n1994) (reversing trial court’s dismissal on Younger grounds and remanding for further factual \ndevelopment of the question of bias on the part of state administrative body); Yamaha Motor \nCorp., U.S.A. v. Riney, 21 F.3d 793 (8th Cir. 1994) (denying abstention where member of state \nadjudicative board had pecuniary interest in the adjudication).  \nIn Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A. v. Royal Nissan, Inc., Judge Mentz of the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana refused to apply Younger abstention in a case in which the plaintiff sought \nan injunction against the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission and alleged that the \nCommission’s members had a financial bias against it. 757 F. Supp 736, 739 (E.D. La. 1991). \n                                                 \n3 It remains unsettled whether a biased tribunal qualifies as an inadequate opportunity to raise a federal plaintiff’s \nclaims under the third Middlesex factor, or whether it is instead an “extraordinary circumstance” that would exclude \nYounger abstention even where the other three factors are met. See, e.g., Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 125 n.4 \n(1975). Regardless, a biased tribunal results in the same outcome:  “[W]hether bias is considered separately from the \nthree-prong Middlesex text, or whether we disregard the clear language in Kugler and consider bias to be a part of \nthe third prong of the test . . . . under Gibson it is clear that bias on the merits of a disciplinary proceeding is \nsufficient to preclude Younger abstention.” Partington v. Gedan, 880 F.2d 116, 139-40 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n \n9 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 10 of 12\n   \nOther districts in the Fifth Circuit agree. See Geots v. Miss. Bd. of Veterinary Med., 986 F. Supp. \n1028 (S.D. Miss. 1997) (“[N]ot only will the federal court not abstain where the potential for \nbias is shown, but upon a finding that members of a state tribunal have a personal interest that \nmight preclude their fair and impartial hearing of charges, it is appropriate for the federal court to \nenjoin the state proceedings against the plaintiff.”).  \nMagistrate Cantrell cites to the case of El v. Louisiana, No. 16-2125, 2017 WL 1969552 \n(E.D. La. May 12, 2017), for the proposition that Younger abstention applies to Plaintiffs’ claims. \nBut the plaintiff in El appeared to be specifically requesting the District Court to enjoin the \nDistrict Attorney from prosecuting his arrest for various misdemeanors. Furthermore, Mr. El \nbased his argument on the proposition that the state court lacked jurisdiction over him because he \nis an adherent to the Moorish Science Temple faith and therefore an entity beyond the \njurisdiction of the United States. Thus El v. Louisiana is easily distinguished from this case. \nPlaintiffs here do not seek to enjoin their criminal prosecutions nor do their claims challenge the \njurisdiction of the state court over them. \nMagistrate Cantrell has an unconstitutional conflict of interest in his role in setting \nPlaintiffs’ bail. (ECF No. 1 at 13–15.)  Indeed, this Court already found such a financial conflict \n(in which judicial officers receive a percentage of monetary bail amounts to the Judicial Expense \nFund) to violate due process over 25 years ago.  Augustus v. Roemer, 771 F. Supp. 1458, 1472–\n73 (E.D. La. 1991).  Chief Judge Vance recently held that an identical claim states a due process \nviolation for the same reasons.  Cain v. City of New Orleans, No. 15-4479, 2017 WL 467685 at \n*17–18 (E.D. La. Feb. 3, 2017).  To summarize: through the statutory scheme requiring the \npayment of 1.8% of every commercial surety bond to the Orleans Criminal District Court, \nMagistrate Cantrell has an impermissible financial conflict in determining whether to require \n10 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 25   Filed 08/15/17   Page 11 of 12\n   \ncommercial money bail as a condition of pretrial release and then in the calibration of what any \nmonetary bail amount should be. The 1.8% fee is deposited into an account controlled by \nMagistrate Cantrell and the Judges of the Orleans Criminal District Court. (ECF No. 1 at 15.) \nThis fee amounts to a quarter of the court’s operating budget. (Id. at 14.) Therefore, Magistrate \nCantrell has an incentive to require financial conditions of release and to calibrate the amount of \nthose conditions in a manner that maximizes the revenue that he controls. Even if Plaintiffs had \nthe ability to raise this argument within the confines of their first appearance, they would be \nforced to make this argument before Magistrate Cantrell, who is not the neutral adjudicator that \nthe Due Process Clause requires. Younger abstention is therefore inapplicable in this case. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nMagistrate Cantrell’s Motion to Dismiss should be denied. First, he has made an \nirrelevant challenge to the “standing” of nonparties. Second, this case falls squarely outside the \nbounds of claims that a federal court must abstain from hearing under Younger v. Harris. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Eric A. Foley     \nKatie M.

Cantrell Motion to Dismiss. R. Doc. 12.  Plaintiff \nopposes the motion. R. Doc. 25. The Court held oral arguments on this matter on August 23, \n2017. Having considered the parties’ arguments, submissions, and the applicable law, the Court \nnow issues this Order and Reasons. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nOn June 27, 2017, a group of Plaintiffs filed suit as a class against one Criminal District \nCourt Judge; Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell. Plaintiff’s Motion to Certify a Class has been \ncontinued. R. Doc. 5, 31. This case arises from Defendant Magistrate Judge Cantrell’s allegedly \nunconstitutional practice of imposing unreasonably expensive secured financial conditions of \nrelease upon arrestees without inquiring about their ability to pay. R. Doc. 1 at 1. Named \nPlaintiffs are two criminal defendants with cases pending in the Orleans Parish Criminal District \nCourt. R. Doc. 1 at 2-3. They appear as class representative for the putative class. Defendant \nHarry Cantrell is the Magistrate Judge for Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, among his \nduties is to set bail for those arrested. He also has a role in managing the expenditures of the \nJudicial Expense Fund. R. Doc. 1 at 3.  \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 44   Filed 08/25/17   Page 2 of 8\n  Plaintiffs, as class representatives, allege that Defendant routinely sets a $2,500 minimum \nsecured money bond. Plaintiffs contend Judge Cantrell sets bond without considering the facts of \nthe case to determine whether a lower bond amount or an alternative condition of release might \nbe appropriate. R. Doc. 1 at 6. Plaintiffs further aver that Defendant requires the use of a for-\nprofit bail bond and does not allow arrestees to post cash bail. R. Doc. 1 at 2. Plaintiffs contend \nthat this policy involves a conflict of interest because under Louisiana law, 1.8% of a bond \namount collected from a commercial surety (but not from any other type of bond) is allocated \ndirectly to the Court for its discretionary use. R. Doc. 1 at 2. Plaintiffs argue that this policy of \nrefusing to consider a criminal defendant’s ability to pay, alternative conditions of release, or a \nlower bond, as well as the resulting institutional financial conflict, violate the Due Process and \nEqual Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. R. Doc. 1. Thus, Plaintiffs seek a \ndeclaratory judgement that Defendant’s bond policy, which results in the creation of a modern \n“debtor’s prison,” is a violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and a declaration that \nDefendant’s financial conflict of interest violates the Due Process rights of criminal defendants. \nR. Doc. 1 at 26.    \nII.  PRESENT MOTION \n \n  Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. R. Doc. \n12. Defendant raises two issues, standing and abstention. R. Doc. 12-1 at 1. \n  First, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs whose criminal proceedings have concluded no \nlonger have a case or controversy and therefore lack standing. R. Doc. 12-1 at 2. Defendant \nasserts that these Plaintiffs lack standing because they are not currently injured (have no pending \ncriminal cases) and are unlikely to suffer the same injury via Defendant in the future. R. Doc. 12-\n1 at 5. Defendant highlights the Court’s opinion in Cain v. City of New Orleans (15-4479). R. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 44   Filed 08/25/17   Page 3 of 8\nDoc. 12-1 at 5. There, the Court held that plaintiffs who had already paid their debts lacked \nstanding because their potential future interest was too speculative. 15-4479, R. Doc. 109 at 18-\n21; R. Doc. 12-1 at 5. The Court reasoned that it “must assume that the plaintiffs ‘will conduct \ntheir activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and conviction as well as exposure to the \nchallenged course of conduct.’” 15-4479, R. Doc. 109 at 18-21 (quoting O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 \nU.S. 488, 496 (1974)).  \n  Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ ongoing criminal proceedings require federal \nabstention under the Younger doctrine. R. Doc. 12-1 at 2, 6. The Fifth Circuit applies the \nYounger doctrine when the following conditions are met: “(1) the federal proceeding would \ninterfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding; (2) the state has an important interest in \nregulating the subject matter of the claim; and (3) the plaintiff has an adequate opportunity in the \nstate proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.” Bice v. Louisiana Pub. Def. Bd., 677 F.3d \n712, 716 (5th Cir. 2012) (internal quotations omitted).  \n  Defendant asserts that the first condition is met because there are ongoing state court \ncriminal proceedings against the named plaintiffs and other class members and that a federal \nproceeding will interfere with the state court’s ability to handle these proceedings. R. Doc. 12-1 \nat 7. Defendant contends that the second condition is met because the state has an important \ninterest in criminal law enforcement and the Fifth Circuit has held abstention appropriate when \nthere are current state criminal proceedings against a federal plaintiff. Bice, 677 F.3d 712; R. \nDoc. 12-1 at 7. Finally, Defendant argues that the third condition is met because Plaintiffs will \nhave an adequate opportunity during the current state criminal proceedings and in future appeals \nto raise their constitutional concerns. R. Docs. 12-1 at 8, 37 at 1.  \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 44   Filed 08/25/17   Page 4 of 8\nIII.  LAW & ANALYSIS \n \na.  Motion to Dismiss Standard \n \n  Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs challenges to a court’s \nsubject matter jurisdiction. A court must dismiss a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \n“when the court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.” Home \nBuilders Ass'n of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, 143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting \nNowak v. Ironworkers Local 6 Pension Fund, 81 F.3d 1182, 1187 (2d Cir. 1996)). \nDismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is appropriate when \nsubject matter jurisdiction is lacking. Ramming v. United States, 281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir. \n2001). The party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of proof. Id. (citing Barrera-Montenegro \nv. United States, 74 F.3d 657, 659 (5th Cir. 1996)). \n  A court reviewing subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) may base its \nopinion on the face of the complaint, “the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts \nevidenced in the record,” or “the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court's \nresolution of disputed facts.” Ramming, 281 F.3d at 161 (internal citations omitted). A district \ncourt evaluating subject matter jurisdiction “must resolve disputed facts without giving a \npresumption of truthfulness to the plaintiff's allegations.” Vantage Trailers, Inc. v. Beall Corp., \n567 F.3d 745, 748 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 413 (5th Cir. \n1981)). \nb.  Standing \n  Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the judiciary to “cases” or \n“controversies.” U.S. Const. III, § 2. “No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s proper \nrole in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 44   Filed 08/25/17   Page 5 of 8\nactual cases or controversies.” DaimlerChrylser Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, at 341–42 (2006) \n(quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 37 (1976)). In order to \nsatisfy the Constitution’s Article 3 standing requirements, a plaintiff must show, (1) that he has \nsuffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).   \n  To meet the case or controversy requirement, plaintiffs “must allege some threatened or \nactual injury resulting from the [defendants’] putatively illegal action before a federal court may \nassume jurisdiction.” O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 493. “Abstract injury is not enough. . . . The injury or \nthreat of injury must be both real and immediate.” Id. at 494 (quoting Golden v. Zwickler, 394 \nU.S. 103, 109-110 (1969)). If a plaintiff is seeking equitable relief, it is not sufficient that they \nwere previously exposed to illegal conduct; rather, prior exposure must be “. . . accompanied by . \n. . continuing, present adverse effects.” Id. at 495-96. However, when plaintiffs who were injured \nat the time of the filing of the suit, by incarceration or deprivation of due process, bring due \nprocess violation claims, these claims are not mooted by plaintiff’s subsequent release from \ncustody or provision of due process. See Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52 (1991) \n(holding plaintiffs’ claims not mooted by release from custody or provision of probable cause \nhearing after filing of complaint). \n  Named and proposed Plaintiffs in this putative class action have criminal cases pending \nbefore Defendant. Therefore, they have ongoing actual injuries, traceable to the defendant, and \nwill likely be redressed by a favorable decision. Defendant argues that Named Plaintiff Gisclair \nlacks standing because he has been released from custody subsequent to the filing of this suit. R. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 44   Filed 08/25/17   Page 6 of 8\nDoc. 32 at 2. However, in Cain v. City of New Orleans, 186 F. Supp. 3d 536 (E.D. La. 2016), the \nCourt only dismissed plaintiffs for lack of standing who were not incarcerated or did not have \ncourt debts outstanding at the time the suit was filed. Id. at 546-47 n.62. Here, Plaintiff Gisclair \nwas incarcerated at the time the suit was filed and his claim is not mooted by his release from \ncustody. Therefore, Plaintiff Gisclair has standing to bring this claim. Finally, regarding the \nputative class members, there are issues related to standing that may depend on facts not present \nat this time.  \nc.  Abstention \n  The Younger abstention doctrine applies when exercising federal jurisdiction would \ninterfere with an ongoing state criminal proceeding. 403 U.S. 37 (1971). Application of the \nYounger doctrine is appropriate when three requirements are satisfied: “(1) the federal \nproceeding would interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding; (2) the state has an \nimportant interest in regulating the subject matter of the claim; and (3) the plaintiff has an \nadequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.” Bice, 677 F.3d \nat 716 (internal quotations omitted). The Fifth Circuit has held that “[u]nder the rule set out by \nthe United States Supreme Court in Younger v. Harris, federal courts must refrain from \nconsidering requests for injunctive relief based upon constitutional challenges to state criminal \nproceedings pending at the time the federal action is instituted.” Harvey v. Cannizzaro, No. 12-\n1187, 2012 WL 1946435, at *3 (E.D. La. May 30, 2012). \n  However, “a necessary predicate for a Younger dismissal . . .  is, the opportunity to raise \nand have timely decided by a competent state tribunal the federal issues involved.” Yamaha \nMotor Corp. U.S.A. v. Riney, 21 F.3d 793, 797 (8th Cir. 1994). Further, the opportunity for \nappeal does not negate a denial of due process in the initial proceeding. Ward v. Village of \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 44   Filed 08/25/17   Page 7 of 8\nMonroeville, Ohio, 409 U.S. 57, 61 (1972). Defendant argues that adequate appeals are available \nin the state courts and that, under Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Lopez-Freytes, Plaintiffs must \ncomplete the state court appeal process before coming to the federal court for relief. 522 F.3d \n136, 141 (1st Cir. 2008). On the contrary, in Esso the court reasoned that abstention was \nappropriate “because [Plaintiff] had not yet demonstrated irreparable harm,” rather than \nreasoning that Plaintiff was required to complete the state court appeal process. Id. \n  Allegations contained on the face of Plaintiffs’ complaint are sufficient to support denial \nof their 14th Amendment rights to due process for purposes of determining subject matter \njurisdiction. The merits of Plaintiffs’ complaint are not yet at issue. Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendant Judge Cantrell does not adequately inquire into Plaintiff’s ability to pay the set bond \nor consider alternative conditions of release. R. Doc. 1 at 1, 4. Further, they claim that Plaintiffs \ndo not have an adequate opportunity to raise the relevant claim in Criminal District Court. R. \nDoc. 1 at 9-11. They allege that when constitutional arguments regarding bond policies and \npractices are raised that Magistrate Cantrell refuses to consider the arguments and threatens to \nhold defense counsel in contempt. R. Doc. 1 at 12-13.  \n  While these Plaintiffs have various procedural mechanisms available to challenge the \nbonds set by Defendant, the delay required by these appeals is problematic because the damage \nis done by the time the appeal is perfected. Named Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \nwill suffer irreparable harm via incarceration and/or the financial burden of the bonds even if \ntheir appeals are eventually successful. Additionally, any appeals would not abrogate denial of \ndue process during initial bond hearings. See Ward, 409 U.S. at 61.   \n  Therefore, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction and Younger abstention is not \nappropriate. Plaintiffs’ complaint is sufficient on its face to make a claim of denial of due \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Document 44   Filed 08/25/17   Page 8 of 8\nprocess. Further, Plaintiffs have not and likely will not have an adequate opportunity in the state \ncourt to raise constitutional challenges in a manner that prevents irreparable harm.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss filed by \nDefendant Harry E. Cantrell is hereby DENIED.  \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties shall attend a status conference in \nchambers set for September 7, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. \n \n \n  New Orleans, Louisiana, this 25 day of August, 2017. \n              \n   \n    _________________________________ \n     UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n       ",

CANTRELL  *  SECTION “L” (5) \nORDER & REASONS \nBefore the Court are Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. \nR.Docs. 116 and 121. The parties have also filed in opposition. R. Docs. 120 and 130. Having\nconsidered the parties’ arguments and the applicable law, the Court issues this Order & Reasons. \nI. BACKGROUND\nOn June 27, 2017, Plaintiffs Adrian Caliste and Brian Gisclair, individually and on behalf \nof others similarly situated, filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Orleans Parish \nCriminal District Magistrate Judge Harry E. Cantrell, alleging violations of their rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. R. Doc. 1 at 25. Plaintiffs \nare former criminal defendants who were in the custody of the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office at \nthe time the complaint was filed. R. Doc. 1 at 2-3. Defendant Cantrell is the Magistrate Judge for \nOrleans Parish Criminal District Court (“OPCDC”), where he is responsible for setting bail upon \narrest and has a role in managing the expenditures of the Judicial Expense Fund. R. Doc. 1 at 3.  \nIn Count One, Plaintiffs allege that Judge Cantrell routinely sets a $2,500 minimum \nsecured money bond without first considering the facts of the case to determine whether a lower \nbond amount or an alternative condition of release might be appropriate. R. Doc. 1 at 6. Plaintiffs \nfurther aver that Judge Cantrell requires the use of a bail bond from a commercial (for-profit) \nsurety and does not allow arrestees to post cash bail. R. Doc. 1 at 2. In Count Two, Plaintiffs \ncontend that Judge Cantrell has a conflict of interest because under Louisiana law, 1.8% of a \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 2 of 30\nbond amount collected from a commercial surety is allocated directly to the Court for its \ndiscretionary use. R. Doc. 1 at 2.  \nPlaintiffs moved to certify a class of similarly situated plaintiffs. R. Doc. 5. On March 16, \n2018, the Court granted this motion and certified the class. R. Doc. 99. Plaintiffs now seek a \ndeclaratory judgement that Judge Cantrell’s bond policy, which they assert results in the creation \nof a modern “debtor’s prison,” and financial conflict of interest are violations of Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights. R. Doc. 1 at 26. Defendant, Judge Cantrell, denies Plaintiffs’ allegations \nand seeks summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs’ complaint.  \nII.  PRESENT MOTIONS \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment (R. Doc. 116) \n \n  Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. R. Doc. 116. The Plaintiff Class \nseeks declaratory judgment on both of their claims. R. Doc. 116-1 at 4. First, Plaintiffs’ argue \nthat Judge Cantrell violates their Equal Protection and Due Process rights by jailing Plaintiffs \nwhen they are unable to pay set bonds. R. Doc. 116-1 at 5. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Cantrell’s \npractice violates their rights against wealth-based detention and fundamental right to pretrial \nliberty because he sets bail without making findings that pretrial detention is necessary or \nmaking an inquiry into Plaintiffs’ ability to pay. R. Doc. 116-1 at 6, 12, 26. Second, Plaintiffs \nargue that since Judge Cantrell shares executive control over funds that come partly from fees on \nthe commercial surety bonds that he sets, he has a conflict of interest in the process of setting \nthose bonds. R. Doc. 116-1 at 33. Plaintiffs allege that this conflict violates their due process \nright to a neutral and detached judge. R. Doc. 116-1 at 29. For these reasons, Plaintiffs move for \nsummary judgment. R. Doc. 116-1 at 34. \n  Defendant responds in opposition. R. Doc. 120. First, Judge Cantrell argues that this \nCourt lacks the power to direct him in the performance of his duties. R. Doc. 120 at 1. Judge \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 3 of 30\nCantrell argues that Plaintiffs have asked this Court to order him to follow certain protocols \nwhen he conducts bail hearings and that this Court lacks the power to direct him in this manner. \nR. Doc. 120 at 3. Second, regarding Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief, Judge Cantrell \nargues that any such relief would be advisory because there is no justiciable controversy. R. Doc. \n120 at 5. Judge Cantrell further argues that Plaintiffs’ claims regarding his bail hearing protocol \nare moot because since this lawsuit he has in good faith changed his bail hearing procedures. R. \nDoc. 120 at 6. Understanding his heavy burden in proving mootness, Judge Cantrell has attached \nan affidavit describing his new colloquy and checklist used during bail hearings. R. Doc. 120-1.1  \n  Third, Judge Cantrell argues that the procedures regarding management of the Judicial \nExpense Fund do not negate a fair tribunal because 1) the OPCDC can go to the state or parish if \nit needs more funds, 2) there is no quota or reward for adding to the fund, and 3) the judges have \nno personal interest in the money collected. R. Doc. 120 at 9-11. Additionally, Judge Cantrell \nargues that he benefits from a presumption of integrity and if this procedure makes him biased \nthan all courts are biased because all collect fees from defendants in some way. R. Doc. 120 at \n13. Finally, Judge Cantrell also argues that the fees incurred under Louisiana’s bail bond statutes \ndo not create an impermissible bias because the Fifth Circuit has held that such fees are \nreasonable administrative fees. R. Doc. 120 at 18.   \nB.  Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment (R. Doc. 121) \n  In support of his motion for summary judgment, Defendant has submitted a \nmemorandum identical to that submitted in response to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary \n                                                 \n1 Although Judge Cantrell argues that he has already amended his bail procedures, there is some discrepancy \nbetween the statements in his affidavit where he uses language indicating in some places that he is currently \nfollowing the new procedures and some language indicating that he will change his procedures in the future. \nAdditionally, these statements contradict his current affirmation of Plaintiffs’ statement of facts. R. Doc. 121-6, 121-\n7.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 4 of 30\njudgment. R. Doc. 121-1. In opposition, Plaintiffs have submitted a memorandum identical to \nthat submitted in reply supporting their own motion. R. Doc. 130.  \nIII.  LAW AND ANALYSIS \n  The present motions raise questions of justiciability, the constitutionality of Judge \nCantrell’s bail procedures, and his conflict of interest when he has both judicial and executive \npower regarding revenues of the Judicial Executive Fund. The Court acknowledges the \nsimilarities between this case and Cain v. City of New Orleans, 283 F. Supp. 3d 624 (E.D. La. \n2017) (Vance, J.). The Court draws as relevant from Judge Vance’s excellent and thorough \nopinion, particularly as it relates to analysis of judicial conflict of interest.  \nA.  Summary Judgment Standard \n   Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). “Rule 56(c) \nmandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, \nagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element \nessential to that party’s case, and on which the party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Id. A \nparty moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the basis for \nsummary judgment and identifying those portions of the record, discovery, and any affidavits \nsupporting the conclusion that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 323. If the moving \nparty meets that burden, then the nonmoving party must use evidence cognizable under Rule 56 \nto demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 324.  \n  A genuine issue of material fact exists if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the \nnonmoving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1996). \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 5 of 30\n“[U]nsubstantiated assertions,” “conclusory allegations,” and merely colorable factual bases are \ninsufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See Hopper v. Frank, 16 F.3d 92, 97 (5th \nCir. 1994); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. In ruling on a summary judgment motion, a court may \nnot resolve credibility issues or weigh evidence. See Int’l Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally’s Inc., 939 F.2d \n1257, 1263 (5th Cir. 1991). Furthermore, a court must assess the evidence, review the facts and \ndraw any appropriate inferences based on the evidence in the light most favorable to the party \nopposing summary judgment. See Daniels v. City of Arlington, Tex., 246 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir. \n2001); Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir. 1986). With these \nlegal principles in mind, the Court turns to the parties motion which will be discussed in turn.  \nB.  Justiciability  \n  Defendant Cantrell’s motion for summary judgment raises several justiciability questions. \nFirst, Judge Cantrell argues that the claims in Count One are moot due to his voluntary cessation \nof the challenged bail procedures. Second, Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs improperly seek a \nwrit of mandamus compelling the actions of a state official. Finally, Judge Cantrell argues that \nthe Court should abstain from granting declaratory relief in this case. The Court will discuss each \nargument in turn.  \ni.  Mootness \n  The Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases or controversies. U.S. \nConst. art. III, § 2. To satisfy this requirement, a plaintiff must have a personal interest in the \ncase, not only at the outset, but at “all stages” of the lawsuit. Davis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 \nU.S. 724, 732-33 (2008) (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67 \n(1997)). If a plaintiff begins a case with a sufficient personal interest but lacks that interest later \nin the case, the plaintiff’s claims are moot. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. \n(TOC) Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 6 of 30\n  This Court has held that Plaintiffs had the requisite personal interest for standing to bring \nthese claims. R. Doc. 44 at 5-6. In this motion, Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs have lost this \npersonal interest and their claims are now moot. Judge Cantrell argues that since this lawsuit he \nintends to cease the allegedly unconstitutional bail procedures thus mooting Count One.  \n  “Generally, any set of circumstances that eliminates actual controversy after the \ncommencement of a lawsuit renders that action moot.” Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. \nCarmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 661 (5th Cir. 2006). When an action is rendered moot it must be \ndismissed. Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477-78 (1990). However, “[i]t is well \nsettled that ‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal \ncourt of its power to determine the legality of the practice.’” Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 189 (quoting \nCity of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)). Accordingly, the Supreme \nCourt has placed a “heavy burden of persuasion” on a defendant attempting to show mootness by \nvoluntary cessation. United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 \n(1968). \n  Judge Cantrell has filed an affidavit stating that since the inception of this litigation he \nhas “revised the protocol [he] follow[s] in setting bail and now take[s] into consideration the \nfollowing factors”:2 \n  There will be no minimum monetary bail amount utilized when assessing and setting bail.  \n  The seriousness of the offense charged, including but not limited to whether the offense \nis a serious crime of violence or involves a controlled dangerous substance.  \n \n  The weight of the evidence against the defendant.  \n  The previous criminal record of the defendant.  \n                                                 \n2 See FN 1 supra.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 7 of 30\n  The ability of the defendant to give bail.  \n  The nature and seriousness of the danger to any other person or the community that \nwould be posed by the defendant’s release.  \n \n  The defendant’s voluntary participation in a pretrial drug testing program.  \n  The absence or presence in the defendant of any controlled dangerous substance.  \n  Whether the defendant is currently out on a bail undertaking on a previous felony arrest \nfor which he is awaiting institution of prosecution, arraignment, trial, or sentencing.  \n \n  Any other circumstances affecting the probability of defendant’s appearance.  \n  The type or form of bail.  \n  Amount and source of defendant’s income.  \n  Defendant’s employment status.  \n  Number and type of defendants.  \n  Recommendations of pre-trial services report.  \n  Should a defendant be unable to afford the amount set, they will be entitled to an \nadversarial hearing, wherein they have the right to be represented by counsel and to \npresent any evidence and/or testimony and traverse (or deny) any evidence and/or \ntestimony presented against them concerning the previously stated factors in determining \nthe amount of bail.   \n \nR. Doc. 120-1 at 2-3. Judge Cantrell further avers that he will now state on the record his \nreasoning when setting bail. R. Doc. 120-1 at 3.  \n  The Court does not doubt that Judge Cantrell is earnest in his present intent to modify his \nbail procedures. However, “allegations by a defendant that its voluntary conduct has mooted the \nplaintiff’s case require closer examination than allegations that ‘happenstance’ or official acts of \nthird parties have mooted the case.” Fontenot v. McCraw, 777 F.3d 741, 747-48 (5th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Envt’l Conservation Org. v. City of Dallas, 529 F.3d 519, 528 n.4 (5th Cir. 2008)). \nAccordingly, the Court has closely examined Defendant’s claims and is not satisfied that the \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 8 of 30\nvoluntary conduct has mooted Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the alleged bail practices. Unlike \ncases where there has been a “formally announced change[]” regarding official policy, Sossamon \nv. Lone Star State of Texas, 560 F.3d 316, 325 (5th Cir. 2009), here the Court and Plaintiffs must \nrely solely on Judge Cantrell’s statement that he has changed his procedures and will not change \nthem back again. Judge Cantrell has submitted no evidence of the implementation of these new \nbail procedures. These changes were made only after this litigation was commenced and Judge \nCantrell’s affidavit is not binding on his future procedures. For these reasons, the Court finds that \nJudge Cantrell has not met his heavy burden of convincing the Court that the challenged bail \nprocedures could not reasonably be expected to recur. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims are not moot.3  \nii.  Mandamus \n  Next, Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs’ have requested a writ of mandamus disguised \nas a request for declaratory relief. “[F]ederal courts have no general power to issue writs of \nmandamus to direct state courts and their judicial officers in the performance of their duties \nwhere mandamus is the only relief sought.” Lamar v. 118th Judicial Dist. Court of Tex., 440 \nF.2d 383, 384 (5th Cir. 1971). However, federal judges have the power to provide declaratory \nand injunctive relief against state judicial officers and these remedies are unequivocally available \nvia § 1983. See 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“[I]n an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper \nproceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or \nomission taken in such officer’s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a \ndeclaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.”); Pulliam v. Allen, 466 \n                                                 \n3 Additionally, the Court notes that Judge Cantrell’s affidavit, if it were sufficient to meet his heavy burden, does not \nresolve all of the issues before the Court regarding the Count One allegations. Specifically, Judge Cantrell’s \naffidavit does not provide a standard to be applied when determining whether a defendant qualifies for alternative \nconditions of release, nor does it provide that defendants will have a right to representative counsel at initial bail \nhearings.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docu m  ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 9 of 30\nU.S. 522, 541-42 (1984); Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517, 525 (5th Cir. 1985).  \n  Judge Cantrell claims that Plaintiffs are asking the Court to direct him in the exercise of \nhis judicial duties, specifically to order him to change his bail procedures in specific ways. \nHowever, Plaintiffs’ complaint and motion for summary judgement merely asks the Court to \nprovide declaratory relief regarding Judge Cantrell’s bail procedures.  \n  A writ of mandamus compels the defendant to perform a certain act. See \nMandamus, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). By contrast, the declaratory \njudgments plaintiffs seek . . . would merely state that certain of defendant[’s] \npractices are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has recognized the authority of \nfederal courts to issue such relief against state judges. See Pulliam, 466 U.S. at \n526 (affirming attorneys’ fees award in case where district court declared \nmagistrate’s practice of “require[ing] bond for nonincarcerable offenses . . . to be \na violation of due process and equal protection and enjoined it”). Thus, the Court \nrejects defendant[’s] argument that plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory relief are in \nfact requests for a writ of mandamus. \n \nCain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 645-46 (footnotes omitted). Because here the alleged acts were \nomissions taken in Judge Cantrell’s judicial capacity, this Court has authority under § 1983.  \niii.  Declaratory Judgment Act \n  Judge Cantrell further argues that it would be inappropriate for the Court to grant a \ndeclaratory judgment because the ruling would be merely advisory. The Declaratory Judgment \nAct is “an enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right \nupon the litigant.” Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 287 (1995) (quoting Public Serv. \nComm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 241 (1952)). As an initial step in a declaratory \njudgment suit, the Court must determine “whether the declaratory action is justiciable.” Sherwin-\nWilliams Co. v. Holmes Cty., 343 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 2003). Defendant argues that the Count \nOne claims are not justiciable because there is no “actual controversy.” However, the Court has \nalready found that Plaintiffs’ claims are not moot. Accordingly, the Court may consider \nPlaintiffs’ claims for declaratory relief.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 10 of 30\niv.  Brillhart-Wilton Abstention \n  Finally, Judge Cantrell argues that the Court should abstain from deciding this case under \nthe Brillhart-Wilton doctrine. Judge Cantrell argues that while the Declaratory Judgment Act \ngrants federal courts discretion, the Court should decline to exercise this discretion. However, the \ncases cited by Judge Cantrell narrowly apply to situations where a federal court sitting in \ndiversity is asked to grant declaratory judgment on a state law matter. Wilton, 515 U.S. at 280, \n290; Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Am., 316 U.S. 491, 493 (1942). Additionally, the Court has \nalready considered and rejected Defendant’s previous abstention arguments under the Younger \ndoctrine. R. Doc. 44 at 6-8.  \n  Accordingly, this analysis is inapplicable to the matter at hand. Furthermore, even if this \nanalysis were applicable, the Fifth Circuit reasoning under St. Paul Ins. Co. v. Trejo, 39 F.3d 585 \n(5th Cir. 1994), and Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Holmes Cty., leads the Court away from abstention. \nIn Brillhart the Court was concerned with whether a federal suit “can be better settled in the state \ncourt.” 316 U.S. at 495. The Fifth Circuit employs seven nonexclusive factors for this purpose, \nwhich it first fashioned in St. Paul Ins. Co. v. Trejo.4 These factors are: \n1) Whether there is a pending state action in which all of the matters in \ncontroversy may be fully litigated, 2) whether the plaintiff filed suit in \nanticipation of a lawsuit filed by the defendant, 3) whether the plaintiff engaged in \nforum shopping in bringing the suit, 4) whether possible inequities in allowing the \ndeclaratory plaintiff to gain precedence in time or to change forums exist, 5) \nwhether the federal court is a convenient forum for the parties and witnesses, . . . \n6) whether retaining the lawsuit in federal court would serve the purposes of \njudicial economy, and [7)] whether the federal court is being called on to construe \na state judicial decree . . . . \n \nTrejo, 39 F.3d at 590–91 (internal citations omitted). The Fifth Circuit has since updated its \nTrejo analysis to include: 1)“[t]he presence of federal law questions, [2)] their relationship to \n                                                 \n4 Trejo was decided prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Wilton. However, the Fifth Circuit continues to apply \nthe Trejo factors with some additional and/or clarified considerations laid out in Sherwin-Williams.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 11 of 30\nstate law questions, [3)] the ability of the federal court to resolve state law issues, and [4)]the \nability of a state court to resolve the federal law issues.” Sherwin-Williams, 343 F.3d at 396. \n“‘The presence of federal law issues must always be a major consideration weighing against \nsurrender’ of federal jurisdiction.” Id. (quoting Moses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. \nCorp., 460 U.S. 1, 26 (1983)). “The presence of federal law issues is especially important when \nthere is no pending state court proceeding to which the federal district court can defer.” Id. \n  Here, the issue before the Court is a federal law issue and there are no pending state court \nproceedings to consider. Plaintiffs have filed a § 1983 claim requesting declaratory relief \nrecognizing their Constitutional rights. None of the above factors apply to this situation or \nsuggest that this suit would be “better settled in state court.” \n  Accordingly, the Court finds that the matters before it are justiciable and finds no reason \nto abstain from ruling. The Court now moves to a consideration of the Plaintiffs’ substantive \narguments seeking summary judgment.  \nC.  Count One: Judge Cantrell’s Bail Procedures \n  In Count One, Plaintiffs’ main argument is that Judge Cantrell’s bail procedures violate \ntheir constitutional rights because he imprisons criminal defendants solely based on their \ninability to pay the set bail. Plaintiffs specifically challenge Defendant’s practice of setting bail \nwithout considering alternative conditions of release or ability to pay.  \n  The facts regarding Judge Cantrell’s bail procedures are undisputed. R. Docs. 121-6, 121-\n7. Judge Cantrell agrees that the following are standard practices for setting bail in his court: \n  Introduction and overview of bail setting process. \n  Qualification of defendants for public defender services, including questions regarding \nemployment, income, and dependents. \n \n  Time for defendants to meet with their attorneys. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 12 of 30\n  Judge Cantrell uses the background information provided by the public defender to \ndetermine the conditions of release or detention; “he does not ask additional questions.” \n \n  Judge “Cantrell has told public defenders that he would hold them in contempt when they \nhave attempted to argue for lower bond amounts or RORs for their clients.” \n \n  Judge “Cantrell does not determine whether the financial condition of release that he \nimposes will result in pretrial detention.” \n \nR. Doc. 121-7 at 3-6.  \n \n  It is clear that under these procedures Judge Cantrell does not request much financial \ninformation from criminal defendants prior to determining the amount of their bail. Nor does he \n“consider or make findings concerning alternative conditions of release when he requires secured \nfinancial conditions, and does not make any findings that pretrial detention is necessary to serve \nany particular government interest if a secured financial condition will result in detention.” R. \nDoc. 121-7 at 6-7. Transcript evidence in the record confirms these facts. R. Docs. 121-7. \nPlaintiffs in this case were imprisoned prior to trial because they were unable to pay the set bail. \nTranscripts from their bail hearings demonstrate that Judge Cantrell did not inquire regarding \ntheir ability to post bail, nor did he provide reasoning for his rejection of alternative conditions of \nrelease.  \n  As an example, Ms. Mishana Johnson was detained prior to trial on a charge of simple \nbattery. R. Doc. 121-7 at 4. Judge Cantrell appointed a public defender to represent Ms. Johnson \nafter learning that she did not have counsel and worked at McDonald’s. R. Doc. 121-7 at 4. Her \nappointed counsel requested $1000 bail based on employment status and lack of risk factors. R. \nDoc. 121-7 at 4. Judge Cantrell set bail at $5000 without inquiry into Ms. Johnson’s ability to \npay and informed the public defender that he does not set bail lower than $2500. R. Doc. 121-7 \nat 5. Judge Cantrell later reprimanded another public defender for requesting release on \nrecognizance (“ROR”) or a $1000 bond. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. The attorney argued that his client \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 13 of 30\nwas employed in a low-wage job and was a college student. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. Judge Cantrell \nagain set a $5000 bond without inquiry into the defendant’s ability to pay or providing reasoning \nfor his rejection of alternative conditions of release. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5.  \n  More disturbing is the colloquy regarding bail set for Ms. Ashley Jackson on June 12, \n2017. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. Judge Cantrell had agreed to an ROR for this defendant until he \nrealized that her listed address was a homeless shelter. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. Subsequently, stating \nhis concerns regarding the court’s ability to contact Ms. Jackson, he set a secured $2500 bond. R. \nDoc. 121-7 at 5. After argument with defense counsel, Judge Cantrell stated that he was “not \npunishing [the defendant] for being poor [but that he was] punishing her because [the court \ncould] not get in touch with her.” R. Doc. 121-7 at 6.  \n  This evidence suggests that Judge Cantrell regularly sets bail without considering the \ndefendant’s ability pay or qualification for alternative conditions of release and that these \npractices regularly result in pretrial detention based on inability to pay bail. Judge Cantrell has \nnot argued that these descriptions of his practices are inaccurate and has made no substantive \nconstitutional arguments in defense of these practices.  \n  Plaintiffs argue that these practices violate their due process and equal protection rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nprovides that “[n]o state . . . shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due \nprocess of law . . . .” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. It protects individuals against two types of \ngovernment action. “Substantive Due Process” prevents the government from engaging in \nconduct that “shocks the conscience,” Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952), or \ninterferes with rights “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. \n319, 325–26 (1937). “Procedural Due Process” ensures that government action depriving a \nperson of life, liberty, or property is implemented in a fair manner. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 14 of 30\nU.S. 319, 335 (1976). \n  Although “[d]ue process and equal protection principles converge” in \ncases involving the criminal justice system’s treatment of indigent individuals, \nBearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 665 (1983), plaintiffs’ argument sounds in \nprocedural due process. Thus, the familiar framework set out in Mathews v. \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), applies. See Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 444–\n45 (2011) (applying Mathews v. Eldridge to civil contempt proceedings). \n \nCain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 649.  \n \n  “[S]tandard analysis under [the Due Process Clause] proceeds in two steps: We first ask \nwhether there exists a liberty or property interest of which a person has been deprived, and if so \nwe ask whether the procedures followed by the State were constitutionally sufficient.” Swarthout \nv. Cooke, 562 U.S. 216, 219 (2011). Here, Plaintiffs successfully assert that they have been \ndeprived of a liberty interest based on “the well-established principle that an indigent criminal \ndefendant may not be imprisoned solely because of her indigence.” Cain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 649 \n(citing Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971); United States v. Voda, 994 F.2d 149, 154 n.13 \n(5th Cir. 1993)). Additionally, Plaintiffs have been deprived of their fundamental right to pretrial \nliberty. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750 (1987); see also Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 \nU.S. 71, 80 (1992) (“Freedom from bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty \nprotected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental action.”); Jones v. United \nStates, 463 U.S. 354, 361 (1983) (quoting Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979)) (“It is \nclear that ‘commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that \nrequires due process protection.’”).  \n  Under Mathews, courts consider three factors to identify the requirements of procedural \ndue process when the state endeavors to deprive someone of these rights: \n  First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; \nsecond, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the \nprocedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute \nprocedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 15 of 30\nfunction involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail. \n \n424 U.S. at 335. The Supreme Court has discussed the types of procedural safeguards required to \nauthorize pretrial detention under the Bail Reform Act. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 751-52 (finding that \nthe procedures under the Bail Reform Act were “specifically designed to further the accuracy of \nth[e] determination” of “the likelihood of future dangerousness” and did not violate due process). \nAmong the valuable procedural safeguards noted in Salerno were “right to counsel at the \ndetention hearing”; the opportunity to testify, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses; \nstandards for the judicial officer “determining the appropriateness of detention”; government \nburden of clear and convincing evidence; and requirement of findings of fact and reasons for \ndetention from the judicial officer. Id.  \n  The Supreme Court has also articulated additional procedural safeguards in several \ndifferent contexts including pretrial and post-conviction detention.5 In Bearden v. Georgia, the \nSupreme Court held that “a sentencing court can[not] revoke a defendant’s probation for failure \nto pay the imposed fine and restitution, absent evidence and findings that the defendant was \nsomehow responsible for the failure or that alternative forms of punishment were inadequate.” \n461 U.S. 660, 665, 673-74 (1983). There, the state court had imprisoned Bearden for his inability \nto pay a fine but had not asked why he was unable to pay or considered other alternative means \nof enforcing the fine. Id. at 674. The Court reasoned that for the state court to simply convert the \nfine into a prison sentence without “inquir[ing] into the reasons for the failure to pay” or finding \nthat “alternate measures [we]re not adequate to meet the State’s interests . . . would deprive \n[Bearden] of his . . . freedom simply because, through no fault of his, he [could not] pay the \n                                                 \n5 This Court finds that the post-conviction detention cases, while not directly on point, are highly relevant because \nthe liberty interests of presumptively innocent, pretrial detainees cannot be less than, and are generally considered \ngreater than, those of convicted defendants. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 16 of 30\nfine.” Id. at 672-73.  \n  Moreover, in Turner v. Rogers, the Supreme Court held that court-appointed counsel was \nnot required in a civil contempt proceeding if sufficient alternative procedures were provided \n“equivalent to . . . adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay, fair opportunity to present, \nand to dispute, relevant information, and court findings.” 564 U.S. 431, 448 (2011). There, the \nCourt reasoned that “[g]iven the importance of the [liberty] interest at stake, it is obviously \nimportant to assure accurate decisionmaking in respect to the key ‘ability to pay’ question.” Id. at \n445.  \n  While there are clear differences between the facts of these cases and the facts at issue \nhere, what is manifest and pertinent is the Supreme Court’s emphasis on the due process \nrequirements of an informed inquiry into the ability to pay and findings on the record regarding \nthat ability prior to detention based on failure to pay. Accordingly, the Court finds that these \ncases are useful here because Plaintiffs have been subjected to pretrial imprisonment, as a result \nof their inability to pay a court ordered sum.  \n  With the principles of Salerno, Bearden, and Turner in mind, the Court applies the \nMathews factors to the present facts.  \nFirst, plaintiffs’ interest in securing their “freedom ‘from bodily restraint[ ]’ lies \n‘at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.’” Turner, 564 U.S. \nat 445 (quoting Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992)). Plaintiffs’ liberty \ninterest weighs heavily in favor of procedural safeguards provided before \nimprisonment. \n \nCain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 651. \n \n  “Second, the risk of erroneous deprivation without an inquiry into ability to pay is high.” \nId. The record suggests that many criminal defendants, including Named Plaintiffs, have been \nimprisoned solely because they are unable to pay the bail amount set by Judge Cantrell. These \nare criminal defendants who have been found to be indigent for the purpose of appointing \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 17 of 30\ncounsel. Accordingly, the inquiry into the ability to pay “must involve at least notice and \nopportunity to be heard, [and express findings in the record] as suggested by Turner; an ability-\nto-pay inquiry without these basic procedural protections would likely be ineffective.” Id.  \n  Third, Judge Cantrell has not suggested any government interest6 that would prevent or \ndiscourage an inquiry into the ability to pay. Rather, he seems to agree that it is appropriate to \nconsider “[t]he ability of the defendant to give bail.” R. Doc. 120-1 at 2. However, this simple \nconsideration is inadequate under the principles laid out by the Supreme Court. Bearden requires \nthat this inquiry include court consideration of the reasons why a criminal defendant cannot pay \nand of alternative measures prior to imprisonment. 461 U.S. at 672; see Cain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at \n652.  \n  Here, it is clear that Judge Cantrell did not conduct an inquiry into ability to pay or \ninclude satisfactory procedural safeguards to that inquiry when setting bail. To satisfy the Due \nProcess principles articulated by Supreme Court precedent, Judge Cantrell must conduct an \ninquiry into criminal defendants’ ability to pay prior to pretrial detention. “This inquiry must \ninvolve certain procedural safeguards, especially notice to the individual of the importance of \nability to pay and an opportunity to be heard on the issue. If an individual is unable to pay, then \n[he] must consider alternative measures before imprisoning the individual.” Cain, 281 F. Supp. \n3d at 652.  \n  Plaintiffs suggest that due process requires additional procedures in order to “ensure the \naccuracy of [a] finding that pretrial . . . detention is necessary.” R. Doc. 116-1 at 14. Plaintiffs \ncite Salerno and the safeguards provided under the Bail Reform Act as the standard for these \nadditional procedural safeguards because they provide confidence that a sufficient inquiry into \n                                                 \n6 Defendant has not made any constitutional arguments regarding the substance of Plaintiffs’ Count One claims.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 18 of 30\nability to pay is conducted prior to pretrial detention. In Salerno, the Court noted that the Bail \nReform Act is “narrowly focuse[d] on individuals who have been arrested for a specific category \nof extremely serious offenses.” 481 U.S. at 750. Even with this heightened government interest, \n“[i]n a full-blown adversary hearing, the Government must convince a neutral decisionmaker by \nclear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of \nthe community or any person.” Id. The Court then praised other procedural safeguards found to \nbe sufficient under Due Process including: findings of fact, statements of reasons for decisions, \nand the right to counsel.” Id. at 750-51; see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973) \n(listing the minimum requirements of due process when revoking probation). These procedures \nare required for defendants charged with committing serious offenses. How much more \nimportant are these safeguards when considering pretrial detention for criminal defendants who \nmay not be accused of committing extremely serious offenses?  \n  First, Plaintiff suggests that Due Process requires proof under the clear and convincing \nstandard “that pretrial detention is necessary to mitigate either a risk of flight or a danger to the \ncommunity.” R. Doc. 116-1 at 16. Beginning with Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979), the \nSupreme Court has held that, when scrutinized under procedural due process criterion, \ndeprivation of liberty requires a heightened standard. There, when considering the government’s \ninterest in “protect[ing] the community from the dangerous tendencies of some who are mentally \nill,” the Court reasoned that the clear and convincing standard struck an appropriate balance \nbetween scrupulous protection of individual liberty interests and the government interest in \npublic safety. Id. at 424, 426.  \n  In cases where physical liberty is at stake in all kinds of situations, the Court consistently \napplies the clear and convincing standard. Foucha, 504 U.S. at 82; Cruzan ex rel. Cruzan v. Dir., \nMo. Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 282-83 (1990); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 756 \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 19 of 30\n(1982); Addington, 441 U.S. at 433; see also Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966); \nSchneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 123 (1943). While this Court has not found a case \nrequiring the clear and convincing standard in the particular circumstances of this case,7 \ndetermining pretrial detention based specifically on risk of flight, the Court is convinced of the \nvital importance of the individual’s interest in pretrial liberty recognized by the Supreme Court. \nIn a Mathews analysis of the balance required by Due Process of the private liberty interest and \ninterest of the government in ensuring that a criminal defendant appears in court, the Court \nagrees with the views expressed in the concurring opinion in United States v. Motamedi, 767 \nF.2d 1403, 1409 (9th Cir. 1985) (Boochever, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).8  \n[T]he consequences to the defendant from an erroneous pretrial detention are \ncertain and grave. The potential harm to society, although also significant, is \nspeculative, because pretrial detention is based on the possibility, rather than the \ncertainty, that a particular defendant will fail to appear. Moreover, society’s \ninterest in increasing the probability of detention is undercut by the fact that it has \nno interest in erroneously detaining a defendant who can give reasonable \nassurances that he will appear. I conclude therefore that the injury to the \nindividual from an erroneous decision is greater than the potential harm to \nsociety, and that under Addington due process requires that society bear a greater \nportion of the risk of error: the government must prove the facts supporting a \nfinding of flight risk by clear and convincing evidence. \n \nId. at 1415.  \n \n  Second, Plaintiffs suggest that arrestees must be represented by counsel. R. Doc. 116-1 at \n24. The importance of the right to counsel is evident from its inclusion in the Bill of Rights. The \nSixth Amendment requires that the government provide counsel for those who cannot afford it at \n“critical stages” of criminal proceedings. Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 695-96 (2002). The \n                                                 \n7 Case law considering the standard required under the Bail Reform Act alone has held that the preponderance of the \nevidence standard is sufficient. See e.g., United States v. McConnell, 842 F.2d 105 (5th Cir. 1988). However, these \ncases did not consider the burden of proof require by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See \ne.g., McConnell, 842 F.2d 105; United States v. Motamedi, 767 F.2d 1403 (9th Cir. 1985).  \n8 In United States v. Motamedi, the Ninth Circuit was confronted only with the question of the proper standard \nrequired by the Bail Reform Act. The Court finds Judge Boochever’s reasoning persuasive when conducting an \nanalysis of the standard required by the Constitution.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 20 of 30\nSupreme Court has held that “critical stages” are those that “h[o]ld significant consequences for \nthe accused.” Id. at 696; Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 10 (1970) (holding that a preliminary \nbail hearing is a “critical stage . . . at which the accused is . . . entitled to [counsel]”). There is no \nquestion that the issue of pretrial detention is an issue of significant consequence for the accused.  \n  Under a Mathews analysis, the Court finds that without representative counsel the risk of \nerroneous pretrial detention is high. Preliminary hearings can be complex and difficult to \nnavigate for lay individuals and many, following arrest, lack access to other resources that would \nallow them to present their best case. Considering the already established vital importance of \npretrial liberty, assistance of counsel is of the utmost value at a bail hearing.  \n  Judge Cantrell does not argue this point. In fact, the record shows that public defenders \nare regularly provided for those individuals found to be indigent at their initial appearance before \nJudge Cantrell. The Court commends this practice and encourages its continuance. Beyond this \nencouragement, the Court finds that the right to counsel at a bail hearing to determine pretrial \ndetention is also required by due process. The interests of the government are mixed regarding \nprovision of counsel at this stage. It is certainly a financial burden on the state to provide \nattorneys for the indigent. However, this burden is outweighed not only by the individual’s great \ninterest in the accuracy of the outcome of the hearing, but also by the government’s interest in \nthat accuracy and the financial burden that may be lifted by releasing those arrestees who do not \nrequire pretrial detention. Accordingly, the Mathews test demonstrates that due process requires \nrepresentative counsel at pretrial detention hearings.  \n  As discussed above, the record indicates that Judge Cantrell’s bail procedures have not \nprovided notice of the importance of the issue of the criminal defendant’s ability to pay, inquiry \ninto the ability to pay, findings on the record regarding ability to pay and consideration of \nalternative conditions of release, or application of a legal standard in the determination of the \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 21 of 30\nnecessity of pretrial detention. Accordingly, these procedures violate Plaintiffs’ procedural due \nprocess rights; Plaintiffs’ are entitled to summary judgment on Count One and it is appropriate to \ngrant Plaintiffs’ motion for declaratory judgment.  \n  The Court commends Judge Cantrell’s expressed willingness to mend the bail procedures \nin his court to comply with due process requirements. R. Doc. 120-1. As a summary of the above \ndiscussed Mathews analysis, the Court finds that in the context of hearings to determine pretrial \ndetention Due Process requires:  \n1) an inquiry into the arrestee’s ability to pay, including notice of the importance of this \nissue and the ability to be heard on this issue; \n2) consideration of alternative conditions of release, including findings on the record \napplying the clear and convincing standard and explaining why an arrestee does not \nqualify for alternative conditions of release; and \n3) representative counsel.  \nD.  Count Two: Conflict of Interest \n  In Count Two, Plaintiffs argue that Judge Cantrell has an unconstitutional conflict of \ninterest that violates due process when he sets bail. Plaintiffs challenge Judge Cantrell’s \nmultipurpose role in determining their ability to pay bail, the amount of bail upon which pretrial \nrelease is conditioned, and managing the Judicial Expense Fund, a portion of which comes from \nfees levied on commercial surety bonds. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Cantrell’s management role \nover this fund creates an unconstitutional conflict of interest that deprives them of their right to a \nneutral fact finder in pretrial detention hearings. \ni.  The Judicial Expense Fund \n  Louisiana Revised Statute 13:1381.4 sets up the Judicial Expense Fund (“the Fund”) for \nthe Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (“OPCDC”). The Fund receives revenue from fines, \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 22 of 30\nfees, costs, and forfeitures imposed by the OPCDC. See La. Rev. Stat. § 13:1381.4. \nApproximately $1 million per year in revenue comes from fees levied on commercial surety \nbonds, representing roughly 20-25% of the total Fund in a given year. R. Doc. 121-7 at 9. The \nfund is controlled by the Judges of the OPCDC and “may be used for any purpose connected \nwith, incidental to, or related to the proper administration or function of the court or the office of \nthe judges . . . .” La. Rev. Stat. § 13:1381.4(C). However, the Fund may not be used to pay any \njudge’s salary. Id. § 13.1381.4(D). Generally, the Fund is used to finance court operations \nincluding, but not limited to, staff salaries and benefits, conferences and legal education, \nceremonies, office supplies, law books, jury expenses, and other services. R. Doc. 121-7 at 8.  \nii.  Legal Standards \n  As discussed by the Court in Cain v. City of New Orleans, the unbiased judge or neutral \nfact finder has long been considered “essential to due process.” Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Bomer, 274 \nF.3d 212, 217 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting Johnson v. Mississippi, 403 U.S. 212, 216 (1971)). While \ndisqualification of a judge is not common, the Supreme Court has held that when a judge has \nfinancial interests in the matter before him due process is violated. In Tumey v. Ohio, the \nSupreme Court “held that the mayor, acting as judge, was disqualified from deciding Tumey’s \ncase ‘both because of his direct pecuniary interest in the outcome, and because of his official \nmotive to convict and to graduate the fine to help the financial needs of the village.’” Cain, 281 \nF. Supp. 3d at 655 (quoting Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 535 (1927)). There, the mayor acted as \njudge in courts that levied fines, some of which went to village funds. Tumey, 273 U.S. at 521-\n22. These funds covered some court expenses as well as some fees paid to the mayor himself. Id. \nat 522.  \n  Later, in Ward v. Village of Monroeville, the Court held that a mayor’s court violated due \nprocess when it financed a “major part” of the city funds that were also managed by the mayor. \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 23 of 30\n409 U.S. 57, 58, 60 (1972). There, the Court reasoned that the principle articulated in Tumey did \nnot rely on the mayor’s personal interest in the funds. Id. at 60. Rather, the Court articulated the \nfollowing test: “whether the . . . situation is one ‘which would offer a possible temptation to the \naverage man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which \nmight lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear, and true between the state and the accused.’” \nId. at 60 (quoting Tumey, 273 U.S. at 532).  \n  More recently, the Court has clarified that finding a conflict of interest in violation of due \nprocess “do[es] not require proof of actual bias.” Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 \nU.S. 868, 883 (2009). Rather, when determining whether the Due Process Clause requires \njudicial recusal due to a conflict of interest, the correct question is “whether, ‘under a realistic \nappraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,’ the interest ‘poses such a risk of \nactual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is \nto be adequately implemented.’” Id. at 883-84 (quoting Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 \n(1975)).  \n  The Fifth Circuit applied these principles in Brown v. Vance, 637 F.2d 272, 274, 282 (5th \nCir. 1981), holding that a fee system that compensated justices of the peace based on volume of \ncases filed was unconstitutional. There, the Court reasoned that the Supreme Court’s concern in \nTumey and Ward  \nwas not . . . the probity of an individual judge or perhaps even, of the great \nmajority of judges . . . rather [it was] in the inherent defect in the legislative \nframework arising from the vulnerability of the average man-as the system works \nin practice and as it appears to defendants and to the public. \n \nId. at 284. Accordingly, the Court found that the undeniable opportunity and “possible \ntemptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required” created by the \nsystem was sufficient to “deprive[] criminal defendants of their due process right to a trial before \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 24 of 30\nan impartial tribunal.” Id. at 282 (quoting Tumey, 273 U.S. at 532).  \n  Most recently, this Court applied this line of cases holding that collection of costs and \nfees by judges in Orleans Criminal District Court who also administer those monies as part of the \nJudicial Expense Fund had an “institutional incentive[ that] create[d] an impermissible conflict \nof interest when they determine, or are supposed to determine, plaintiffs’ ability to pay fines and \nfees.” Cain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 659. The Cain case dealt with the same Judicial Expense Fund at \nissue in this case and a different source of revenue also determined by judges. There, the relevant \nfacts included the above discussed management of the Judicial Expense Fund by the judges and \nthose same judges determination of ability to pay the fines and fees going to the Fund. Id. at 654.  \n  The Court in Cain reasoned that “[b]y no fault of their own, the Judges’ ‘executive \nresponsibilities for [court] finances may make [them] partisan to maintain the high level of \ncontribution,’ . . . from criminal defendants.” Id. at 657 (quoting Ward, 409 U.S. at 60). For that \nreason, the Court found that the judge’s “substantial” conflict of interest in adjudicating \nplaintiffs’ ability to pay fines and fees “offend[ed] due process” “[s]o long as the Judges control \nand heavily rely on fines and fees revenue.” Id. at 657-58.  \niii.  Analysis  \n  Here, it is clear from the record that Judge Cantrell participates in the management of the \nFund, sets the amount of bail, and determines arrestee’s ability to pay bail. R. Doc. 121-7 at 8. \nAs discussed above, the Fund is partially financed by fees levied on commercial surety bonds. \nJudges, including Judge Cantrell then use these funds to finance court operations. Approximately \n$1,000,000 gained from bond fees is deposited into the Fund each year.9 This is roughly 20-25% \n                                                 \n9 The Fund gained $821,371 in bond fees in 2012, $1,062,224 in 2013, $1,026,282 in 2014, $1,008,108 in 2015, \n$848,089 in 2016, and $839,006 in 2017. R. Doc. 121-7 at 9.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 25 of 30\nof the Fund’s total revenue in a given year.10 R. Doc. 121-7 at 9. “This funding structure puts the \nJudges in the difficult position of not having sufficient funds to staff their offices unless they \nimpose and collect sufficient [monies] from a largely indigent population of criminal \ndefendants.” Cain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 655.  \n  Judge Cantrell’s participation in the management of bond fee revenue creates a conflict \nof interest because he is also responsible for determining whether a pretrial detainee is able to \npay bail and the appropriate amount of bail. As stated above, due process requires that Judge \nCantrell make an inquiry regarding an arrestee’s ability to pay and consider alternative \nconditions of release. However, Judge Cantrell also has a financial interest in these \ndeterminations as well as the determination of the amount of bail because revenue collected as a \npercentage of the bail set by him is promptly sent to the Fund. See id. Accordingly, Judge \nCantrell “ha[s] an institutional incentive to find that criminal defendants are able to pay bail” and \nto set higher bail amounts. Id.  \n  [Defendant Cantrell’s] dual role, as [an] adjudicator who determine[s] \nability to pay [and amount of bail] and as manager[] of the OPCDC budget, \noffer[s] a possible temptation to find that indigent criminal defendants are able to \npay [bail and higher amounts of bail]. This “inherent defect in the legislative \nframework” arises not from the bias of any particular Judge, but “from the \nvulnerability of the average man—as the system works in practice and as it \nappears to defendants and to the public.”  \n \nId. (quoting Brown, 637 F.2d at 284).  \n \n  The Tumey Court further reasoned that to offend due process the judicial conflict of \ninterest must be substantial. 273 U.S. at 534 (“The minor penalties usually attaching to the \nordinances of a village council, or to the misdemeanors in which the mayor may pronounce final \njudgment without a jury, do not involve any such addition to the revenue of the village as to \n                                                 \n10 The revenue from bond fees represented 20% of the total Fund revenue in 2012, 25.9% in 2013, 26.1% in 2014, \n25.5% in 2015, 21% in 2016, and 19% in 2017. R. Doc. 121-7 at 9.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 26 of 30\njustify the fear that the mayor would be influenced in his judicial judgment by that fact.); Cain, \n281 F. Supp. 3d at 657. “[T]he proper question is ‘whether the official motive here is “strong,” \nso that it “reasonably warrants fear of partisan influence on the judgment.”’” Id. (quoting Alpha \nEpsilon Phi Tau Chapter Hous. Ass’n v. City of Berkeley, 114 F.3d 840, 847 (9th Cir. 1997)).  \n  Here, it is clear that Judge Cantrell’s, as well as that of the OPCDC, institutional interest \nin the fees derived from commercial surety bonds is substantial. As discussed above, the \npercentage of the Fund derived from these fees is roughly 25% and these funds make up a \nconsiderable portion of the salaries and benefits for judicial employees. In Cain, the Court found \nthat a similar percentage of the Fund was enough to make the judges’ conflict of interest \nsubstantial. Id. at 657-58 (“Fines and fees revenue is obviously important to the Judges; fines and \nfees provide approximately 10% of the total OPCDC budget and one quarter of the Judicial \nExpense Fund.”).  \n  As explained by the Court in Cain, this conflict of interest is not created by Judge \nCantrell, nor is it his fault. The conflict of interest is “the unfortunate result of the financing \nstructure” and lack of sufficient funding from the state and local governments for the criminal \njustice system. Id. at 658. However, the source of the conflict does not change the fact that as \nlong as Judge Cantrell participates in the control of bond fee revenue and the OPCDC relies on it \nas a substantial source of funding, Judge Cantrell’s determination of Plaintiffs’ ability to pay bail \nand the amount of that bail is in violation of due process. See id. \n  Defendant makes several arguments that his dual role in setting bail and administering \nthe Fund do not offend due process requirements. The Court will consider each in turn.  \n  First, Judge Cantrell argues that the Fund system does not create a conflict of interest \nbecause if the OPCDC needs additional funds it can request them from the state legislature or \nlocal parish government. R. Doc. 120 at 9. The Court approaches this claim with some \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 27 of 30\nincredulity. Given the substantial percentage of the Fund coming from bond fees, the Court finds \nit implausible that these revenues would be easily replaced by solicitation of state and local \nofficials. Furthermore, OPCDC officials themselves have noted the significance of this amount \nof revenue and its sources to the Fund. See Cain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 658.11  \n  Second, Judge Cantrell argues that the revenues in the Fund are publically audited and \nused appropriately. The Court finds this fact irrelevant to the issues before it as Plaintiffs are not \narguing that the use of the revenues violates their constitutional rights, but rather that the \ndetermination of those revenues and control over them by the same individual is the problem.  \n  Third, Judge Cantrell argues that he is not subjected to a quota, receives no rewards based \non amount of revenue collected, and has no personal interest in the Fund. The Court finds that it \nis not necessary for Judge Cantrell to have a quota, punishment, or reward associated with the \nFund in order to have a conflict of interest. The significance of these funds for the payment of \npersonnel salaries and other administrative needs, approximately $250,000 per chambers, is \nsufficient incentive to act as a “possible temptation” to the “average man.” Additionally, “[t]hat \n[Judge Cantrell] ha[s] an institutional, rather than direct and individual, interest in maximizing \n[bond fee] revenue is immaterial.” Cain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 656. “Ward itself involved a mayor \nwho had no direct, personal interest in traffic fine revenue; his interest related solely to his \n‘executive responsibilities for village finances.’ 409 U.S. at 60. Likewise, [Judge Cantrell’s] \ninterest in [bond fee] revenue is related to [his] executive responsibilities for OPCDC finances.” \nId. at 656-57.  \n  Fourth, Judge Cantrell argues that all courts are partially funded by fees from criminal \n                                                 \n11 The Court also notes that the Affidavit testimony submitted to support this argument is the same testimony \nprovided to Judge Vance in the Cain case. R. Doc. 120-2. Judge Vance did not find the argument negated her \nfinding that the “OPCDC depends heavily on fines and fees revenue” which also makes up approximately 25% of \nthe Fund. Cain, 281 F. Supp. 3d at 658.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 28 of 30\ndefendants and if this funding offends due process then no courts will be functional. Defendant \nmisses the point here because the problem is not specifically with the fact that the court is \npartially funded by fees from criminal defendants and those that utilize the court system. Rather \nthe problem lies with the inherent temptation and conflict of interest when the same official is \ndetermining ability to pay bail, and the amount of that bail, and also managing the funds \ncollected from fees on that bail.  \n  Fifth, Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs cannot overcome the “presumption of honesty \nand integrity of judges.” R. Doc. 120 at 13 (citing Valley v. Rapides Parish Sch. Bd., 118 F.3d \n1047, 1052-53 (5th Cir. 1997)). However, in Brown v. Vance, when reviewing the district court’s \nuse of this standard, the Fifth Circuit found that the district court had erred. 637 F.2d at 283.  \nThere is no language in Tumey or Ward qualifying the “possible temptation” \nstandard by the necessity of overcoming the presumption of probity in favor of \nadjudicators. That added burden comes from Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, \nupon which the district court and the defendant strongly relied. But the question in \nWithrow was whether a board of physicians could exercise both investigative and \nadjudicative functions.  \n \nId. Likewise, the case cited by Judge Cantrell involved the potential bias of a school board rather \nthan a judge. Valley, 118 F.3d at 1049. Accordingly, the proper standard has been stated above, \nthat the interest under Tumey and Ward is not the actual bias or integrity of an individual judge, \nbut rather “the vulnerability of the average man-as the system works in practice and as it appears \nto defendants and to the public [and] the possibility that judges will fail to hold ‘the balance nice, \nclear and true.’” Brown, 637 F.2d at 284. Furthermore, it is not only important that justice be \ndone; it is equally important that justice appear to be done. The appearance of justice is vital to \nperpetuation of the rule of law, a concept upon which our society is based.  \n  Finally, Judge Cantrell raises Broussard v. Parish of Orleans arguing that the bail bond \nstatutes do not create an unconstitutional bias. The Court has previously addressed the relevance \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 29 of 30\nof Broussard in the proper party defendant context. R. Doc. 81 at 6. The Court again finds that \nBroussard is not relevant to the issue of judicial conflict of interest in this case. In Broussard the \nplaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Louisiana bail statutes rather than alleging bias of \nindividual judicial officers. 318 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2003). There, the Fifth Circuit affirmed \nthe district court finding that Tumey and Ward did not apply because the defendants, sheriffs, \nwere not exercising a judicial function. Id. at 662. In contrast, Judge Cantrell does exercise a \njudicial function when he, sitting as Magistrate Judge, determines Plaintiffs’ ability to pay bail \nand the amount of that bail. Therefore, it is appropriate to apply the Tumey and Ward tests here \nwhen determining whether there is an unconstitutional conflict of interest.  \n  The Court finds none of these arguments persuasive, and finds that Plaintiffs have \nsucceeded in demonstrating that Judge Cantrell’s participation in the management of the Fund in \nconjunction with his determination of Plaintiffs’ ability to pay bail and the amount of that bail is \na substantial conflict of interest that produces a “possible temptation . . . not to hold the balance \nnice, clear, and true between the state and the accused.” Ward, 409 U.S. at 60 (quoting Tumey, \n273 U.S. at 532). Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on Count Two and \nare entitled to a declaratory judgment that Judge Cantrell’s institutional incentives create a \nsubstantial and unconstitutional conflict of interest when he determines their ability to pay bail \nand sets the amount of that bail.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nAs articulated above,  \n  IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, R. Doc. 116, is hereby \nGRANTED and the Court provides declaratory relief as laid out above.  \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, R. Doc. \n121, is hereby DENIED.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-06197-EEF-MBN   Docum   ent 131   Filed 08/06/18   Page 30 of 30\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 6th day of August, 2018.  \n \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n30 \n ",

Cantrell, challenging the constitutionality of Judge Cantrell’s bail \nprocedures in the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (“OPCDC”). Evidence in the record \ndemonstrates that Judge Cantrell’s procedure does not include an inquiry into ability to pay or \nconsideration of alternative conditions of release prior to his setting bail. Furthermore, because \nof Judge Cantrell’s institutional conflict of interest, he fails to provide a neutral forum for \ndetermination of ability to pay or consideration of alternative conditions of release. The \nFourteenth Amendment requires an inquiry into ability to pay, including notice of the importance \nof this inquiry; consideration of alternative conditions of release, including findings on the record \napplying the clear and convincing standard and explaining why an arrestee does not qualify for \nalternative conditions of release; and representative counsel at such hearings. Additionally, the \nFourteenth Amendment requires a neutral forum for consideration of ability to pay and \nalternative conditions of release.
