    "summary": "<p>Plaintiff, Disability Rights Mississippi (\"DRMS\"), filed this lawsuit against CARES, Inc. (initially identified in Complaint as Mississippi Children's Home Services) on September 6, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Defendant, a non-profit organization, operated CARES Center, a residential treatment facility for children with severe emotional or behavioral disabilities. Plaintiff asserted that, as Mississippi's designated Protection & Advocacy organization for individuals with disabilities, it had monitoring authority over the CARES Center under federal P&A Acts. Plaintiff alleged that between July and August of 2013, defendant had denied both DRMS and the Southern Poverty Law Center (\"SPLC\") - which had contracted with DRMS to conduct monitoring visits - access to its facilities despite numerous attempts to explain DRMS's and SPLC's authority to conduct such visits under federal law. After defendant wrote a letter formally denying plaintiff access to its facilities, plaintiff filed this lawsuit. </p><p>Plaintiff brought claims under the federal P&A Acts and their accompanying regulations (42 U.S.C ยงยง 10805(a)(3), 15043 (a)(2)(H); 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c); 45 C.F.R. ยง1386.22(g). Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring it and SPLC access to the CARES Center. Plaintiff filed the Complaint along with a motion for a preliminary injunction. </p><p>On December 13, 2013, Defendant filed an Answer and Counterclaim. Defendant sought a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C ยง2201 stating that DRMS's authority to access the facility did not extend to unlimited and general operational investigations, but only to limited investigations of abuse or neglect. On January 2, 2014, plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss this counterclaim.</p><p>On February 5, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in the case. The statement asserted that the PAIMI Act was intended to provide P&A organizations with broad access to facilities like CARES, even in the absence of allegations of abuse or neglect. It also stated that monitoring is an important part of P&A organizations' mandate to protect vulnerable populations. Accordingly, the statement argued that plaintiff should have reasonable unaccompanied access to the CARES facilities.</p><p>On September 24, 2014, after the parties notified the court that they had reached a tentative working agreement, the court placed all pending motions - including plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction - on its inactive docket. On September 28, 2015, the parties jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal along with a sealed Settlement Agreement. While there is no formal dismissal on the record, there has been no action in the case since September of 2015.</p>",

The Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6).   \nSECOND DEFENSE \n  DRMS lacks standing.   \nTHIRD DEFENSE \n  DRMS failed to exhaust all avenues available, including mediation, to resolve this \ndispute through a non-adversarial process before filing suit.  \nFOURTH DEFENSE \n  This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding as there is no case or \ncontroversy. \n \nJM SWB 1250182 v1  \n \n2921104-000002  11/26/2013\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 18   Filed 12/13/13   Page 2 of 12\n \nFIFTH DEFENSE \n \n  The federal statutory mandates which provide funding for DRMS do not provide a \nprivate right of action.   \nSIXTH DEFENSE \n  Plaintiff's complaint violates the Mississippi Litigation Accountability Act.   \nSEVENTH DEFENSE \n  Now, answering the specific allegations of the Complaint, CARES states as follows: \n  1.

The allegations of paragraph 2 are admitted.   \n  3.  The allegations of paragraph 3 are denied.  The statutes referenced do not provide \nfederal  question  jurisdiction  and  the  Plaintiff  failed  to  exhaust  appropriate  administrative \nremedies.     \n  4.  The allegations of paragraph 4 are denied.  As the Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction over this action, venue is not proper in this Court either.   \n  5.

The allegations of paragraph 10 state conclusions of law to which no response is \nrequired; however, should this Court require a response, the allegations of paragraph 10 are \ndenied to the extent they tend to impute liability to CARES, and they are specifically denied to \nthe extent they tend to suggest that DRMS has standing to bring a legal action against CARES \nfor unfettered unlimited and expansive monitoring.   \n  11.  The allegations of paragraph 11 state conclusions of law to which no response is \nrequired; however, should this Court require a response, the allegations of paragraph 11 are \ndenied to the extent they tend to impute liability to CARES, or authority to DRMS for unfettered \nunlimited and expansive monitoring.   \n  12.

(\"CARES\") files this \nCounterclaim against Disability Rights Mississippi (\"DRMS\") for declaratory judgment pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. ยง2201 and shows: \n  1.  CARES is a not for profit company organized under the laws of the State of \nMississippi and currently doing business in the State of Mississippi.   \n  2.  DRMS is a not for profit company organized under the laws of the State of \nMississippi and is currently doing business in the State of Mississippi.   \n  3.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1331, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201.   \n  4.  Venue is proper in this Court.   \n  5.  The Protection and Advocacy System (\"System\") in Mississippi is the federally-\nmandated and funded state entity created pursuant to the Developmental Disabilities Act, 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 15043.  It was first organized in 1976.  To avoid conflicts of interest when suing other \nMississippi Departments of State Government, the System was incorporated in 1982.  In 1986, it \nacquired the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Program, which was \nfunded under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, 42 U.S.C.      \nยง 10801-51 (the \"Act\").  In 2009 the System became known as DRMS.   \n  6.  DRMS is a private entity that performs a public function and may be sued under \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1983.   \n7 \nJM SWB 1250182 v1  \n \n2921104-000002  11/26/2013\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 18   Filed 12/13/13   Page 8 of 12\n \n  7.  DRMS filed suit against CARES to conduct an unlimited and unfettered open-\nended  general  operational  investigation  of  its  CARES  Center  (the  \"Center\"),  a  Residential \nPsychiatric Treatment Facility.  Admittedly, it is not investigating abuse or neglect at the Center.  \nIn its prayer, it seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction against CARES, its employees and \nagents to \"provide DRMS and its agent with timely, full, meaningful, and unaccompanied access \nto monitor the [Center].\"  [Compl. ยถ39(b)].  What it means by \"timely, full, meaningful and \nunaccompanied access to monitor\" is neither described nor defined.  DRMS contends that it has \nan unlimited \"statutory right to monitor the children\" at the Center to \"ensure that all individuals \nare protected and housed safely at that facility.\"  [Dkt. 3, p. 15].  DRMS fails to describe its goals \nand does not define the parameters of the operational investigative monitoring it contemplates at \nthe Center.  Instead, DRMS seeks to conduct an unlimited, unbounded, and unaccompanied \ngeneral operational investigation of the Center, all minor residents of the Center and all staff of \nthe Center.   \n  8.  DRMS's unfettered and general operational investigation in the Center will cause \ninjury to CARES and the vulnerable mentally ill children who are entrusted to it for their \npersonal care, psychiatric and psychological treatment, and education.  The carefully calibrated \nmedical treatments, personal care, meals, educational, recreational and sleep schedules of the \nmentally ill minor residents will be significantly disrupted, (causing damage that cannot even be \nmeasured)  by  the  unscheduled  inspections  and  unlimited,  unaccompanied  and  confidential \nconferences between Center residents and staff with DRMS representatives day or night, without \ndefined parameters or boundaries1.  Further, psychiatric and/or psychological treatments will be \ncompromised as well as the stability and progress made by the Center's vulnerable residents by \n                                                 \n1 Even if made during regular business hours the scope of the contemplated general inspections will be damaging \nsince medical treatments, meals, school classes and recreational activities all take place during regular business \nhours.   \n8 \nJM SWB 1250182 v1  \n \n2921104-000002  11/26/2013\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 18   Filed 12/13/13   Page 9 of 12\n \nthe coercive conditions of these unscheduled, unlimited, and sweeping \"conferences\" sought by \nDRMS.   \n  9.  DRMS's  statutory  mandate  permits  it  access  to  facilities  like  the  Center  to \ninvestigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness if the incidents are \nreported to DRMS or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents of abuse or neglect \noccurred to an identifiable individual.   It may also have reasonably limited access to facilities as \ndefined under the statute and the applicable regulations; that access is not unlimited nor is it for \npurposes of an unlimited unfettered operational investigation as sought by DRMS. \n  10.  The limitations imposed by the Act prevent unreasonable searches and seizures \nthat are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The limitations \nof the Act also prevent invasions of privacy that are prohibited by the United States Constitution.  \n  11.  DRMS does not have statutory authority to seek entry into facilities like the \nCenter for general operational investigations.   \n  12.  In its suit for an unlimited general operational investigation, DRMS is not acting \non a complaint of abuse or neglect to a particular individual at the Center, nor is it acting on the \nsuspicion of probable cause that a particular individual is subject to abuse or neglect at the \nCenter.   \n  13.  DRMS's  suit  against  CARES  seeking  an  unlimited  general  operational \ninvestigation  of  the  Center  constitutes  a  violation  of  CARES's  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment  rights  under  the  United  States  Constitution.    CARES  and  its  residents  are \nconstitutionally  protected  against  DRMS's  unreasonable  searches,  seizures  and  invasions  of \nprivacy.     \n9 \nJM SWB 1250182 v1  \n \n2921104-000002  11/26/2013\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 18   Filed 12/13/13   Page 10 of 12\n \n  14.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, CARES seeks a declaration from this Court that (1) \nDRMS's  statutory  authority  granted  under  the  Act  does  not  extend  to  unlimited  general \noperational investigations like that sought by DRMS, and (2) this suit constitutes an improper \nexercise of the powers granted to DRMS pursuant to the Act.   \n  15.  The  issues  which  CARES  seek  addressed  by  this  Court  constitute  an  actual \ncontroversy between the parties, are justiciable and can be presently litigated and decided.  \n  16.  CARES has standing to pursue its declaratory judgment action because it and its \nresidents are suffering an injury and will suffer further injury if the issues are not addressed.   \n  WHEREFORE, CARES seeks a declaration that (1) DRMS's statutory authority does not \nextend to unlimited general operational investigations like that sought by DRMS, and (2) this \nsuit constitutes an improper exercise of the powers granted to  DRMS pursuant to the Act. \nAdditionally, it seeks its attorneys' fees, interest and costs as well as other relief which this Court \ndeems just and proper.  Further, CARES reserves its right and expressly does not waive its \nentitlement to amend its counterclaim and to assert additional claims as they may arise. \n  This, the 13th day of December, 2013. \n \n          Respectfully submitted,  \n \n          CARES, INC., INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED AS   \n          MISSISSIPPI CHILDREN'S HOME SERVICES \n  \n          By Its Attorneys, \n \n          BAKER, DONELSON, BEARMAN,  \n          CALDWELL & BERKOWITZ, PC \n \n \n          By:  s/  Sheryl Bey           \n            SHERYL BEY   \n \n \n   \n10 \nJM SWB 1250182 v1  \n \n2921104-000002  11/26/2013\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 18   Filed 12/13/13   Page 11 of 12\n \nOF COUNSEL:  \n \nSheryl Bey (Miss.

As \nthe United States has made clear in litigation across the country, it has a strong interest in the \ninterpretation of the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (โPAIMI \nActโ), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801โ10851.  See, e.g., Statement of Interest of the United States, Ind. Prot. \n& Advocacy Servs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs. Admin., No. 1:06-cv-1816 (S.D. Ind. June 16, \n2008); Brief for Intervenor United States of America, Iowa Prot. & Advocacy Servs., Inc. v. \n                                                 \n1 Section 517 provides that the โSolicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, \nmay be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the \ninterests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court of a \nState, or to attend to any other interest of the United States.โ 28 U.S.C. ยง 517.  A submission by \nthe United States pursuant to this provision does not constitute intervention under Rule 24 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 2 of 12 \nTanager Place, No. 04-4074 (8th Cir. May 11, 2005).  Therefore, the United States offers the \nCourt its understanding of the statute and regulations at issue in this case.2  \nARGUMENT  \nPlaintiffs, representatives of the local protection and advocacy organization, have brought \nthis case seeking access to a psychiatric residential treatment center serving children in  \nMississippi.  Defendants argue that the access Plaintiffs seek is not guaranteed by law.  The \nUnited States Statement of Interest will establish that the PAIMI Act was intended to protect \nvulnerable people with disabilities by affording broad access rights to protection and advocacy \norganizations. A central function of these organizations is to conduct monitoring, even in the \nabsence of abuse and neglect complaints from residents. Monitoring activities include facility \nvisits and also unaccompanied opportunities to speak with residents of the facilities.  The PAIMI \nAct is undermined if protection and advocacy organizations are denied these rights, or required \nto litigate each time they seek access to a facility and its residents.     \nA.   The PAIMI Act was Passed to Protect a Vulnerable Population  \nCongress enacted this law because it found that โindividuals with mental illness are \nvulnerable to abuse and serious injury,โ and that โ[s]tate systems for monitoring compliance with  \nrespect to the rights of individuals with mental illness vary widely and are frequently \ninadequate.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 10801. The law grew out of a congressional staff investigation that \nuncovered fear and intimidation at psychiatric facilities.  Care of Institutionalized Mentally \nDisabled Persons: Joint Hearings Before the Senate Subcomms. on the Handicapped and on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, 99th Cong. (1985). Staff \nvisiting psychiatric facilities across the nation found evidence of physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal \n                                                 \n2 The United States recognizes that the Partiesโ briefing on this issue has concluded and would \nnot object if the Court wishes to offer the Parties an opportunity to respond to the United States.  \n2 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 3 of 12 \nthreats, regular harassment, reliance on seclusion and mechanical restraints, inadequate treatment, \nand indecent living conditions. Id. at 3.  In one graphic example of the abuse and neglect, \ninvestigators found a patient died while tied to a bed in full restraints and was discovered soaked in \nher own urine.  Id. at 24.  Investigators reviewed existing monitoring mechanisms and determined \nthat monitoring conducted by the states and other accreditation bodies was not sufficient to prevent \nand remedy the violations of law.  Id. at 5, 76-114.  After conducting a thorough analysis,  \ncongressional staff determined that protection and advocacy  services were desperately needed.  Id. at \n81.   \nIn response, Congress passed the PAIMI Act and explained that the statuteโs purpose is \nโto ensure that the rights of individuals with mental illness are protected and to assist States to \nestablish and operate a protection and advocacy system that will (1) protect and advocate for the \nrights of those individuals; and (2) investigate incidents of abuse and neglect.โ  H.R. Rep. 102-\n319, November 15, 1991.  To achieve this goal, the law provides funding and authority for a \nsystem of protection and advocacy organizations across the country.3  \nSince PAIMI was enacted nearly 30 years ago, protection and advocacy organizations  \nhave used their authority to address widespread abuse, neglect, and exploitation in psychiatric \ninstitutions around the country.  A recent report on PAIMI enforcement identified the significant \nimpact that protection and advocacy organizations have when they are able to monitor and \ninvestigate facilities on behalf of vulnerable people whose every action is controlled by their \nservice providers. See  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, HHS Pub. No. \nPEP12-EVALPAIMI, Evaluation of the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals With Mental Illness \n                                                 \n3 Congress enacted parallel legislation to protect the rights of people with developmental \ndisabilities, 42 U.S.C. ยง 15041, and people with disabilities other than mental illness and \ndevelopmental disabilities.  29 U.S.C. ยง 794e(a)(1). \n \n3 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 4 of 12 \n(PAIMI) Program, Phase III. Final Report. (2011).  For example, the report describes how one \nprotection and advocacy organization helped a family find a safe environment for their child \nafter he was placed at a residential treatment facility where staff members were abusing children.  \nSee id. at 13. In another case, a man with kidney cancer who was institutionalized at a \npsychiatric hospital did not receive needed medical care until the protection and advocacy \norganization advocated on his behalf.  Id. In yet another instance, a protection and advocacy \norganization litigated on behalf of a class of individuals with mental illness who were \ninappropriately discharged from  a psychiatric hospital to nursing facilities where they received \nno mental health treatment and were subject to strict limits on their activities and movement.  Id.   \nAll of these cases, and many thousands of others, demonstrate the importance of the protection \nand advocacy system established by the PAIMI Act. \nWhile the Department of Justice plays a role in the enforcement of the constitution and  \nfederal law in institutional settings, see, e.g., 42 U. S.C. ยง 1997 et seq., the protection and \nadvocacy system is a critical partner in that work.  It is not possible for the Department of Justice \nto investigate all allegations of abuse and neglect and to monitor all facilities across the country.  \nFor these reasons, it is imperative that the protection and advocacy organizations are able to \nmonitor facilities and investigate claims of abuse and neglect. \nB.   Monitoring is a Critical Part of Protection and Advocacy Organizationsโ Mandates \nWhen establishing the protection and advocacy system, Congress wisely recognized that \nprotection and advocacy organizations must be empowered to regularly monitor facilities \nproviding treatment to people with disabilities.  Regular monitoring enables advocates to detect \nand deter abuse and neglect in facilities that might not otherwise come to the attention of the \nadvocates. People living in psychiatric residential treatment facilities are particularly vulnerable \n4 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 5 of 12 \nto abuse because they are struggling with significant medical needs, are often isolated from their \nfamilies and communities, and their ability to reach out to outside advocates is restricted.  In \naddition, they are often unfamiliar with their rights or with the advocates available to help them.  \nIn order to successfully prevent and remedy violations of rights, the PAIMI Act provides that \nprotection and advocacy organizations shall, โhave access to facilities in the State providing care \nor treatment.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 10805. This provision  stands in addition to, and independent of, the \nstatuteโs provision for conducting investigations of abuse allegations, indicating that the two \nafford distinct authorities.     \n1. \t  PAIMI Regulations Affirm Protection and Advocacy Organization Monitoring Access \nRights \nThe regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (โHHSโ) \nunder the PAIMI Act carry out Congressโs design and make very clear that protection and \nadvocacy organizations need not be conducting an investigation of a specific allegation in order \nto access a covered facility.4  Because these regulations by the agency entrusted to administer the \nPAIMI program elucidate and give force to the statute, they are afforded great deference.  \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984) \n(โWe have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive \ndepartment's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, and the principle of \ndeference to administrative interpretations.โ).   \n                                                 \n4 Access to covered facilities was not intended to be limited to a specific group of facilities, but \nrather to any facilities in which people with disabilities reside and receive treatment.  The \nConference Committee Report on the original legislation explained that, โIt is the intent of the \nconferees that this legislation focus on abuse and neglect of mentally ill individuals and not on \nthe particular residential facility in which they reside. Accordingly, residential facilities could \ninclude, but need not be limited to, hospitals, nursing homes, community facilities for mentally \nill individuals, and board and care homes.โ H.R. Conf. Re. 99-576, May 5, 1986 (emphasis \nadded). \n5 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 6 of 12 \nThe regulations provide that for purposes of education, training, monitoring, and \ninspection,  \na P&A system shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to facilities โฆ and their \nresidents at reasonable times, which at a minimum shall include normal working hours \nand visiting hours. Residents include adults or minors who have legal guardians or \nconservators. P&A activities shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with \nfacility programs, respect residents' privacy interests, and honor a resident's request to \nterminate an interview.  42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c). \n \nThe regulations define unaccompanied access as โthe opportunity to meet and communicate \nprivately with individuals regularly, both formally and informally, by telephone, mail and in \nperson.โ 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(d).  The plain language of the regulation reaffirms that a protection \nand advocacy organization must be afforded reasonable unaccompanied access to facilities and \nresidents for the purpose of monitoring and education even where there is no allegation of abuse \nor neglect. The text also explicitly empowers protection and advocacy organizations to meet \nwith minors as well as with adults.  Thus it is clear that Congress anticipated that protection and \nadvocacy organizations would need to visit facilities and speak with their residents regularly, \nregardless of age.  Such access enables these organizations to fulfill their missions of educating \nindividuals about their rights and offering residents an opportunity to raise questions or concerns \nabout their care with an independent advocate.   \n2.   Federal Precedent Affirms Protection and Advocacy Monitoring Access Rights \nSo unambiguous are the regulations that there has been little recent litigation on the \nsimple question of access to facilities for monitoring and education.  In the few decisions that \ntouch on protection and advocacy organizationsโ authority to conduct monitoring, including \nunaccompanied access to residents, courts have recognized that the statute unmistakably \ncontemplates monitoring access.  See, e.g., Protection & Advocacy System, Inc. v. Freudenthal, \n412 F.Supp.2d 1211, 1213 (D. Wyo. 2006) (โThese acts and their implementing regulations \n6 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 7 of 12 \nauthorize P & A to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect; to monitor; to provide training \non rights and make referrals and to pursue legal, administrative and other remedies. They also \nauthorize P & A to obtain access to records under specific circumstances.โ); Equip for Equality, \nInc. v. Ingalls Memorial Hosp., 292 F.Supp.2d 1086, 1095-98, 1100 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (โA P & A \nsystem must be given the leeway to discover problems or potential problems at a facilityโ); Iowa \nProtection and Advocacy Services, Inc. v. Gerard Treatment Programs, L.L.C., 152 F.Supp.2d \n1150. 1169-70 (N.D. Iowa 2001) (considering access to a psychiatric facility for youth and \nnoting that protection and advocacy organization representatives are empowered to conduct \nunaccompanied interviews for monitoring purposes).  Courts have explained that curtailing \nprotection and advocacy organizationsโ access would thwart the goals laid out by Congress in \nPAIMI.  See Equip for Equality, 292 F.Supp.2d at 1099 (โrequiring tours of a facility to be \nannounced and accompanied would seriously hinder a P & A system's ability to monitor the \nfacility for compliance with the rights and safety of the patients and would thwart the purpose of \nthe federal and state acts.โ); Robbins v. Budke, 739 F.Supp. 1479, 1487 (D.N.M. 1990) (finding \nhospitalโs policies limiting protection and advocacy organization access to patients with mental \nillness thwarted PAIMIโs purpose).  Protection and advocacy organizations are unquestionably \nauthorized to conduct regular unaccompanied monitoring tours of covered facilities in addition to \nany investigations they conduct. \nC.   Reasonable Unaccompanied Access Includes Regular Opportunities to Speak with \nResidents \nThe law contemplates that advocates will have regular, even โfrequent,โ unaccompanied \nopportunities to speak with residents.  See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c); Mississippi Protection and \nAdvocacy System, Inc. v. Cotton, 1989 WL 224953 *9 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 7, 1989) (โOnly by \nfrequent personal contact with residents, out of the presence of Boswell staff, can MP & A \n7 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 8 of 12 \neffectively carry out its mission of pursuing remedies to protect the rights of Boswell residents \nand of providing the necessary information to them.โ).5 Recognizing that people with disabilities \nmay be distrustful of advocates they rarely see, courts have encouraged regular visits with \nprotection and advocacy organization representatives.  See  Robbins, 739 F.Supp. at 1486. \nDefendants argue that the protection and advocacy organization suffers no harm when entirely \nprecluded from conducting complete monitoring visits because it made two, unrelated visits \npreviously. See Def.โs Resp. at 9, 18-19, Dkt. No. 20. There is no numerical limit, in statute, \nregulations, or precedent, on how often a protection and advocacy organization may visit a \ncovered facility. The visits, themselves, must simply be reasonable. \nIn contravention of the law, facilities sometimes attempt to place significant limits on the \nfrequency and ease with which protection and advocacy representatives can speak with residents.  \nOf course, the regulations provide that advocates should minimize disruption of facility \nprograms, but that obligation does not negate their right to regular, voluntary, unaccompanied \ninterviews of residents. See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c). While courts have recognized the need to \nweigh a facilityโs practical concerns, including concerns about impact on treatment, they have \ndetermined that such concerns do not preclude the protection and advocacy organizationsโ access \nrights.  See, e.g., Equip for Equality, 292 F.Supp.2d at 1100 (requiring unaccompanied access to \nresidents with 24-hours notice); Pennsylvania Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. RoyerโGreaves \nSchool for the Blind, No. 98โ3995, 1999 WL 179797, at *11โ12 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 24, 1999) \n(same).6  The statute and its implementing regulations provide for unaccompanied access to \n                                                 \n5 This case was filed under PAIMIโs companion legislation protecting the rights of people with \ndevelopmental disabilities. \n \n6 This case was filed under PAIMIโs companion legislation protecting the rights of people with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  \n8 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 9 of 12 \nresidents, specifically including children; facilities cannot defeat this access by making \nunsupported allegations that access will be disruptive or harmful.  See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c) \n(โResidents include adults or minorsโ); Robbins, 739 F.Supp. at 1488 (โDefendants claim that \npatient care and a therapeutic environment will be  totally disrupted if P & A's presence at LVMC \nis not controlled to the extent that it is at present. I am not persuaded that this is true.โ);  Michigan \nProtection & Advocacy Service, Inc. v. Miller, 849 F.Supp. 1202, 1208 (W.D. Mich. 1994) \n(โdefendant has failed to indicate how the access  MPAS seeks would โsubstantially interfereโ \nwith DSS programsโ).  Concerns about access, even well-intentioned, do not overcome the \njudgment Congress made when authorizing protection and advocacy organizations to conduct \nunaccompanied interviews.  \nWhile some courts have limited unannounced, unlimited, 24-hour access to residents of a \nfacility, the limits imposed have been minimal. For example, a few courts have required \nprotection and advocacy organizations seeking to meet with or interview residents to provide 24-\nhours notice of their visit. See Equip for Equality, 292 F.Supp.2d at 1100-02; Pennsylvania \nProtection & Advocacy, Inc. 1999 WL 179797, at *11โ12. Ideally, a protection and advocacy \norganization will be able to work collaboratively with the facility it plans to monitor to establish \na protocol that minimizes disruption to the facility program, without overly restricting the \norganizationโs work. Where the parties are unable to resolve the contours of an agreed on \nmonitoring protocol, courts have found that authorizing protection and advocacy organizations \nbroad access rights is appropriate. See id.   \nD.   Requiring Protection and Advocacy Organizations to Seek Court Orders Each Time \nThey Wish to Gain Access to Facilities Would Significantly Impair Their Work \nRequiring protection and advocacy organizations to go to court every time they seek \naccess afforded by the statute would frustrate the goals of PAIMI and unnecessarily burden the \n9 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 10 of 12 \ncourts.  See Advocacy Center v. Stalder, 128 F.Supp.2d 358, 364 (M.D. La.1999) (โit cannot be \ndisputed that the delay in getting a court order frustrates the goal of the PAMII Act.โ); Oklahoma \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Dillon Family and Youth Services, Inc., 879 F.Supp. 1110, 1112 \n(N.D. Okl. 1995) (โThe timely access guaranteed by the Act should not be stripped of all \nmeaning by requiring advocacy hearings to survive an application for a court order.โ).  The \nPAIMI Act does not require protection and advocacy organizations to go to court each time they \nwish to conduct statutorily mandated activities.  As a recent evaluation of the PAIMI Act found, \nโ[w]hen forced to litigate access issues, significant portions of [a protection and advocacy \norganizationโs] limited resources are consumed โ resources that would better be used moving the \nnationโs mental health system forward.โ  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, HHS Pub. No. PEP12-EVALPAIMI, Evaluation of the Protection and Advocacy for \nIndividuals With Mental Illness (PAIMI) Program, Phase III. Final Report. 87 (2011).   Facilities \nshould not be permitted to circumvent Congressโs  legislation by requiring a court order before \npermitting meaningful access as required by law. \nCONCLUSION  \n  The PAIMI Act is a critical component in the system of legal protections for people with \ndisabilities and its words must be given full force and effect.  Congress unambiguously afforded \nprotection and advocacy organizations the authority to access facilities serving people with \ndisabilities and to the individuals themselves.  While facilities may be well-intentioned in \nseeking to limit access to the physical space or individuals in their care, the law requires them to \npermit reasonable access, including unaccompanied conversations with residents.  \n   \n \n \n10 \n\n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 40   Filed 02/05/14   Page 11 of 12 \n           \nRespectfully submitted,   \n       \nGREGORY K.

The purpose of this action is to protect children living \nin the CARES Center from harm and enforce the children's federal statutory right to an effective, \nmeaningful Protection and Advocacy (\"P&A\") System. \nParties \n1.  Plaintiff Disability Rights Mississippi (\"DRMS\") is a nonprofit organization with \na federal  mandate to  protect the rights  of individuals with disabilities.  DRMS  was formerly \nknown as the Mississippi Protection and Advocacy System. Among other activities, DRMS and \nits agents travel across the State of Mississippi monitoring conditions and treatment in facilities \nhousing individuals with disabilities. \n2.  Defendant Mississippi Children's Home Services is a nonprofit organization that \nprovides psychiatric and educational services to children in Mississippi. The service relevant to \nthis  litigation  is  the  Defendant's operation of the  CARES  Center,  a Psychiatric Residential \nTreatment Facility in Jackson, Mississippi, which provides treatment to \"children with severe \nemotional  or  behavioral  disturbances.\"  See  CARES  Center,  available  at \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 2 of 10\nhttp://www.mchscares.org/statewide-services/campus-based/cares-center/ (last accessed Aug. 22, \n2013). The Defendant may be served with process via its registered agent, Sherry Rowlett, at \n1900 N. West Street, Jackson MS 39202. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n3.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 because DRMS alleges \nviolations of its rights under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act \nof 1986  (the  \"PAlMI  Act\"),  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง  10801  et  seq.;  the  Developmental  Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act of2000 (the \"PADD Act\")1, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 15001 et seq.; and \nthe Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program (the \"PAIR Act\"), 29 U.S.C. ยงยง 794e \net seq. These three laws are collectively referred to as \"the P&A Acts.\" \n4.  Venue  is  proper in this  Court under 28  U.S.C.  ยง  1391(b) because Defendant \nresides in this District and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this District. \nFactual Allegations \nThe P&A Acts \n5.  In the P AIMI Act, Congress recognized that \"individuals with mental illness are \nvulnerable to abuse and serious injury ... [and] subject to neglect, including lack of treatment, \nadequate  nutrition,  clothing,  health  care,  and  adequate  discharge  planning.\"  42  U.S.C.  ยง \n10801(a).  Congress  further  recognized  that  \"State  systems  for  monitoring  compliance  with \nrespect  to  the  rights  of individuals  with  mental  illness  vary  widely  and  are  frequently \ninadequate.\" !d. ยง 10801(a)(4). \n6.  To  address  these  problems,  the  P AIMI  Act \"assist[s ]  States  to  establish  and \noperate a protection and advocacy system for individuals with mental illness which will . . . \nprotect and advocate the rights of such individuals through activities to ensure the enforcement \n1 This Act is sometimes referenced in case law as the \"DD Act.\" \n2 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 3 of 10\nof the Constitution and Federal and State statutes; and ... investigate incidents of abuse and \nneglect of individuals.\" /d.  ยง 10801 (b )(2). \n7.  Similarly, the PADD Act authorizes the same system \"to protect the legal and \nhuman  rights  of individuals  with  developmental  disabilities.\"  /d.  ยง  15041.  The  PAIR Act, \nmeanwhile, authorizes that system \"to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with \ndisabilities who\" are not covered under the PAlMI or PADD Acts. 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e(a)(l). \n8.  As a result of the P&A Acts, every state has created a \"Protection and Advocacy \nSystem,\" or \"P&A.\" \"There is a P&A/CAP agency in every state and U.S. territory as well as \none serving the Native American population in the P&A/CAP network is the largest provider of \nlegally  based  advocacy  services  to  people  with  disabilities  in the  United  States.\"  National \nDisability  Rights  Network,  Member  Agencies,  available  at  http://www.ndm.org/en/ndm \nmember-agencies.html (last accessed Aug. 22, 2013). \n9.  While not identical, the P&A Acts overlap in many respects. In the PAIR Act, for \nexample, Congress gave each P&A \"the same general authorities, including access to records \nand program income, as  are  set forth  in\" the PADD Act.  29 U.S.C.  ยง 794e(f)(2); see,  e.g., \nConnecticut Office of Prot. & Advocacy For Persons With Disabilities v.  Hartford Bd of Educ., \n464 F.3d 229, 240 (2d Cir. 2006) (concluding that the PAlMI, PADD and PAIR Acts all granted \nConnecticut's P&A access to  a non-residential facility providing services to individuals with \nemotional impairments). \n10.  Under federal  law,  each P&A \"shall have the power to  bring legal  actions to \nensure the protection of its constituents and to litigate on behalf of its constituents.\" Indiana \nProt.  & Advocacy Servs.  v.  Indiana Family & Soc.  Servs.  Admin., 603 F.3d 365, 375 (7th Cir. \n2010) (en bane); see 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10805(a)(l)(B), 15043(a)(2)(A)(i). \n3 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 4 of 10\nDRMS's Access Authority \n11.  DRMS is the P&A in Mississippi. See Mississippi Prot.  & Advocacy Sys., Inc.  v. \nCotten,  929  F.2d  1054,  1056 (5th Cir.  1991) (affirming Judge  Lee's \"careful and  scholarly \nmemorandum opinion\"  and injunction granting  the  Mississippi  P&A access  to  a residential \nfacility housing adults with intellectual disabilities). \n12.  In order to protect individuals with disabilities, the P&A Acts provide DRMS \nwith physical access to facilities housing individuals with disabilities. \n13.  For example, the P AIMI Act states that a P &A \"shall ... have access to facilities \nin the State providing care or treatment.\" 42 U.S.C.  ยง 10805(a)(3). Similarly, the PADD Act \nstates  that  a  P&A  \"shall  ... have  access  at  reasonable  times  to  any  individual  with  a \ndevelopmental  disability  in a  location in  which  services,  supports,  and  other assistance  are \nprovided  to  such  an  individual,  in  order  to  carry  out  the  purpose  of this  part.\"  !d.  ยง \n15043(a)(2)(H). The authority granted by the PAIR Act is identical to that granted by the PADD \nAct. See~ 9, supra. \n14.  More specifically, the regulations implementing the PAlMI Act state that \"a P&A \nsystem shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to facilities including all areas which are \nused by residents, are accessible to residents, and to programs and their residents at reasonable \ntimes, which at a minimum shall include normal working hours and visiting hours. Residents \ninclude  adults  or minors who  have  legal guardians  or conservators.  P&A activities  shall  be \nconducted  so  as  to  minimize  interference  with  facility  programs,  respect  residents'  privacy \ninterests, and honor a resident's request to terminate an interview.\" 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(c). \n15.  The same regulation further provides that \"[t]his access is for the purpose of: (1) \nProviding  information  and  training  on,  and  referral  to  programs  addressing  the  needs  of \n4 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 5 of 10\nindividuals with mental  illness, and information and training about individual rights and the \nprotection and advocacy services available from the P&A system, including the name, address, \nand telephone number of the P&A system; (2) Monitoring compliance with respect to the rights \nand safety of residents; and (3) Inspecting, viewing and photographing all areas of the facility \nwhich are used by residents or are accessible to residents.\" !d. \n16.  The access provisions of the P AIMI  Act apply with full  force to  the  CARES \nCenter  because  it  is  a  \"public  or  private  residential  setting  that  provides  overnight  care \naccompanied by treatment services.\" 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.2. In short, the CARES Center is a covered \nentity because it \"render[s] care or treatment for individuals with mental illness.\"2 Id.  ยง 51.42(b). \n17.  The regulations implementing the P ADD Act are  similar.  They provide that a \nP&A \"and all of its authorized agents shall have unaccompanied access to all residents of a \nfacility at reasonable times, which at a minimum shall include normal working hours and visiting \nhours, for the purpose of: (1) Providing information and training on, and referral to, programs \naddressing  the  needs  of individuals  with  developmental  disabilities,  and  the  protection and \nadvocacy services available from the system, including the name, address, and telephone number \nof the system and other information and training about individual rights; and (2) Monitoring \ncompliance with respect to the rights and safety of service recipients.\" 45 C.F.R. ยง 1386.22(g). \n18.  To  the  extent  there  are  residents  with  developmental  disabilities,  the  access \nprovisions  of the  P ADD  Act also  apply to  the  CARES  Center because  it  is  a \"setting that \nprovides care, treatment, services and habilitation, even if only 'as needed' or under a contractual \narrangement.\" 45 C.F.R. ยง 1386.19. In other words, the CARES Center would have to provide \naccess  because  it  \"provide[ s]  services,  supports,  and  other  assistance  for  individuals  with \n2  For purposes of the P&A Acts, behavioral and emotional disorders are treated the same as mental illness. \n5 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 6 of 10\ndevelopmental disabilities.\" /d.  ยง 1386.22(ยฑ); see Connecticut Office of Prot.  & Advocacy, 464 \nF.3d at 241. \n19.  To the extent the CARES Center does not provide care, treatment, services, or \nhabilitation for individuals with developmental disabilities, the PAIR Act authorizes DRMS \"to \nprotect the legal and human rights of individuals with disabilities who\" are not covered under the \nPAlMI or PADD Acts, on access terms identical to the PADD Act. 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e(a)(1). \n20.  The P&A Acts authorize DRMS \"to enter into contracts with State agencies and \nnonprofit organizations which operate throughout the State.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 10804(a)(l). DRMS \nhas contracted with Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofit organization, to assist in \nfulfilling its statutory obligations. See Exhibit A (Agreement between DRMS and SPLC). \n21.  The Agreement gives SPLC \"access to detention centers, correctional and mental \nhealth facilities housing individuals with mental illness, developmental disabilities, and/or other \ndisabilities under the age of 22,\" including monitoring authority, as authorized under the P&A \nActs. !d.  (citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 10804(a)(1)); see also 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(a) (\"Access to facilities \nand residents shall be extended to all authorized agents of a P&A system.\"). \n22.  DRMS and SPLC currently have access to several other Psychiatric Residential \nTreatment  Facilities  across  the  State  of Mississippi.  DRMS  and  SPLC  conduct  regular \nmonitoring visits at those facilities in accordance with the P&A Acts. \nDefendant's Denial ofA  ccess \n23.  On July 30, 2013, SPLC spoke with counsel for Defendant to schedule a periodic \nmonitoring visit to the CARES Center. See Exhibit B (Correspondence of Counsel). \n24.  Over the next several days, SPLC provided counsel for Defendant with citations \nto federal statutes, federal regulations, and federal court decisions granting P&A systems and \n6 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 7 of 10\ntheir  agents  access  to  facilities  housing  individuals  with  disabilities.  !d.  Those  authorities \nincluded Orders issued by Judges Jordan and Starrett of this Honorable Court, which are attached \nas Exhibit C.3 !d.  SPLC addressed counsel's specific concerns regarding HIPAA, the type of \nfacilities authorized under the P&A Acts, Mississippi law, and the nature of SPLC's relationship \nwith DRMS. !d. \n25.  On August 2, SPLC invoked its right to a written statement of reasons from the \nCARES Center explaining why the CARES Center was denying DRMS and SPLC monitoring \naccess. !d. at 7 (citing 45 C.P.R.ยง 1386.22(i) and 42 C.P.R.ยง 51.43). SPLC requested a response \nby August 9. !d. \n26.  On August 13, counsel for Defendant issued a written letter formally denying \nSPLC  monitoring  access to  the  CARES  Center.  See  Exhibit D (Denial  Letter).  Counsel for \nDefendant  concluded  that  \"[a]ccording  to  my  interpretation  of these  regulations,  absent  an \nallegation  of abuse/neglect,  an  authorized  consent  or  a  court document is  required\"  before \nDRMS or its agents may engage in monitoring at the CARES Center. !d. at 2. \n27.  DRMS and SPLC subsequently concluded that this dispute would not be resolved \nwithin a reasonable time. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 10807(a). \nCause of Action \n28.  DRMS incorporates the prior paragraphs as if fully realleged herein. \n29.  Defendant has violated DRMS's federal statutory right to timely, full, meaningful, \nand unaccompanied access to monitor children in the CARES Center, in violation of the P&A \nActs. See id. ยงยง 10805(a)(3), 15043(a)(2)(H); 42 C.P.R.ยง 51.42(c); 45 C.P.R.ยง 1386.22(g). \n3  In fact, in recent years, several other Judges in this District have issued similar Orders. See Disability Rights \nMississippi v.  Lauderdale Cnty.,  No.  4:09-cv-137-TSL-LRA (S.D.  Miss.  Nov.  9,  2009) (Lee,  J.);  Mississippi \nProtection & Advocacy System, Inc. v. Harrison Cnty., Miss., No. 1:09-cv-267-LG-RHN (S.D. Miss. June 11, 2009) \n(Guiro1a, C.J.). \n7 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 8 of 10\nNecessity of Injunctive Relief \n30.  DRMS and the children it is charged with protecting lack an adequate remedy at \nlaw and will be irreparably harmed if Defendant is permitted to continue blocking DRMS and its \nagents access to monitor the children at the CARES Center. \n31.  Via separate motion filed this day, DRMS requests injunctive relief granting it \nand its agents access to monitor the children at the CARES Center. \nNecessity of Costs of Court and Reasonable Attorney's Fees \n32.  Prior to  filing  this  suit,  DRMS  and  its  agents  sought  to  resolve  this  dispute \namicably. See Exhibit B. \n33.  An amicable resolution could not be reached because counsel for Defendant has \ninterposed  meritless  objections.  Contrary  to  counsel's  assertion,  the  question  of access  to \nfacilities like the CARES Center is not a matter of first impression. See id.  (collecting statutes, \nregulations, cases, and prior court orders). \n34.  In particular, counsel for Defendant's insistence on a separate court order granting \nDRMS  monitoring access to  each and every facility  housing  individuals  with disabilities  in \nMississippi is unnecessary, inconsistent with federal law, and a waste of this Court's time. The \nplain language of the P&A Acts does not require DRMS to seek a court order before it may enter \na facility housing individuals with disabilities. Such a requirement would have a chilling effect \non the ability of DRMS -and every P&A agency nationwide- to conduct the basic and routine \nmonitoring activities Congress expressly set forth in the P&A Acts. See Advocacy Ctr. v. Stalder, \n128 F. Supp. 2d 358, 364 (M.D. La. 1999) (\"it cannot be disputed that the delay in getting a court \norder frustrates the goal of the [PAlMI] Act.\"). As Judge Starrett wrote years ago, \"Congress' \nrecognition of the importance of protecting youth with disabilities would be undermined and \n8 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 9 of 10\nfatally frustrated if states, localities, and institutions are permitted to enact policies that limit and \nrestrict  DRMS's  access  to  facilities  and  records.  The  language  of the  federal  regulations \naccompanying the P AIMI Act demonstrates the broad access rights that DRMS must have in \naccordance with federal law.\" Exhibit Cat 7. \n35.  Further, counsel for Defendant's objection on HIPAA grounds is not well-taken. \nDRMS and SPLC are not requesting any records at this time. If children in the CARES Center do \nnot wish to discuss their protected health information with DRMS or SPLC, they do not have to \nsign up to speak with DRMS or SPLC. \n36.  Even if DRMS or SPLC were requesting records in accordance with the terms of \nthe P&A Acts, however, they would be entitled to them over a HIPAA objection. See, e.g., Iowa \nProt.  & Advocacy Servs.,  Inc.  v.  Gerard Treatment Programs,  L.L.C., 152 F.  Supp. 2d 1150, \n1175 (N.D. Iowa 2001) (\"Nor can [defendant] realistically argue that an interest in maintaining \nconfidentiality of the records outweighs permitting [Iowa's P&A] to have the access it seeks, \neven where a guardian objects, because IP AS must maintain the confidentiality of any records to \nthe same extent [defendant] itself must.\"). \n37.  The purpose ofhaving federal statutes, regulations, and reported cases is to direct \nthe conduct of the Nation's citizens and organizations. Individuals and organizations should need \nno court order directing them to comply with federal law. Just as a citizen pays taxes pursuant to \nthe Internal Revenue Code without demanding a personal court order, Defendant should comply \nwith federal law pursuant to the P&A Acts without demanding a personal court order. \n38.  For these reasons, DRMS requests that this Court award it costs and reasonable \nattorney's fees incurred in bringing this action, in an amount to be shown by evidence. \n9 \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00547-HTW-LRA   Document 1   Filed 09/06/13   Page 10 of 10\nPrayer for Relief \n39.  Wherefore, premises considered, DRMS prays that this Honorable Court grant: \na.  A  declaration that  Defendant's denial  of Plaintiffs access  to  monitor the \nchildren in the CARES Center violates the P&A Acts; \nb.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  requiring  the  Defendant,  its \nemployees, and its agents to cease their unlawful behavior and provide DRMS \nand  its  agent with timely,  full,  meaningful,  and  unaccompanied access  to \nmonitor the CARES Center in accordance with the P&A Acts; \nc.  An award of costs and reasonable attorney's fees; and \nd.  Other such relief as the Court deems just. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, this the 6th day of September, 2013. \nDISABILITY RIGHTS MISSISSIPPI \nE.  wens II, MSB # 102333 \njo  .owens@splcenter.org \nAndrew Canter, MSB # 102906 \nandrew. canter@splcenter .org \nSOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER \n111 East Capitol Street, Suite 280 \nJackson, MS 39201 \n601-948-8882 (phone) \n601-948-8885 (fax) \nWendy Wilson-White, MSB # 10 0409 \nwwhite@drms.ms \nDISABILITY RIGHTS MISSISSIPPI \n210 East Capitol Street, Suite 600 \nJackson, Mississippi 39201 \n601-968-0600 (phone) \n601-968-0665 (fax) \nCounsel for Plaintiff \n10 ",
