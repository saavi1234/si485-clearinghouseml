    "summary": "<p>On March 14, 2013, the United States Department of Justice filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The United States sued a Marion County-owned skilled nursing facility, the operation of which was largely funded through Medicaid, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), alleging that the Defendant had a practice of violating the constitutional and statutory rights of residents at the nursing home.  </p><p>Specifically, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant deliberately disregarded known harm or serious risks of harm to residents, and that its actions and failures to act caused harm to residents, including unnecessary segregation, and physical, mental and psychological harm. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant was violating the ADA by failing to serve individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, by not taking sufficient steps to assess, identify, and prepare individuals for discharge from the facility to programs in the community. The Plaintiff also alleged the Defendant failed to adequately screen individuals who are required by federal law to be screened before admission, resulting in individuals being served in a more restrictive setting than appropriate to their needs.  </p><p>The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant’s healthcare services “substantially depart from professional standards,” and thus failed to provide adequate healthcare, a constitutionally protected right. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to monitor, evaluate, update, or review individual’s care plans, despite new diagnoses or changes in conditions. For example, the Plaintiff alleged that on multiple occasions, residents showing symptoms of a stroke or began to foam at the mouth sometimes waited hours before nursing staff noticed or notified a physician.  These failures allegedly resulted in unnecessary harm, including hospitalization, preventable falls, and a decline in functional abilities.</p><p>Concurrently with the Complaint, the United States filed a settlement agreement, which it had already negotiated with the Defendant. The settlement involved a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment, and mandated improvements in three areas: (1) placement in the most integrated settings, (2) conditions of care and treatment, and (3) protection from harm. </p><p>On March 22, 2013, Judge Charles A. Shaw for the United States District for the Eastern District of Missouri issued an order entering the settlement agreement as an order of the court. The Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.</p><p>First, to ensure placement in the most integrated settings, the Agreement required the Defendant to conduct adequate pre-admission evaluations to ensure that individuals were not inappropriately admitted to the facility. The Defendant was also required to implement a discharge and transition process to ensure that individuals who could be served in more integrated settings were identified and that such individuals would be part of a robust and individualized discharge planning process and implementation. The Agreement also provided for “in-reach” by community service providers to residents to actively support them in moving to more integrated settings.</p><p>The Agreement established specific requirements for the “care plan,” or formal written individualized plan of treatment, required for each individual living at the nursing home and those at risk of being institutionalized there. </p><p>The Defendant was required to implement a quality assurance process to oversee the discharge and transition process. It was required to review this information on a quarterly basis, and on an annual basis, create a report summarizing its quality assurance activities, findings, and recommendations, and evaluate whether it had been effective in addressing the barriers preventing individuals from receiving services in the most integrated, appropriate settings. </p><p>Second, to improve the Defendant's conditions of care and treatment, the Agreement required the Defendant to provide individuals at Maple Lawn with adequate and appropriate protections, treatment, supports, and services to meet the individualized needs of the individuals and that are consistent with generally accepted professional standards. This involved the following: improving health care assessments and care plans, establishing an effective infection control program to minimize the spread of infections or communicable diseases, ensuring that nutrition and hydration services as well as aspiration prevention care were sufficient, improving its psychiatric and psychosocial services, specifically its policies about psychotropic medication, improving pressure sore prevention and treatment policies, providing adequate pain management services, mortality reviews for individuals who die at the Defendant’s facility or at an acute-care facility after being transferred from the Defendant’s facility, and annual quality assurance reporting.</p><p>Third, the Defendant was required to provide individuals with a safe and secure environment and ensure protection from harm. The Agreement mandated improvements in the Defendant's fall prevention and reporting policies, adequate reporting and investigation of all incidents where individuals sustain injuries, and annual quality assurance reporting.</p><p>The Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.</p><p>The Monitor’s first Semi-Annual Compliance Report was adopted by the Defendant and filed with the court on September 19, 2013.</p><p>On January 30, 2014, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint statement regarding Defendant’s compliance with the settlement agreement, informing the court that they both agreed with the Monitor’s finding that as of January 15, 2014, the Defendant had achieved substantial compliance with the terms of the Agreement.</p><p>For the next two years, the Monitor and Defendant filed semi-annual reports on compliance with the settlement agreement.</p><p>On April 15, 2016, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint stipulation and motion for dismissal, in which they agreed and stipulated that the Defendant achieved substantial compliance on January 15, 2014 and remained in substantial compliance at all times through January 15, 2016.  The parties jointly stipulated to the dismissal of the action, and each paid its own costs.  District Judge Rodney W. Sippel dismissed the case, and the case is now closed.</p>",

Defendant MARION COUNTY NURSING HOME DISTRICT d/b/a MAPLE \nLAWN (\"Defendant\"), a municipal corporation that is located and transacts business in Marion \nCounty, Missouri, within the Northern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri, is engaging \nin a pattern or practice of violating the Constitutional and statutory rights of persons who reside \nat Maple Lawn Nursing Home (\"Maple Lawn\") in Palmyra, Missouri.  Defendant has \ndeliberately disregarded known harm or serious risks of harm to residents at Maple Lawn, and its \nactions and failures to act cause harm to Maple Lawn residents, including unnecessary \nsegregation, and physical, medical and psychological harm.  After negotiating extensively with \nDefendant, the United States has concluded that a court order entering the settlement agreement, \nfiled concurrently with this Complaint, is necessary to ensure that the unconstitutional and \nunlawful conditions are remedied. \n\nI.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 & 1345 and \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.c. § 12133. \n3.  The United States is authorized to bring this action pursuant to the Civil Rights of \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997a, and Title II ofthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12133.  The Court may grant the reliefrequested pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2201. \n4.  The Attorney General certifies that all pre-filing requirements specified by \n42 U.S.C. § 1997b have been met.  The Attorney General's certificate is attached to, and \nincorporated in, this Complaint.  All conditions precedent to the filing of this Complaint under \nTitle II ofthe ADA have occurred or been performed. \n5.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  The acts and \nomissions giving rise to this action occurred in the Eastern District of Missouri, and Defendant \nconducts business and maintains a facility in Marion County, Missouri. \nII.  DEFENDANT \n6.  The citizens of Marion County, Missouri, voted to create the Defendant to operate \nMaple Lawn. \n7.  Defendant is the entity and municipal corporation charged by the laws of the State \nof Missouri with authority to operate Maple Lawn and is responsible for the services and \nsupports provided to residents living there. \n8.  Defendant funds operation of Maple Lawn largely through the Medicaid program, \na joint federal and state program that funds medical services for low-income persons pursuant to \nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42  U.S.C. §1396 et seq. \n2 \n\n\n9.  Defendant is a \"public entity\" within the meaning ofthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n12131(1),28 C.F.R. § 35.104, and is therefore subject to title II ofADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131. \n10.  Maple Lawn is an institution within the meaning ofCRlPA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997(1). \n11.  At all relevant times Defendant has acted or failed to act, as alleged herein, under \ncolor oflaw. \nIII.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Defendant is Violating the ADA by Failing to Serve Individuals iu the Most \nIntegrated Setting Appropriate to Their Needs \n12.  Title II ofthe ADA prohibits the unjustified isolation of persons with disabilities, \n42 U.S.C. § 12132; Olmsteadv. L.e., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999), and requires states and other \npublic entities to \"administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs ofqualified individuals with disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n13.  Maple Lawn is a long-term care facility (\"nursing home\") certified to serve up to \n140 individuals.  The facility has four wings, one of which is a locked Special Care Unit \ndesigned for individuals with dementia. \n14.  Maple Lawn's residents are primarily elderly persons with disabilities that \nsubstantially limit their ability to engage in activities of daily living without assistance. \n15.  Maple Lawn's residents include \"qualified individual[s] with a disability\" for \npurposes of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101-12213, and implementing regulation, \n28 C.F.R. § 35.13O(d), who meet the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services \nor the participation in programs or activities provided by Defendant. \n16.  Maple Lawn is a segregated setting where individuals with disabilities are \ncongregated together with little to no opportunity to interact with their non-disabled peers. \n3 \n\n\nResidents share rooms with unrelated persons.  Meal times, menus, medication times, and even \nactivity times are regulated by a schedule set by Maple Lawn, not by residents. \n17.  Defendant has failed and is continuing to fail to serve individuals in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs by not taking sufficient steps to assess, identify, and \nprepare individuals for discharge from Maple Lawn to programs in the community. \n18.  Defendant has failed and is continuing to fail to avoid inappropriate admissions of \npersons who are required by federal law to be screened before admission.  Defendant conducts \nan inadequate Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (\"PA  SRR\") process that is required \nby 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7) and 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.100 to 483.138.  Maple Lawn fails prior to \nadmission to identify individuals with mental illness or developmental disabilities and/or conduct \nsecondary screens and offer community alternatives to individuals who are identified through \ninitial screening.  Defendant's failure to properly conduct P ASRR screenings has resulted in \npersons being served in a more restrictive setting than appropriate to their needs. \n19.  Defendant fails to adequately develop and implement transition and discharge \nplans for the residents it has identified as appropriate for discharge to more integrated settings, \ncausing those residents to remain inappropriately and needlessly institutionalized in violation of \nthe ADA.  Specifically, Defendant's discharge plans: \na. \t do not describe, identify, or secure the community resources necessary to \nserve individuals in the community, despite the fact that the facility has a \nwritten discharge planning policy that requires these issues to be addressed; \nb. \t lack documentation of an individual's preferences for care, how such care is \nto be paid for, how care is to be coordinated, what specific care needs have \n4 \n\n\nto be addressed after discharge, and what preparation has to be done before \ndischarge; and \nc. \t repeatedly use generic statements that the individual requires 24-hour care \nand supervision. \n20.  Defendant fails to develop adequate discharge plans for residents who could and \nwish to live in more integrated settings.  Residents who could live in integrated community \nsettings remain at Maple Lawn because of Defendant's failure to assess the supports and services \nnecessary to allow them to succeed in the community.  Specifically, Defendant: \na. \t engages in inadequate discharge planning for many individuals who have \nexpressed a desire to be discharged and who likely could be served in more \nintegrated settings; \nb. \t fails to examine options for community-based supports and services for \nindividuals who have expressed a preference to live in the community and \nwhose family members or other significant persons would require assistance \nin order to meet the individuals' needs; and \nc. \t fails to provide the information individuals need to make an informed choice \nregarding moving to a more integrated setting. \nB. \t Defendant Deprives Individuals of their Constitutionally Protected Rights to \nReceive Adequate Healthcare Services \n21.  The Constitution requires Defendant to provide adequate care for individuals' \nserious medical and mental health care needs.  Defendant's healthcare services substantially \ndepart from professional standards, exposing individuals at Maple Lawn to significant risk of \nharm, and to prolonged institutionalization at Maple Lawn. \n5 \n\n\n22.  Defendant fails to monitor, evaluate, update, or review individual's care plans for \nserious medical needs, despite new diagnoses or changes in individuals' conditions.  Defendant's \nmedical care departs substantially from generally accepted professional standards.  For example, \nresidents who suddenly began to foam at the mouth or show symptoms of a stroke waited hours \nbefore nursing staff noticed or notified a physician.  These failures resulted in unnecessary harm, \nincluding hospitalization, preventable falls, and a decline in functional abilities. \n23.  Defendant inadequately trains nursing staff to monitor individuals for any ofthe \nImown side effects of drugs.  For example, nursing notes did not consider or ruled out the role of \nan individual's drug protocol in contributing to falls.  This failure to provide adequate care for \nindividuals' serious medical needs departs substantially from generally accepted professional \nstandards and results in unnecessary harm, including repeated preventable falls. \n24.  Defendant inadequately identifies, assesses, manages, and treats communicable \ndiseases.  For example, in several cases staff failed to implement proper isolation procedures for \nresidents diagnosed with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (\"MRSA\"), exposing other \nresidents to mmecessary risk of contracting MRSA.  This failure to provide adequate care for \nindividuals' serious medical needs departs substantially from generally accepted professional \nstandards. \n25.  Defendant fails to provide adequate nutrition and hydration practices.  For \nexample, Defendant fails to consistently weigh, monitor, assess, and evaluate individuals' \nnutritional needs, causing many individuals to suffer avoidable weight loss, compromising their \nindividual conditions, and in some cases these failures have hastened individuals' deaths.  This \nfailure to provide adequate care for individuals' serious medical needs departs substantially from \ngenerally accepted professional standards. \n6 \n\n\n26.  Defendant provides unnecessary psychotropic medications, with little or no \nmonitoring of the appropriateness ofthe dose or drug interactions.  This failure to provide \nadequate care for individuals' serious medical needs departs substantially from generally \naccepted professional standards and results in harm to residents, including increased falls, \nphysical side-effects, and declining medical condition. \n27.  Defendant fails to take basic steps necessary to adequately prevent and care for \npressure sores including failing to tum and reposition individuals, failing to assess and report \nchanges in individuals' conditions, and failing to accurately document individuals' records.  This \nfailure to provide adequate care for individuals' serious medical needs departs substantially from \ngenerally accepted professional standards and causes individuals at Maple Lawn to suffer painful \nand preventable pressure sores. \nC.  Defendant Fails to Protect Maple Lawn Residents from Harm \n28.  In violation ofconstitutional standards, Defendant fails to provide individuals at \nMaple Lawn with a safe enviromnent or to protect individuals from harm or risk of harm in a \nsubstantial departure from generally accepted professional standards. \n29.  Defendant fails to provide adequate fall prevention programs and ignores known \nand obvious fall risks.  For example, between January and September 2009, more than 50 \nindividuals at Maple Lawn suffered 166 documented falls, with almost 20% ofthese individuals \nfalling more than five times.  This failure to provide a safe enviromnent and protect individuals \nresiding at Maple Lawn from harm or risk of harm departs substantially from generally accepted \nprofessional standards and causes individuals to suffer harm or risk of harm from injuries, \nfractures, skin tears, and bruises. \n7 \n\n\n30.  Defendant fails to lock doors and storage rooms thus exposing residents to \nhazardous toxins and cleaning solutions.  This failure to provide a safe environment and protect \nindividuals residing at Maple Lawn from harm or risk of harm departs substantially from \ngenerally accepted professional standards and causes individuals to suffer harm or risk ofharm \nfrom exposure to harmful and potentially fatal toxins. \n31.  Defendant fails to properly monitor and secure dangerous drugs.  For example, \nMaple Lawn unit nurses neither count nor record highly addictive and severely restricted \nnarcotics, such as Demerol or Morphine.  Nurses pre-sign blank or partially completed control \nsheets intended to monitor these narcotics.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \n \n \nAssistant Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Ave, NW - RFK  \nWashington, DC  20530 \n \n \n \n              January 25, 2011 \n \n \n \nThe Honorable Lyndon Bode \nPresiding Commissioner \nMarion County Courthouse \n100 South Main Street \nPalmyra, Missouri  63461-1661 \n \n  Re:  Investigation of the Maple Lawn Nursing Home, Palmyra, Missouri  \n \nDear Commissioner Bode: \n \nWe write to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation into the \nconditions, practices, care, and treatment of individuals at the Maple Lawn Nursing Home  \n(“Maple Lawn”) in Palmyra, Missouri. On July 1, 2009, the Department of Justice \n(“Department”) notified you of its intent to investigate Maple Lawn pursuant to the Civil Rights \nof Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (“CRIPA”), and Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, as interpreted by Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 \n(1999). CRIPA authorizes the Department to seek remedies for any pattern or practice of \nconduct that violates the constitutional and federal statutory rights (including those under the \nADA) of persons who reside in public institutions.  The Department also has authority to seek a \nremedy for violations of Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C § 12133. \n \nI.   SUMMARY OF FINDINGS \n \nWe find that Maple Lawn violates the constitutional and federal statutory rights of people \nin the nursing home.  Maple Lawn fails to provide services to persons with disabilities in the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to their needs, as required by the ADA.  In addition, Maple \nLawn fails to prevent unconstitutional harms, or minimize the risk of such harm, from inadequate \nmedical and nursing care; inadequate nutritional and hydration services; improper and dangerous \npsychotropic medication practices; inadequate pressure sore treatment and skin care; inadequate \npain management and end-of-life care; and, inadequate protection from harm due to falls.  Maple \nLawn has inadequate quality assurance systems to identify and cure these deficiencies.   \nExamples of these systemic deprivations of individuals’ constitutional and federal statutory \nrights, include: \n\n- 2 -\n\n \n \t  Failure to divert individuals who could be served in more integrated settings from being \nadmitted to the nursing home in the first place; \n \n \t  Failure to have in place an adequate process to identify and plan for the discharge of \nindividuals who could be served in more integrated settings instead of remaining at \nMaple Lawn; \n \n \t  Inadequate emergent care for individuals suffering life-threatening, and in some cases, \nlife-ending medical crises;  \n \n \t  Failure to treat known communicable diseases; \n \n \t  Shockingly inadequate nutrition practices that caused at least one individual to lose as \nmuch as 20 pounds in one month, and in other cases to suffer untimely and needless \ndeaths; \n \n \t  Dangerous psychotropic medication practices, including overmedication, combining \ncontraindicated drugs, and failing to note adverse drug reactions; \n \n \t  Woefully inadequate pressure sore care and prevention, resulting in painful and needless \nsores; \n \n \t  Exceedingly long periods of unaddressed pain, where individuals sometimes wait weeks \nfor proper pain assessment and care; and, \n \n \t  Inadequate protection from falling that has led to excessively high fall rates, where some  \nat-risk individuals have fallen five or more times. \n \nThese system-wide deficiencies not only contribute to individuals remaining at Maple \nLawn instead of being served in more integrated settings, but also result in untimely deaths and \nother preventable illnesses, injuries, risks, and harms. \n \nII. INVESTIGATION \n \n  The Department and its expert consultants in relevant disciplines conducted an on-site \nreview at Maple Lawn from October 26 through October 30, 2009.  The review focused on the \ngeneral care and treatment of individuals at Maple Lawn as well as on the facility’s discharge \nplanning and community integration practices.  Before, during, and after our site visit, we \nreviewed a wide variety of relevant facility documents, including policies and procedures, \nmedical records, and other records relating to the care and treatment of individuals at Maple \nLawn. During our visit, we also interviewed Maple Lawn administrators, professionals, staff, \nand individuals residing at Maple Lawn.  In keeping with our pledge to share information and to \nprovide technical assistance, we conveyed our preliminary findings to Maple Lawn’s counsel \nand to facility administrators and staff during exit briefings at the close of our on-site visit. \n \n   \n\n- 3 -\n \n  Despite that we identified very serious concerns, the Facility Director expressed a \ngenuine interest in reform. Many staff members genuinely care for the well-being of those who \nreside at the facility. Lastly, the Department appreciates the assistance, support, professionalism, \nand courtesy that Maple Lawn’s administrators and staff showed.  We look forward to working \nwith the County and Maple Lawn officials in the same cooperative manner we have thus far \nenjoyed. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \n  Maple Lawn nursing home is owned and operated by Marion County, Missouri.  Maple \nLawn is located in Palmyra, about 120 miles from St. Louis.  Maple Lawn has licensures under \nboth Medicare and Medicaid. The facility is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (“CMS”) to serve up to 140 individuals.  Maple Lawn is made up of four wings, one of \nwhich is the locked Special Care Unit, designed for individuals with dementia.  At the time of \nour tour, there were 101 individuals in the facility. \n \nIV.  FINDINGS \n \nA. \t  MAPLE LAWN IS VIOLATING THE ADA BY FAILING TO SERVE \nINDIVIDUALS IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING APPROPRIATE TO \nTHEIR NEEDS  \n \nMany individuals at Maple Lawn are not being served in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs, as required by the ADA. Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 “to provide a clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  Congress found that “historically, society has \ntended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and despite some improvements, \nsuch forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and \npervasive social problem.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).  For these reasons, Congress prohibited \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities by public entities:  \n \n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  \n\n- 4 -\n\n \n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n \n  One form of discrimination prohibited by Title II of the ADA is violation of the \n“integration mandate.”  The integration mandate arises out of Congress’s explicit findings in the \nADA, the regulations of the Attorney General implementing Title II,1 and the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 586. In Olmstead, the Supreme Court held that public entities \nare required to provide community-based services to persons with disabilities when (1) such \nservices are appropriate; (2) the affected persons do not oppose community-based treatment; and \n(3) community-based services can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the \nresources available to the entity and the needs of other persons with disabilities.  Id. at 607. In so \nholding, the Court explained that “institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit \nfrom community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are \nincapable or unworthy of participating in community life.”  Id. It also recognized the harm  \ncaused by unnecessary institutionalization: “confinement in an institution severely diminishes the  \neveryday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, \neconomic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Id. at 601.2  As the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear, there is a “consensus among health care \nprofessionals that community access is not only possible, but desirable for individuals with \ndisabilities.”  See Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 512 (8th Cir. 2006) (quoting letter \nreceived from the Center for Medicaid and State Operations). \n \n  Maple Lawn is a segregated setting where individuals with serious illnesses or disabilities \nare congregated together with little to no opportunity to interact with their healthy and non-\ndisabled peers. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), App. A. at 571 (stating that an integrated setting “enables \nindividuals with disabilities to interacted with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent  \npossible”). Individuals at Maple Lawn cannot choose with whom they associate and live, have \nset mealtimes with little to no choice of content, and have limited contact with the community \noutside the four walls of the facility.  Accord Disability Advocates Inc. (DAI) v. Paterson, 653 F. \nSupp. 2d 184, 200-207 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (describing characteristics of institutions to include  \n   \n                                                 \n1  The regulations provide that “a public entity shall administer services, programs and \nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified persons with \ndisabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). The preamble discussion of \nthe ADA “integration regulation” explains that “the most integrated setting” is one that “enables \nindividuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.” \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), App. A. at 571 (2009). \n  2  Olmstead therefore makes clear that the aim of the integration mandate is to eliminate \nunnecessary institutionalization and enable individuals with disabilities to participate in all \naspects of community life.  Accord Press Release, The White House, “President Obama \nCommemorates Anniversary of Olmstead and Announces New Initiatives to Assist Americans \nwith Disabilities” (June 22, 2009) (in announcing the Year of Community Living Initiative, \nPresident Obama affirmed “one of the most fundamental rights of Americans with disabilities:  \nhaving the choice to live independently.”).   \n \n\n- 5 -\n\n \nregimented daily activities, lack of privacy, and few choices).  Yet the County continues to \nprovide services in the segregated setting of Maple Lawn to too many individuals with illnesses \nand disabilities who could be served in the community.   \n \n  This failure was made evident when we asked Maple Lawn staff to provide the names of \nindividuals they felt could transition into the community.  Staff identified only four out of the \n101 individuals at Maple Lawn.  In contrast, after speaking to individuals at Maple Lawn, \nreviewing their charts, and comparing them to similarly situated individuals who are being \nserved in the community, our expert consultant identified additional individuals who could reside \nin more integrated settings. \n \n  While Maple Lawn has developed policies and procedures that could help to ensure that \nindividuals live in more integrated settings, they do not routinely follow these policies and \nprocedures. Maple Lawn is not taking sufficient steps to assess, identify,  and prepare individuals \nfor discharge to programs in the community. First, Maple Lawn does not have an adequate \nprocess to avoid inappropriate admissions.  The Preadmission Screening and Resident Review \n(“PASRR”) screening process employed by the facility is inadequate.  Second, we found that \nMaple Lawn fails to adequately develop and implement transition and discharge plans for the \nindividuals whom it has identified as ready for discharge.  Finally, we found that Maple Lawn \nfails to engage in discharge planning for individuals who could and wish to live in more \nintegrated settings.  \n \n  1. \t Maple Lawn Is Violating the ADA by Failing to Avoid Inappropriate  \nAdmissions. \n \n  We find that Maple Lawn is violating the ADA by failing to have adequate processes in \nplace to avoid inappropriate admissions.  The ADA’s integration mandate not only applies to \nindividuals who are currently institutionalized but also to individuals who are at risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization. See, e.g., Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004) \n(ADA applied to individual at risk of entering a nursing home); Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care \nAuth., 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003) (same).  A nursing home’s admission process must \ninclude a determination of whether individuals’ needs could be served in a more integrated \nsetting than the nursing home and of whether the individual is aware of and interested in \ncommunity-based alternatives to nursing home care.  For nursing homes that receive Medicaid \nfunding, implementation of the federally-mandated PASRR is an essential component of an \nadequate admissions process. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n- 6 -\n\n \n  PASRR is designed to ensure that persons with mental or developmental disabilities,3 are \nnot inappropriately placed in nursing facilities and is an important tool for diversion from  \nadmission of individuals who could be served in more integrated settings.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1396r(b)(3)(f)(i) & (ii), 1396r(e)(7)(A) & (B), and 42 C.F.R. § 483.128; see also Letter from  \nthe Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services to State Medicaid Directors (May 20, 2010), \navailable at https://www.cms.gov/smdl/downloads/smd10008.pdf.  PASRR requires that \nindividuals with mental or developmental disabilities being considered for admission to a nursing \nfacility are evaluated to determine the most integrated setting to meet their needs.  Specifically, \nPASRR mandates a two-level screening procedure.  42 U.S.C. §1396r(e)(7)(A). Level I \nscreening is designed to identify individuals with mental illnesses or developmental disabilities \nprior to their admission to a nursing home.  Level I screens are done for any person for whom  \nplacement in a Medicaid certified bed is being sought, and private pay individuals must be \nscreened as well as those on Medicaid.  Level II screening is completed on those persons \nidentified at Level I who are known or suspected to have mental illnesses or developmental \ndisabilities. Level II screens examine whether the identified individuals’ needs could be met in a \nmore integrated setting and, if it is determined that admission to the nursing home is necessary, \nwhether specialized services are needed, including services to help the individual gain the skills \nnecessary to move to a more integrated setting.  \n \n  PASRR is also an important tool for identifying individuals in a nursing home who can \nbe transitioned to more integrated settings.  See Letter from the Centers for Medicaid and \nMedicaid Services to State Medicaid Directors (May 20, 2010), available at  \nhttps://www.cms.gov/smdl/downloads/smd10008.pdf    In that regard, PASRR mandates regular \nreviews of nursing home individuals’ needs, including whether they could be served in a more \nintegrated setting, upon any change in their condition.  42 C.F.R. §§ 482.116(b)(2), 483.130(n). \n \n  Our tour of Maple Lawn and review of its clinical files revealed that implementation of  \nPASRR at Maple Lawn is inadequate, causing admission of individuals who could be served in \nmore integrated settings.  According to Maple Lawn, few individuals have mental or \ndevelopmental disabilities.  However, we observed instances where Maple Lawn failed to \nidentify individuals with these disabilities prior to their admission or failed to conduct Level II \nscreens when such individuals were identified:   \n \n \t  Medical information in A.A.’s 4 file states that her medical history is “significant for \nschizophrenia.” However, the PASRR Level I screening checked the box “no” for major \nmental disorder.  Because Maple Lawn failed to identify A.A. as an individual with  \n   \n                                                 \n3  Developmental disabilities covered by PASRR are broadly defined and include \nintellectual disabilities as well as conditions such as cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and \nepilepsy, or any other conditions that result in impairment of general intellectual functioning or \nadaptive behavior.  \n4  To protect residents’ privacy, we identified residents by initials other than their own.  \nWe will separately transmit to the County a schedule that cross references the initials used in this \nletter with the residents’ actual names.  \n\n- 7 -\n \nmental illness on a Level I screen, a Level II screen was never completed.  Thus, no \ndetermination was ever made whether A.A. could be served with community-based \nmental health services.  \n \n \t  B.B.’s file indicates she has schizophrenia and a mild intellectual disability.  A Level I \nscreening was completed, but there was no evidence in her file that a Level II screening \nwas completed, including an assessment of whether B.B.’s needs could be met with \ncommunity-based services.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Maple Lawn has \ncontacted either the State or local developmental disability office to arrange for an \nassessment of B.B.’s capabilities and needs.  \n \n  Maple Lawn’s failure to have an adequate admissions process in place, including its \nfailure to adequately conduct PASRR screens, is leading to individuals being served in more \nrestrictive settings than appropriate to their needs, in violation of the ADA. \n \n2. \t Maple Lawn is Violating the ADA by Failing to Provide Adequate Transition \nand Discharge Planning for Individuals It Identifies As Ready for Discharge  \n \nMaple Lawn is violating the ADA by failing to have an adequate process to identify and \nplan for the discharge of individuals who could be served in more integrated settings instead of  \nremaining at Maple Lawn.  Maple Lawn’s discharge planning process is causing individuals who \ncould be served in the community to remain inappropriately and needlessly institutionalized in \nviolation of the ADA. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. Effective discharge planning must focus on \nthe individual’s specific capacities to function in a more integrated setting and identify and \naddress any barriers to discharge.  It should identify the supports and services necessary for the \nindividual’s successful community living.  Planning for discharge must begin upon admission. \n \nOur review of Maple Lawn’s discharge plans shows that they are deficient.  They do not \ndescribe, identify, or secure the community resources necessary to serve individuals in the \ncommunity, despite the fact that the facility has a written discharge planning policy that requires \nthese issues to be addressed. Maple Lawn’s written policy requires two essential processes to be \ncompleted for each individual:  a discharge summary and a post-discharge plan of care.  \n \n \t  Maple Lawn’s discharge policy requires a summary of the individual’s status, \nincluding medical information, physical and mental functional status, sensory and \nphysical impairments, mental and psychosocial status, discharge potential, \nactivities potential, rehabilitation potential, cognitive status, and drug therapy.  \nAccording to the policy, this information is to be filed in the individual’s medical \nrecord.  \n \n \t  Maple Lawn’s post-discharge plan requires a description of how the individual \nand family will access and pay for needed services, a description of how the care \nshould be coordinated if continuing treatment involves multiple caregivers, and \nthe identification of specific needs after discharge including personal care, \nActivities of Daily Living (“ADLs”), self-administration of medications, diet,  \n   \n\n- 8 -\n\n \nsterile dressings, and physical therapy.  Appropriate referrals, when necessary, are \nto be made by social services and documented in the medical record.  The policy \nalso requires the institution to: discuss preferences for care with the individual \nand his or her family; discuss how the individual and family need to prepare for \ndischarge; and review the post-discharge plan with the individual and family. \n \n  The documentation in the files of individuals at Maple Lawn, however, routinely revealed \na failure to complete both a discharge summary and a post-discharge plan.  Essential components \nof adequate discharge planning are not developed or shared with the individuals and their \nfamilies.  This failure occurred in both files of persons recently discharged and in individuals \nwho were identified by staff as persons who could return to the community.  There was no \ndocumentation of an individual’s preferences for care, how such care is to be paid for, how care \nis to be coordinated, what specific care needs have to be addressed after discharge, and what \npreparation has to be done before discharge.  In almost all instances, the documentation on the \nsummary concerning discharge planning simply states that the individual requires 24-hour care \nand supervision. \n \n  Examples of deficient discharge planning for individuals whom Maple Lawn staff \nidentified as ready for community placement include: \n  \n \t  C.C. is at Maple Lawn to recuperate from complications following surgery.  C.C. \nstated that he plans to return home soon and have his ex-wife care for him, as he is \nstarting to feel better from the hospitalization, attending rehab, and working on \ngetting his strength back. However, a review of C.C.’s file provided no indication \nthat Maple Lawn staff had discussed with C.C. the capacity of his ex-wife to provide \ncare or explored the services and supports necessary to meet his needs in the \ncommunity. \n \n \t  D.D. was admitted to Maple Lawn as a result of a hip fracture that required \nrehabilitation. D.D. ambulates with a wheelchair and a walker, and needs limited \nassistance in bed mobility, transferring, and toileting.  Yet, we were unable to find \nany documentation regarding discharge planning even though D.D. had multiple \nadmissions to Maple Lawn for rehabilitation.  This is particularly troubling, as a lack \nof discharge planning that addresses an individual’s specific needs increases the \nlikelihood that the individual will be readmitted to Maple Lawn in the future.  It is \npossible that adequate discharge planning on previous admissions would have \nprevented D.D.’s subsequent readmission. \n \n  Moreover, in order for discharge planning to be adequate, Maple Lawn staff involved in \ndischarge planning should be knowledgeable about community-based services and supports.  \nDuring our tour of Maple Lawn and review of clinical files, it became clear that staff responsible \nfor discharge planning were not aware of and were not sufficiently utilizing these potential \nresources to place individuals in more integrated, appropriate settings, in violation of the ADA.  \n \n   \n\n- 9 -\n\n \n  Missouri has a range of community services that could support individuals discharged \nfrom Maple Lawn to the community.  For example, the Aged and Disabled Waiver and the \nIndependent Living Waiver (“ILW”) are two sources that may be utilized by individuals at \nMaple Lawn to move to a more integrated, community-based setting, including into their own \nhome.  The Aged and Disabled Waiver provides community-based services to Medicaid-eligible \nelderly individuals who meet a nursing home level of care, including homemaker services, chore \nservices, respite care, advanced respite care, nurse respite care, institutional respite care, and \nadult day healthcare. The Missouri ILW provides community-based services to Medicaid-\neligible persons between the ages of 18 and 64 who meet a nursing home level of care, including \npersonal care services, case management, specialized medical equipment and supplies, and \nenvironmental accessibility adaptations.  Missouri also provides for an array of services in the \ncommunity through their Medicaid State Plan, including the Consumer-Directed Services \n(“CDS”) program which provides personal care assistance services for Medicaid-eligible \nconsumers with physical disabilities who need assistance with activities of daily living to live \nindependently.  Finally, according to staff at the Marion County Division of Senior and \nDisability Services Office, persons needing more complex assistance in their home can receive \nAdvanced Personal Care. These services can include catheter care, bowel and bladder \nassistance, and assistance that requires the use of lift equipment. \n \n  In sum, even the individuals that Maple Lawn believes are ready for community \nplacement remain improperly institutionalized in the nursing home in violation of their rights \nunder the ADA because of Maple Lawn’s inadequate discharge planning process.  \n \n  3. \t Maple Lawn’s Discharge Planning Process Violates the ADA Because It Fails \nto Identify Many Individuals Who Could Be Served in More Integrated \nSettings \n \n  Maple Lawn’s discharge planning process also violates the ADA because it fails to \nidentify and plan for many individuals who could be discharged to a more integrated setting.  \nMaple Lawn does not meaningfully engage in the discharge planning process until its treating \nprofessionals have recommended community placement.  Instead of using the discharge planning  \nprocess as a means to identify and address barriers to discharge, we found that Maple Lawn \nkeeps many individuals (including those who have expressed a desire for community placement) \nfrom even reaching the point where Maple Lawn staff will explore discharge options with them.   \nAs a result, individuals who could live in integrated community settings remain at Maple Lawn \nbecause they have not received adequate assessments of the supports and services necessary to \nallow them to succeed in the community.  Accord Frederick L. v. Dept. of Public Welfare, 157 F. \nSupp. 2d 509, 540 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (“Olmstead does not allow States to avoid the integration \nmandate by failing to require professionals to make recommendations regarding the service \nneeds of institutionalized individuals with disabilities.”); DAI, 653 F. Supp. 2d at 259 (same). \n \n  For example, our consultant’s review of individual’s files revealed that Maple Lawn \nengaged in no meaningful discharge planning for numerous individuals who had expressed a \nstrong desire to be discharged and who, in our expert’s opinion, likely could be served in more \nintegrated settings.  The fact that these individuals have indicated they wish to return to the  \n   \n\n- 10 -\n\n \ncommunity should trigger a detailed analysis of how this can be accomplished or why it is not \nappropriate and what needs to occur so that goal can be met.  For example: \n \n \t  A.A. is a 75-year-old woman who came to the facility in April 2009 as a result of a \nmotor vehicle accident that caused head and leg injuries.  Her diagnoses included \norganic brain damage and schizophrenia.  A.A’s husband, who was also in the \naccident, visits regularly and stated that he has prepared their home to accommodate \nher physical needs when she returns home.  There is no assessment in her file, \nhowever, that documents his efforts or identifies what services and supports A.A. \nwould need to return to the community. \n \n \t  E.E., a 79-year-old retired school teacher who lives in Quincy, Illinois, plans on \nreturning there when she is ready for discharge.  She came to the facility in \nSeptember 2009.  E.E. requires limited assistance in transferring, mobility, toileting \nand bathing, but is independent in dressing, eating, and personal hygiene.  Despite the \nfact that E.E.’s needs are relatively light, there has been no determination of what \nservices are available to meet her needs in the community once her medical condition \nis stabilized, and there have been no arrangements made to see that these services are \ndelivered.  \n \n  We also found examples where Maple Lawn staff failed to examine all options for \ncommunity-based supports and services for individuals who had expressed a clear preference to \nlive in the community but whose family members or other significant persons indicated that they \ncould not themselves handle some of the individuals’ needs.  Instead, Maple Lawn simply \ndetermined that these individuals were not able to be discharged.  However, our expert \nconsultant identified a variety of supports that Maple Lawn failed to explore, including \nAdvanced Personal Care through the Medicaid program, that might be able to meet these \nindividuals’ needs. For example: \n \n \t  F.F., a 77-year-old, was admitted in February 2009 with chronic renal failure and \nadvanced peripheral vascular disease. F.F. uses a wheelchair and needs assistance \nwith his ADLs. The social service notes indicate that F.F. wants to go home, but his \nwife and son cannot provide 24-hour care and supervision.  F.F. told us that he would \nrather be “someplace else” other than the nursing facility.  There is no evidence in \nF.F.’s file that Maple Lawn staff have examined what services are available, \nincluding those through Medicaid that could meet his care needs in the community. \n \n \t  G.G., a 71-year-old, was admitted in June 2009 with diabetes, hypertension, and \ndifficulty moving muscles on one side of his body.  G.G. does not require significant \nhelp with his ADLs, although he needs tube feeding and supervision with bathing, \nwalks with the assistance of a cane, and is occasionally incontinent.  G.G. is adamant \nthat he wants to return home, and told us that he has spoken to the social service staff \nabout this desire, but says he cannot return to the community until the feeding tube is \nremoved.  G.G. told us that he has a girlfriend who can help him with his needs.  \nHowever, his file contained a doctor’s note that states his girlfriend had concerns  \n   \n\n- 11 -\n \nregarding taking G.G. home because of the tube feeding and the blood testing \nrequired for his diabetes. There is no evidence in G.G.’s file indicating whether or \nnot Maple Lawn’s staff have followed-up with G.G.’s girlfriend to discuss her \nconcerns, or indicating whether staff have examined whether other services, such as \nintensive personal care through Medicaid, would be able to address his needs.   \n \nFinally, we found that Maple Lawn’s discharge planning process fails to provide  \nthe information individuals need to make an informed choice regarding moving to a more  \nintegrated setting. Maple Lawn should provide information to individuals in order to enable \nthem to make an informed choice, as ambivalence among individuals about their ability  \nto reside in the community is frequently based on a lack of information and counseling \nconcerning alternatives.  Cf. DAI, 653 F. Supp. 2d at 267 (“[W]ith accurate information and  \na meaningful choice, many . . . residents would choose to live and receive services in a  \nmore integrated setting”); Letter from the Center for Medicaid and State Operations Health  \nCare Financing Administration to State Medicaid Directors (Jan. 14, 2000), available at  \nhttps://www.cms.gov/smdl/downloads/smd011400c.pdf (advising states that their Olmstead \nplans must “address what information, education, and referral systems would be useful to ensure \nthat people with disabilities receive the information necessary to make informed choices”). \n \n  We found the following examples where Maple Lawn’s failure to inform individuals \nabout community-based alternatives to nursing home care is leading to individuals for whom  \ndischarge may be appropriate remaining at Maple Lawn: \n \n \t  H.H. is 87 years old and was most recently admitted to the facility in April 2009.  \nH.H. states that he would rather be home with his nearby family but is resigned to \nbeing in the facility. However, H.H.’s file contains no documentation of discussions \nwith H.H. regarding the possibility of moving to the community or discussions to \nascertain the reason for his resignation, and no indication of what, if any, barriers \nprevent his return to the community.  \n \n \t  I.I. is 60 years old and was admitted to the facility in April 2009.  She has Parkinson’s \ndisease and coronary artery disease, needs the assistance of one person to transfer her \nfrom her bed to her wheelchair, and needs limited assistance in dressing, toileting, \nand bathing. In July 2009, I.I. indicated a preference to return to the community.  Her \ndaughter lives in the community and supports the discharge.  When we spoke to I.I. \nduring our visit, however, she was ambivalent about moving to the community.  \nThere is no evidence in I.I.’s file, however, that Maple Lawn staff have addressed \nI.I.’s ambivalence towards a return to the community through counseling or through \nthe provision of information on what services are available to address her needs in the \ncommunity. \n \n  Thus, Maple Lawn’s deficient discharge planning process is leading to individuals who \ncould be served in more integrated settings unnecessarily remaining at Maple Lawn in violation \nof the ADA.  \n \n   \n\n- 12 -\n\n \nB. \t MAPLE LAWN DEPRIVES INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONALLY \nPROTECTED RIGHTS TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE SERVICES \n \n  Unnecessary segregation of individuals at Maple Lawn not only violates the ADA, but \nsubjects them to a high risk of harm from unconstitutional conditions.  Individuals residing in a \ncounty-owned nursing home such as Maple Lawn have a Fourteenth Amendment Due Process \nright to adequate healthcare. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315 (1982); Goodman v. \nParwatikar, 570 F.2d 801, 804 (8th Cir. 1978) (holding that once admitted, an individual with \nmental illness “had a constitutional right to a basically safe and humane living environment”).   \nA governmental entity that holds people in confinement for care and treatment violates the Due \nProcess Clause when it provides medical care that substantially departs from professional \nstandards. See Morgan v. Rabun, 128 F.3d 694, 697-98 (8th Cir. 1997). \n \n  We find a number of conditions and practices at Maple Lawn that violate individuals’ \nconstitutional right to adequate healthcare services.  In particular, individuals at Maple Lawn \nsuffer significant harm and risk of harm due to Maple Lawn’s:  (1) failure to provide adequate \nmedical care; (2) failure to provide adequate nutritional and hydration care; (3) allowing  \ndangerous psychotropic medication practices; (4) failure to provide adequate pressure sore \ntreatment and skin care; and (5) failure to provide adequate pain management and end-of-life \ncare. These failures not only result in unconstitutional harms, they also contribute to a regression \nin individuals’ skills, leading to their prolonged institutionalization at Maple Lawn. \n \n1. \t Maple Lawn’s Inadequate Medical Care Practices Are Resulting in \nUnconstitutional Harm. \n \n  Maple Lawn fails to provide adequate healthcare.  We consistently found examples \nwhere Maple Lawn failed to properly treat the healthcare needs of individuals.  As a result, \nindividuals unnecessarily suffered falls, declined in functional abilities, and lost excessive \namounts of weight without proper intervention.  These failures resulted in unconstitutional harm. \n \n  At Maple Lawn, we found assessments that were inaccurate, inadequate, and \ninconsistent.  We found care plans that were boiler-plate, did not contain measurable outcomes, \nand failed to address individuals’ needs. As a result, care plans appeared useless as a guide to \naddress individual care. In our nursing consultant’s opinion, the major cause of the inadequate \ndelivery of healthcare was inadequate nursing training, with staff unable to recognize and react \nto changes in individuals’ conditions.  Moreover, Maple Lawn does not have an adequate quality \nassurance or quality improvement mechanism that would identify the deficient medical care.  \n \n  The inadequate medical care of the following individuals illustrates these problems: \n \n \t  J.J., who had a history of diabetes, died in November 2008. According to J.J.’s \nmedical records, she experienced unstable blood sugars on November 11, 2008.  \nYet, nursing staff failed to notify her physician, failed to assess her change of \ncondition, failed to update her care plan, and failed to timely intervene.  When \n   \n\n- 13 -\n\n \nJ.J.’s blood sugar rose to 502 mg/dl5 and she began foaming out the mouth, it \nappears that nursing staff left J.J. in her room unattended as she was gasping for \nbreath.  When nursing staff finally returned to her room, J.J. was not breathing \nand did not have a pulse. Nursing staff failed to initiate life saving efforts despite \nclear indications to do so. According to our nursing expert, the nurse who was \nassigned to J.J.’s unit on the evening when J.J. died was neither properly trained \nto handle J.J.’s declining condition nor properly supervised while J.J.’s condition \ndeclined. Ms. J. needlessly suffered before she died.  Staff’s utter failure to act to \ntreat Ms. J. can only be seen as deliberate indifference to her serious medical \ncondition and is therefore a violation of her constitutional right to adequate \nmedical care. \n \n \t  In May 2009, K.K., who had been fairly independent and able to walk without \nassistance, exhibited symptoms of a stroke (left side limp and unable to \nambulate).  Despite this change in K.K.’s condition, nursing staff waited over five \nhours before they finally contacted her physician.  Even then, her physician failed \nto evaluate her condition and K.K. continued to decline.  In reviewing K.K.’s \nrecords, it also appears that nursing staff failed to reassess and document her \ndeclining condition as she worsened.  Further, nursing staff continued to \nadminister medication that increased K.K.’s risk for bleeding even though she \nwas already at risk for bleeding. Less than seven days after her change of  \ncondition, K.K. had to be rushed to the emergency room where she was treated \nfor a large ventricular hemorrhage and was placed in the Intensive Care Unit.  \nWhen K.K. was returned to Maple Lawn on June 9, her condition had drastically \ndeteriorated. She was unresponsive and totally dependent on nursing staff to \nassist with her daily needs.  The facility’s failure to treat Ms. K’s worsening \ncondition likely contributed to her hospitalization and decline, and again, bespoke \nof deliberate indifference to her serious medical needs. \n \n\t   Even though L.L. had a condition identifying him as a high risk for falls, his care \nplan did not include specific interventions designed to reduce the risk of falls. \nNursing staff thus failed to provide adequate supervision and assistance.  In \nJanuary 2009, L.L. fell and fractured his hip.  It appears that a Maple Lawn  \nemployee witnessed the fall but did not intervene.  Maple Lawn’s failure to \nidentify specific interventions given his medical history and his known proclivity \nfor falls likely contributed to Mr. L.’s fracture that required surgery to repair. \n \n \t  M.M. had a history of falls. In reviewing M.M.’s records, we found that he had a \nmedical condition that likely contributed to several falls at the facility, but nursing \nstaff failed to address this risk.  In fact, his care was so deficient that it failed to \naddress his known previous falls as well as his risk for future falls.  As a result, he \ncontinued to fall without any intervention. \n   \n                                                 \n5  The normal blood sugar level is 70-100 mg/dl.  \n\n- 14 -\n\n \n \t  N.N., whom Maple Lawn identified as a fall risk, fell 11 times between August \nand October 2009. Despite its knowledge, the facility made no attempt to \nmonitor, evaluate, or revise her care plan even though she continued to fall.  The \nmisadministration of medication contributed to the increased falls during the \nperiod of August to October 2009. Nursing notes revealed that Ms. N.’s \npsychotropic medication was incorrectly increased during this time, and she \nexhibited poor balance, unsteady gait, and was lethargic; despite this, staff failed \nto reassess her care. Further, it appears that during this time, N.N.’s physician did \nnot evaluate her after multiple falls and failed to detect the medication error that  \nlikely increased her fall risk. \n \n\t   O.O. was prescribed a potent pain medication that could cause sedation and \nrespiratory depression and required close monitoring.  In reviewing Mr. O.’s \nrecord, it appears that he had an adverse reaction to the medication, yet nursing \nstaff failed to monitor him closely and failed to treat him despite his negative \nreaction to his medication.  Again, Maple Lawn failed to act to treat known risks \nof harm. \n \n  Maple Lawn’s nursing staff did not appear to monitor individuals for any of the known \nside effects of drugs. For example, none of the nursing notes that our consultants reviewed \nsuggested that staff rule out, or even consider, the role of an individual’s drug protocol in \ncontributing to falls.  It is likely that a substantial number of fall-related incidents occur from  \npolypharmacy, or the use of multiple and often unnecessary medications.  \n \n  Maple Lawn also fails to adequately assess, manage, and treat communicable diseases.  \nWe learned during our on-site visit that Maple Lawn did not have a dedicated Infection Control \nNurse, which likely contributed to inadequate staff training and poor facility practices.  Even \nmore alarming, Maple Lawn lacked adequate policies and procedures regarding infection control \nand infection surveillance and tracking.  Notably, nursing staff admitted that, even though \ninfections were a current and past problem, in-service training on infection control was never \nprovided. The following examples illustrate the facility’s failure to adequately treat \ncommunicable diseases: \n \n\t   Even though P.P. complained of rectal pain and diarrhea, nursing staff failed to \ntest for a bacterial infection.  Nursing staff waited nearly five weeks before they \nfinally ordered a lab test that confirmed a potentially life-threatening and highly \ncontagious bacterial infection.  In our nursing consultant’s opinion, Maple Lawn’s \nfailure to timely treat P.P.’s condition  unnecessarily exposed individuals and staff \nto an unreasonable risk from infectious disease. \n \n \n   \n\n- 15 -\n\n \n \t  Q.Q. was diagnosed with Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (“MRSA”)6 in her \nurine in September 2009.  In reviewing Q.Q.’s records, we found that nursing \nstaff failed to maintain proper contact isolation to prevent the spread of MRSA to \nother individuals. \n \n\t   R.R. was diagnosed with MRSA in his respiratory tract yet staff did not isolate \nhim.  In fact, we learned that R.R. was placed in a semi-private room where there \nwere no isolation carts or supplies readily available for the staff. \n \n\t   Another individual, S.S., was diagnosed with MRSA in his respiratory tract and \nnursing staff failed to use isolation carts and failed to have supplies readily \navailable for the staff to prevent the spread of MRSA. \n \n  A major contributing factor to the nursing home’s inability to prevent the spread of \ninfectious diseases stems from the fact that the Maple Lawn does not have policies or procedures \nthat address isolation to prevent the spread of these prevalent and serious infections, and the \nfacility staff have not been properly trained to address these issues.  In any event, the facility’s \nfailure to adequately treat highly contagious and potentially life threatening communicable \ndiseases exposes individuals to unconstitutional harm. \n \n2. \t Maple Lawn’s Inadequate Nutrition and Hydration Practices Expose \nIndividuals to Unlawful Harm. \n \n  Individuals at Maple Lawn have a constitutional right to adequate food.  Youngberg, 457 \nU.S. at 315. Nursing facilities, such as Maple Lawn, are also obligated by federal regulation to \nprovide individuals with adequate nutrition, including sufficient fluids, to maintain their health \nand well-being. See 42 C.F.R. § 483.25 (i-j).7  Maple Lawn’s inadequate nutrition and hydration \npractices have resulted in unlawful harm.  In particular, we found that staff and physicians fail to \nadequately treat individuals with significant weight loss or poor oral intake.  As a result, \nindividuals have suffered, and sometimes, have died untimely and needless deaths.  In cases \nwhere there was clear evidence that individuals had inadequate oral intake, we noted that \nlicensed nurses did not determine the reasons why intake was poor. \n \n  We reviewed weight records for the month of September 2009 and were alarmed to find \nthat staff did not weigh any individuals during this period.  This is an egregious departure from  \ngenerally acceptable professional standards of care.  In our discussion with the facility dietitian,  \n   \n                                                 \n6  Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (“MRSA”) are drug-resistant bacteria that can cause \ndifferent kinds of illness, including skin infections, bone infections, pneumonia, and severe life-\nthreatening bloodstream infections.  MRSA is particularly prevalent and virulent in institutions  \nwhere many people are housed in close proximity and basic hygiene may be lacking. \n7  Federal nursing home regulations require a high quality of care and establish generally \naccepted professional standards.  \n\n- 16 -\n\n \nshe confirmed that weights likely were not taken in September and emphasized the importance of \nhaving members of the nursing department participate in monitoring and tracking individuals’ \nnutritional status. Yet, we learned during our site visit that the nursing department had abdicated \nits responsibility for monitoring individuals’ weights to the restorative department.  When we \nreviewed weight loss records, we were unable to find any evidence that restorative staff were \ninvolved in tracking weight changes, nutritional intake, or overall nutritional status.  The failure \nto weigh individuals for the entire month of September calls into question Maple Lawn’s avowed \npractice of accurately monitoring individuals’ weights, and undermines data concerning \nnutritional and hydration status as well. \n \n  The following are examples of dangerously inadequate nutritional and hydration care for \nindividuals at Maple Lawn. Many of these examples, again, demonstrate staff’s utter failure to \ntreat serious, and in some cases, life threatening conditions. \n \n \t  T.T. is 105 years old and was admitted to the nursing home in May 2008.  She \nhad a history of diabetes, glaucoma, depression, and dementia.  In reviewing her \nweight logs, we noted that Ms. T. lost nearly 20 pounds in one month.  Nursing \nstaff did not report this significant loss to her physician or evaluate her condition \nto determine the cause of the weight loss.  As a result, this potentially life-\nthreatening weight loss went unaddressed by the facility. \n \n \t  J.J. was 75 years old and died in November 2008.  Ms. J. had an extensive \nmedical history; most notably, she had brittle diabetes8 and required strict \nmonitoring. Despite her medical history, it appears that Maple Lawn staff failed \nto adequately monitor her condition.  As J.J.’s condition declined and she \napparently stopped eating, nursing staff failed to contact her physician, failed to \nassess her changing condition, failed to monitor her blood sugar levels, failed to \nfollow physician’s orders for insulin, and failed to intervene in any way. Even \nthough Ms. J. consumed no food on the day that she died, nursing staff continued \nto administer long-acting and fast-acting insulin until she had irregular breathing \nand was foaming at the mouth.  When Ms. J.’s heart and respiration ceased, \nnursing staff failed to initiate life saving efforts to resuscitate her despite clear \ndirection in her chart to do so.  In our medical consultant’s opinion, Ms. J. likely \ndied from hypoglycemic shock -- excessive insulin administration leading to \nseverely low blood sugar and death. \n \n\t   In another example, U.U., a 91-year-old, was admitted from Maple Lawn to the \nhospital in July 2009 after she lost a great deal of weight and became severely \nanemic.  While at the hospital, Ms. U. received a blood transfusion, which \nsignificantly improved her condition.  Thereafter, she returned to the nursing \nhome and again, lost a significant amount of weight -- nearly 11 pounds in one \n   \n                                                 \n8    Brittle diabetes is a term used to describe a type of diabetes when a person’s \nblood glucose (sugar) level often swings quickly from high to low and from low to high. \n\n- 17 -\n\n \n month.  This significant weight loss was not reported to her physician for several \nweeks.  When the doctor finally evaluated her, he noted a “rapid deterioration,” \nyet he did not make any changes to her medications.  One week later Ms. U. died. \nThe lack of medical and nursing interventions and monitoring likely contributed \nto her death. \n \n\t   In October 2009, I.I. lost 18 pounds, yet Maple Lawn staff failed to adequately \nassess and monitor his condition. The failure to assess and respond to Mr. I.’s \ndeclining nutritional status and weight loss is emblematic of the unlawful actions  \nof Maple Lawn staff. \n \n  In summary, due to Maple Lawn’s failure to consistently weigh, monitor, assess, and \nevaluate individuals’ nutritional needs, many individuals have unnecessarily suffered avoidable \nweight loss, compromising their individual conditions, and in some cases these failures have \nhastened these deaths. In all cases, the resulting harm was unconstitutional. \n \n3. \t Maple Lawn’s Psychotropic Medication Practices are Causing \n\nUnconstitutional Harm \n\n \n  Maple Lawn is providing unnecessary psychotropic medications in violation of the law.  \nBoth federal law and generally accepted professional standards require that nursing home  \nindividuals be free from unnecessary anti-psychotropic medication.  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(1)(1).  \nPsychotropic medications are widely prescribed at Maple Lawn.  Over half of those who live at \nMaple Lawn receive multiple psychotropic medications, many without clinical justification.  \nEven more alarming, we found in almost every case that we reviewed, the treating physician did \nnot monitor the effectiveness of the prescribed medication and nursing staff failed to monitor \nchanges in individuals’ condition.  When we asked about the shockingly high numbers of \npsychotropic medications administered to individuals, the facility’s consultant pharmacist told us \nthat he is “trying to reduce the number of prescriptions,” but his efforts have been ineffective \nbecause his recommendations for medication reduction are rarely accepted by the treating \nphysicians. Problems with psychotropic medication practices may stem from Maple Lawn’s \nfailure to appropriately divert individuals with mental illnesses from admission to the nursing \nhome in the first place, as discussed in Part IV(A)(1) above.  \n \n  We found numerous examples of unnecessary medication use at Maple Lawn, where \nlittle or no apparent effort had been made to reduce dosage and little or no monitoring had been \nundertaken of the appropriateness of the dose or drug interactions.  For example: \n \n\t   N.N., discussed above, was prescribed a psychotropic medication.  Her records \nrevealed that in July 2009, nursing staff took a verbal order to decrease her \ndosage, but instead, increased the dosage by 25 mg.  For nearly three months, \nnursing staff failed to recognize the medication error and failed to monitor the \nside effects that the medication was causing.  During this period, N.N. fell 11 \ntimes, a potential side-effect from the medication, yet nursing staff failed to \ncomplete an evaluation.  \n   \n\n- 18 -\n\n \n \t  V.V. has a history of Alzheimer’s disease and was prescribed antipsychotic \nmedications since at least May 2009.  Although he was prescribed medications for \nagitation, there was no documentation in his record of any recent symptoms that \nrequired the medication.  Further, we noted that his physician refused to reduce \nhis medication dosage despite clear indications that Mr. V. exhibited no signs of \nagitation or restlessness for several months. \n \n \t  Q.Q. was admitted to Maple Lawn in November 2008.  Q.Q. was prescribed four \nantipsychotic medications, two anti-anxiety medications, two pain medication \ndrugs, and one drug for Parkinson’s symptoms.  In September 2009, nursing staff \nnotified the physician that Q.Q.’s hands were shaking, a potentially adverse \nreaction to the antipsychotic medication, yet the physician neither reduced nor \nchanged her medication for nearly one month.  Her medical records indicate that, \nduring this period, nursing staff failed to properly assess her changing condition \nor to monitor the side effects that her medication caused. \n \n\t   W.W., an 89-year-old resident who died prior to our visit, was prescribed 29 \ndifferent drugs up until his death. It appears that his physician failed to \nconsistently review the list of drugs that W.W. was taking.  According to our \nexpert consultant, the excessive numbers of drugs likely contributed to W.W.’s \ndecline in condition.  \n \n\t   X.X. had been taking psychotropic medication without adequate monitoring and \nassessment.  It was not until his family intervened that Maple Lawn staff finally \nassessed and reduced his medication. \n \n  Finally, we found a concerning pattern of prescribing a medication used to treat urinary \nurge incontinence without records that could explain the rationale for prescribing this \nmedication.  Even more troubling, we learned that despite the facility pharmacist’s request to \ndiscontinue this medication because of possible adverse effects, Maple Lawn’s physicians \ncontinued to prescribe the medication without addressing the pharmacist’s concern. \n \n  In summary, the nurses’ and physicians’ failures with regard to psychotropic medication \npractices are unlawful and are causing unconstitutional harm. \n \n4. \t Maple Lawn Fails to Adequately Treat Individuals with Pressure Sore and \nSkin Care Needs \n \n  We find that individuals at Maple Lawn are suffering painful and preventable pressure \nsores due to unlawfully inadequate services.  Federal law and generally accepted professional \nstandards require that nursing homes ensure that individuals with pressure sores receive \nnecessary treatment.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.25(c)(1).  Maple Lawn’s unacceptable pressure sore \ncare and skin care place individuals at risk of harm.  We found several instances where staff \nfailed to take basic steps necessary to adequately care for pressure sores.  Staff failed to turn and \nreposition individuals, failed to assess and report changes in individuals’ condition, and failed to  \n   \n\n- 19 -\n\n \naccurately document individuals’ records.  In our expert consultant’s opinion, these failures \nlikely occurred because nursing staff are not adequately trained in pressure sore prevention and \ntreatment. \n \n  In reviewing the in-service training records for the six months prior to our on-site \ninvestigation, we noted minimal training sessions devoted to identifying and treating pressure \nsores and skin care.  Even more troubling, Maple Lawn did not have a clearly defined set of \npolicies and procedures guiding pressure sore prevention and treatment.  In addition, Maple \nLawn’s pressure sore treatment and prevention program lacks multidisciplinary involvement.  \nAdequate nutritional care is critical in the prevention and treatment of pressure sores.  \nUnfortunately, there is no evidence that the dietitian participates in any team effort on prevention \nor treatment of pressure sores.  Similarly, medical staff and therapy staff are not involved in a \ngroup effort to address pressure sore prevention and treatment. \n \n  The combined deficiencies in nurse training and lack of multidisciplinary involvement in \npressure sore treatment and prevention is causing grievous harm.  The following are examples of \nthe harm suffered because of inadequate pressure sore treatment: \n \n \t  L.L. fell and fractured his hip at the facility in January 2009, and staff noted that \nhe was at high risk of skin breakdown.  Because of the fracture, L.L. had limited \nmobility and was dependent on nursing staff for repositioning in his bed and \nwheelchair and for removing his stockings and boots every evening.  However, \nnursing staff failed to adequately provide this care.  As a result, Mr. L. developed \na Stage II pressure sore9 on his heel and Stage I pressure sore on his coccyx. \nEven after staff noted the facility-acquired sores, they waited two days before \nthey finally notified his physician or the wound care nurse.  When the wound care \nnurse finally saw him, she noted his Stage II pressure sore and recommended \ntreatment.  Nursing staff, however, waited four days before they finally attempted \nto treat the sores on Mr. L.’s heel and coccyx.  \n \n \t  Y.Y. was at risk of skin breakdown and required daily skin inspections.  In \nreviewing Y.Y.’s records, we found that in May 2009 nursing staff noted a skin \nbreakdown on Y.Y.’s heel but failed to document it in the weekly skin report.  For \ntwo months, staff failed to conduct daily skin inspections of Mr. Y.  As a result of \nMaple Lawn’s absence of care, Mr. Y.’s wounds were not identified until July \n2009 when they were advanced (Stage III or IV) and had become infected.   \n   \n                                                 \n9  Pressure sores are staged I - IV according to severity as follows:  stage I - intact skin \nbut reddened, non-blanching; stage II - partial thickness injury like an abrasion or blister; stage \nIII - full-thickness pressure damage extending into subcutaneous tissue; stage IV - full-thickness \ntissue destruction to muscle, tendon or bone.  It is critical that pressure sores be “staged” \naccurately, as the type and frequency of treatment depends on the wound being accurately \nassessed.  \n\n- 20 -\n \nDiscolored drainage from his heel indicated that his wound was infected and \npainful.  \n \n \t  P.P. was known to be at risk for skin breakdown and was totally dependent on \nstaff for her care. In reviewing P.P.’s records, we found that she developed a \nfacility-acquired pressure sore that nursing staff neither identified nor treated.  In \nfact, it was not until P.P. was admitted to a local hospital that the pressure sore on \nher buttocks was identified and treated. It is most likely that the wound was \npresent in some stage prior to her hospital admission, yet Maple Lawn nursing \nstaff failed to assess, develop a care plan, or treat P.P.’s condition. \n \n \t  Z.Z., another totally dependent individual who was known to be at risk for skin \nbreakdown and required repositioning in her bed, developed a facility-acquired \npressure sore. In reviewing Z.Z.’s records, we found that nursing staff failed to \nturn and reposition her, failed to conduct daily inspections, and failed to update \nand individualize her care plan. As a result, Z.Z. developed a pressure sore on her \ncoccyx that became infected.  In our expert consultant’s opinion, the staff’s \nfailures to provide care likely caused the development of her skin breakdown. \n \n5. \t Maple Lawn’s Inadequate Pain Management and End-Of-Life Care is Causing \nUnlawful Harm  \n \nMaple Lawn does not provide adequate pain management and end-of-life care practices to those \nin residence. Federal regulations require nursing homes to assess individuals for pain as part of \nthe comprehensive care planning process.  42 C.F.R. § 483.20(d).  Diagnosing and treating pain \nis essential to the practice of medicine and is especially urgent in caring for elderly individuals \nand those with terminal illnesses.  During our review, we found several examples where the \nnursing home failed to adequately manage or assess individuals’ pain.  Examples of inadequate \npain management that are causing grave harm include: \n \n \t  A.B. was admitted to Maple Lawn in July 2009 after suffering a fractured spine.  \nAlthough she was admitted for short-term rehabilitation, she died less than three \nweeks after admission.  From the outset, Ms. B. complained of pain yet staff \nwaited nearly two weeks before they finally contacted her physician to address \nher continued complaints of pain.  During this period, Ms. B. refused to eat, \nthreatened to “let self go,” and stated that she was “tired of the pain.”  Even then, \nMs. B.’s physician did not come to the facility to assess her condition; rather, he \nsimply increased her medications and quadrupled the strength of her fentanyl \npatch10. Thereafter, Ms. B. became unable to eat or drink and increasingly \nnonresponsive and died within a week. \n \n   \n                                                 \n10  A fentanyl patch is a narcotic (opiod) pain medicine applied to the skin for treating persistent  \nmoderate to severe pain. \n\n- 21 -\n \n \t  A.C. was admitted to Maple Lawn in April 2009 after suffering from breast \ncancer complications.  Despite clear indications that A.C. required pain \nmanagement, it appears that nursing staff failed to adequately address her pain.  \nNursing staff mistakenly administered a short-acting form of morphine rather than \na long-acting form to address her pain.  According to our medical expert, this \nmedication error likely contributed to an escalation of pain that went untreated.  In \nreviewing the nurse’s notes, it appears that Ms. C. suffered laboring breathing, \ntwitching, shaking, and moaning when staff attempted to reposition her in her \nbed, yet we were unable to find any indication that Ms. C.’s drug regime was \nadjusted to address her pain. \n \n \t  A.D. was admitted to Maple Lawn in June 2009 after suffering from obstructive \npulmonary disease and a prior stroke.  Mr. D. steadily declined in the three \nmonths before his death. In reviewing Mr. D.’s records, we found that A.D.’s \ncare plan lacked specific direction for comfort measures, symptom management \nduring this terminal illness, and any social services assessment and plan for his \nneeds.  Further, his physician ordered a series of painful and futile interventions \nthat likely exacerbated his discomfort.  The nurses notes state that Mr. D. “was \nrubbing his stomach and grimacing,”  “restless,”  “gaggy,” “drawing up legs,” and \n“whispered ‘ow,’” yet his physician did not increase his medication dosage.  In \nour expert consultant’s opinion, Maple Lawn’s treatment of Mr. D. is a gross \ndeviation from lawful practices.  \n \nC. \t MAPLE LAWN SUBJECTS INDIVIDUALS TO HARM IN VIOLATION OF \nTHEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND FEDERAL LAW  \n \n  Through Maple Lawn’s acts or omissions, individuals suffer harm, or are at risk of harm \nfrom preventable deaths, preventable falls, fractures, unexplained injuries, skin tears, and \nbruises. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a county-run facility to \nprotect individuals from harm when it affirmatively places those individuals in danger.  Tinder v. \nLewis County Nursing Home District, 207 F. Supp. 2d 951, 955-57 (E.D. Mo. 2001) (holding \nthat the nursing home violated plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights because it had a duty to \nprotect or care for an individual when it affirmatively placed that individual “in a position of \ndanger the individual would not have otherwise faced”).  The facility must deliver services with \n“reasonable care and safety.” Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324. It must also take all reasonable steps \nto protect those who live at the facility from harm.  Id. at 315-16. Maple Lawn violates the \nconstitutional rights of those who reside at the facility when it affirmatively places them in \ndangerous positions they otherwise would not have otherwise faced.  Tinder, 207 F. Supp. 2d at \n955-56. \n \n1.  Fa\t ll Risk  \n \n  Individuals at Maple Lawn suffer serious injuries from preventable falls, where staff fail \nto reasonably mitigate known fall risks.  More than 50 individuals at Maple Lawn suffered 166 \ndocumented falls between January and September 2009.  Almost 20% of these individuals fell  \n   \n\n- 22 -\n\n \nmore than five times, many resulting in serious injuries.  The following 12 individuals suffered a \ntotal of 108 documented falls during this period; in each case, staff response was so cursory or \ndelayed, it amounted to a deliberate indifference to their needs for care and resulted in \nunnecessary pain.  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (concluding that deliberate \nindifference to medical needs constitutes an unnecessary infliction of pain (citing Gregg v. \nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976) (joint opinion))).  \n \n\t   A.E. fell six times between January and September 2009.  Following one fall, \nMaple Lawn staff described A.E.’s left hand as “purple.”  Over the next five days, \nA.E. fell twice more.  Staff noted her falls, but provided her with no medical care.  \nAfter complaining of pain in her right leg and being unable to bear weight, it was \ndiscovered that A.E. had fractured her left wrist and right foot. \n \n\t   A.F. had seven falls and three injuries over three months, including from tripping \nover another individual, and walking with closed eyes.  Staff did not change the \ncare provided to A.F. after any of the seven events. \n \n\t   A.G. fell nine times over a six month period, with no record of follow-up or care. \n \n\t   A.H. fell, first, from a sitting position, and later, after attempting to stand.  There \nis no indication that staff changed his mobility protocol as a result.  \n \n\t   A.G. had 22 falls in six months, including eight in one month, yet there is no \ndocumented follow-up or care. \n \n\t   A.I. had 13 falls while walking in socks, trying to sit, or trying to “fly,” and in no \ncase did staff note preventive intervention.  \n \n\t   N.N. had 11 falls in 12 weeks, where staff failed to take measures to prevent \nadditional falls. \n \n\t   I.I. had ten falls over four months, yet again, there is no documented response of a \nchange in his care plan to prevent further harm. \n \n\t   A.J. had had nine falls, with no appropriate staff intervention or follow-up  \ndocumented.  \n \n\t   A.K. had six falls, with no appropriate staff intervention or follow-up \ndocumented. \n \n\t   A.L. had six falls in 90 days, with no appropriate staff intervention or follow-up \ndocumented. \n \n   A.M. had five falls, with no appropriate staff intervention or follow-up \ndocumented.  \n   \n\n- 23 -\n\n \n  By failing to take action to prevent falls when falls risks are not just known but obvious, \nMaple Lawn acted with deliberate indifference to individuals’ needs.  See, e.g., Snow v. City of \nCitonelle, et al., 420 F.3d 1262, 1270 (11th Cir. 2005) (finding sufficient evidence of deliberate \nindifference where custodian failed to act in response to known risk of serious harm). \n \n  2.  Risk of Preventable Injury \n \n  Individuals at Maple Lawn also suffer from harm from fractures, bruises, and skin tears.  \nIn many of these situations, staff creates a danger by failing to provide adequate nursing \nassistance and supervision. Further, Maple Lawn  creates a serious risk of harm from hazardous \nenvironmental conditions.  For example, Maple Lawn nursing and facility staff exposed people \nin the facility to harmful, and even potentially fatal, toxins on at least four occasions during our \nreview. Facility staff left the cleaning utility room unlocked and unobserved, even though staff \nleft a large bucket containing cleaning solution on the counter.  Staff left the storage room  \nunlocked, where cabinets contained hazardous solutions.  \n \n  Maple Lawn also fails to investigate unknown injuries, even when they continue.  In a \nparticularly disturbing example, U.U., discussed above, had a number of unexplained injuries \nthat Maple Lawn staff failed to investigate.  Staff discovered U.U. with a large bruise under her \nright eye. Within days of that discovery, U.U.’s nurse found both of her eyes “blackened,” and \nU.U. crying and “very tearful.” Thereafter, staff regularly found skin breaches and “muscle \nknots” on U.U.’s back, and she was crying almost daily.  U.U.’s charts also showed that blood \nwas seeping from her right ear canal.  U.U. slowed, and then stopped eating altogether, and soon \ndied. Maple Lawn’s failure to investigate these injuries likely contributed to their continuation. \n \n  3.  Risk of Harm Created by Improper Drug Storage and Inadequate Care  \n \n  Maple Lawn also creates a serious risk of harm by failing to properly monitor and secure \ndangerous drugs. Maple Lawn has no system to safely monitor, store, and control dangerous \ndrugs. For example, nurses neither count nor record the number of Demerol or Morphine Sulfate \non their units. Both Demerol and Morphine Sulfate are highly addictive and severely restricted \nnarcotics. We also learned that nurses pre-sign blank or partially completed control sheets, which \ndeviates so substantially from accepted professional standard of having two nurses count and \nsign a control log together that it evidence a deliberate indifference to care.  Maple Lawn’s \nfailure to track controlled medications increases the likelihood for medication to become lost, \nmisappropriated, or misused. \n \n  Maple Lawn also creates a serious risk of harm to its individuals from inadequate \nrepositioning and continence care, which increases an individual’s risk of harm from pressure \nsores and infections. Maple Lawn’s own nurses and nursing assistants report that weekend unit \nstaffing is particularly inadequate.  As a direct result, staff do not deliver incontinence care, and \nindividuals sit in feces and urine for long periods of time. Aides do not routinely turn or \nreposition individuals as required.  These lapses deprive individuals of their constitutional right \nto adequate care. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315. \n \n   \n\n- 24 -\n\n \n  4.  Inadequate Nursing Policies  \n \n  Maple Lawn creates a serious risk of harm because it had no nursing services policy and \nprocedure manual. When our nursing consultant requested Maple Lawn’s manual, the Director \nof Nursing (“DON”) provided internet print-outs of policies that staff had included in generic \nguidelines written by Maple Lawn within the past day.  Maple Lawn’s Assistant Director of \nNursing (“ADON”) assembled a smaller, unit-based policy and procedure manual that contained \nsome of the same policies as the DON’s manual but that also had completely different policies.  \nMaple Lawn’s manual was inadequate in both scope and implementation.  For example, it failed \nto address infection control.  It contained procedures on hand washing, but no isolation \nprocedures to prevent the spread of highly infectious contagious infections, though they have \nbeen found at Maple Lawn.  Finally, because the policies did not consistently reflect \nimplementation or review dates, the nursing staff was unable to determine which policies were \ncurrent. \n \n  All of these failures to provide basic care are resulting in serious injuries and violating \nthe constitutional rights of the individuals at Maple Lawn. \n \nV. MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES  \n \n  To remedy the deficiencies discussed above, and protect the constitutional and statutory \nrights of individuals at Maple Lawn and those at risk of being institutionalized at Maple Lawn, \nthe County should promptly implement the minimum remedial measures set forth below. \n \nA.  MOST INTEGRATED SETTING    \n \n  In order to remedy its failure to serve its individuals in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs, consistent with the mandate of Title II of the ADA and its \nimplementing regulation, it is essential for Maple Lawn to provide transition, discharge, and \ncommunity placement services to ensure that all individuals residing at Maple Lawn are served \nin the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  \n \n  Maple Lawn should have an admissions process in place that examines whether \nindividuals could be served in more integrated settings and that provides individuals information \nabout alternatives to nursing home care.  As part of this process, and in order to ensure that \npersons with mental or developmental disabilities are not inappropriately placed in a nursing \nfacility, Maple Lawn should adequately complete PASRR screenings, including regular \nindividual reviews, to examine whether the individual could be served in a more integrated \nsetting. \n \n  Maple Lawn should also have in place a discharge planning process that ensures that \nindividuals who could be served in more integrated settings are identified and that appropriate \nplans are developed and implemented.  Maple Lawn should actively pursue, from the time of \nadmission, the appropriate discharge of individuals residing at Maple Lawn and provide them  \nwith adequate and appropriate supports and services consistent with each person’s individualized  \n   \n\n- 25 -\n\n \nneeds, in the most integrated setting in which they can be reasonably accommodated, and where \nthe individual does not object. Maple Lawn should assume that every admission is temporary \nuntil there is overwhelming medical and psychosocial evidence that the placement is going to be \nfor a long period of time.  It must clearly understand individuals’ desires concerning where they \nwould ultimately like to reside after their stay in the facility.  While it is important to recognize \nand document the need for the current level of care, there also needs to be an ongoing \nconversation about what the individual’s plan is for the future. \n \n  During the treatment planning process and in implementing individual treatment plans, \nMaple Lawn should ensure, for all individuals, that barriers to discharge are identified and \naddressed, and for individuals with a history of re-admission, that factors that led to re-admission \nare analyzed and addressed.  Discharge planning should begin upon admission and should be an \non-going process for all individuals, not only for individuals Maple Lawn’s staff have deemed \nimminently ready for discharge.  Treatment plans should set forth in reasonable detail a written \ntransition plan specifying the particular supports and services that each individual will or may \nneed in order to safely and successfully transition to and live in the community.  The plan should \ninclude, at a minimum:  the individual’s and families’ preferences for care; a discussion of how \nthe individual and family will access and pay for such services; the names and positions of those \nresponsible for the individual’s care, making appropriate referrals when necessary; a plan on how \nto coordinate care among multiple caregivers, if applicable; identification of the individual’s \nspecific needs after discharge; a discussion of how the individual and family need to prepare for \ndischarge; and corresponding time frames for completion of needed steps to effect transition.  In \norder to Maple Lawn staff to be able to develop and implement adequate discharge plans, they \nshould become knowledgeable with the range of community-based services available to \nindividuals being discharged from Maple Lawn, including the Aged and Disabled Waiver, \nIndependent Living Waiver, Consumer Directed Services program, and Advanced Personal Care. \n \n  In order to support individuals in making an informed choice regarding discharge, Maple \nLawn should ensure the participation in all aspects of care, treatment and discharge planning by \nthe individual, his or her guardian, family, and friends, as appropriate, and staff who know the \nindividual best. Staff should provide information and counseling to individuals, their guardians, \nand/or families regarding community supports and services that could support the individual’s \ndischarge to a more integrated setting, and information about the transition process.  Further, \nstaff should provide counseling and information to address any objections from individuals to \nbeing discharged to a more integrated setting, and document those efforts.  If an individual \nopposes placement, Maple Lawn should document the steps taken to ensure that any individual \nobjection is an informed one. \n \n  Finally, in order to ensure continuity of care upon discharge, Maple Lawn should require \ncontact with identified community providers prior to discharge, and develop and implement a \nsystem to follow up with individuals after discharge to identify gaps in care and address \nproactively any such gaps to reduce the risk of re-admission.  Maple Lawn should also create, \nrevise, and implement a quality assurance or utilization review process to oversee the discharge \nprocess. The quality assurance process should include, at a minimum:  developing a system to \nreview the quality and effectiveness of discharge plans; developing a system to track discharged  \n   \n\n- 26 -\n\n \nindividuals to determine if they receive care in the community as set forth in their discharge plan; \nand identifying and assessing gaps in community services identified through the tracking of  \ndischarge outcomes. \n \nB.  HEALTHCARE SERVICES \n \n  Medical Care  \n \n  In order to provide adequate medical care, Maple Lawn should develop and implement \ncomprehensive care plans for each individual that specifically address her or his needs. 42 \nC.F.R. § 483.20. Each care plan should include: an initial assessment; nursing diagnosis; care \nplanning; interdisciplinary intervention; and an evaluation.  The initial assessment is arguably the \nmost important step in developing adequate and appropriate care plans.  Care plans should be \ncomprehensive and focused to address specific needs. \n \n  Maple Lawn should implement procedures to ensure that nursing staff timely recognize \nand identify problems and needs.  Nursing staff should then devise care plans, evaluate the plans \nfor effectiveness, and update and change the plans when goals and outcomes are not achieved.  \nMaple Lawn should ensure that interdisciplinary teams consisting of nursing, dietary, social \nservices, activities, and rehabilitation staff are established to ensure that all care plans have \nmeasureable outcomes, have time-limited goals, and reflect changes in an individual’s condition.  \nGenerally accepted professional standards require Maple Lawn to provide individuals necessary \ncare and services to attain or maintain highest practical physical, mental, and psychological well-\nbeing. 42 C.F.R. § 483.25. \n \n  Nutrition and Hydration Care  \n \n  In order to provide adequate food and basic care, and meet generally accepted \nprofessional standards, Maple Lawn should implement procedures that ensure that individuals \nreceive adequate nutrition, including sufficient fluids, to maintain their health and well-being.  \nSee 42 CFR§ 483.25(i-j). All individuals should be assessed and care plans should be devised \nwith measureable and time-limited goals.  Each assessment should track and calculate calories, \nproteins, carbohydrates, and specific nutrition and hydration needs. Individuals should be \nweighed on admission and readmission weekly for four weeks, then monthly unless there is a \nchange in an individual’s condition.  Any individual who loses five percent of total body weight \nin one month or 10 percent in six months should be re-evaluated and nursing staff shall contact \nthe attending physician. \n \n  Nursing staff, along with assistance from restorative staff, should conduct daily \nmonitoring of each individual's food and fluid intake.  Nursing staff should be responsible for \nensuring that each individual’s daily food and fluid intake is documented and maintained in each \nindividual’s medical record. \n \n  Finally, Maple Lawn should ensure that the facility’s dietitian oversees nutrition and \nhydration services. The dietitian should be responsible for educating Maple Lawn staff  \n   \n\n- 27 -\n\n \nregarding nutritional needs and developing clinical guidelines to ensure that nutrition and \nhydration services comport with generally accepted professional standards. \n \n  Psychotropic Medications  \n \n  Maple Lawn should ensure that its psychotropic medication practices comport with \ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Federal law strictly regulates the prescription of \npsychotropic medications for people in nursing homes, and generally accepted professional \nstandards require that they be free from unnecessary antipsychotic medication.  See 42 C.F.R.  \n§ 483.25(l)(1). “Unnecessary medication” is defined by federal law as any medication that is \nexcessive in dose, excessive in duration, without adequate monitoring or indication for use, or \nwithout specific target symptoms.  Id.  \n \n  Maple Lawn should ensure that the use of psychotropic drugs is professionally justified, \ncarefully monitored by physicians and nursing staff, documented by nursing staff, and reviewed, \nas needed, by physicians and nursing staff. Maple Lawn should also ensure that prescribed \nmedications are based on clinical needs and not used in a manner that exposes individuals to \nundue risks to their health and safety. \n \n  Finally, Maple Lawn should document that, prior to using psychotropic medications, \nother less restrictive techniques have systematically been tried and have been demonstrated to be \nineffective.  \n \n  Pressure Sore Treatment and Skin Care  \n   \n  Maple Lawn should develop and implement procedures that ensure that individuals do \nnot develop pressure sores that are clinically avoidable and ensure that existing pressure sores \nreceive necessary treatment and services to promote healing.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.25. Maple \nLawn should ensure that staff conduct risk assessments for skin breakdown for all individuals at \nleast quarterly. Maple Lawn should also ensure that staff develop and follow an individualized \nplan of care for each individual at risk for skin breakdown and for each individual with existing \npressure sores. \n \n  Maple Lawn should develop and implement procedures that ensure that individuals with \npressure sores are appropriately positioned, turned and repositioned, and monitored on a daily \nbasis. Maple Lawn staff should ensure that physicians are notified within 24 hours of signs of \nnew skin breakdown or deterioration of existing pressure sores.  Finally, Maple Lawn should \ndevelop and implement a protocol to track all individuals with  pressure sores, all outstanding \nphysician orders regarding pressure sores, and all recommended pressure sore treatments. \n \n  Pain Management and End-of-Life Care  \n \n  Maple Lawn should develop and implement procedures that ensure that its pain \nmanagement and end-of-life care practices comport with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care. Federal regulations and generally accepted professional standards require  \n   \n\n- 28 -\n\n \nnursing homes to assess individuals for pain as part of the comprehensive care planning process.  \n42 C.F.R. § 483.20(d). Maple Lawn should ensure that nursing staff are conducting pain \nassessments, implementing appropriate interventions, and monitoring individual pain to ensure \nthat medications are administered as needed.  Maple Lawn should also ensure that changes in \neach individual’s condition are documented and placed in the comprehensive care plan.  Finally, \nMaple Lawn should ensure that physicians review medication usage and analyze pain data \nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.  \n \nC.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \n \n  Investigation Process  \n \nIn order to identify threats to safety and care, Maple Lawn should conduct thorough \ninvestigations of individual incidents. 42 C.F.R. § 483.13(B)(3); Grace Healthcare v. United \nStates HHS, 589 F.3d 926, 927 (8th Cir. 2009). Maple Lawn should thoroughly investigate \nincidents, and promptly report the results of investigations to the facility's administrator and to \nother officials in accordance with state law within 5 working days of [an] incident.”  Grace, 589 \nF.3d at 930 n.6. Specifically, Maple Lawn investigators should visit the scene of an alleged \nincident, collect physical evidence, and obtain witness accounts.  Investigators should also \nidentify, preserve, and record evidence, and then conduct a reasoned analysis of all evidence \nreceived. In addition, Maple Lawn investigators should issue a report of their findings, detailing:  \n(1) interviews conducted; (2) evidence considered; (3) staff compliance with care guidelines and \nfacility policies; (4) the basis for each conclusion; and (5) recommended corrective measures.  \nThe facility should promulgate policies or procedures addressing basic investigative principles \nsuch as collecting biological, video, or other physical evidence; conducting sensitive staff and \nindividual interviews; and navigating the difficult inquiry into possible peer misconduct. \n \n  Maple Lawn should investigate all serious injuries, deaths, and suspected cases of abuse, \nneglect, and maltreatment.  42 C.F.R. 483.13(B)(3). See also 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g)(4)(A) (“Each \nstate shall maintain procedures … to investigate of violations of requirements by nursing \nfacilities.”).  Maple Lawn may not limit its investigations to a single category of injury falls.  \nInvestigators should evaluate possible cases of abuse, neglect, or inadequate care following a \nquestionable individual death, or when an incident resulted in severe individual injury.  Maple \nLawn should investigate, for example, injuries from staff, self-injurious behaviors, supervisory \nneglect, treatment neglect, or failure train and supervise care staff. \n \n  Lastly, Maple Lawn should use trained investigators to conduct its investigations.  Maple \nLawn tasked two staff persons with conducting incident investigations, yet neither has had any \ninvestigative training. \n \nFall Prevention Program and Practices  \n \n  In order to minimize harm from preventable falls, Maple Lawn should actively ensure \nthat each individual receives adequate assistance to prevent accidents and falls.  See generally 42 \nC.F.R. § 483.25(h).  First, Maple Lawn should assess physical functioning and structural  \n   \n\n- 29 -\n\n \nproblems at least annually.  Thereafter, Maple Lawn staff should assess fall risks within 14 \ncalendar days after staff have determined, or should have determined, a change in an individual’s \ncondition likely to go unresolved without intervention.  42 C.F.R. § 483.20(b)(1)(viii), (b)(2)(ii)-\n(iii). Staff should consider the circumstances leading to falls.  For many individuals with a high \nfall risk, staff should do more than a generic assessment, and should adjust intervention plans to \ndecrease their likelihood of falling. \n \n  Next, within seven days of completing the comprehensive assessment, Maple Lawn \nshould develop a comprehensive care plan with measurable objectives and timetables for \nmedical, nursing, and mental health needs.  42 C.F.R. 483.20(k).  The plan should be developed \nby an “interdisciplinary team that includes the attending physician, a registered nurse with \nresponsibility for the individual, and other appropriate staff in disciplines as determined by the \nindividual's needs.”  42 C.F.R. 483.20(k)(2)(ii).  Lastly, Maple Lawn should also maintain all \nassessments completed within the past 15 months of active treatment and use the results to revise  \nindividuals’ plan of care.  42 C.F.R. 483.20(d). \n \n  Maple Lawn’s physicians should monitor drugs used during treatment for their likelihood \nto increase risk to fall, and review the drug regime of any at-risk individual who ultimately falls.  \nSee 42 C.F.R. § 483.40(b)(1) (noting that physicians should review medications when assessing \ncare programs).  Maple Lawn should ensure that such assessments occur at each visit, which \nshould take place, at a minimum, once every 30 days for the first 90 days after an individual’s \nadmission, and once every 60 days thereafter.  42 C.F.R. § 483.40(c)(1). Physicians should \nproperly monitor and chart drug side effects, especially when using medication known to \ncontribute to falls. In addition, physicians should review drug regimens and eliminate drugs to \ndecrease fall risks.  \n \n  Finally, Maple Lawn’s pharmacist should advise care teams about any medications in an \nindividual’s regimen that increase the likelihood of a fall.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.60 (“The \npharmacist should report any irregularities to the attending physician and the director of nursing, \nand these reports should be acted upon.”).  Maple Lawn has pharmacists on staff, and physicians \nshould incorporate pharmacists’ recommendations where medically indicated to eliminate or \nreduce drugs and drug combinations specifically for their potential to contribute to falls.  \n \nQuality Assurance Program  \n \n  In order to identify and reduce sources of recurrent harm, Maple Lawn should implement \na quality assurance program to:  (1) make certain its senior staff respond appropriately to issues \nplacing individuals at risk; (2) provide its nursing staff with clear policies and procedures that \ndefine adequate direct care; and (3) share findings and recommendations so its various \ndisciplines can avoid recurrent or potentially harmful incidents.  \n \n  Maple Lawn’s senior clinical administrators should ensure that care is appropriate.   \nMO.  CODE REGS.  ANN. tit. 19, § 30-86.042(42).  Maple Lawn should develop and implement \nwritten policies and procedures preventing mistreatment, neglect, abuse, and misappropriation.  \n42 C.F.R. § 483.13(c). To ensure proper individual care, nursing and facility staff should have  \n   \n\n- 30 -\n\n \nready access to those policies; management should enforce the policies through regular \nsupervision and training; and, staff should be trained on new or revised policies. \n \n  Maple Lawn should also develop and “maintain a quality assessment and assurance \ncommittee, consisting of the director of nursing services, a physician designated by the facility, \nand at least 3 other members of the facility's staff, which (i) meets at least quarterly to identify \nissues with respect to which quality assessment and assurance activities are necessary and  \n(ii) develops and implements appropriate plans of action to correct identified quality \ndeficiencies.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. § 483.75(o).  This does not exist at Maple \nLawn. Instead, Maple Lawn had a number of “stand alone” review teams, comprised primarily \nof its Quality Assurance, Fall Prevention, Weight, and Safety Committees.  Each team narrowly \nand independently considers the staff, individual, or environmental events relevant to its focus; \nnothing suggested that individual disciplines either formally or informally shared data, evidence, \nfindings, recommendations, or even their basic understanding of the events themselves.  Maple \nLawn should employ a collaborative, interdisciplinary analysis to prevent harm or recurrence at \nany level, thus mitigating risk of individual harm.  Finally, Maple Lawn should “ensure that all \nallegations of abuse or neglect are reported to the facility's administrator and to other officials in \naccordance with state law.”  Grace, 589 F.3d at 930 n.6. \n \nRisk Management Practices  \n \nIn order to reduce harm from inadequate staffing, substandard care, hazardous \nenvironmental conditions, and dangerous narcotics control practices, Maple Lawn should \nestablish a comprehensive risk management system. \n \n  Maple Lawn should provide a sufficient number of qualified nurses to meet the total \nnursing care needs within the facility twenty-four hours per day, seven days a week.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.30(a)(1). In keeping with State law, Maple Lawn’s staffing pattern should be “one (1) \nstaff person for every fifteen (15) individuals or major fraction of fifteen (15) during the day \nshift, one (1) person for every fifteen (15) residents or major fraction of fifteen (15) during the \nevening shift, and one (1) person for every twenty (20) residents or major fraction of twenty (20) \nduring the night shift.” MO.  CODE REGS.  ANN. tit. 19, § 30-86.045 (4)(A) (2009).  There shall be \na licensed nurse employed by the facility to work at least eight (8) hours per week at the facility \nfor every thirty (30) residents” or fraction thereof. Id. at § 30-86.047 (61)(E). \n \nMaple Lawn should ensure that its nurses, aides, technicians, and care staff are able to \nfunction at the level required by the State. 42 C.F.R. § 483.75(g)(2). Maple Lawn should \ndiscontinue its current practice of hiring staff and failing to provide ongoing training and \nsupervision for nurses and aides. \n \n  Maple Lawn should provide a safe environment, with appropriate services to maintain a \nsanitary and orderly interior. 42 C.F.R. 483.15(h). Its rooms should be designed and equipped \nsuch that safety is provided for at all times.  MO.  CODE REGS.  ANN. tit. 19, § 30-86.032(22). In \naddition, generally accepted professional standards require Maple Lawn staff to take affirmative, \nstrategic efforts to protect individuals from environmental harm.  Maple Lawn staff \n   \n\n- 31 -\n\n \nshould evaluate hazards, implement interventions, monitor effectiveness, and make needed \nmodifications to minimize preventable risk. See generally 42 C.F.R. § 483.25(h)(1) (“The \nfacility should ensure that the resident environment remain free of accident hazards as is \npossible.”). \n \n  Finally, Federal and State laws require Maple Lawn care staff to tightly control narcotics \nthrough facility oversight and management.  See MO.  CODE REGS.  ANN. tit. 19, \n§ 30-86.047(41)(A)-(B) (“All medication . . . shall be kept in a secured location behind at least \none (1) locked door or cabinet. ... Schedule II controlled substances shall be stored in locked \ncompartments separate from non-controlled medications”); 42 C.F.R. § 483.60(e) (requiring that \nfacilities store general in locked, access controlled compartments, and Schedule II substances in \nseparate, locked, permanently affixed compartments).   A Maple Lawn pharmacist or registered \nnurse should review the controlled substance record keeping quarterly, including reconciling the \ninventories of controlled substances. MO.  CODE  REGS.

By  rule,  a  case  may  be  dismissed without  a  court  order  upon  the  filing  of “a \nstipulation  of dismissal  signed by  all  parties  who  have  appeared.”  Fed.R.Civ.P.  41 (a)(1). \n  \nThe  two  parties  who  have  appeared  in  this  case  are  Plaintiff,  the United  States  of \nAmerica,  and Defendant the  Marion  County Nursing  Home  District  d/b/a  Maple  Lawn | \nNursing Home  (“Maple  Lawn”).  Counsel  for  both parties  have  electronically  signed  this \n  \nStipulation. \n2.  In general,  the  case  involves  allegations  by  the  United  States  Department  of \nJustice  that  Defendant,  a  long-term  care  facility  organized  as  a nursing  home  district, \nviolated  federal  statutes  and  the  United  States  Constitution. \nJEF-275828-1\n3,  This  case  commenced  on March  14,  2013,  with the  filing  of a  Complaint, \nJoint Motion  for  Unopposed  Entry  of Settlement Agreement,  and Memorandum  in    \nSupport  of ] oint  Motion  for Unopposed Entry  of Settlement Agreement. \n4,  On March  22,  2013,  this  Court  issued  its  Order  Entering  Settlement \nAgreement  as  an  Order  of the  Court,  and retaining jurisdiction  over  the  case. \n5.  Pursuant to  the  Settlement Agreement,  Barbara A.  Primm,  BSN,  BSeD, \nRN-BC,  LNBA,  is  serving  as  the  Monitor regarding  compliance  with  the  Settlement \n/  Agreement.
