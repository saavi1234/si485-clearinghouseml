    "summary": "<p>Plaintiff, a man with cerebral palsy, filed this class-action lawsuit against the Department of Public Welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (DPW) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 27, 2013. As a person with a physical disability, plaintiff was eligible for in-home services under the State's Act 150 Program, a program aimed at allowing individuals with disabilities to live as independently as possible in their communities. However, plaintiff alleged that because the Program had at least a two-year-long waiting list, he was unable to receive services and was therefore forced to reside in a nursing home. Plaintiff claimed that defendants' failure to provide him and other similarly-situated persons with in-home care services resulted in unnecessary institutionalization in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Represented by the Disability Rights Network of PA and the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia, plaintiff sought class certification and declaratory and injunctive relief.</p><p>On October 3, 2013, plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction which, if granted, would require defendants to provide him with appropriate community-based attendant care services and allow him to leave the nursing home where he had resided for over two years. </p><p>On October 9, an Amended Complaint was filed to include a second named plaintiff. The second plaintiff, Ms. Smith, a woman with multiple sclerosis, was also on the waiting list for Act 150 services and, while she was able to remain in her own home under the care of her teenage daughter, anticipated being forced to move into a nursing home once her daughter left for college unless she received in-home care. On October 24, the original plaintiff removed himself as a party and the case continued with one named plaintiff, Ms. Smith.</p><p>On October 30, plaintiff moved to certify a class defined as \"all Pennsylvanians who are or will be placed on the waiting list for the Act 150 Program.\"</p><p>The parties began discovery in November of 2013. Both plaintiffs and defendants filed motions for summary judgment on April 11 and May 9, 2014, respectively. DPW argued that any change in the way it provided its services would constitute a fundamental alteration its state programs and would impermissibly interfere with its discretion to administer Medicaid services. </p><p>Before any motions were decided, on June 12, the U.S. Department of Justice submitted a statement of interest. The DOJ asserted that because the ADA requires states to avoid unnecessary institutionalization, including where a reasonable accommodation is available to avoid said institutionalization, if the court found that a plausible accommodation was available that would allow plaintiffs to avoid living in a segregated setting, DPW would have the burden of showing that providing that accommodation would constitute a fundamental alteration of its programming. The DOJ also pointed out that several other courts had found that changing the location of services provided from an institutional setting to a community setting was not in itself a fundamental alteration.</p><p>After several months of conferring, the parties submitted a voluntary stipulation of dismissal on June 11, 2015. While it is probable that the parties reached a private settlement agreement, no information on any agreement is available. The case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n1.  Joseph Gleason is a 52-year-old man who has cerebral palsy \nand has been forced to reside in a nursing facility for more than two years.  \nHe has rented an apartment and wants to live independently in the \ncommunity but requires attendant care services to assist him with some of \nhis activities of daily living, such as transferring to and from bed and his \nwheelchair, showering, dressing and cooking. \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 2 of 19\n2.  Defendants administer a program, known as the “Act 150 \nProgram,” to provide community-based attendant care services to \nindividuals with significant physical disabilities.  \n3.  Eligibility for the Act 150 Program is based solely on whether an \nindividual needs attendant care services and is able to direct those \nservices.  There are no income or asset limits for eligibility, but Act 150 \nProgram participants whose income exceeds 300% of the federal poverty \nlevel pay a weekly fee toward the cost of the services based on the amount \nof his or her income.  \n4.  Plaintiff Gleason is eligible for the Act 150 Program, but it has a \nwaiting list of 316 people, which has remained constant for two years.   \n5.  Since Mr. Gleason cannot receive services under the Act 150 \nProgram, he is forced to remain segregated in a nursing facility where he is \nprovided with attendant care services. \n6.  Defendants pay more than $8,000 monthly for Mr. Gleason’s \nnursing facility services through the Medical Assistance program, which on \ninformation and belief is more than they would pay if they funded \ncommunity-based attendant care services for him through the Act 150 \nProgram. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 3 of 19\n7.  Mr. Gleason is not alone.  Defendants only offer Pennsyl-\nvanians on the waiting list for the Act 150 Program attendant care services \nin segregated nursing facilities, not in the community which is the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.  This results in their \nunnecessary institutionalization or places them at serious risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization.   \n8.  Defendants’ failure to assure that Mr. Gleason and others \nsimilarly situated can access community-based attendant care services \nthrough the Act 150 Program violates the integration mandates of Title II of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29 U.S.C. §794. \n9.  Plaintiff Gleason seeks declaratory and injunctive relief which \nwill allow him and others similarly situated to reside in the community and \nnot be subject to unnecessary institutionalization.   \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  The Court has jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343(a)(3) and (4).   \n11.  Plaintiff’s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are \nauthorized under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  Plaintiff’s \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 4 of 19\ncauses of action for disability discrimination are authorized by 42 U.S.C. § \n12133 and 29 U.S.C. § 794a.   \n12.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  Defendant has \noffices located in this district, and Defendants’ actions in denying Plaintiff’s \nrequest for attendant care services took place in this district.  \nIII.  PARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff Joseph Gleason is a 52-year-old man who resides in \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania.   \n14.  Defendant Department of Public Welfare (DPW) is the single-\nstate agency that administers the Medical Assistance Program in Pennsyl-\nvania, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5) and 55 Pa. Code § 101.1(e), which includes \nfunding for nursing facilities, and has responsibility to establish and \nimplement the Act 150 Program, 62 Pa.C.S. § 3054(a).  DPW also has \nresponsibility to assure that its programs, including the Medical Assistance \nProgram and Act 150 Program, are administered in accordance with \nfederal law, including the ADA and RA. \n15.  Defendant Beverly Mackereth is Secretary of Public Welfare of \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Defendant Mackereth is responsible \nto oversee and administer DPW and its programs, including Medical \nAssistance and the Act 150 Programs, and to assure that they comply with \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 5 of 19\nfederal law.  Defendant Mackereth is sued in her official capacity only for \nactions and omissions under color of state law.  \nIV.  CLASS ACTION  \n16.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), the named Plaintiff \nbrings this action on behalf of himself and the following class of persons:    \nAll Pennsylvanians who are or will be placed on the waiting list for the Act \n150 Program. \n17.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is \nimpracticable.  There are approximately 316 people who are on the Act 150 \nProgram waiting list.  Based on information and belief, many of these \npeople either are institutionalized because or are at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization because they cannot access community-based attendant \ncare services. Joinder is also impracticable because class members lack \nthe knowledge and financial means to maintain individual actions.  \n18.  There are questions of law or fact that are common to the \nnamed Plaintiff and putative class members, including whether:  (a) \nDefendants violate the ADA and RA by offering attendant care services to \nthem only in segregated, institutional settings rather than the community ; \n(b) Defendants have decreased the number of persons served by the Act \n150 Program despite a waiting list; (c) Defendants have refused to request \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 6 of 19\nadditional funding to provide services to individuals on the Act 150 \nProgram’s waiting list or to use available funding to provide services to \nPlaintiff and class members; (d) whether Defendants’ policies and practices \n– including decreasing the number of persons served by the Act 150 \nProgram, maintaining a waiting list for the Act 150 Program, and refusing to \nuse available funding to serve people on the waiting list – result in a lack of \nnecessary community-based attendant care services so that Plaintiff and \nclass members are unnecessarily institutionalized or at serious risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization; (e) whether Defendants fail to provide \nnamed Plaintiff and class members with meaningful choice of community-\nbased long-term care alternatives to nursing facilities; and (f) whether \nDefendants fail to have any plan, with timelines and benchmarks, to move \npeople off of the Act 150 Program waiting list at a reasonable pace. \n19.  Mr. Gleason’s claims are typical of the claims of putative class \nmembers.  Mr. Gleason, like all class members, is eligible for attendant \ncare services in the Act 150 Program and has been placed on a waiting list \nfor those services. \n20.  The named Plaintiff will fairly represent and adequately protect \nthe interests of members of the class as a whole.  The named Plaintiff does \nnot have any interests antagonistic to those of other class members. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 7 of 19\n21.  By filing this action, the named Plaintiff has displayed an \ninterest in vindicating his rights, as well as the claims of others who are \nsimilarly situated.   \n22.  The relief sought by the named Plaintiff will inure to the benefit \nof members of the class generally.   \n23.  The named Plaintiff is represented by counsel who are skilled \nand knowledgeable about civil rights litigation, disability discrimination, \npractice and procedure in the federal courts and the prosecution and \nmanagement of class action litigation.  \n24.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate \nwith respect to the class as a whole under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n25.  Joseph Gleason is a 52-year-old man with cerebral palsy. \n26.  As a result of his disability, Mr. Gleason uses a motorized \nwheelchair for ambulation.  \n27.  After Mr. Gleason graduated from high school, he attended the \nBucks County Community College, from which he received his Associate \nDegree in 1985. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 8 of 19\n28.  From 1987 to 2010, Plaintiff Gleason worked full-time in the \nadmissions office of Bucks County Community College. \n29.  Until 2003, Mr. Gleason lived with in his family home.  After his \nmother died, Mr. Gleason continued to live there with his brother and his \nbrother’s family. \n30.  In 2010, Mr. Gleason, who was then using a manual \nwheelchair, slipped on the snow and fell backwards in his wheelchair, \nresulting in serious injuries to his back. \n31.  Mr. Gleason was hospitalized for several months due to his \nback injuries. \n32.  When Mr. Gleason was ready to leave the hospital in 2011, he \nwas unable to return to live with his brother and his brother’s family \nbecause his physical impairments were too significant for his brother and \nhis family to provide him the care he needed at home.   \n33.  Because Mr. Gleason could not return to his family home and \nhad no access to services to allow him to remain in the community, he was \nforced to enter a nursing facility in 2011, where he remains.   \n34.  Mr. Gleason requires assistance with some activities of daily \nliving, including transferring to and from his bed and his wheelchair, \ndressing, showering, cooking, and some house cleaning.  He can and does \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 9 of 19\nbrush his teeth, comb his hair, eat (but he cannot cut the food), do his \nlaundry, and toileting (but he cannot pull his pants up).  He can also take \nhis own medications and can shop for food. \n35.  If Mr. Gleason had access to attendant care services in the \ncommunity to assist him with his daily living activities, he could live \nindependently and contribute to and participate in society. \n36.  Mr. Gleason wants to move to the community so he can return \nto work, live alone, and be independent of institutional rules and \nprocedures. \n37.  At the nursing facility, Mr. Gleason has no privacy.  There is no \ntoilet in his bedroom and he must use a toilet located in the shower room. \n38.  Mr. Gleason eats alone because he feels like cattle in the \ndining room at the nursing facility. \n39.  At the nursing facility, Mr. Gleason cannot even participate in \n“movie night” because it is scheduled on his shower night. He does not \nwant to forego a shower because the nursing facility provides showers only \ntwice a week.  In his own apartment, Mr. Gleason would like to shower \nevery day. \n40.  Mr. Gleason owns and uses a computer in his room.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 10 of 19\n41.  Defendants’ Medical Assistance Program pays $8,082.72 per \nmonth for the services Mr. Gleason receives in his nursing facility.  In \naddition to that sum, Mr. Gleason also must contribute toward his nursing \nfacility care all but $45 of his $783.90 monthly Social Security Disability \nIncome (SSDI) benefits and $1,558.38 from private insurance.   \n42.  Mr. Gleason uses the $45 per month of the SSDI benefits he is \npermitted to keep to pay for paratransit services so he can leave the \nnursing facility periodically and to buy pizza and other incidentals. \n43.  On December 20, 2012, Mr. Gleason applied to receive \nservices through Medical Assistance-funded Home and Community-based \n(HCBS) Waiver programs administered by DPW’s Office of Long-Term \nLiving (OLTL). \n44.  OLTL’s HCBS Waiver programs include the “Attendant Care \nWaiver,” which provides community-based attendant care services to \nindividuals with physical disabilities, and the “Independence Waiver,” which \nprovides community-based attendant care and other services to individuals \nwith physical disabilities.  To be eligible for these or other HCBS Waiver \nprograms, individuals’ income and resources cannot exceed limits \nestablished by the Medical Assistance Program. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 11 of 19\n45.  With access to HCBS Waiver services, Mr. Gleason could \nmove from the nursing facility to the community. \n46.  After he applied for the HCBS Waiver program, Mr. Gleason \nwas informed by Maximus, the Independent Enrollment Broker with which \nDPW contracts to take and help process applications for HCBS Waiver \nservices, that he was eligible for HCBS Waiver services through \nDefendants’ Independence Waiver that would enable him to receive \ncommunity-based attendant care services.   \n47.  Based on that information, Mr. Gleason located an accessible \napartment in Philadelphia in late July 2013.  He signed a lease to begin on \nAugust 1, 2013 and borrowed money from his brother and sister for a \nsecurity deposit and two months’ rent. \n48.  On September 6, 2013, DPW sent Mr. Gleason a notice that \nstated he was determined to be ineligible for HCBS Waiver services \nbecause his monthly income of $2,342.28 exceeded the $2,130 monthly \nincome limit to qualify for Medical Assistance benefits, including HCBS \nWaivers.   \n49.  Besides the HCBS Waiver programs, DPW’s OLTL administers \nthe Act 150 Program.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 12 of 19\n50.  The Act 150 Program, created by the Attendant Care Services \nAct, 62 Pa.C.S. § 3051 et seq., authorizes DPW to fund attendant care \nservices for eligible individuals to provide them assistance with their \nactivities of daily living and allow them to live independently in their own \nhomes and communities rather than in institutions. \n51.  Unlike Medical Assistance programs, there are no income or \nasset requirements that limit eligibility for the Act 150 Program.  Eligibility \nfor the Act 150 Program is based solely on the applicant’s need for atten-\ndant care services and ability to direct his or her services.  Individuals \nwhose income exceeds 300 percent of the federal poverty level, however, \nare required to contribute toward the cost of their services. \n52.  When DPW denied Mr. Gleason’s application for the Medical \nAssistance HCBS Waiver services, it did not inform him that he could apply \nfor the Act 150 Program to receive community-based attendant care \nservices.   \n53.  Mr. Gleason learned of the Act 150 Program through advocates \nwho helped him to apply for that Program.    \n54.  Although Mr. Gleason has applied for and is eligible to receive \ncommunity-based attendant care services through the Act 150 Program, he \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 13 of 19\nwill not be able to secure those services because there is a waiting list for \nthat program. \n55.  Since, at least, Fiscal Year 2007-08, DPW has decreased the \nnumber of persons who received attendant care services under the Act 150 \nProgram.  In Fiscal Year 2007-08, there were 2,479 budgeted slots \navailable.  In Fiscal Year 2011-12, there were budgeted slots for 2,277 \nindividuals.  In Fiscal Year 2012-13, there were budgeted slots to serve \nonly 2,016 individuals.  \n56.  As the number of budgeted slots for the Act 150 Program has \ndecreased, the waiting list for the Program has grown.  In December 2012, \nthere were 294 individuals on the Act 150 Program waiting list.  There \ncurrently are approximately 316 individuals on that waiting list. \n57.  DPW has stated that there is a two-year waiting list for the Act \n150 Program. \n58.  DPW has stated that it will continue to serve individuals who \ncurrently participate in the Act 150 Program, but will not serve any \nadditional individuals in the current Fiscal Year, 2013-14. \n59.  On information and belief, DPW knows or should know that \nthere are individuals, like Mr. Gleason, on the Act 150 Program waiting list \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 14 of 19\nwho are institutionalized and could live in the community if they had access \nto attendant care services through the Act 150 Program. \n60.  On information and belief, DPW knows or should know that \nthere are individuals on the Act 150 Program waiting list who are at serious \nrisk of institutionalization if they cannot access attendant care services in \nthe community through that program. \n61.  DPW has not sought funding to expand the Act 150 Program \nand, to the contrary, has decreased funding for it despite the waiting list \nand the fact that individuals on that waiting list are unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized or at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n62.  On information and belief, the cost of funding attendant care \nservices through Act 150 to Mr. Gleason and putative class members \nwould be less than the cost to DPW’s Medical Assistance program of \nproviding them with attendant care services in nursing facilities where they \nare unnecessarily segregated. \nVI.  CLAIMS \n \nA.  Count I - Violation of Title II of the ADA \n \n63.  Paragraphs 1 through 62 are incorporated by reference.  This \nCount is brought solely against Defendant Mackereth in her official capacity \nfor acts and omissions under color of state law. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 15 of 19\n64.  Mr. Gleason and putative class members are individuals with \nphysical impairments that substantially limit one or more major life \nactivities, including walking and caring for themselves.  As such, they are \npersons with disabilities protected by the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). \n65.  Mr. Gleason and putative class members are eligible for the Act \n150 Program and, as such, are qualified persons with disabilities under the \nADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n66.  DPW, administered by Defendant Mackereth, is a public entity \nsubject to the requirements of Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  \n67.     Defendant Mackereth violates Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), by failing to offer Mr. Gleason and \nputative class members attendant care services in the community, which is \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, and, instead, offering \nthem such services only in segregated institutions and by either subjecting \nthem to unnecessary institutionalization or placing them at serious risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization. \n68.  Defendant Mackereth violates Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3), by using methods of administration \nthat subject Mr. Gleason and putative class members to discrimination \nthrough actual or serious risk of unnecessary segregation and \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 16 of 19\ninstitutionalization, including, but not limited to:  (a) failing to assess \nwhether persons on the Act 150 Program waiting list are institutionalized or \nat serious risk of institutionalization; (b) failing to use available funding to \nprovide services to Mr. Gleason and putative class members through the \nAct 150 Program ; (c) allowing the Act 150 Program to serve fewer and \nfewer people despite the increasing need for such services; and (d) failing \nto have a plan with specific and concrete benchmarks and timelines within \nwhich DPW will provide Mr. Gleason and putative class members with \ncommunity-based attendant care services through the Act 150 Program. \nB.  Count II - Violation of Section 504 of the RA \n \n69.  Paragraphs 1 through 68 are incorporated by reference.  This \nCount is brought solely against Defendant DPW. \n70.  Mr. Gleason and putative class members are individuals with \nphysical impairments that substantially limit one or more major life \nactivities, including walking and caring for themselves.  As such, they are \npersons with disabilities protected by Section 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § \n705(20)(B). \n71.  Mr. Gleason and putative class members are eligible for the Act \n150 Program and, as such, are qualified persons with disabilities under \nSection 504 of the RA. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 17 of 19\n72.  Defendant DPW is a recipient of Federal financial assistance \nand, as such, is subject to the requirements of Section 504 of the RA.  29 \nU.S.C. § 794(b).  \n73.  Defendant DPW violates Section 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § \n794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d), by failing to offer Mr. Gleason and putative \nclass members attendant care services in the community, which is the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs, and, instead, offering them \nsuch services only in segregated institutions and by either subjecting them \nto unnecessary institutionalization or placing them at serious risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization. \n74.  Defendant DPW violates Section 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § \n794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3), by using methods of administration that \nsubject Mr. Gleason and putative class members to discrimination through \nactual or serious risk of unnecessary segregation and institutionalization, \nincluding, but not limited to:  (a) failing to assess whether persons on the \nAct 150 Program waiting list are institutionalized or at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization; (b) failing to use available funding to provide services to \nMr. Gleason and putative class members through the Act 150 Program; (c) \nallowing the Act 150 Program to serve fewer and fewer people despite the \nincreasing need for such services; and (d) failing to have a plan with \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 1   Filed 09/27/13   Page 18 of 19\nspecific and concrete benchmarks and timelines within which DPW will \nprovide Mr. Gleason and putative class members with community-based \nattendant care services through the Act 150 Program. \nVI.

The Department of \nJustice has authority to enforce Title II and to issue regulations implementing the statute.  \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12133, 12134. This case involves a public entity’s obligation, under the \nADA’s integration regulation, to provide services to individuals with disabilities in the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to their needs and to avoid placing individuals at risk \nof institutionalization.   See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 607 \n(1999).   Therefore, the United States has an interest in ensuring the appropriate and \nconsistent interpretation of Title II and the integration regulation. \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 2 of 17 \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n  The Plaintiff and the putative class (“Plaintiffs”) allege that the Pennsylvania \nDepartment of Public Welfare (“DPW”) unnecessarily places them at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization in nursing facilities by failing to provide them with attendant care \nservices in the community. (Pls.’ 2d Am. Compl. 13-15, ¶¶ 57-62, April 11, 2014, ECF \nNo. 11.)1  DPW has already determined that Plaintiffs are in need of, and eligible for, its \nexisting community-based attendant care program.  (Virginia Brown Dep. 2, 88:13-23, \nMarch 25, 2014, ECF No. 45-7.) Plaintiffs allege that, even though it is less expensive to \nprovide attendant care services in the community, DPW  places them at risk of \ninstitutionalization in nursing facilities by limiting their access to attendant care services  \nin the community. (See Gov.’s Exec. Budget FY2014-2015 7, April 11, 2014, ECF No. \n45-8; Gov.’s Exec. Budget, 46, ECF No. 45-8.)   Plaintiffs request that DPW provide \nthem with community-based attendant care services that DPW already provides to \nindividuals with similar disabilities; and they claim that otherwise, they may suffer from \na serious decline in health that would likely necessitate nursing facility admission.  (Pls.’ \nMot. Summ. J., 36-38, April 11, 2014, ECF No. 45.) \n  DPW denies that it has placed Plaintiffs at serious risk of institutionalization and \nargues that, even if Plaintiffs were at risk, any change it could make to address the \nviolation would fundamentally alter the nature of its attendant care services.  (Defs.’ \nMem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 29-64, May 9, 2014, ECF No. 51-1.)    The United \nStates offers this Statement of Interest as a means of clarifying the applicable law so as to \nassist the Court in deciding the motions before it.   \n                                                           \n1 Throughout this Statement of Interest, the references to page numbers in the \nrecord refer to the ECF page numbers. \n \n2 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 3 of 17 \n \nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS   \n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania offers community-based attendant care \nservices to individuals with physical disabilities who need hands-on assistance with \nactivities of daily living, such as dressing, taking medication, eating, and bathing.  (Decl. \nVirginia Brown 3, ¶¶ 6-12, May 9, 2014, ECF No. 53-1.)  These services are funded one \nof two ways: (1) through the state- and federally-funded Attendant Care Waiver (“the \nWaiver”), which is available to those who are both clinically eligible to receive the \nservices and financially eligible for Medicaid; or (2) through the state-funded Act 150 \nprogram, which is intended for individuals such as Paula Smith, who are clinically \neligible to receive services, but ineligible for Medicaid because their income exceeds \n300% of the Federal Benefit Rate paid for Supplemental Security Income benefits ($2163 \nper month).2  (Decl. Brown 3-4 ¶¶ 10-19, ECF No. 53-1; Anne Henry Dep. 5, 11:7-11, \nApr. 11, 2014, ECF No. 45-3; Def.’s Mem. Law at 10, ECF 51-1.)    \n  Prior to 2009, the Act 150 program served all eligible individuals; however, since \n2009, there has been a waitlist for Act 150 attendant care services, and it has grown to \n283 individuals, seven of whom are currently in nursing facilities.  (Decl. Brown 8 ¶ 44, \nECF No. 53-1; Decl. Henry 4 ¶¶ 16-17, 5 ¶ 22, May 9, 2014, ECF No. 53-2; Defs’ Mem.  \nLaw at 22-23, ECF No. 51-1.) The creation of the Act 150 waitlist coincided with the \nCommonwealth’s reduction of funding for the program, which was approximately $45 \nmillion for fiscal year 2007 to 2008, but now stands at approximately $26 million.  (See  \nPls.’ Stmt. Undisp. Facts Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 30-31, ¶¶ 111-12, April 11, 2014, \n                                                           \n2 Pennsylvania created the Act 150 program under the Attendant Care Services \nAct in 1987. See 62 Pa. Stat. Ann. §§ 3051-3058. \n \n3 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 4 of 17 \n \nECF No. 45-1.) DPW has no plan for transitioning Act 150 applicants off the waitlist.  \n(See Decl. Henry 5 ¶ 20, ECF No. 53-2.) \n            The putative class includes individuals who have been found eligible for Act 150 \nservices, but remain on the waitlist.  (Pls.’ 2d Am. Compl. at 12-13, ECF No. 11.)  One \nindividual who has been waiting for services since 2012 was briefly hospitalized, and she \ninformed DPW that her husband can no longer care for her.  (Act 150 Waitlist 6, April \n11, 2014, ECF No. 45-13.)  A man with quadriplegia who is also waiting for services is \n“in dire need of services,” and DPW noted that he “MUST have additional help at home.”  \n(Act 150 Waitlist 8, ECF No. 45-13) (emphasis in original).  This man also required \nsurgery for skin/pressure wounds, a condition that is commonly associated with \ninsufficient care and assistance. (See Act 150 Waitlist 8, ECF No. 45-13.)  The doctor of \na 55-year-old man on the waitlist indicated that his decreased ambulatory function and \nability to transfer himself put him at risk of hospitalization.  (Act 150 Waitlist 6, ECF No. \n45-13.) \n  DPW has already determined that Plaintiffs are clinically eligible for nursing \nfacility care and for services through the Waiver and Act 150.  (NFCE Clarification 40, \nApril, 4, 2014, ECF No. 45-8; Brown Dep. 2, 88:13-23, ECF No. 45-6.)   DPW’s \nguidance provides the following with respect to individuals who need attendant care \nservices outside of a nursing facility:  \n[A]n individual who only needs personal care services to remain at home \nor in a community setting may be [nursing facility eligible] if, absent those \npersonal care services, the individual’s condition would deteriorate to the \npoint that he or she would be institutionalized in a nursing facility in the \nnear future (that is, a month or less).  \n \n(NFCE Clarification 40, ECF No. 45-8.)   \n \n4 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 5 of 17 \n \n  The cost of serving individuals through the Act 150 program ($27,408 per year) is \nslightly less than the Commonwealth’s cost for serving the same person in a nursing \nfacility through Medicaid ($27,878 per year); and it is half the combined cost to the state \nand federal government.  (Gov.’s Exec. Budget FY2014-2015 7, April 11, 2014, ECF No. \n45-8) (stating that the cost of Act 150 attendant care services is $2284 per month, per \nuser); (Gov.’s Exec. Budget, 46, ECF No. 45-8) (stating that the yearly average cost of \nnursing facility care, including the federal and state shares, is $58,080).3  \n  Individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid because their income exceeds $2163 \nper month may still meet the income criteria for attendant care under Medicaid (either in \na nursing facility or through the Waiver) by using the Commonwealth’s “spend down” \nprocess. 55 Pa. Code §§ 181.1(b), 181.1(f)(7), 181.14(c); Pa. Operations Mem. #13-11­\n01, 2-3, April 11, 2014, ECF No. 45-17. With respect to nursing facility care, the “spend \ndown” process is generally available if the cost of medical care over a six-month period \nexceeds an individual’s income during that time, in which case the person may enter the \nnursing facility and pay most of his or her income to the nursing facility.  55 Pa. Code \n                                                           \n3 The state portion of the nursing facility cost changes yearly based upon the \nfederal share, referred to as Federal Medical Assistance Payment (FMAP).  The \nCommonwealth’s current FMAP is 53.52%, which drops to 51.82% on October 1, 2014.  \nSee Federal Financial Participation In State Assistance Expenditures; Federal Matching \nShares for Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and Aid to Needy Aged, \nBlind, or Disabled Persons for October 1, 2013 Through September 30, 2014, 70 Fed. \nReg. 231, 71422 (Nov. 30, 2012); Federal Financial Participation In State Assistance \nExpenditures; Federal Matching Shares for Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram, and Aid to Needy Aged, Blind, or Disabled Persons for October 1, 2014 \nThrough September 30, 2015, 79 Fed. Reg. 13, 3387 (Jan. 21, 2014).   \nDPW approximates the FMAP at 52%, presumably because the FMAP changes \nduring the Commonwealth’s fiscal year.  (See Defs.’ Mem. Law at 5, ECF No. 51-1.)   \nUsing the Commonwealth’s FMAP rate of 52% and the Governor’s budgetary projection \nfor the total yearly nursing facility cost of $58,080, the state cost to serve each person in a \nnursing facility under Medicaid is $27,878 per year.   \n \n5 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 6 of 17 \n \n§§ 181.1(b), 181.1(f)(7), 181.14(c). The average per person cost for all nursing facilities \nis approximately $4840 per month (that is, $26,040 every six months and $58,080 a \nyear). (Gov.’s Exec. Budget, 46, ECF No. 45-8).  Therefore, on average, individuals will \nonly be eligible to enter a nursing facility and use the “spend down” process if they have \na yearly income lower than approximately $58,080 a year.     \nIII.   LEGAL AUTHORITY AND ANALYSIS \n  A.  Unnecessary Segregation   \n  Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 “to provide a clear and comprehensive \nnational mandate for the elimination of  discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  Congress found that “historically, society has \ntended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some  \nimprovements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities \ncontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2). For \nthose reasons, in Title II of the ADA,  Congress prohibited discrimination by public \nentities against individuals with disabilities, providing that “no qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be \nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n  As directed by Congress, the Attorney General issued regulations implementing \nTitle II. 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a). Central to this case are two regulations, the first of which \narticulates the “integration mandate” of the ADA and provides that “[a] public entity \nshall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 CFR § 35.130(d). \n6 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 7 of 17 \n \nThe “most integrated setting” is “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to \ninteract with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35 app. A \n(2009); cf. Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 333 (3d Cir. 1995) (holding that “the ADA \nand its attendant regulations clearly define unnecessary segregation as a form of illegal \ndiscrimination against the disabled”).  The second regulation provides that public entities \nare required to “make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures” to \navoid unjustified segregation of individuals with disabilities; however, public entities are \nnot required to make such modifications if “the public entity can demonstrate that making \nthe modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or \nactivity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n  B.  Risk of Institutionalization \n \n  Individuals who are at risk of entering  an institution because of a state policy need \nnot wait until they enter the institution in order to assert an ADA integration claim.   \nPashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 322-23 (4th Cir. 2013); M.R. v. Dreyfus, 663 F.3d 1100, \n1118 (9th Cir. 2011), amended by 697 F.3d 706 (9th Cir. 2012); Fisher v. Okla. Health \nCare Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1181-82 (10th Cir. 2003). In Fisher, the Tenth Circuit held \nthat “disabled persons who . . .  stand imperiled with segregation” could bring a claim  \n“under the ADA’s integration regulation without first submitting to institutionalization.”  \nId. at 1182. The court reasoned that “there is nothing in the plain language of the \nregulations that limits protection to persons who are currently institutionalized.”  Id. at \n1181. The court concluded that the integration mandate “would be meaningless if \nplaintiffs were required to segregate themselves by entering an institution before they \ncould challenge an allegedly discriminatory law or policy that threatens to force them \n7 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 8 of 17 \n \ninto segregated isolation.”  Id. Moreover, the plaintiffs in Fisher “face[d] a substantial \nrisk of harm” because they were “at high risk for premature entry” to an institution due to \nthe state policy at issue in the case.  Id. at 1184 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nSerious risk of institutionalization may be established by evidence that the lack of  \nsufficient state-sponsored community-based services will likely cause a decline in a \nplaintiff’s health, safety, or welfare that would lead to her eventual placement in an \ninstitution. M.R.  v.  Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 734 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing, with approval, the \nstatement by the Department of Justice that serious risk of institutionalization is \ndemonstrated when insufficient services cause plaintiffs “to enter an institution \nimmediately, or . . . causes them to decline in health over time and eventually enter an \ninstitution in order to seek necessary care”).4   \n  C.  Reasonable Accommodations \n  The plaintiff’s prima facie burden in articulating a reasonable accommodation is \n“not a heavy one.”  Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 280 (2d Cir. 2003) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals explained in \nHenrietta D., “it is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible \naccommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits,” and that \n                                                           \n4 See also  Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1185 (finding the fact that many of the plaintiffs \nwould remain in their homes “until their health ha[d] deteriorated” and would “eventually \nend up in a nursing home” was sufficient to show the plaintiffs were at risk of \ninstitutionalization); V.L. v. Wagner, 669 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1120 (N.D. Cal. 2009) \n(concluding that plaintiffs may establish a violation of the integration mandate by \nshowing that the denial of services could lead to an eventual “decline in health” that puts \nthem at “risk [of] being placed in a nursing home”); Crabtree  v.  Goetz, No. 3:08-0939, \n2008 WL 5330506, *3-*12 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 19, 2008) (unpublished) (granting a \npreliminary injunction to reinstate plaintiffs’ home health services based on evidence of  \nthe plaintiffs’ deteriorating health and likely placement in nursing facilities); Hiltibran  v.  \nLevy, No. 10-4185, 2010 WL 6825306, *4-*6 (W.D. Mo. Dec. 27, 2010) (unpublished) \n(ordering the state to provide plaintiffs incontinence briefs to prevent their eventual \nplacement in nursing facilities).    \n8 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 9 of 17 \n \n“once the plaintiff has done this, she has made out a prima facie showing that a \nreasonable accommodation is available, and the risk of nonpersuasion falls on the \ndefendant.”5  331 F.3d at 280 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see also  \nFrederick L. v. Dept. of Public Welfare of Commonwealth of Pa., 364 F.3d 487, 492 n.4 \n(3d Cir. 2004) (Frederick L. I) (stating that a plaintiff in an Olmstead action bears the \nburden of articulating a reasonable modification that the state may make in order to \ncomply with the ADA).     \n  DPW has not violated the ADA simply because it has a waitlist for Act 150 \nservices, nor does the ADA require the Commonwealth to provide a certain level of \nbenefits to nursing facility eligible individuals;6 however, as noted above, the ADA does \nrequire public entities to avoid placing individuals at serious risk of unnecessary state-\nsponsored institutionalization.  Frederick L.I, 364 F.3d at 492. Moreover, where \nindividuals are placed at serious risk of such institutionalization and an accommodation is \navailable to prevent such institutionalization, the public entity bears the burden of \nshowing that accommodating those individuals will fundamentally alter its provision of \nservices.  Pa. Prot. and Advocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dept. of Public Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 379 \n(3d Cir. 2005). If this Court determines that Plaintiffs have established that they are at \nrisk of needing state-sponsored nursing facility services and have “suggest[ed] the \n                                                           \n5  See also Duffy v. Velez, No. 09-5539, 2010 WL 503037, at *3 (D.N.J. Feb. 8, \n2010) (unpublished) (holding that a “[p]laintiff need only allege facts showing that an \naccommodation could be made which would allow” him or her to receive integrated \nservices).   \n \n6  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14 (stating, “We do not in this opinion hold that \nthe ADA imposes on the States a standard of care for whatever medical services they \nrender, or that the ADA requires States to provide a certain level of benefits to \nindividuals with disabilities”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n \n9 \n\n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 10 of 17 \n \nexistence of a plausible accommodation,” Henrietta D. 331 F.3d at 280 (for example, by \nmaking a request for attendant care services in the community), DPW must meet its \nburden with respect to whether it can properly assert a fundamental alteration defense.7  \n  Courts have routinely recognized that a request to receive services in the \ncommunity when an individual is entitled to those same services in an institution is a \nreasonable modification and not a fundamental alteration of a state’s program.  For \ninstance, in Townsend v. Quasim, the court stated that Olmstead controls where the issue \ncenters on “what location these services will be provided.  Mr. Townsend simply requests \nthat the services he is already eligible to receive under an existing state program  \n(assistance in dressing, bathing, preparing meals, taking medications, and so on) be \nprovided in the community-based adult home where he lives, rather than the nursing \nhome setting the state requires.”  328 F.3d 511, 517 (9th Cir. 2003).  Similarly, in the pre-\nOlmstead case of Helen L., the Third Circuit Court of Appeals determined that DPW had \nviolated the ADA’s integration mandate by failing to provide state-funded attendant care \nservices for the plaintiff in her own home, rather than in a nursing facility.  46 F.3d at \n337-39. See also  Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 611 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that \n“the integration mandate may well require the State to make reasonable modifications to \nthe form of existing services in order to adapt them to community-integrated settings.”).  \nAccordingly, DPW must provide attendant care services in the community to the same \ngroup of individuals whom the Commonwealth has already determined it would \n                                                           \n7 Contrary to DPW’s argument that Plaintiffs’ other suggested modifications are \nirrelevant because their “allegations . . . center on the Act 150 program” and should \ntherefore be limited to that program (Defs.’ Mem. Law at 55-56, ECF No. 51-1), nothing \nin Olmstead or other case law indicates that states can meet their Olmstead obligations \nonly by providing the services through the very same program  in which an individual is \ncurrently participating, or is on a waiting list to receive services from, or that provided \nthe services to the individual in the past.   \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 11 of 17 \n \notherwise serve through its Medicaid program in nursing facilities, unless it can establish \nthat doing so will cause a fundamental alteration.8      \n    D.  Fundamental Alteration Defense \n \n  DPW argues that any change to its current approach to attendant care services \nwould constitute a fundamental alteration.  For summary judgment purposes, DPW bears \nthe burden of demonstrating such a fundamental alteration based on undisputed facts.  \nSee, e.g., Pa. Prot. and Advocacy, Inc., 402 F.3d at 379-81 (stating that it is error for a \ndistrict court, on summary judgment, “to find a fundamental alteration solely on the basis \nof budgetary constraints”). A public entity can establish a fundamental alteration defense \nif, “in the allocation of available resources, immediate relief would be inequitable, given \nthe responsibility the State has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and \ndiverse population of persons with . . . disabilities.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604.   \n  DPW argues that any accommodations that would require it to change its \nattendant care system would impermissibly interfere with its discretion to administer its \nMedicaid program.  (Defs.’ Mem. Law at 49-50, 55-56, ECF No. 51-1.)  This is legally \nincorrect. A state’s obligations under the ADA are not defined by the scope of the \nfederal-state Medicaid program—Title II of the ADA is an independent legal obligation  \non states to operate programs, services, and activities in ways that do not discriminate on \n                                                           \n8 Contrary to DPW’s assertion that “one could have millions, or even tens-of­\nmillions, of dollars of assets to pay privately for community-based care and still” receive \nattendant care services from the DPW (Defs.’ Mem Law at 11, ECF No. 51-1), the \nCommonwealth’s obligation to provide community-based services does not extend to an \nunlimited group of individuals.  As noted above, the Commonwealth only provides \nnursing facility services to Medicaid-eligible individuals whose income, on average, is \nless than $58,080 a year; and therefore, the Commonwealth’s obligation to provide \nattendant care services is limited to individuals making less than $58,080 per year and  \nwho are at serious risk of institutionalization.  See 55 Pa. Code §§ 181.1(b), 181.1(f)(7), \n181.14(c); (Gov.’s Exec. Budget, 46, ECF No. 45-8); (Pa. Operations Mem. #13-11-01, \n2-3, ECF No. 45-17). \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 12 of 17 \n \nthe basis of disability. Townsend, 328 F.3d at 518, n.1.  Therefore, complying with the \nMedicaid Act does not equate to complying with the ADA; therefore, courts have \nroutinely held that a state may run afoul of the ADA even while carrying out CMS-\napproved state plans, waiver services, and amendments.  See e.g., Radaszewski, 383 F.3d \nat 601 (allowing the plaintiffs’ claims to proceed without regard to federal approval of the \nstate’s Medicaid plan and waiver programs); Crabtree v. Goetz, No. Civ. A. 3:08-0939, \n2008 WL 5330506, at *2, *30-*31, (M.D. Tenn. Dec.19, 2008) (unpublished) (same); \nGrooms v. Maram, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840, 844, 863 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (same). \n  DPW’s assertion that budget constraints prevent it from providing community-\nbased services does not square with the fact that the cost of providing community-based \nattendant care services to Plaintiffs is slightly less than the cost of providing these \nservices in a nursing facility. (See Gov.’s Exec. Budget FY2014-2015 7, ECF No. 45-8; \nGov.’s Exec. Budget, 46, ECF No. 45-8.) In addition, the Third Circuit has held that \n“budgetary constraints alone are insufficient to establish a fundamental alteration \ndefense.” Pa. Prot. and Advocacy, 402 F.3d at 380.  \n  The Third Circuit has also held that public entities may not avail themselves of  \nthe fundamental alteration defense unless they can first demonstrate that they have a \ncomprehensive, effectively working plan to comply with the Olmstead mandate.  Id. at \n381 (holding that the “only sensible reading of the integration mandate consistent with \nthe Court’s Olmstead opinion allows for a fundamental alteration defense only if the \naccused agency has developed and implemented a plan to come into compliance with the \nADA”); Frederick L. v. Dept. of Public Welfare of Pa., 422 F.3d 151, 157 (3d Cir. 2005) \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 13 of 17 \n \n(“Frederick L. II”) (holding that the existence of an Olmstead plan is a “necessary \nelement” of a successful fundamental alteration defense).  \nMore specifically, the Third Circuit requires a public entity to prove that it has \ndeveloped and is implementing an Olmstead plan that demonstrates a specific and \nmeasurable commitment to action by the public entity, including goals, benchmarks, and \ntimeframes for which the entity can be held accountable.9   Frederick L. II, 422 F.3d at \n156-59. The Third Circuit has rejected a public entity’s vague, general assurances and \ngood faith intentions of future community placement, because such assurances may \nchange; and it has further held that past progress in deinstitutionalization alone is \ninsufficient to establish a comprehensive, effectively working Olmstead plan.10   Id.; \nFrederick L. I, 364 F.3d at 499-501; Pa. Prot. and Advocacy, Inc., 402 F.3d at 383-85; \nsee also U.S. Dept. of Justice, Statement of the Department of Justice on the Integration \nMandate of Title II of the ADA and Olmstead v. L.C., http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a \n_olmstead.htm (last updated June 22, 2011) (providing guidance for ADA and Olmstead  \nenforcement).   \n                                                           \n9 In Frederick L. II, the Third Circuit held: \n \n[A] viable integration plan at a bare minimum should specify the \ntime-frame or target date for patient discharge, the approximate \nnumber  of  patients  to  be  discharged  each  time  period,  the \neligibility  for  discharge,  and  a  general  description  of  the  \ncollaboration  required  between  the  local  authorities  and  the \nhousing, transportation, care, and education agencies to effectuate \nintegration into the community.   \n \n422 F.3d at 160. \n \n10 DPW applies the standard articulated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n(Defs.’ Mem. Law at 51-52, ECF No. 51-1), which is less exacting than that of the Third \nCircuit; however, even if it were applicable, the Ninth Circuit still requires that the state \nbe “genuinely and effectively in the process of deinstitutionalizing disabled persons.”  \nArc of Wash. State, Inc. v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, 619-21 (9th Cir. 2005). \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 14 of 17 \n \n  The Commonwealth claims to have an unwritten Olmstead plan to move some  \nindividuals out of institutions and into community-based settings.  (Defs.’ Mem. Law at \n44-47, ECF No. 51-1.) Plaintiffs claim that unwritten plan lacks the specificity required \nby Frederick II. (Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J., 51-53, ECF No. 45.)  However, resolution of this \ndisputed issue is not essential to defeat the Commonwealth’s fundamental alteration \nargument.  Both parties acknowledge that the Commonwealth does not have a plan to \nensure that individuals on the Act 150 waitlist are not placed at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization. (See Decl. Henry 4 ¶ 20, ECF No. 53-2; Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J., 51-53, \nECF No. 45.) That alone is fatal to DPW’s fundamental alteration defense in this case.   \nDPW incorrectly argues that it can avoid liability for placing Plaintiffs at risk of \ninstitutionalization because it has established a comprehensive, effectively working \nOlmstead plan to  move some other individuals out of institutions.  (Defs.’ Mem. Law at \n54, ECF No. 51-1.)  However, a state may not place one group of individuals at serious \nrisk of institutionalization, without any plan to address the alleged violation, solely \nbecause it is working towards remedying unnecessary institutionalization as to another \ngroup of individuals.  See U.S. Dept. of Justice, Statement of the Department of Justice \non the Integration Mandate of Title II of the ADA and Olmstead v. L.C., \nhttp://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm (last updated June 22, 2011) (stating \nthat a public entity’s Olmstead “plan should include commitments for each group of \npersons who are unnecessarily segregated, such as individuals residing in facilities for \nindividuals with developmental disabilities, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and \nboard and care homes, or individuals spending their days in sheltered workshops or \nsegregated day programs”).  Permitting such a result would contradict Olmstead’s \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 15 of 17 \n \nholding that a state must consider the needs of a “large and diverse population” of \nindividuals with disabilities served by the state.  See  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604.   That is, \na public entity cannot rely on its Olmstead plan as part of its defense unless it can prove \nthat its plan comprehensively and effectively addresses the needless segregation of the \ngroup at issue.11     \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n   The United States offers this Statement of Interest as a means of clarifying the \napplicable law in this action so as to assist  the Court in deciding the motions before it.  If \nthe Court so desires, counsel for the United States will be present and prepared to argue \nthe present Statement of Interest at any upcoming hearings regarding the Motion. \n        \n                                                           \n11 DPW also argues that Olmstead plans are only applicable to individuals in \ninstitutions. (See Defs.’ Mem. Law at 53 (stating that “an integration plan is a plan to \nmove people out of institutions and into the community”).)  The purpose of an Olmstead  \nplan is for a state to correct its noncompliance with the ADA, not insulate itself from its \nADA obligations to people who are facing institutionalization.  Further, DPW’s position \nwould effectively push people into institutions in order to benefit from an Olmstead plan, \na result plainly at odds with the ADA.  Cf. Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1182  (the integration \nmandate “would be meaningless if plaintiffs were required to segregate themselves by \nentering an institution before they could challenge an allegedly discriminatory law or \npolicy that threatens to force them into segregated isolation”).  \n \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 59   Filed 06/12/14   Page 16 of 17 \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n          JOCELYN SAMUELS \n          Acting Assistant Attorney General \n          Civil Rights Division \n           \nEVE L.

      "text": "Case 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 37   Filed 03/19/14   Page 1 of 3\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nPAULA SMITH, individually and on behalf  :\nof similarly situated persons, :\nPlaintiff,  :\n: Civil Action No. 2:13-cv-5670-AB\nv. :\n:\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE :\nOF THE COMMONWEALTH OF  :\nPENNSYLVANIA; BEVERLY  :\nMACKERETH,in her official capacity as  :\nSecretary of the Department of Public  :\nWelfare of the Commonwealth of  :\nPennsylvania :\n:\n:\nMOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and this Court’s Preferred Procedure for \nsuch Motions, Defendants Department of Public Welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n(“DPW”) and Beverly Mackereth in her official capacity as Secretary of the Department of \nPublic Welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (collectively with DPW, “Defendants”) \nrespectfully move this Court for an Order granting partial summary judgment.  \nPursuant to this Court’s Preferred Procedure, Defendants state as follows:\n(1)  This  Motion  is  directed  to  Plaintiff’s  burden  to  demonstrate  that  under  the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act – the claims asserted in \nCounts  I and II of Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) – there are reasonable \nmodifications available to DPW in order to accommodate Plaintiff’s demand for state-funded \nservices.  In particular, the Motion challenges Plaintiff’s theory that the Court can require DPW \nto alter its financial eligibility standards for Medicaid when Congress has expressly granted \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 37   Filed 03/19/14   Page 2 of 3\nDPW the discretion to adopt or not adopt the programs in question.  The Motion raises two \nprimary arguments:\n(a) Because Plaintiff’s case focuses exclusively on DPW’s administration of a \nstate-funded program called “Act 150,” possible modifications to the joint federal/state Medicaid \nprogram are irrelevant; and \n(b)  Basic principles of statutory interpretation demonstrate that Congress did \nnot intend the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act to constrain the discretion that Congress granted to \nthe states to adopt or not to adopt the policies in question.  \n(2) There is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis to support the issues identified \nabove.\n(3) Defendants  hereby  request  that  the  Court  enter  partial  summary  judgment \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\nWHEREFORE, for the reasons stated herein, and in the accompanying Memorandum of \nLaw, which is incorporated herein by reference, Defendants request that the Court grant this \nMotion and enter partial summary judgment.  \nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/  Joshua D.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n1.  Plaintiff, Paula Smith, is a 56-year-old woman who has had \nmultiple sclerosis since 2006.  Ms. Smith resides in a fully accessible \napartment with her 17-year-old daughter.  Ms. Smith’s daughter must assist \nher mother with her activities of daily living, including transferring to and \nfrom her bed and her wheelchair, dressing, showering, and grooming. \n2.  Defendants administer a program, known as the “Act 150 \nProgram,” to provide community-based attendant care services to \nindividuals with significant physical disabilities.  \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 2 of 19\n3.  Eligibility for the Act 150 Program is based solely on whether an \nindividual needs attendant care services and is able to direct those \nservices.  There are no income or asset limits for eligibility, but Act 150 \nProgram participants whose income exceeds 300% of the federal poverty \nlevel pay a weekly fee toward the cost of the services based on the amount \nof his or her income.  \n4.  Plaintiff Smith is eligible for the Act 150 Program, but it has a \nwaiting list of 316 people, which has remained relatively constant for two \nyears.   \n5.  Since Ms. Smith cannot receive services under the Act 150 \nProgram, she must depend on her teenage daughter, who wishes to attend \ncollege and live on campus, for assistance with her activities of daily living.  \nWhen her daughter goes to college, Ms. Smith will be forced to enter a \nnursing home. \n6.  Ms. Smith is not alone.  Defendants only offer Pennsylvanians \non the waiting list for the Act 150 Program attendant care services in \nsegregated nursing facilities, not in the community which is the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.  This results in their unneces-\nsary institutionalization or places them at serious risk of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 3 of 19\n7.  Defendants’ failure to assure that Ms. Smith and others \nsimilarly situated can access community-based attendant care services \nthrough the Act 150 Program violates the integration mandates of Title II of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n8.  Plaintiff Smith seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to allow \nher and others similarly situated to reside in the community rather than in \ninstitutions. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  The Court has jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343(a)(3) and (4).   \n10.  Plaintiff’s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are \nauthorized under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  Plaintiff’s \ncauses of action for disability discrimination are authorized by 42 U.S.C. § \n12133 and 29 U.S.C. § 794a.   \n11.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  Defendants have \noffices located in this district, and Defendants’ actions in denying Plaintiff’s \nrequest for attendant care services took place in this district.  \n   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 4 of 19\nIII.  PARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Paula Smith is a 56-year-old woman who resides in \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. \n13.  Defendant Department of Public Welfare (DPW) is the single-\nstate agency that administers the Medical Assistance Program in Pennsyl-\nvania, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5) and 55 Pa. Code § 101.1(e), which includes \nfunding for nursing facilities, and has the responsibility to establish and \nimplement the Act 150 Program, 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3054(a).  DPW also \nhas responsibility to assure that its programs, including the Medical \nAssistance Program and Act 150 Program, are administered in accordance \nwith federal law, including the ADA and RA. \n14.  Defendant Beverly Mackereth is Secretary of Public Welfare of \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Defendant Mackereth is responsible \nto oversee and administer DPW and its programs, including Medical \nAssistance and the Act 150 Program, and to assure that they comply with \nfederal law.  Defendant Mackereth is sued in her official capacity only for \nactions and omissions under color of state law.  \nIV.  CLASS ACTION  \n15.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), Plaintiff Smith \nbrings this action on behalf of herself and the following class of persons:    \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 5 of 19\nAll Pennsylvanians who are or will be placed on the waiting list for the Act \n150 Program. \n16.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is \nimpracticable.  There are approximately 316 people who are on the Act 150 \nProgram waiting list.  Based on information and belief, many of these \npeople either are institutionalized or are at serious risk of institutionalization \nbecause they cannot access community-based attendant care services. \nJoinder is also impracticable because class members lack the knowledge \nand financial means to maintain individual actions.  \n17.  There are questions of law or fact that are common to Ms. \nSmith and putative class members, including whether:  (a) Defendants \nviolate the ADA and RA by offering attendant care services to them only in \nsegregated, institutional settings rather than the community; (b) Defendants \nhave decreased the number of persons served by the Act 150 Program \ndespite a waiting list; (c) Defendants have refused to use available funding \nor to request additional funding to provide services to individuals on the Act \n150 Program’s waiting list or to use available funding to provide services to \nPlaintiff and class members; (d) Defendants’ policies and practices – \nincluding decreasing the number of persons served by the Act 150 \nProgram, maintaining a waiting list for the Act 150 Program, and refusing to \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 6 of 19\nuse available funding or seek additional funding to serve people on the \nwaiting list – result in a lack of necessary community-based attendant care \nservices so that individuals on the waiting list are unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized or at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization; (e) \nDefendants fail to provide Ms. Smith and class members with meaningful \nchoice of community-based long-term care alternatives to nursing facilities; \nand (f) Defendants have no plan, with timelines and benchmarks, to move \npeople off of the Act 150 Program waiting list at a reasonable pace. \n18.  Ms. Smith’s claims are typical of the claims of putative class \nmembers.  Ms. Smith, like all class members, is eligible for attendant care \nservices in the Act 150 Program and has been placed on a waiting list for \nthose services. \n19.  Ms. Smith will fairly represent and adequately protect the \ninterests of members of the class as a whole.  Ms. Smith has no interests \nantagonistic to those of other class members. \n20.  By filing this action, Ms. Smith has displayed an interest in \nvindicating her rights, as well as the claims of others who are similarly \nsituated.   \n21.  The relief sought by Ms. Smith will inure to the benefit of \nmembers of the class generally.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 7 of 19\n22.  Ms. Smith is represented by counsel who are skilled and \nknowledgeable about civil rights litigation, disability discrimination, practice \nand procedure in the federal courts, and the prosecution and management \nof class action litigation.  \n23.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate \nwith respect to the class as a whole under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n24.  Plaintiff, Paula Smith, is a 56-year-old woman with multiple \nsclerosis. \n25.  As a result of her impairment, Ms. Smith uses a motorized \nwheelchair for ambulation.  \n26.  After Ms. Smith graduated from Dobbins High School, she \nreceived an Associate Degree from the Berean Institute. \n27.  Ms. Smith worked for the Navy Quarter Master as a billing clerk \nfor a number of years and then worked for 17 years as a data support clerk \nfor the Philadelphia Water Department until 2006 when her multiple \nsclerosis became too debilitating for her to continue working. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 8 of 19\n28.  Paula Smith is the grandmother of four grandchildren and the \nmother of four daughters, ages 32, 26 (twins) and 17.  Only her youngest \ndaughter, Faith C., currently resides at home. \n29.  In 2006, when she could no longer work due to her disability, \nMs. Smith applied to receive attendant care services through the Attendant \nCare Waiver. \n30.  The Attendant Care Waiver is a Medical Assistance-funded \nHome and Community Based Services Waiver program administered by \nDPW’s Office of Long Term Living (OLTL).  To be eligible for this or other \nHCBS Waiver programs, an individual’s income and resources cannot \nexceed limits established by the Medical Assistance Program. \n31.   Due to her disability, Ms. Smith needs attendant care services \nto provide her assistance with her daily living activities, including \ntransferring to and from her wheelchair and bed, bathing, dressing, meal \npreparation, light housekeeping, laundry, and shopping. \n32.  DPW determined that Ms. Smith met the program and financial \neligibility criteria for the Attendant Care Waiver and began receiving 35 \nhours a week of services in October, 2006 – 26 hours a week for basic \nattendant care services and 9 hours a week for ancillary services, such as \nshopping, laundry, light housekeeping, and changing linens. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 9 of 19\n33.  Sometime in late 2007, Ms. Smith became eligible for Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits and began receiving about \n$1,100 a month in addition to her monthly pension of about $1,200.  Ms. \nSmith’s increased income made her financially ineligible for the Attendant \nCare Waiver and resulted in her termination from that program. \n34.  Besides the HCBS Waiver programs, DPW’s OLTL administers \nthe Act 150 Program. \n35.  The Act 150 Program, created by the Attendant Care Services \nAct, 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 3051 et seq., authorizes DPW to fund \nattendant care services for eligible individuals to provide them assistance \nwith their activities of daily living and allow them to live independently in \ntheir own homes and communities rather than in institutions. \n36.  Unlike Medical Assistance programs, there are no income or \nasset requirements that limit eligibility for the Act 150 Program.  Eligibility \nfor the Act 150 Program is based solely on the applicant’s need for atten-\ndant care services and the ability to direct his or her services.  Individuals \nwhose income exceeds 300 percent of the federal poverty level, however, \nare required to contribute toward the cost of their services. \n37.  Ms. Smith was transferred to the Act 150 program at the time \nshe was terminated from the Attendant Care Waiver and she continued to \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 10 of 19\nreceive attendant care services for 35 hours a week.  In 2008, she became \nunable to budget her limited income and to maintain her copayments for \nthe Act 150 Program, and she had to leave the program.  \n38.  Since late 2008, Plaintiff Smith has had to rely exclusively on \nher teenage daughter to assist her with many activities of daily living. \n39.  Ms. Smith toilets herself with the commode she keeps in her \nbedroom.  \n40.  Although her right hand dexterity is poor, causing her to cut \nherself at times, Ms. Smith attempts to cook and prepare supper for her \ndaughter and herself.  \n41.  As a result of her multiple sclerosis and her impairments, Ms. \nSmith is presently fatigued all the time.  When she tries to transfer on her \nown or even walk short distances, she falls sometimes and her daughter \nmust lift her.   \n42.  Ms. Smith wears incontinence pads because she is frequently \nincontinent and must stay wet and soiled until her daughter returns from \nschool.  \n43.  Ms. Smith’s teenage daughter, Faith C., wakes at 5 a.m. to help \nher mother with her morning activities of daily living and then leaves for \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 11 of 19\nschool.  After school she assists her mother with the remaining activities of \ndaily living which are required. \n44.  Faith is a senior in high school.  She plans to attend college, \nreside on campus, and not to continue to provide attendant care services \nfor her mother.  \n45.  Ms. Smith likes to visit Faith at her school, go to the movies and \nmalls, have her grandchildren visit, and go out to restaurants. \n46.  Ms. Smith presently receives monthly SSDI benefits in the \namount of $1,332 and a monthly pension from the Philadelphia Water \nDepartment in the amount of $1,220.44, which makes her financially \nineligible for HCBS Waiver Programs.   \n47.  In late 2009, Ms. Smith received skills training in Financial \nManagement, Meals and Nutrition Skills, Health and Wellness from Liberty \nResources, Inc., a non-profit organization that advocates for individuals \nwith disabilities.  She also participated in Accessing Public Transportation \nclasses at Liberty Resources to learn how to access and ride public buses. \n48.  Ms. Smith applied for Act 150 attendant care services \napproximately two years ago with the assistance of Liberty Resources.  On \nseveral occasions in the last two years, she has contacted Maximus, the \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 12 of 19\nenrollment broker for the Act 150 Program, but has not received any \nindication when she will receive attendant care services. \n49.  Although Ms. Smith applied for and is eligible to receive \ncommunity-based attendant care services through the Act 150 Program, \nshe will not be able to secure those services because there is a waiting list \nfor that program. \n50.  Since at least Fiscal Year 2007-08, DPW has decreased the \nnumber of persons who received attendant care services under the Act 150 \nProgram.  In Fiscal Year 2007-08, there were 2,479 budgeted slots \navailable.  In Fiscal Year 2011-12, there were budgeted slots for 2,277 \nindividuals.  In Fiscal Year 2012-13, there were budgeted slots to serve \nonly 2,016 individuals.  \n51.  As the number of budgeted slots for the Act 150 Program has \ndecreased, the waiting list for the Program has grown.  In December 2012, \nthere were 294 individuals on the Act 150 Program waiting list.  There \ncurrently are approximately 316 individuals on that waiting list. \n52.  DPW has stated that there is a two-year waiting list for the Act \n150 Program. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 13 of 19\n53.  DPW has stated that it will continue to serve individuals who \ncurrently participate in the Act 150 Program, but will not serve any \nadditional individuals in the current Fiscal Year, 2013-14. \n54.  On information and belief, DPW knows or should know that \nthere are individuals, like Ms. Smith, on the Act 150 Program waiting list \nwho are at serious risk of institutionalization if they cannot access attendant \ncare services in the community through that program. \n55.  DPW has not sought funding to expand the Act 150 Program \nand, to the contrary, has decreased funding for it despite the waiting list \nand the fact that individuals on that waiting list are unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized or at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n56.  On information and belief, the cost of funding attendant care \nservices through the Act 150 Program to Ms. Smith and putative class \nmembers would be less than the cost to DPW’s Medical Assistance \nprogram of providing them with attendant care services in nursing. \nVI.  CLAIMS \n \nA.  Count I - Violation of Title II of the ADA \n \n57.  Paragraphs 1 through 56 are incorporated by reference.  This \nCount is brought solely against Defendant Mackereth in her official capacity \nfor acts and omissions under color of state law. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 14 of 19\n58.  Ms. Smith and putative class members are individuals with \nphysical impairments that substantially limit one or more major life \nactivities, including walking and caring for themselves.  As such, they are \npersons with disabilities protected by the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). \n59.  Ms. Smith and putative class members are eligible for the Act \n150 Program and, as such, are qualified persons with disabilities under the \nADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n60.  DPW, administered by Defendant Mackereth, is a public entity \nsubject to the requirements of Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  \n61.  Defendant Mackereth violates Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), by failing to offer Ms. Smith and putative \nclass members attendant care services in the community, which is the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs, and, instead, offering them \nsuch services only in segregated institutions and by either subjecting them \nto unnecessary institutionalization or placing them at serious risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization. \n62.  Defendant Mackereth violates Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3), by using methods of administration \nthat subject Ms. Smith and putative class members to discrimination \nthrough actual or serious risk of unnecessary segregation and \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 15 of 19\ninstitutionalization, including, but not limited to:  (a) failing to assess \nwhether persons on the Act 150 Program waiting list are institutionalized or \nat serious risk of institutionalization; (b) failing to use available funding to \nprovide services to Ms. Smith and putative class members through the Act \n150 Program; (c) allowing the Act 150 Program to serve fewer and fewer \npeople despite the increasing need for such services; and (d) failing to \nhave a plan with specific and concrete benchmarks and timelines within \nwhich DPW will provide Ms. Smith and putative class members with \ncommunity-based attendant care services through the Act 150 Program. \nB.  Count II - Violation of Section 504 of the RA \n \n63.  Paragraphs 1 through 62 are incorporated by reference.  This \nCount is brought solely against Defendant DPW. \n64.  Ms. Smith and putative class members are individuals with \nphysical impairments that substantially limit one or more major life \nactivities, including walking and caring for themselves.  As such, they are \npersons with disabilities protected by Section 504 of the RA.  29 U.S.C. § \n705(20)(B). \n65.  Ms. Smith and putative class members are eligible for the Act \n150 Program and, as such, are qualified persons with disabilities under \nSection 504 of the RA. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 16 of 19\n66.  Defendant DPW is a recipient of Federal financial assistance \nand, as such, is subject to the requirements of Section 504 of the RA.  29 \nU.S.C. § 794(b).  \n67.  Defendant DPW violates Section 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § \n794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d), by failing to offer Ms. Smith and putative \nclass members attendant care services in the community, which is the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs, and, instead, offering them \nsuch services only in segregated institutions and by either subjecting them \nto unnecessary institutionalization or placing them at serious risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization. \n68.  Defendant DPW violates Section 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § \n794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3), by using methods of administration that \nsubject Ms. Smith and putative class members to discrimination through \nactual or serious risk of unnecessary segregation and institutionalization, \nincluding, but not limited to:  (a) failing to assess whether persons on the \nAct 150 Program waiting list are institutionalized or at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization; (b) failing to use available funding to provide services to \nMs. Smith and putative class members through the Act 150 Program; (c) \nallowing the Act 150 Program to serve fewer and fewer people despite the \nincreasing need for such services; and (d) failing to have a plan with \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-05670-AB   Document 11   Filed 10/28/13   Page 17 of 19\nspecific and concrete benchmarks and timelines within which DPW will \nprovide Ms. Smith and putative class members with community-based \nattendant care services through the Act 150 Program. \nVI.
