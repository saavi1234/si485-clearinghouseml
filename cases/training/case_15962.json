    "summary": "<p>On June 29, 2017, the James Madison Project, Noah Shachtman, and Betsy Woodruff sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The James Madison Project (JMP) is an organization established in 1998 \"to promote government accountability and the reduction of secrecy, as well as [to educate] the public on issues relating to intelligence and national security.\" Noah Schactman is the current Editor-in-Chief (previously the Executive Editor) of The Daily Beast, and Betsy Woodruff was a politics reporter for the publication at the time. Private counsel represented plaintiffs, who filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought disclosure of agency records by DHS and its subordinate entities: the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Specifically, plaintiffs sought the disclosure of records clarifying the extent to which U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) were coerced into surrendering their residency statuses, once DHS began implementing President Trump's Jan. 27 <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-02-01/pdf/2017-02281.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Executive Order 13769</a> but before DHS stopped enforcing it on Feb. 4. According to plaintiffs, lawyers for some travelers affected by the EO claimed their clients were, during this implementation period, pressured to sign I-407 forms surrendering their LPR status.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that on Mar. 3, 2017, plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to the defendant federal agencies seeking copies of records memorializing:</p>\r\n<p>1. Instructions or guidelines &ndash; including verbal instructions memorialized in writing &ndash; provided to CBP officials with respect to agency practice for presenting I-407 forms to individuals impacted by the EO;</p>\r\n<p>2. Communications between CBP officials &ndash; including verbal communications memorialized in writing &ndash; mentioning I-407 forms between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5;</p>\r\n<p>3. Any documentation tabulating or calculating the number of individuals who signed I-407 forms between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5;</p>\r\n<p>4. Copies of the actual I-407 forms signed between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint further alleged that, to date, the plaintiffs had not received a substantive response from any of the defendant agencies, and that the plaintiffs had constructively exhausted all required administrative remedies. The plaintiffs sought a disclosure order under FOIA, legal fees, and expedited action.</p>\r\n<p>(Plaintiff James Madison Project also has two similar FOIA cases in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, summarized in this Clearinghouse: one by the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15676\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daily Beast against the Department of Justice</a> and one by <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15678\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Politico against DHS</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>On June 29, the case was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg.</p>\r\n<p>On Sept. 7, the parties reported that USCIS and CBP were searching for records responsive to plaintiff's request and needed another month to prepare a list. On Oct. 10, the parties reported the following: TSA had located no responsive documents; USCIS had located no responsive records for some requests and had withheld responsive records for other requests due to privacy; and CBP had located a few responsive records.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Boasberg then ordered defendant (USCIS and CBP) to provide its first production of non-exempt portions of responsive records by Nov. 6 and its second production by Dec. 7.</p>\r\n<p>On Nov. 6, the parties reported that defendants were following the schedule ordered by Judge Boasberg.</p>\r\n<p>The following status report, of Jan. 5, 2018, noted that USCIS and CBP had both produced more responsive non-exempt records and informed plaintiff that the search was completed. The parties agreed to meet to confer on next steps.</p>\r\n<p>The Feb. 1 status report stated that the parties needed more time to discuss search declarations, before deciding whether to brief motions. A status report filed on Apr. 13 informed the Court that plaintiffs accepted TSA's productions and the sufficiency of USCIS's and CBP's searches, but would challenge denials and redactions of some of USCIS's and CBP's productions. Status reports filed October through December indicated the production was ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>Though the documents released by the government are not available online, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/border-patrol-ordered-to-block-congressmen-during-travel-ban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this news article</a> references some of their contents.</p>\r\n<p>On June 15, 2018, the defendants submitted a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the I-407 forms in question were exempt and properly withheld. The plaintiffs responded to the motion on July 16, claiming that the categorical refusal to produce the I-407 forms was improper and that their redactions were unjustified. After a conference call on October 3, the defendant submitted a status report on October 5, with the defendant&rsquo;s agreement to respond to the plaintiff&rsquo;s FOIA requests and a proposed schedule. The court, as agreed in the report, ordered the defendant to provide rolling productions every 60 days of the I-407 forms and a joint status report every 45 days.</p>\r\n<p>Production followed the next few months. On December 26, 2018, the defendant moved for a stay of production schedule due to lapse of appropriations, which resulted in a temporary prohibition of DOJ&rsquo;s work. Two days later, the court granted the motion. According to the February 1, 2019 status report, the funding was restored and the defendants had completed their required production on December 18, 2018. The parties then continued to provide status reports regarding attorney fees.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, and the court ordered dismissal the same day. The case is now closed.</p>",

At the end of the day on December 21, 2018, the appropriations act that had been \nfunding the Department of Justice expired and appropriations to the Department lapsed.  The \nsame is true for several other Executive agencies, including the federal Defendant.  The \nDepartment does not know when funding will be restored by Congress. \n2.  Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the \nfederal Defendant are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited \ncircumstances, including โemergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of \nproperty.โ  31 U.S.C. ยง 1342.   \n3.  Undersigned counsel for the Department of Justice therefore requests a stay of the \nall deadlines in this case until Congress has restored appropriations to the Department. \n4.  If this motion for a stay is granted, undersigned counsel will notify the Court as \nsoon as Congress has appropriated funds for the Department.  The Government requests that, at \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01281-JEB   Document 18   Filed 12/26/18   Page 2 of 2\nthat point, all current deadlines for the parties be extended commensurate with the duration of the \nlapse in appropriations.  \n5.  Opposing counsel has authorized counsel for the Government to state that they  \nhave no objection to this motion. \n  Therefore, although we greatly regret any disruption caused to the Court and the other \nlitigants, the Government hereby moves for a stay of the briefing schedule in this case until \nDepartment of Justice attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions. \n \nDated: December 26, 2018        Respectfully submitted, \n              JOSEPH H.

Pursuant to that Court Order, the Parties submit the instant \nJoint Status Report as follows: \n1.  This action arises under the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ), 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, \nand involves three largely identical FOIA requests submitted to the Transportation Security \nAdministration (โTSAโ), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (โCBPโ) and U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (โUSCISโ), respectively.  The FOIA requests seek certain documentation \nconcerning I-407 forms, which permit the abandonment of lawful permanent resident status in the \nUnited States. \n2.  By letter dated March 29, 2017, TSA responded to Plaintiffs that โ[a] search was \nconducted within the TSA and no records responsive to your request were located.โ  \n3.  At this time, for Plaintiffsโ requests #1 and #3, USCIS has located no responsive \ndocuments.    USCIS  has  also  located  no  documents  responsive  to  request  #2,  which  seeks \nโcommunications between USCIS officials . . . mentioning I-407 forms between January 27, 2017 \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01281-JEB   Document 7   Filed 10/10/17   Page 2 of 3\nand February 5, 2017,โ though USCIS will conduct additional searches concerning this request.  \nConcerning Plaintiffsโ request #4, which seeks โ[c]opies of the actual I-407 forms that were signed \nbetween January 27, 2017, and February 5, 2017,โ USCIS has determined that it will withhold all \nresponsive documents in full, because, among other reasons, disclosure of these forms would \nconstitute โa clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.โ  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(6). \n4.  With regard to CBP, for Plaintiffsโ requests #1 and #4, CBP has located no \nresponsive documents.  Concerning Plaintiffsโ request #2, which seeks โcommunications between \nCBP officials . . . mentioning I-407 forms between January 27, 2017 and February 5, 2017,โ and \nPlaintiffsโ request #3, which seeks โany documentation tabulating or calculating the number of \nindividuals who signed I-407 forms between January 27, 2017 and February 5, 2017,โ CBPโs \nsearch is ongoing.  Thus far, CBP has located approximately 12 potentially responsive documents \nto request #2, and no documents responsive to request #3.   \n5.  The parties propose the following production schedule: that CBP and USCIS \nprovide their first production of non-exempt portions of responsive records on or before November \n6, 2017.  CBP and USCIS will make a second production of non-exempt portions of responsive \nrecords on December 7, 2017, if needed.   \n6.  Pursuant to the Courtโs Order of September 7, 2017, the parties will file a Joint \nStatus Report on or before November 6, 2017, updating the Court as to the status of the case.  The \nparties propose filing additional Joint Status Reports every 60 days thereafter. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01281-JEB   Document 7   Filed 10/10/17   Page 3 of 3\nDated: October 10, 2017.

This action arises under the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ), 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, \nand involves three largely identical FOIA requests submitted to the Transportation Security \nAdministration (โTSAโ), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (โCBPโ), and U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (โUSCISโ).  The FOIA requests seek certain documentation concerning          \nI-407 forms, which permit the abandonment of lawful permanent resident status in the United \nStates. \n2.  On February 1, 2018 the parties submitted a Joint Status Report, explaining that \nDefendant had completed its processing of Plaintiffsโ FOIA request, and the parties had conferred \nconcerning next steps in the case.  Specifically, Defendant agreed to provide Plaintiffs with draft \nsearch declarations, so that Plaintiffs could determine which issues, if any, will require motions \npractice. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01281-JEB   Document 11   Filed 04/13/18   Page 2 of 3\n3.  Since that time, Defendant has provided Plaintiffs with draft search declarations \nfrom TSA, CBP and USCIS, respectively.  Plaintiffs have reviewed the draft declarations and \nconcur that TSA has met its obligations under the FOIA, such that Plaintiffs will drop any further \nchallenge concerning TSA.  In addition, Plaintiffs will not assert any further challenge to the \nsufficiency of CBPโs or USCISโs searches. \n4.  However, Plaintiffs do intend to challenge certain denials and redactions made by \nCBP and USCIS in responding to Plaintiffsโ request.  The parties agree that these issues are ripe \nfor summary judgment. \n5.  Accordingly, the parties jointly request that the Court enter the following briefing \nschedule: \na.  On or before June 15, 2018 - Defendant files its Motion for Summary Judgment \nb.  On or before July 16, 2018- Plaintiffs file their Response \nc.

USCIS will redact all fields within the I-407 \nforms, except fields 6 and 10 (country of citizenship/nationality, and reasons for abandoning lawful \nstatus).  USCIS will review the content of fields 6 and 10 and will agree to only redact information \ntherein which would tend to identify the signatory, such as name, telephone number, address, and \nother personally identifiable information. \n3.  In the interest of amicably resolving the litigation, the parties have agreed that, in \nreturn for USCISโs efforts outlined above, Plaintiffs will not raise any further challenges to \nUSCISโs FOIA response in this matter. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01281-JEB   Document 15   Filed 10/05/18   Page 2 of 3\n4.

This lawsuit is brought under the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ). It seeks \nto compel disclosure of U.S. Government records clarifying the extent to which U.S. \npermanent residents were coerced into surrendering their residency statuses during the \nchaos surrounding the implementation of the first โtravel banโ issued by President Donald \nJ. Trump (โPresident Trumpโ).  \n  8.  For context, President Trump issued an Executive Order on January 27, 2017, \nentitled โProtecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United Statesโ. \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-\ntrump.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=B456165D1D10E39DE6FBC6134CD7796\n3&gwt=pay (last accessed January 30, 2017). The Executive Order suspended the U.S. \nGovernment refugee program, indefinitely barred Syrian refugees, and temporarily barred \nentry into the United States foreign nationals from seven countries. https://www.nytimes. \ncom/2017/01/29/us/trump-refugee-ban-muslim-executive-order.html?_r=0 (last accessed \nJanuary 30, 2017).  \n  9.  In the aftermath of the issuance of the Executive Order, chaos erupted at U.S. \nairports on January 28, 2017, as hundreds of individuals were detained and prevented \nfrom entering the United States despite holding valid entry paperwork.
