She also brought claims against the College's President, Jennifer Raab, and its Acting Vice President, Eija Ayravainen, in their individual capacities and their capacities as administrators of the College. </p><p>Plaintiff suffered from Major Depressive Disorder and was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In June of 2004, she attempted suicide in her dormitory room at the College. She had also overdosed on medication earlier that year while at school. Pursuant to a school policy stating that students who attempt suicide would be asked to take a leave of absence from their Residence Halls for a semester, following the incident on June 5, the College notified plaintiff that she would not be allowed to live in the dorm during the fall 2004 semester. The College also told her she would be required to visit with Deans and counselors on campus. </p><p>In her Amended Complaint, filed on October 7, 2004, plaintiff brought the following claims: 1) intentional discrimination under the Fair Housing Act; 2) intentional discrimination and failure to accommodate in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and 3) intentional discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages. </p><p>Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on October 27, 2004, alleging that as a state institution, the College and its officials were protected by Eleventh Amendment immunity. On August 25, 2005, Judge Sidney H. Stein denied defendants' motion to dismiss and ordered the parties to begin discovery. </p><p>The parties engaged in negotiations and, on August 22, 2006, jointly filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. On the same day, the parties filed a Settlement Agreement. The Agreement indicated that defendants would pay a total of $100,000 in attorneys' fees and would pay approximately $63,000 in damages to plaintiff over a period of 48 months. </p><p>The case is closed.</p>",

GOLDFARB:  David Goldfarb from Goldfarb, Abrandt,\n2 Salzman & Kuzin for Jane Doe.\n3 MR. SALZMAN:  Ira Salzman also from Goldfarb,\n4 Abrandt, Salzman & Kuzin also for Jane Doe.\n5 THE COURT:  Good morning.  Please be seated.\n6 MS. BLANCHETTE:  Antoinette Blanchette, Assistant\n7 Attorney General for the defendants, Your Honor.\n8 THE COURT:  Good morning, Ms. Blanchette.\n9 We're going to tape this.  Is the machine on?  All\n10 right.  Because what I'd like to do is read into the record my\n11 decision denying defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground\n12 that plaintiff has adequately stated a claim for disability\n13 discrimination.  What I then will do is enter a minute order\n14 saying for the reasons set forth on the record today\n15 defendants' motion to dismiss is denied.  \n16 If anyone wants a transcript I'm going to ask whoever\n17 transcribes the tape to send the draft to my Chambers and I\n18 will fill in the specific cites.  In other words, as I read my\n19 decision I'm not going to give detailed citations with -- I\n20 won't say 354 F.3d so forth.  I'll just give the case cite and\n21 then when it comes up to me I'll fill in -- and also the record\n22 cites.  I'll fill in the specific references to the complaint\n23 as well as the specific case citations.  That's if anybody\n24 wants to have the transcript.\n25 Then I want to talk with the parties about where\n26 we're going in the litigation.  But first off tell me --\n27 because I think what's most important here is Ms. Doe.  Tell me\n28 what's happening with Ms. Doe.  I take it she's back and by now\n\n3\n1 she's a junior in the college.  Is that right and she's in the\n2 dorm?\n3 MR. GOLDFARB:  Your Honor, I was unable to contact\n4 her at the end of the summer when I get the message about the\n5 conference today.  So I haven't got an update.  When we last\n6 spoke to her at the beginning of the summer when she was back\n7 in the dorm under the agreement she was having some problems\n8 that it was -- we had not resolved what was going to happen\n9 next semester but I was assuming that she would continue in the\n10 dormitory under the agreement.\n11 THE COURT:  All right.  I see that -- there is a\n12 mouse in front of you.  I couldn't tell whether there was.  So\n13 that should have been picked up.  Fine.\n14 Well, it sounds good.  It sounds like she's back and\n15 continuing with her education which was obviously a significant\n16 part of this.  All right.\n17 My decision is as follows.  Plaintiff brings this\n18 disability discrimination action after being evicted from her\n19 college dormitory room for attempting to commit suicide.  She\n20 asserts claims pursuant to the Americans With Disabilities Act,\n21 the Rehabilitation Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act.  \n22 Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint\n23 pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).FRCP 12(b)(6). \n24 Defendants' motion is denied because plaintiff has adequately\n25 stated a claim for disability discrimination.\n26 The facts are recounted as follows and are as alleged\n27 in the amended complaint.  Hunter College of the City\n28 University of New York (“Hunter”) is a federally funded\n\n4\n1 institution of higher education that owns and maintains\n2 Brookdale Residence Hall (“Brookdale”) as a dormitory for its\n3 students.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 6).  Defendant Jennifer Rabb is\n4 Hunter's president and defendant IraEija Ayravainen is its vice\n5 president.  (Id. ¶ 1).  Pseudonymous plaintiff Jane Doe was a\n6 19 year old sophomore at Hunter when the action was commenced. \n7   (Id. ¶ 5).\n8 As far as the parties know, Ms. Doe is currently\n9 living in Brookdale Residence Hall as a junior at Hunter.  Doe,\n10 who suffers from major depressive disorder and attention\n11 deficit hyperactivity disorder, had to take medical leave\n12 during most of her junior year of high school and has\n13 previously been hospitalized for depression.  (Id. ¶ 8).  When\n14 it came time for her to choose among her options for college,\n15 Doe selected Hunter at least in part because its honors college\n16 program offered her free housing.  (Id. ¶ 20).\n17 When she arrived at Hunter in September of 2003, Doe\n18 signed a 2003-2004 housing contract and assumed residence at\n19 Brookdale.  (Id. ¶ 9).  The contract provided that \"a student\n20 who attempts suicide or in any way attempts to harm him or\n21 herself will be asked to take a leave of absence for at least\n22 one semester from the Residence Hall and will be evaluated by\n23 the school psychologist or his/her designated counselor prior\n24 to returning to the Residence Hall.  Additionally, students\n25 with psychological issues may be mandated by the Office of\n26 Residence Life to receive counseling.\"  (Id. ¶ 13). \n27\n\n5\n1 Toward the end of her first year on June 5, 2004, Doe\n2 swallowed twenty Tylenol PM pills and then called 911.  (Id. ¶\n3 10).  An ambulance transported her to Cabrini Medical Center\n4 where she received treatment.  (Id.).  Four days later on June\n5 9 the hospital released Doe and she returned to Brookdale. \n6 (Id.).  Upon arrival she discovered that the locks had been\n7 changed on the door to her dormitory room.  (Id.).  On the next\n8 day, June 10, in a meeting with Pamela Burrithwrightte [Ph.] of\n9 the Office of Residence Life, and defendant IraEija Ayravainen,\n10 Doe learned that Hunter was requiring her to vacate her room. \n11 (Id.).  \n12 Following her eviction, Doe lived with her mother in\n13 Queens while continuing to attend school.  (Id. ¶ 11).  \n14 That living situation alleged exacerbated Doe's \n15 mental illness.  (Id.).  On June 14, 2004, Doe wrote to\n16 Burthwright Brithwrite and IraEija Ayravainen insisting that\n17 she had been discriminated against on the basis of her mental\n18 disability.  (Id. ¶ 12).  A week later on June 21 IraEija\n19 Ayravainen informed Doe that she would continue to be excluded\n20 from Brookdale, at least through the end of the fall 2004\n21 semester.  (Id. ¶ 13).  IraEija Aygravaninen's letter cited the\n22 2003-2004 housing contract and advised Doe that she could apply\n23 to return to Brookdale for the spring semester of 2005 at which\n24 time Hunter would review her request and notify her whether it\n25 would readmit her to the dormitory or not.  (Id. ¶ 14).\n26 Doe's counsel, David Goldfarb, wrote Hunter on July\n27 2, 2004 demanding that the college reverse its decision.  (Id.\n28 ¶ 15).  He claimed that Hunter's policy constituted intentional\n\n6\n1 discrimination on the basis of mental disability and that Doe\n2 was entitled as a matter of reasonable accommodation to have\n3 her residency status immediately reassessed.  (Id.).  Goldfarb\n4 supplemented his letter with a statement from Doe's treating\n5 psychiatrist, Dr. David Grodberg, who set forth his diagnosis\n6 of major depressive disorder and attention deficit\n7 hyperactivity disorder and relayed that he had met with Doe on\n8 June 23, approximately two weeks after she had been released\n9 from the hospital.  (Id. ¶ 16).\n10 At that meeting, according to Grodberg, Doe did not\n11 exhibit suicidal ideation nor did she pose an imminent threat\n12 to herself or others.  (Id. ¶ 16).  Grodberg explained that the\n13 symptoms associated with her hospitalization seemed to have\n14 improved and were no longer interfering with her ordinary\n15 functioning.  (Id.).  In addition, Grodberg noted that\n16 isolation from the dormitory might be a complicating factor\n17 with respect to her illness.  (Id.).\n18 After Hunter refused to readmit Doe to Brookdale,\n19 Goldfarb spoke with Linda Chin, special counsel to defendant\n20 Rabb on July 26, 2004 requesting that the school make a\n21 reasonable accommodation by considering the summer session to\n22 be Doe's full semester of required absence from the dormitory\n23 thereby allowing Doe to reapply for housing in the fall.  (Id.\n24 ¶¶ 17-18).  Chin refused to accept that proposal and Doe was\n25 not permitted to return to the dormitory for the fall 2004\n26 semester.  (Id. ¶¶ 18, 20).\n27 Doe initially moved for a temporary restraining order\n28 requiring Hunter to readmit her to the dorm.  After that motion\n\n7\n1 was denied Doe moved for a preliminary injunction but later\n2 withdrew that motion.  \n3 I note that although it is not included in the\n4 complaint and therefore not considered for purposes of this\n5 motion, plaintiff was readmitted to residence in Brookdale\n6 beginning with the spring 2005 semester, and as I say as far as\n7 we know she's still there.\n8 Defendants have moved, as I said, for dismissal\n9 pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)12(b)(6).  Everyone knows\n10 the standard for review on a 12(b)(6) motion.  I can only\n11 dismiss plaintiff's claims if it appears beyond doubt that the\n12 plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim\n13 which would entitle him to relief.  Drake v. Delta Air Lines,\n14 Inc., 147 F.3d 169, 171 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Conley v.\n15 Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80\n16 (1957)) (quotation marks omitted).  Drake v. Delta Airlines\n17 quoting Connelly v. Gibson.  I must treat all factual\n18 allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable\n19 inferences in plaintiff's favor.  See Ganino v. Citizens Utils.\n20 Co., 228 F.3d 154, 161 (2d Cir. 2000); Lee v. Bankers Trust\n21 Co., 166 F.3d 540 (2d Cir. 1999)Aneeno v.  Citizen Utilities\n22 Co., Levy Bankers Trust.  A complaint need only give the\n23 defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the\n24 grounds upon which it rests.  Phillip v. Univ. of Rochester,\n25 316 F.3d 291, 293 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at\n26 47). Phillip v. University of Rochester quoting Connelly.\n27 The forgiving notice pleading rules apply with\n28 particular stringency to complaints of civil rights violations. \n\n8\n1 See also, Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512, 122\n2 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002)Swierkiewicz v. Serema, N.A.\n3 Defendants offer three arguments in support of\n4 dismissing the complaint.  One, the Eleventh Amendment; two, a\n5 lack of standing to bring a claim pursuant to the Fair Housing\n6 Amendments Act (“FHAA”); and three, the complaint fails to\n7 state a claim for relief pursuant to Section 504 of the\n8 Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and\n9 Section 202 of Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act\n10 (“Title II”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n11 Now, I'm going to take each of those three arguments\n12 in turn, the Eleventh Amendment, lack of standing pursuant to\n13 the Fair Housing Amendment Act, and complaint fails to state a\n14 claim pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and\n15 Section 202 of Title II of the ADA.\n16 The first one, the Eleventh Amendment.  The Eleventh\n17 Amendment provides in pertinent part that “[t]he judicial power\n18 of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any\n19 suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of\n20 the United States by Ccitizens of another Sstate.”  U.S. Const.\n21 amend. XI.  For more than a century, see Hans v. Louisiana, 134\n22 U.S. 1, 13, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890)Hands v.\n23 Louisiana, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Eleventh\n24 Amendment to extend beyond the literal terms of the amendment\n25 to confirm what the Supreme Court calls the background\n26 principle of state sovereign immunity.  See Garcia v. S.U.N.Y.\n27 Health Scis. Ctr. of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir. 2001)\n28 (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.\n\n9\n1 Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996))Garcia v. SUNY Health\n2 Sciences quoting Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida.\n3 “The ultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is\n4 that non-consenting Sstates may not be sued by private\n5 individuals in federal court.”  That's Garcia v. S.U.N.Y., 280\n6 F.3d at 107 (quoting  Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,\n7 531 U.S. 356, 363, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866\n8 (2001))Board of Trustees of University of Alabama v. Garrett. \n9 That guarantee yields, however, to Congress' unequivocal\n10 abrogation of a state sovereign immunity pursuant to a valid\n11 grant of constitutional authority.  See iId. (citing Kimel v.\n12 Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 73, 120 S. Ct. 631, 145 L.\n13 Ed. 2d 522 (2000))Kimmel v. Florida Board of Regents.  \n14 Defendants contend that the Eleventh Amendment bars\n15 all of plaintiff's claims against Hunter as well as her claims\n16 for monetary relief against the individual defendants, Rabb and\n17 Ayravaninen.  Plaintiff responds that the Eleventh Amendment is\n18 not a bar to any of her claims and insofar as she seeks money\n19 damages she seeks them only pursuant to Section 504 (Pl.’s Mem.\n20 in Opp. Mot. to Dismiss at 1, 6), and that with respect to that\n21 statute Hunter has waived its sovereign immunity regardless of\n22 whether the claim is for money damages or for injunctive\n23 relief.  \n24 Since plaintiff seeks damages only pursuant to\n25 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Court must determine\n26 whether plaintiff may bring her claims for injunctive and\n27 declaratory relief pursuant to Title II and the FHAA.  See\n28 Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 44See Seminole Tribe.  In addition,\n\n10\n1 with respect to plaintiff's Section 504 claim, I must determine\n2 whether plaintiff can sue for damages.\n3   A)  Injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to\n4 Title II and the FHAA.  As state entitiesy, senior colleges of\n5 the City University of New York, including Hunter, receive\n6 protection of New York State sovereign immunity.  See Clissuras\n7 v. City of New York, 359 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, -\n8 -- U.S. ----, 125 S. Ct. 498, 160 L. Ed. 2d 372\n9 (2004).Clissuras v. City of New York.  When sued in their\n10 official capacities officers of state entities such as Rabb and\n11 IraEija Aygravaninen are shielded from suit to the same extent\n12 as the state entities themselves.  See Garcia, 280 F.3d at\n13 107See Garcia.  There's no indication in here that plaintiff\n14 intends to sue Rabb and Ira Eija Aygravaninen as individuals\n15 and indeed the caption lists the administrators with their\n16 titles next to their names.  (Am. Compl. at 1).  So it clearly\n17 appears that they're being sued in their official capacities\n18 and therefore the protections of the Eleventh Amendment extend\n19 to the individuals as well as to Hunter.\n20 However, the well settled Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.\n21 123, 29 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), ex parte Young\n22 exception to the principle of sovereign immunity permits suits\n23 for declaratory or injunctive relief against state officers to\n24 prevent them from engaging in ongoing violations of federal\n25 law.  See Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 288 (2d Cir.\n26 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 936, 124 S. Ct. 1658, 158 L. Ed.\n27 2d 356 (2004); see also W. Mohegan Tribe and Nation v. Orange\n28 County, 395 F.3d 18, 21 (2d Cir. 2004).See Henrietta Dee v.\n\n11\n1 Bloomberg.  See also W. Mohegan Tribe and Nation v. Orange\n2 County.   The Eex parte Young doctrine rests on an “obvious\n3 fiction.”;  aAlthough the state is the actual party in\n4 interest, the suit must be brought against the state official. \n5 See Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 270,\n6 117 S Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1997).  See Idaho v.\n7 Cordelen Tribe of Idaho.  The Eex parte Young doctrine allows\n8 plaintiff to bring her claims for injunctive and declaratory\n9 relief from alleged ongoing discriminatory practices insofar as\n10 those claims are brought against the individual defendants. \n11 The Eex parte Young doctrine does not apply, however, to\n12 plaintiff's injunctive relief claims against Hunter.  \n13 Moreover, plaintiff does not contend that Hunter has\n14 consented to suit pursuant to the FHAA and Title II. \n15 Therefore, plaintiff's claims pursuant to those statutory\n16 provisions can only survive against Hunter if those provisions\n17 constitute effective abrogations of sovereign immunity. \n18 Nevertheless, because plaintiff may be afforded full relief by\n19 virtue of Eex parte Young claims against the individual\n20 defendants, I'm not going to engage in unnecessary\n21 constitutional interpretation to determine whether Title II and\n22 the FHAA were valid abrogations of state sovereign immunity.\n23 Congress may not properly abrogate sovereign immunity\n24 pursuant to the powers granted it by Article I of the U.S.\n25 Constitution.  See Garcia, 280 F.3d at 108;  and SSeminole\n26 Tribe, 517 U.S. at 72-73..  But Congress may abrogate state\n27 sovereign immunity pursuant to its power to enforce Section 5\n28 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Garcia, 280 F.3d at 108;\n\n12\n1 Kimel, 528 U.S. at 80.  See Garcia and Kimmel.  Therefore, to\n2 determine whether plaintiff may properly sue Hunter for\n3 injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Title II and the\n4 FHAA, I would have to ascertain whether those statutes\n5 constitute valid Section 5 enforcement legislation for the\n6 purposes of remedying the type of injury at issue here.  See\n7 Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d\n8 820 (2004)..\n9 Before undertaking that constitutional inquiry,\n10 however, I'm obligated first to evaluate whether the Court may\n11 resolve the dispute without interpreting the Constitution\n12 because if I can reach a conclusion without rendering a\n13 constitutional interpretation that's the better path and the\n14 more logical path.  See Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846, 854, 105\n15 S. Ct. 2992, 86 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1985) (quoting Spector Motor\n16 Serv., Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S. Ct. 152, 89\n17 L. Ed. 101 (1944)); see also United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S.\n18 41, 45-46, 73 S. Ct. 543, 545-46, 97 L. Ed. 770 (1953); Horne\n19 v. Coughlin, 191 F.3d 244, 246 (2d Cir. 1999).Jean v. Nelson\n20 quoting Specter Motor Services, Inc. v. McLaughlin, United\n21 States v. Rumely, Horn v. Caughlin.  Here, resolving the\n22 constitutional question of whether Title II and the FHAA\n23 constitute valid Section 5 abrogation of state sovereign\n24 immunity is absolutely unnecessary to afford plaintiff total\n25 relief.  \n26 In her claims against the individual defendants who\n27 oversee Hunter and are subject to the Eex parte Young doctrine,\n28 plaintiff may realize all injunctive and declaratory relief she\n\n13\n1 seeks.  Therefore, no prejudice will inure to plaintiff by\n2 virtue of the Court's refusal to engage in this constitutional\n3 analysis at this time.  See Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery\n4 Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 446, 108 S. Ct. 1319, 99 L. Ed.\n5 2d 534 (1988)Ling v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective\n6 Association.\n7 In CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Board of Public Works\n8 of State of West Virginia, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\n9 Fourth Circuit declined to address the question of sovereign\n10 immunity when complete relief was available to a plaintiff as\n11 it is here by means of the Eex parte Young doctrine.  See 138\n12 F.3d 537, 540 (1998).  Just as in CSX Transportation,\n13 plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief against Hunter for\n14 violation of Title II and the FHAA are  duplicative of her\n15 claims against the individual defendants in their official\n16 capacities.  I decline to engage in the unnecessary\n17 constitutional analysis.\n18 That takes care of the injunctive and declaratory\n19 relief pursuant to the Title II and the FHAA.  Now we'll turn\n20 to the damages under Section 504.\n21 Plaintiff's claim pursuant to Section 504 of the\n22 Rehabilitation Act is brought for damages as well as injunctive\n23 and declaratory relief.  The doctrine of sovereign immunity\n24 only permits suits for damages against states when Congress has\n25 validly abrogated the state sovereign immunity or when the\n26 state has consented to suit.  See Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe\n27 of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 267-68, 117 S Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d\n28 438 (1997); Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58,\n\n14\n1 71, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989)Idaho v. Cordelen\n2 Tribe of Idaho, Will v. Michigan Department of State Police.\n3 By accepting federal funds, Hunter has waived its\n4 sovereign immunity to suit pursuant to Section 504.  Congress\n5 may induce consent to a waiver pursuant to its Article I\n6 spending clause powers by conditioning the provision of federal\n7 funds on relinquishment of sovereign immunity.  See Garcia, 280\n8 F.3d at 113..  Congress enacted Section 504 pursuant to its\n9 spending clause powers and has explicitly provided that receipt\n10 of federal funds constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity for\n11 Section 504 enforcement purposes.  See Garcia (citing 42 U.S.C.\n12\n13 §'  2000Dd-7).  That provides, in part, that a state “shall not\n14 be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of\n15 the United States from suit in Ffederal court for a violation\n16 of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-\n17 7(a)(1).  So it's quite specific.  See also Barbour v.\n18 Washington Metro Area Transit Auth., 374 F.3d 1161, 1166 (D.C.\n19 Cir. 2004), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 125 S. Ct. 1591, ---\n20 L.

George Mason\n8 University.\n9 In Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center, the\n10 Second Circuit explained that a state could not knowingly have\n11 waived its sovereign immunity for Section 504 purposes by\n12 accepting federal funds at a time when it mistakenly believed\n13 as a result of the Second Circuit's decision in Kilcullen v.\n14 New York State Dep’t of Labor, 205 F.3d 77, 82 (2d Cir.\n15 2000)Culcohen v. New York State Department of Labor that the\n16 state sovereign immunity had already been abrogated pursuant to\n17 the ADA.  280 F.3d at 114.  Kilcullen Culcohen held that Title\n18 I of the ADA was an effective abrogation of state sovereign\n19 immunity pursuant to the Section 5 enforcement power of\n20 Congress.  See 205 F.3d at 78-81.  The U.S. Supreme Court\n21 implicitly overruled that holding in Board of Trustees of the\n22 University of Alabama v. Garrett.  See 531 U.S. at 368.  The\n23 Garcia court concluded that a state could not have deliberately\n24 waived its right to sovereign immunity from Section 504 suits\n25 when, in reliance on Kilcullen, Culcohen the state falsely\n26 believed its sovereign immunity to have already been abrogated\n27 with respect to the ADA.  See 280 F.3d at 114.  \n\n16\n1 Footnote 4 of Garcia indicated a state might\n2 knowingly waive its sovereign immunity by continuing to accept\n3 federal funds after it became clear that the Americans With\n4 Disabilities Act does not abrogate state sovereign immunity in\n5 certain circumstances.  Id. n.4.\n6 District courts within the Second Circuit that have\n7 addressed this issue since Garcia have agreed that at some\n8 point it became sufficiently clear that Title II might not have\n9 been an effective abrogation and that continued acceptance of\n10 federal funds thereafter was a meaningful waiver of sovereign\n11 immunity from Section 504 enforcement suits.  Those courts have\n12 disagreed, however, over the specific date when the state\n13 should have been put on notice.  For our purposes we don't have\n14 to be concerned with that dispute because we're talking about\n15 events here long after that issue.\n16 Some courts have held that the operative date was\n17 September 25, 2001 when Garcia was decided.  See Killcullen v.\n18 New York State Dep’t of Labor, No. 97-CV-484, 2003 WL 1220875,\n19 at *3 n.1 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2003)Culcohen.  While others have\n20 held that it was February 25, 2001 when Garrett was decided. \n21 See Cardew v. New York State Dep’t of Corr. Servs., No. 01 Civ.\n22 3669, 2004 WL 943575, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2004)Cardo v.\n23 New York State Department of Correctional Services.  One case\n24 suggested in dictum the states may have knowingly waived\n25 sovereign immunity as early as April 17, 2000 when the Supreme\n26 Court granted the writ of certiorari in Garrett.  See Wasser v.\n27 New York State Office of Vocational and Educ. Servs. For\n28 Individuals with Disabilities, No. 01-CV-6788, 2003 WL\n\n17\n1 22284576, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2003).  See Wasser v. New\n2 York State Office of Vocational and Educational Services.  I do\n3 not need to weigh in on that dispute regarding the date as of\n4 which knowing waiver occurred.  See Doe v. Goord, No. 04 CV\n5 0570, 2004 WL 2829876, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2004).  Doe v.\n6 Goord.  Regardless of which date is operative, the events\n7 giving rise here occurred well after the state knowingly waived\n8 its sovereign immunity because Doe was excluded from her dorm\n9 room in the spring of 2004 and remained excluded until the\n10 spring or the beginning of 2005.\n11 To the extent plaintiff brings claims for injunctive\n12 and declaratory relief pursuant to Title II and the FHAA, the\n13 Eex parte Young doctrine permits her to maintain her suit\n14 against the individual defendants.  To the extent she seeks\n15 damages pursuant to 504, Hunter has waived its sovereign\n16 immunity and therefore the Eleventh Amendment does not preclude\n17 plaintiff's action.\n18 Now let's go on to the lack of standing to pursue an\n19 FHAA claim.  Defendants claim that plaintiff lacks standing to\n20 bring a claim under the FHAA because she does not rent her\n21 dormitory room from Hunter College within the meaning of the\n22 Fair Housing Act according to defendants.  I view that as an\n23 issue of a substantive element of a claim for relief and not a\n24 standing issue.  So it's really to be determined later. \n25 There's enough here to get by on this pleading issue.  \n26 The provision creating a private right of action for\n27 violation of the FHAA entitles an aggrieved person to sue for\n28 relief.  42 U.S.C. § 3613(a).  An aggrieved person includes\n\n18\n1 someone who “claims to have been injured by a discriminatory\n2 housing practice.”  42 U.S.C. § 3602(i)(1).  A discriminatory\n3 housing practice is any practice made unlawful by Sections\n4 3604, 3605, 3606 or 3617 of Title 42.  42 U.S.C. § 3602(f). \n5 This broad language leads courts to refrain from imposing\n6 standing barriers beyond those required by Article III on\n7 plaintiff's attempting to vindicate rights that have allegedly\n8 been compromised by violations of the FHAA.  See Smith v.\n9 Pacific Props. & Dev. Corp., 358 F.3d 1097, 1102 (9th Cir.\n10 2004), cert. denied sub nom. Pacific. Props. & Dev. Corp. v.\n11 Disabled Rights Action Comm., --- U.S. ----, 125 S. Ct. 106,\n12 160 L. Ed. 2d 116; see also Transp. Workers Union of Am., Local\n13 100, AFL-CIO v. New York City Transit Auth., 342 F. Supp. 2d\n14 160, 165 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).See Smith v. Pacific Properties &\n15 Development Corp., Transportation Workers Union of America v.\n16 New York City Transit Authority.\n17 In Regional Economic Community Action Program, Inc.\n18 v. City of Middletown, the Second Circuit held that an\n19 organization had standing to bring an FHAA claim on behalf of\n20 itself and a class of aggrieved persons when it was denied a\n21 special use permit to create halfway houses for recovering\n22 alcoholics.  294 F.3d 35, 46 n.2 (2d Cir. 2002).  The court did\n23 not treat buyer or renter status as a standing prerequisite for\n24 the purpose of the plaintiff's FHAA claim.  Id.  Accordingly, I\n25 do not accept defendant's argument that plaintiffs lack\n26 standing to bring an FHAA claim.\n27 Defendants' arguments properly addressed as one\n28 relating to failure to state a claim.  However, even when so\n\n19\n1 construed, the argument is unavailing.  The FHAA makes it\n2 unlawful “[t]o discriminate against any person in the terms,\n3 conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in\n4 the provision of services or facilities in connection with such\n5 dwelling, because of a handicap of that person.”  42 U.S.C. §\n6 3604(f)(2)(A).    Discrimination includes a refusal to make\n7 reasonable accommodation and rules, policies, practices or\n8 services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford\n9 such person an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. \n10 That's a quote from Shapiro v. Cadman Towers, Inc., 51 F.3d\n11 328, 333 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting 42 U.S.C. §\n12 3604(f)(3)(B)).Shapiro v. Cadman Towers.\n13 I cannot say at this early stage of the litigation\n14 before there's been any discovery that the allegations as\n15 contained in the complaint are entirely inconsistent with\n16 plaintiff's potential recovery pursuant to the FHAA.  See\n17 Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S. Ct.\n18 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002).See Swierkiewicz.  Even assuming\n19 that defendants are correct that a plaintiff who is not a\n20 purchaser or a renter cannot state a claim pursuant to the\n21 FHAA, the fact that plaintiff did not pay money for the right\n22 to live in her dormitory room may not be dispositive.  She may,\n23 for example, haved provided consideration in another form that\n24 would qualify her as a renter.  I cannot say that \"it is clear\n25 that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that\n26 could be proved consistent with the allegations.\"  That's from\n27 Swierkiewicz , at 514 (quoting Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467\n28 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S. Ct. 2229, 81 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1984)).  quoting\n\n20\n1 Hyshon v. King & Spalding.   Therefore, I'm not going to\n2 dismiss the FHAA claim.\n3 Now let's turn to the alleged failure to state a\n4 Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n5 claim.  \n6 Defendants take the position that plaintiff has\n7 failed to state a claim under 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and\n8 Title II of the ADA.  504 provides that “[n]o otherwise\n9 qualified individual with a disability in the United States …\n10 shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded\n11 from participation in, and be denied the benefits of, or be\n12 subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\n13 receiving fFederal financial assistance.    29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n14 In Title II of the ADA mandates that “no qualified\n15 individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n16 disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\n17 benefits of the services programs or activities of a public\n18 entity or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” \n19 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Although phrased differently, the standards\n20 imposed by Title II and Section 504 are essentially the same\n21 and the two statutes are ordinarily interpreted together.  See\n22 Powell v. Nat’l Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 364 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir.\n23 2004); Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 272See PAL v. National Board\n24 of Medical Examiners Henrietta Dee. \n25 In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in\n26 Swierkiewicz, a discrimination claim need not establish a prima\n27 facie case in order to survive a motion to dismiss.  534 U.S.\n28 at 512;  see Budde v. United Ref. Co. of Pennsylvania, No. 03-\n\n21\n1 CV-6547, 2004 WL 1570262, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. July 9, 2004); Sanzo\n2 v. Uniondale Union Free Sch. Dist., 225 F. Supp. 2d 266, 270\n3 (E.D.N.Y. 2002).See Budde v. United Refining Company of\n4 Pennsylvania, Sanzo v. Uniondale Union Free School District.  A\n5 complaint must provide the defendant simply with a short and\n6 plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n7 entitled to relief pursuant to Rule 8A.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). \n8 From that short and plain statement, defendants have to have\n9 “fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds\n10 upon which it rests.”  That's from Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at\n11 512 (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2\n12 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957))Swierkiewicz.\n13 The amended complaint, I find, complies with\n14 Swierkiewicz.  As this litigation proceeds, facts may develop\n15 that are consistent with the allegations that would entitle her\n16 to relief.  See id. at 514 (quoting Hishon, 467 U.S. at 73). \n17 Defendants argue that as a matter of law the facts alleged lead\n18 to the conclusion that plaintiff was unqualified to live in the\n19 housing.  Defendants also maintain that plaintiff did not\n20 suffer any discriminatory treatment on account of her\n21 disability.  The allegations in the amended complaint do not,\n22 however, demonstrate a patent lack of qualification or absence\n23 of discrimination.  \n24 Although plaintiff has alleged that she's\n25 “substantially limited in the major life activities of\n26 sleeping, eating, thinking and interacting with others” as well\n27 as that she has “a history of substantial limitation in caring\n28 for herself,” (Am. Compl. ¶ 8), those allegations do not\n\n22\n1 establish as a matter of law that she lacks “functions [that]\n2 are plainly integral to the independent living required in a\n3 dormitory.”  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 18).\n4 Title II requires that individuals are qualified for\n5 particular services when they can “with or without reasonable\n6 modifications to rules, policies or practices … meet[] the\n7 essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services\n8 or the participation in programs or activities provided by a\n9 public entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).  Her allegations do not\n10 foreclose the possibility that even with reasonable\n11 accommodation she would be unable to meet the requirements for\n12 residence in Brookdale.  Indeed, to the extent her ability to\n13 live in the dorm without hurting herself may have been a\n14 legitimate qualification, she has alleged facts that indicate\n15 that she might have been able to reside at Brookdale safely\n16 before being permitted to return.\n17 For example, the amended complaint includes a\n18 description of an opinion issued by her treating physician that\n19 by July of 2004 \"she did not exhibit suicidal ideation and did\n20 not place herself or others in imminent danger;, that the\n21 symptoms that were associated with her hospitalization appeared\n22 to have improved and currently do not disrupt her emotional,\n23 academic and social functioning.\"  (See Am. Compl. ¶ 16). \n24 Plaintiff may have been qualified to reside in Brookdale at\n25 some point before she was readmitted or at least she may have\n26 been capable of becoming qualified if provided reasonable\n27 accommodation.\n\n23\n1 Defendants maintain that neither the terms of the\n2 housing contract nor its implementation constitute\n3 discrimination against plaintiff on account of her disability. \n4 Defendants characterize their policy as a neutral, conduct-\n5 based one that was administered in a non-discriminatory manner. \n6 (Defs.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 8).  Even\n7 assuming that defendants are correct that the policy did not\n8 constitute disparate treatment or intentional discrimination,\n9 plaintiff may still have a viable claim for failure to make\n10 reasonable accommodation.  See Reg’l Econ. Cmty. Action Prog.,\n11 Inc., 294 F.3d at 48.Regional Economy Committee Action\n12 Progress, Inc.\n13 In sum, I cannot determine from the facts alleged in\n14 the amended complaint “that no relief could be granted under\n15 any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the\n16 allegations.”  Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 514 (quoting Hishon,\n17 467 U.S. at 73).  That's Swierkiewicz again which sets a low\n18 bar under 12(b)(6).  I, therefore, am denying defendants'\n19 motion to dismiss the complaint.\n20 In sum, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar\n21 plaintiff's claims and she has stated claims upon which relief\n22 can be granted.  Defendants' motion is denied.\n23 Thank you.  \n24 * * * * *\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n24\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n25\n1 I cer\n2 I certify that the foregoing is a court transcript\n3 from an electronic sound recording of the proceedings in the\n4 above-entitled matter.\n5\n6                                                    \n7                           Shari Riemer\n8 Dated:  9/7/05\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27",

No.: 212-416-6378\nKATHRYN C. SPANN\nAssistant Attorney General\n   of Counsel\nDated: New York, New York\nDecember 7, 2004\n\nREPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF\nMOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED COMPLAINT\n            Defendants Hunter College of the City University of New York (“Hunter College”), Jennifer\nRaab, and Eija Ayravainen (“Defendants”) submit this reply memorandum of law in further support\nof defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and\n(6). \nARGUMENT\nPoint  I\nCongress Failed to Abrogate the State’s The Eleventh Amendment\nUnder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment for Claims Alleged Pursuant to \nTitle II of the ADA, the FHA and § 504 of the Rehab Act\n  Plaintiff’s opposition papers clarify that she seeks damages only under the Rehab Act, and\nnot the ADA or FHA.  Opp. Mem. at 1.  However, with respect to claims seeking injunctive relief\npursuant to the FHA and Title II of the ADA against CUNY and Hunter College, such claims also\nare barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  See Def. Mem. at 5-13.1  Plaintiff apparently concedes that\ndefendants’ analysis of this issue with regard to her ADA and FHA claim is correct.  To the extent\nthat plaintiff may seek prospective injunctive relief against the individual defendants sued in their\nofficial capacities, the Eleventh Amendment is not a bar. \nPlaintiff also apparently concedes that defendants’ application of Tennessee v. Lane analysis\nto the Rehab Act is correct, insofar as the Rehab Act relies upon a purported abrogation of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity pursuant to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  However, plaintiff asserts a\n1 To the extent that plaintiff’s claims for prospective declaratory relief, see Am.\nCompl. wherefore clause (a), may become moot, any remaining claim for retroactive declaratory\nrelief must also be dismissed under the Eleventh Amendment.  See Ward v. Thomas, 207 F.3d\n114, 119 (2d Cir. 2000) (where there is no claimed continuing violation of federal law,\ndeclaratory relief would only serve as an “end run” around Eleventh Amendment immunity and\nis therefore impermissible).\n\nwaiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity under the Spending Clause.  This question was not part\nof defendants’ motion, and plaintiff has raised it for the first time in her opposition papers.  This\nissue presents significant legal and possible factual issues which need not be addressed at this\njuncture, as it is not included within defendants’ grounds for this motion to dismiss.  Defendants\nrespectfully submit that independent grounds exist for dismissal of plaintiff’s Rehab Act claim,\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  However, in the event that plaintiff’s Rehab Act claim is not\ndismissed for failure to state a claim, defendants reserve the right to move under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(c) or 56, to present this issue of subject matter jurisdiction to the Court for resolution at a later\nstage of these proceedings, when this issue can be presented with the benefit of fully developed\nbriefing.\nPoint II\nPlaintiff Lacks Standing to Sue Under the Fair Housing Act\nPlaintiff claims standing under the FHA, arguing that “in addition to barring discrimination\nin the sale or rental of dwellings, the statute specifically and repeatedly makes it unlawful to\n‘otherwise make unavailable or deny’ the right to use property because of a handicap.”  Opp. Mem.\nat 11, citing 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1). This construction ignores the plain language of the very statute\nplaintiff cites, which bars discrimination “in the sale or rental [of], or to otherwise make unavailable\nor deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1)\n(emphasis added).  If one is not a “buyer” or “renter” as defined in the Act, the “otherwise make\nunavailable” language is inapplicable.  The Act defines “to rent” as “to lease, to sublease, to let or\notherwise to grant for a consideration the right to occupy premises not owned by the occupant.”  42\n2\n\nU.S.C. § 3602(e) (emphasis added). \nPlaintiff argues that the “otherwise make available” language provides a right of action for\none who is not a “buyer” or “renter” to invoke the FHA.  She cites an array of cases which she\ncontends support this proposition.  The cases, however, do not serve her argument.  Woods v. Foster,\n884 F. Supp. 1169 (D. Ill. 1995), is from another jurisdiction and its reasoning does not appear to\nhave been adopted elsewhere in the ten years since its issuance.  In any event, Woods is\ndistinguishable as the defendant program in essence received the “rental” sum from a third party\npursuant to a contract for the housing of these residents.  The remaining cases cited by plaintiff also\nentail payment of consideration, and are thus inapposite because plaintiff has not tendered any\nconsideration.  See City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., 514 U.S. 725, 729 (1995) (Oxford\nHouse “had leased and was operating a home”); Villegas v. Sandy Farms, Inc., 929 F. Supp. 1324,\n1329 (D. Or. 1996) (“the payment of $1.50 per day by the occupants of the cabins to defendant under\nthe terms of the rental agreement falls within the broad definition of rent under Oregon law”); Baxter\nv. Belleville, 720 F. Supp. 720, 735 (D. Ill. 1989) (“[FHA plaintiff] testified that he has suffered\neconomic injury from the loss of income from tenants due to his inability to go forward with his\nplans” to remodel a former office building he had purchased into a residence for occupancy by\npersons with AIDS); United v. Hughes Mem. Home, 396 F. Supp. 544, 547 (D. Va. 1975) (“parents\nand guardians are requested to pay to the Home a monthly sum of money to defray some of the cost\nof the child’s care, and most in fact make such payments.”).2  N.A.A.C.P. v. American Family Mut.\n2 See also Turning Point v. City of Caldwell, 74 F.3d 941, 944 (9th Cir. 1996) (not\nspecifically addressing issue of consideration, but noting damages awarded by trial court to the\nplaintiff operators of homeless shelter, calculated by lost program reimbursement for meals\nbecause of restrictions on number of residents).\n3\n\nIns. Co., 978 F.2d 287, 297-301 (7th Cir. 1992), which found a right of action against a provider of\nproperty insurance, still hinged on the provision of such insurance to one who sought to buy a home.\nIn an effort to bring herself within the protection of the statute, plaintiff contends that she\nprovided consideration by not opting for the stipend offered by the College as an alternative to\ndormitory housing, or alternatively by signing the Housing Contract, or by “having foregone\neducational opportunities elsewhere.”  Plaintiff, however, offers no support for her theory on this\naspect of her prima facie case.  Under New York law, a contract unsupported by consideration is\ngenerally  invalid.  If  the  promisor  loses  nothing,  and  the  promisee  acquires  nothing  by  an\narrangement, then there is no valid consideration.  See Manufacturer’s Hanover Overseas Capital\nCorp. v. Southwire Co., 589 F. Supp. 214, 219 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).  Here, plaintiff has lost nothing;\nrather, she (1) chose to accept the scholarship offered by the College, and (2) made a choice among\npossible grant options within that scholarship.  One grant entailed $1,000 and no Housing Contract,\nwhile the other option entailed dormitory housing with its attendant regulations as embodied in the\nHousing Contract.  Plaintiff’s FHA claim requires dismissal.\nPoint III\nPlaintiff Fails to State a Claim\nA. Plaintiff Is Not “Otherwise Qualified” for Residence in the Dormitory\nPlaintiff argues that there are unspecified issues of fact3 as to whether she is “otherwise\nqualified” for residence in the Hunter College dormitory.  Opp. Mem. at 16.  However, as set forth\n3 If by this she makes reference to the self-evident fact that “dormitory residence\nposes inherent stressors, which a student must be emotionally able to withstand,” Def. Mem. at\n20, see Opp. Mem. at 20, the Second Circuit evidently does not consider such truisms to require\nextraneous proof, as exemplified by its decision in Doe. \n4\n\nin defendants’ moving brief, the Second Circuit has affirmed a 12(b)(6) dismissal on a similar factual\nrecord.  Doe v. New York University, 666 F.2d 761, 774 (2d Cir. 1981).  Plaintiff attempts to\ndistinguish Doe v. NYU, arguing that the NYU plaintiff’s deceit and assaultive behavior were the\ndeterminative factors in the Second Circuit’s decision.  Review of that decision, however, belies this\nassertion.  The issue is not whether the instant plaintiff is equally or less ill than the medical student\nDoe.  The issue is whether the particular manifestations by the instant plaintiff render her “otherwise\nunqualified” for the program at issue – here, dormitory residence.  In Doe v. NYU, the question was\nwhether the particular manifestations of that plaintiff’s illness rendered her “otherwise unqualified”\nfor participation in medical school.  See Doe v. NYU, 666 F.2d at 777. The enquiry is plainly\ncontext-dependent.  Particularly as plaintiff’s papers fail to identify any allegations fulfilling her\nburden to demonstrate that she is otherwise qualified, her claim requires dismissal.\nPlaintiff also argues that the Hunter College Housing Contract “bar[s] people whose\ndepression may result in a suicide attempt.”  Opp. Mem. at 15.  This statement is flatly incorrect; the\nHousing Contract bars only individuals who have attempted suicide, regardless of whether they\nsuffer from depression or another disability or no disability.  A suicide attempt may be in response\nto a situation, such as an unsuccessful relationship or death of a loved one, or may occur in\nconnection with alcohol or substance use.\nPlaintiff argues that the College’s conclusion that she is not “otherwise qualified” to live in\nthe dormitory because she is unable to live independently in a dormitory setting “itself discriminates\non the basis of disability.”  Opp. Mem. at 17.  This assertion improperly conflates two distinct\naspects of the governing standard.  A plaintiff may plead that she is disabled because she is unable\nto live independently, and thus establish that she is “substantially limited in a major life activity,”\n5\n\nthus bringing her within the ambit of the disability discrimination statutes.  But if that disability itself\nrenders her not “otherwise qualified” for the program or service at issue, she may not prevail.  See\ngenerally Doe v. NYU; Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2003)\n(affirming summary judgment in favor of Transit Authority where, assuming plaintiff’s color-\nblindness was a disability because he was allegedly regarded as being substantially limited in the\nmajor life activity of working, the plaintiff was not “otherwise qualified” to be a bus driver, as bus\ndrivers are required to be able to distinguish the colors of traffic signals); Siederbaum v. City of New\nYork, 309 F. Supp. 2d 618, 630 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (plaintiff who suffered from bipolar disorder was\nnot otherwise qualified to drive buses because when untreated, or if a person fails to follow the\nprescribed regimen of medication, the disorder can result in poor judgment, distractibility, and\nreckless behavior; noting “substantial and reasonable interest [of the Transit Authority] in avoiding\nthe liability that would follow should any of the risks associated with bipolar disorder actually\nmaterialize and cause an accident”).   Indeed, this is not a case where plaintiff has sought a\nreasonable accommodation that would enable her to transcend those aspects of her disability which\nrender her “otherwise unqualified” for dormitory residence.  \nPlaintiff asserts that this Court should disregard the Second Circuit’s holding in Doe v. NYU,\n666 F.2d 761 (2d Cir. 1981), and should look instead to Cason v. Rochester Housing Auth, 748 F.\nSupp. 1002 (W.D.N.Y. 1990), Niederhauser v. Independence Sq. Housing, (N.D. Cal. 1998), and\nJainniney v. Maximum Indep. Living, (N.D. Ohio Feb. 9, 2001).  These cases, however, highlight\nthe flaw in plaintiff’s argument.  In Cason, the court cited legislative history indicating that “in the\ncase of a person with a mental illness . . . there must be objective evidence from the person’s prior\nbehavior that the person has committed overt acts which caused harm or which directly threatened\n6\n\nharm. . . .  The landlord’s determination must not rest on ‘unsubstantiated inferences.’” 748 F. Supp.\nat 1007-08.  Here, the determination rests on overt suicidal acts, see Am. Compl. ¶ 10, which surely\nfall squarely within the exception identified in the legislative history.  Further, in Neiderhauser and\nJainniney, the plaintiffs sought to live in the subject apartments with outside assistive services, such\nas assistants or caregivers.  That is not the subject of Ms. Doe’s suit. \nB. The Suicide Provision of the Hunter College Housing Contract \nDoes Not Discriminate on the Basis of Disability\nPlaintiff argues that the College’s policy of requiring a one-semester period out of the\ndormitory for a student who attempts suicide is intentionally discriminatory on the basis of disability\n“because it requires that a person who attempts suicide be evaluated by a school psychologist or his\nor her designated counselor prior to returning to the residence hall.”  Opp. Mem. at 22.  Were that\nthe case, requirements that applicants for any program or job undergo any kind of physical or\npsychological examination would inevitably be stricken as intentionally discriminatory.  Yet the\ncourts have not done so, because such evaluations are a legitimate means for an employer or program\nsponsor or, here, dormitory administrator, to determine that an applicant is, in fact, “otherwise\nqualified” for the program or job at issue.  See Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co., 951 F.2d\n511, 518 and 520 (2d Cir. 1991) (“nothing in the language, history or precedents interpreting § 504\nsuggest that this provision is designed to insulate handicapped individuals from the actual impact\nof their disabilities;” noting that evaluation of whether plaintiff was “otherwise qualified” would\ninclude factors such as plaintiff’s likelihood of substance abuse relapse and future absenteeism, even\nif he was not currently abusing), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 815 (1992).  \nPlaintiff also relies on an array of cases from other jurisdictions that do not support her\n7\n\nposition but rather reinforce the conclusion that the College’s suicide policy is not administered in\na discriminatory manner.  Humphrey v. Mem. Hosps. Assn., 239 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2001), also\nrecognizes that a plaintiff’s mental illness may sufficiently impair her job performance to render her\nnot “otherwise qualified” for the position at issue.  LaPorta v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 163 F. Supp.\n2d 758 (W.D. Mich. 2001), highlights the difference between an individual who is otherwise\nqualified but requests a reasonable accommodation, and one like plaintiff who is not otherwise\nqualified and whose request is for waiver of the policy rather than a modification to facilitate her\nefforts at adequate performance.  A plaintiff always bears the burden of demonstrating that she is\nable to perform the essential functions of the position, though a reasonable accommodation may be\nnecessary.  Here, plaintiff has not requested additional psychological support from the school, or\nmonitoring services from the school to ensure that she is taking her medications, which may or may\nnot  enable  her  to  live  independently;  that  would  more  closely  resemble  a  “reasonable\naccommodation” within the meaning of the law.  Rather, plaintiff simply asks the school to disregard\nits policy as applied to her.  She offers no support for her assertion that this is a “reasonable\naccommodation” within the meaning of the law.\nPlaintiff also argues that the College’s suicide policy has a disparate impact on people with\nmental illnesses.  Plaintiff fails to state a claim under a disparate impact theory, because she has not\nalleged that this policy disproportionately affects dormitory residents who have a mental illness.  See\nHack v. President & Fellows of Yale College, 237 F.3d 81, 90-91 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding plaintiffs\nfailed to state a disparate impact claim under the FHA because they did not allege that the policy at\nissue actually or predictably results in an under-representation of orthodox Jews in campus housing;\nplaintiff must allege “‘a causal connection between [a] facially neutral policy . . . and the resultant\n8\n\nproportion of minority’ group members in the population” governed by the policy); see also\nTsombanidis v. West Haven Fire Dept., 352 F.3d 565, 576-77 (2d Cir. 2003) (“there must be some\n[statistical or other] analytical method to determine disproportionate impact”).  Ultimately, she\ncannot avoid the Second Circuit’s holdings that there is no cause of action for discrimination based\non the severity of an individual’s disability, i.e., between mentally individuals who are not so ill as\nto attempt suicide and those who do.  See Def. Mem. at 21.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s amended complaint requires dismissal.\nDate: New York, New York\nDecember 7, 2004\nRespectfully submitted,\nELIOT SPITZER\nAttorney General of the State of New York\nAttorney for Defendants \nBy:\n                       /s/                                \nKATHRYN C.

This is an action for declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief, \nand damages for discrimination on the basis of handicap in the exclusion from dormitory \nhousing pursuant to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Defendant, \nHunter College of the City University of New York, the owner and manager of \nBrookdale Residence Hall, a dormitory, and Defendants Jennifer Raab and Eija \nAyravainen, employees of and President and Vice President of Hunter College, \n\nrespectively, discriminated against Plaintiff by wrongfully evicting her and denying her \nresidence in dormitory housing on the basis of disability.  Defendants stated that they \ncould not be responsible for Ms. Doe’s recovery.  Defendants further discriminated \nagainst Plaintiff by conditioning her re-admission to the residence hall on her agreement \nto conditions not imposed on students who do not have a disability.   Finally, Defendants \nrefused to provide Plaintiff Doe an accommodation in its rules, policies, practices or \nservices that was necessary to afford her an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the \ndormitory housing.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n2.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a), 42 U.S.C. § \n12132 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(a); 28 U.S.C. § 1367 and by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, \n1343(a)(4), 1367(a), and 2201 and 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 and 794a.  \n3.  The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interests and \ncosts. \n4.  Venue is proper in this district because the claim arose in this district and \nthe Defendants conduct business in this district. \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff Jane Doe is 19 years old, a full time student and a sophomore at \nHunter College.  Ms. Doe suffers from Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder.  At times, Ms. Doe’s depression becomes so severe that it \nsubstantially limits her major life activities, such as sleeping, eating, socializing, and \nperceiving.  At those times, Ms. Doe has engaged in suicidal gestures.   Plaintiff is a \nperson with a disability.  Plaintiff has a history of being a person with a disability within \n  2 \n\nthe meaning of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the FHAA.  \nDefendants regard Ms. Doe as a person with a disability, substantially limited in her \nability to care for herself.  As a student admitted to the Hunter College Honors Program, \nDoe has met the essential eligibility requirements for residence in the Brookdale \nResidence Hall, and is “qualified” to participate in Defendants’ programs, services, and \nactivities.  Plaintiff is not and has never been a threat to others.    \n6.  Doe was a resident of Brookdale Residence Hall in New York until \nevicted by Defendants in June 2004.  From June 2004 until January 2005, she resided in \nher mother’s apartment in Queens, NY, while continuing to attend class at Hunter \nCollege.  In January 2005, Ms. Doe was re-admitted to the Brookdale Residence Hall \nsubject to conditions not imposed on students who do not have a disability, a record of \ndisability, or who are not regarded as having a disability.    Plaintiff continues to be \nadversely affected by the acts, policies, and practices of Defendants and/or their agents. \n7.

Jane Doe is 20 years old, a full time student and a sophomore at Hunter \nCollege. Beginning in 2001, during her junior year in high school, Ms. Doe began to \nexperience depression.  At times, she engaged in self-injury such as cutting. “Cutting” is \nwhen someone cuts their own skin with a sharp object, usually glass or a razor blade; it is \nnot typically linked to suicide or violence.  Rather, individuals typically engage in cutting \nto provide relief from psychological pain, tension reduction, connection with or \ndisassociation from feelings, connection with physical boundaries, or a means of \ncommunication.  \n9.  At times, Ms. Doe’s depression became so severe that it caused perceptual \ndisturbances including difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions; decreased \nappetite; ennui decreased energy and fatigue; anxiety; and difficulty interacting with her \npeers.    At such times, Ms. Doe has periodically had suicidal ideation.  During the 2001 \nacademic year, Ms. Doe was hospitalized for depression for seven days.  Due to her \n  4 \n\nsevere depression, Ms. Doe took a voluntary medical leave of absence and was home \nschooled for the majority of her junior year of high school.    \n10.  Ms. Doe has a history of being substantially limited in the major life \nactivities of sleeping, eating, thinking, learning, interacting with others, and caring for \nherself.  Since November 2001, Ms. Doe has been under the care of psychiatrist, Dr. \nDavid Grodberg, whom she sees once per month.  Doe has also been treated by Ms. \nSusan Frank, a licensed clinical social worker, whom she sees once per week. Dr. \nGrodberg has diagnosed Ms. Doe as suffering from Major Depressive Disorder and \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Ms. Doe has been prescribed medication for \nher depression and for difficulties with focus and attention.    \n11.  Ms. Doe returned to high school for her senior year in 2002.  She \ncontinued her treatment with Drs. Grodberg and Frank.  At the time, her depression was \nnot severe and she was not substantially limited in any major life activities.  She attained \na 90 average during her senior year.    \n12.  Before attending Hunter College, Ms. Doe applied and was accepted to \nSUNY Purchase, SUNY Albany, SUNY Buffalo, SUNY StoneyBrook, SUNY Oswego, \nSUNY Genesco, and Middlebury College.  She was offered dormitory housing at all of \nthe colleges and scholarships at all of the SUNY colleges.   \n13.  Hunter College accepted Ms. Doe into its Honors Program.  Hunter \nCollege does not offer dormitory housing to all of its students.  However, students in the \nHonors Program are entitled to elect either dormitory housing or an annual stipend to \noffset housing costs.  Ms. Doe would not have chosen to attend Hunter College if it had \nnot provided dormitory housing.  Ms. Doe elected to live in the Residence Hall.   \n  5 \n\n14.  As a student admitted to the Hunter College Honors Program, Ms. Doe has \nmet the essential eligibility requirements for dormitory housing and is “qualified” to live \nin Brookdale Residence Hall.  At no time has Ms. Doe ever presented a danger to others \nthat would disqualify her from residential housing.  Ms. Doe began living in Hunter \nCollege Brookdale Residence Hall in September of 2003.  When Ms. Doe began \nattending college in September 2003, she stopped seeing Dr. Frank.  She did continue to \nsee Dr. Grodberg on a monthly basis.   \n15.  In January 2004, Ms. Doe had severe migraine headache which lasted at \nleast one week.  Ms. Doe took Tylenol for several days to ease the pain].  Ms. Doe also \ntook other over-the-counter pain killers such as Aspirin and Advil to alleviate her \nsymptoms.  Ms. Doe’s boyfriend became concerned about Ms. Doe’s headaches, and \nnausea and the amount of medication Ms. Doe took to alleviate them, and called 911.  \nMs. Doe was taken to the Cabrini Hospital by Emergency Medical Services.  Ms. Doe \nwas seen in the medical emergency room.   \n16.  Security guards at the Brookdale Residence hall informed Pamela \nBurthwright, Director of Residence Life, about the incident.  Ms. Burthwright left a note \nunder Ms. Doe’s door, asking Ms. Doe to see her the following day.   \n17.  The following day Ms. Doe met with Ms. Burthwright and explained that \nshe had had headaches and nausea and accidentally took too much medication.  Ms. \nBurthwright did not seem to believe Ms. Doe and told her about counseling services \navailable at the school.   \n  6 \n\n18.  During the following semester, Ms. Doe saw Ms. Burthwright.  Ms. \nBurthwright pointed at Ms. Doe’s arms, which were scarred from the time when Ms. Doe \nwas cutting, and asked Ms. Doe if she was “getting help for that.”  \n19.  In the Fall 2003 semester, ending in December 2003, Ms. Doe received 3 \nAs and one B in her classes. \n20.  During final exams for the Spring semester, Ms. Doe studied rigorously \nand did not keep regular 9-5 hours.  Her depression had lessened.   As a result, she forgot \nto take her medication for several weeks.  In June 2004, Ms. Doe experienced a \nworsening of her depression.  She felt anxious, overwhelmed and alone.  \n21.  In the early morning of Saturday, June 5, 2004, Ms. Doe swallowed 20 \nTylenol PM pills and then dialed 911.  She was taken by ambulance to Cabrini Medical \nCenter, and was voluntarily admitted. \n22.  Cabrini Medical Center determined that Ms. Doe was not a threat to \nherself or others, and released her on Wednesday, June 9, 2004.   Before her release, Ms. \nDoe arranged to resume her weekly sessions with Dr. Frank, and implemented safeguards \nto ensure that she remained on her medication.   \n23.  Despite the recurrence of her severe depression and associated symptoms, \nMs. Doe received four As and one incomplete during the semester ending June 2004. \n24.  Brookdale security informed Ms. Burthwright about Ms. Doe’s \nhospitalization on June 5, 2004.  While Ms. Doe was in the hospital for evaluation and \ntreatment of her severe depression, Defendants decided that they would not allow Ms. \nDoe back into the dormitory and changed the lock to her room.   \n  7 \n\n25.  Ms. Doe returned to her dormitory on June 9, 2004 to find that she was \nlocked out of her room and the locks had been changed. A staff member allowed her into \nher room to retrieve some possessions. \n26.  On June 10, 2004, Ms. Doe met with Pamela Burthwright and Defendant \nAyravainen.  They informed her that she had to vacate her room.  Defendant Ayravainen \nstated that Hunter College could not be responsible for her recovery and that the action \nthey were taking was pursuant to Hunter's policy.  Defendants did not conduct any \nindividualized assessment of Plaintiff.  Defendants evicted Plaintiff Doe due to her actual \ndisability, her history of disability, or because they regarded her as a person with \ndisability.    \n27.  On June 14, 2004, Ms. Doe wrote to Ms. Burthwright and Defendants \nAyravainen and Raab stating: \nBy refusing to allow me to enter my room, by forcing me to leave \nwithout an official explanation, and by threatening to charge me for every \nday I do not vacate my room, Brookdale is not only subjecting me to great \nquantities of emotional stress and personal trauma, but they are unfairly \nand illegally discriminating against me on the basis of my mental health \ncondition. \n \n28.  On or about June 21, 2004, Defendant Ayravainen wrote to Ms. Doe \nreiterating the decision that due to the incident on June 5, 2004, Ms. Doe must \"relinquish \nyour place in the Residence Hall through the Fall 2004 semester.\"  She stated that Ms. \nDoe had to vacate her room by June 28, 2004.  She stated that the decision was based \nupon a review of the records of the June 5th episode, that it was consistent with action \ntaken by the college in similar situations in the past, and that it followed the relevant \nprovisions of the College's 2003-2004 Housing Contract, Section I which states: \n  8 \n\nA student who attempts suicide or in anyway attempts to harm him \nor herself will be asked to take a leave of absence for at least one semester \nfrom the residence Hall and will be evaluated by the school psychologist \nor his/her designated counselor prior to returning to the residence Hall.  \nAdditionally, students with psychological issues may be mandated by the \nOffice of Residence Life to receive counseling. \n \n29.  Defendant Ayravainen admitted that she did not believe that Ms. Doe \ncould emotionally care for herself: “We believe this decision is in your best interest and \nthe best interests of the Residence Hall community.  Our goal is to enable you to receive \nintensive mental health counseling in a setting with reduced pressures and distractions, \nwhich will in turn help you return to the Residence Hall better able to handle the \nchallenges of academic and residential life.”      \n30.  Defendant Ayravainen's letter further stated that Ms. Doe could request to \nreturn to college housing starting with the Spring 2005 semester and that her request \nwould be reviewed at that time and she would be notified of a decision. Along with the \nrequest, Ms. Doe would also have to submit “information and medical documentation \nregarding measures you have taken to address your emotional well-being and ability to \nlive in a residential community.”  \n31.  On July 2, 2004, David Goldfarb, Esq. wrote to Defendant Raab, stating \nthat he represented Ms. Doe and was “writing to ask you to permit Ms. Doe to return to \nher room, and to ask that the College reasonably accommodate her – now and in the \nfuture – as required by law.\"  He further wrote: \nA policy of automatically evicting students at a moment of great \nvulnerability constitutes intentional discrimination on the basis of mental \ndisability.  In any event, Ms. Doe is entitled, as a matter of reasonable \naccommodation, to have her residency status immediately reassessed.  \nDisability discrimination and a failure to make a reasonable \naccommodation are, as you know, violations of a variety of federal, state, \nand local statutes, including the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with \n  9 \n\nDisabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the New \nYork State Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Law, \nand the NY Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law. \n \nI ask that you immediately reverse Dean Ayravainen's decision and allow \nMs. Doe to return to her room…. \n \n32.  Enclosed with the July 2, 2004, letter to Defendant Raab was a statement \nfrom Dr. David M. Grodberg, Ms. Doe's treating psychiatrist stating: that she had been \nunder his care since November 2001; that she is diagnosed as suffering from Major \nDepressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; that he last met with \nher on June 23, 2004 -- after her hospitalization -- and that she did not exhibit suicidal \nideation and did not place herself or others in imminent danger; that the symptoms that \nwere associated with her hospitalization appear to have improved and do not currently \ndisrupt her emotional, academic and social functioning.  Dr. Grodberg further stated: \nSchool has been a very important support in [Doe’s] life since she \nbegan Hunter's Honors Program and it would be in her best interest to \ncontinue her class work and her dorm living.  An eviction from the dorm \nbecause of the school's understandable concerns regarding her depression \nwould be a rejection that could complicate the course of her illness…. \n \n33.  On July 14, 2004, Linda Chin, Dean of Faculty and Staff Relations and \nSpecial Counsel to the President at Hunter College, wrote to David Goldfarb in response \nto his letter.  She stated that Ms. Doe is not entitled to a room in the Residence Hall as a \nreasonable accommodation under any of the laws cited by Mr. Goldfarb.  Despite Dr. \nGrdoberg’s medical opinion that Ms. Doe was not suicidal and was not a threat to either \nherself or anyone else, Ms. Chin stated that it is not possible to permit Ms. Doe to reside \nin the Residence Hall “in light of the possible harm Ms. [Doe] may cause herself and \nothers in the Residence Hall.”  She re-stated Hunter's Housing Contract, Section 1 (see \nparagraph 28 above).  She stated that Ms. Doe could first reapply to return to college \n  10 \n\nhousing with the Spring, 2005 semester, and urged Ms. Doe to “receive or to continue to \nreceive intensive mental health counseling.”   \n34.  As a result of her eviction from Brookdale Residence Hall, Ms. Doe began \nliving in her mother’s apartment in Queens, New York.  Although Defendants refused to \nallow Ms. Doe to reside in the Residence Hall, they did allow her to attend the Summer \nSchool sessions in July and August of 2004.  While attending class, Ms. Doe had \nunrestricted access to the college buildings, and the Residence Hall, but could not live \nthere.    \n35.  Ms. Doe commuted almost one and one-half hours each way to attend \nclass.  Not only did this living situation disrupt her emotional, academic and social \nfunctioning, but it exacerbated her Major Depressive Disorder and threatened to have a \nlasting detrimental impact on her.  Ms. Doe received grades of “A” in all of her summer \ncourses.  Throughout the Summer sessions, Ms. Doe continued treatment with Drs. \nGrodberg and Frank.   \n36.  On or about July 26, 2004, David Goldfarb spoke to Linda Chin.  He \nexplained that Ms. Doe was attending Hunter's Summer Session and requested again that \na reasonable accommodation be made by having the Summer Sessions considered the one \nsemester leave of absence required by the housing contract.  This would allow Ms. Doe \nto reapply for housing in August 2004, for the Fall 2004 Semester.  Ms. Chin refused to \nconsider that or any other accommodation.  By taking this action, Hunter College refused \nto engage in the interactive process that is required as part of the reasonable \naccommodation mandate. \n  11 \n\n37.  The accommodation requested on behalf of Ms. Doe would not \nfundamentally alter the nature of the programs, services, activities offered by the \nDefendants, nor would such an accommodation result in an undue burden on the \nDefendants.  \n38.  The Fall 2004 Academic Semester at Hunter College commenced on \nAugust 27, 2004.  On August 27, 2004, Plaintiff's counsel and Defendants' counsel \nappeared at a pretrial conference on a pending motion for a preliminary injunction.  At \nthat time the parties agreed that Defendants would evaluate Ms. Doe and based on their \nevaluation, determine if she could return the residence hall.   The parties memorialized \ntheir agreement, as a stipulation on the record, as follows: \nThat as of now, plaintiff will be admitted to the residence hall at \nissue on September 7. Hunter intends to have professionals \nevaluate plaintiff on or before that date, and to attempt to reach a \nresolution as to whether its appropriate under their policy for her to \nremain or not. \n \nIf the decision is made by Hunter on the basis of the professional \nevaluation that she cannot enter the residence hall, or if she's \nalready admitted that she can't remain in the residence hall, then \nMr. Speres [counsel for defendants] will notify plaintiff's attorney \nby phone and in writing of that fact, and enable plaintiff to renew \nher application for a temporary restraining order and a motion for a \npreliminary injunction. \n \n39.  At the request of Defendants, Ms. Doe met with Kathryne Leak and Dawn \nKlimovich for an evaluation on September 1, 2004.  On information and belief, Ms. Leak \nis a Licensed Master Social Worker, not a licensed clinical social worker, thus she is not \npermitted to diagnose or treat mental illness.  Ms. Klimovich is not professionally \nlicensed by the State of New York.  Therefore, in breach of their agreement, Defendants \ndid not have Ms. Doe evaluated by qualified professionals.   \n  12 \n\n40.  Neither Ms. Leak or Ms. Klimovich spoke with Dr. Gordberg, Ms. Doe’s \ntreating psychiatrist, or Ms. Frank.  Instead, Ms. Leak questioned Ms. Doe about her \nmental illness, previous cutting behavior and relationship with her family. Both Ms. Leak \nand Dr. Klimovich recognized that Ms. Doe’s expulsion from the dormitory necessitating \nher return to live at home with her mother was very difficult for Ms. Doe and exacerbated \nher condition. They also acknowledged that in the dormitory Ms. Doe “feels connected, \naccepted, part of a group…feel[s] better when there are people around.”  Nonetheless, \nwithout any medical evidence, and based on prejudice and stereotypes they stated that:  \nMs. Doe “appears to be an emotionally very needy individual who seeks \nattention.  There is a great concern that she may again repeat the behaviors she \nhas already exhibited this past year while in the residence.  …Although she has a \nstrained relationship with her mother and we recognize there are cultural \ndifferences about mental health issues and their disclosure in public, the residence \nhall is not to be seen as an escape from the problems she has with her mother.”   \n \n41.  Ms. Leak and Ms. Klimovich, acknowledged that the June 2004 incident \noccurred while Ms. Doe had stopped seeing her therapist and taking her medication, and \nadmitted that Ms. Doe had “recognized she needed to resume meeting with her therapist,” \non September 3, 2004, they nonetheless wrote to Linda Chin, that \"Both Dr. Leak and Dr. \nKlimovich concur that the Brookdale Residence Hall is not the appropriate residence for \nMs. [Doe] at this time.\"  This decision was based on Ms. Doe’s history of mental \ndisability, and/or Defendants perception that Ms. Doe had a disability. \n42.  Based on the evaluation of Ms. Klimovich and Ms. Leak, Defendant \nAyravainen, on September 3, 2004, determined, \"Student will not move back into the \ndormitory at this time.\"   \n43.  On information and belief, Defendants based their decision on their \nconcern that Ms. Doe would successfully commit suicide and would create a risk of \n  13 \n\nsuicide contagion for other students. The decision was not an individualized assessment \nbased on objective medical evidence, rather, it was based on prejudice and stereotypes.   \n44.  In a telephone conference with the Court on September 7, 2004, Plaintiff \nrenewed her motion for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order.  By \norder dated September 10, 2004, the Court denied the motion for a temporary restraining \norder and ordered the parties to submit memoranda addressing the need for a preliminary \ninjunction.   \n45.  On or about November 2004, attorneys for Plaintiff inquired about the \nprocedure for Plaintiff Doe to reapply for dormitory residence for the Fall Semester.  On \nNovember 28, 2004, Kathryn Spann, Assistant Attorney General, attorney for Defendants \nwrote to Plaintiff's counsel to advise that Hunter College had agreed to consider Ms. \nDoe's reapplication if she submitted a \"Hunter College Housing Application\" and \nrequired documentation as follows: \nMs. [Doe] will need to obtain a letter from her therapist explicitly \nstating that (1) Ms. [Doe] is capable of living in a structured \ncollege residence hall environment with limited psychological and \nmental health support, (2) Ms. [Doe] has been regularly taking all \nmedications prescribed for her disability, and (3) in the \nprofessional judgment of the therapist, Ms. [Doe] does not pose a \nthreat of harming herself in the aforementioned environment.  \n \n46.  On December 1, 2004, Jane Doe completed a Hunter College 2004-2005 \nHousing Application and submitted it to Hunter College Office of Residence Life.    \n47.  On December 2, 2004, Dr. David Grodberg wrote to Defendant \nAyravainen the following: \nI am a board certified psychiatrist and have treated Jane Doe since \nNovember of 2001.  I presently meet with Jane Doe once a month.  \nShe also sees a clinical social worker once per week.   \n \n  14 \n\nIt is my opinion that Jane Doe is capable of living in a structured \ncollege residence hall environment with limited psychological and \nmental health support.   \n \nShe has been regularly taking all of the medications that she has \nbeen prescribed for her Major Depressive Disorder.   \n \nIt is my opinion that Jane Doe does not pose a threat of harming \nherself in the Hunter College dormitory environment.   \n \n48.  On January 13, 2005, Counsel for Hunter requested as an additional \ncondition for Plaintiff's readmission that Dr. Grodberg agree to notify them if Ms. Doe \nstopped regular visits; if he had reason to believe that she was not taking her medications; \nand if he became aware of any increased risk that she might attempt suicide.   \n49.  Dr. Grodberg declined to agree to the request from Hunter College, \nbecause he felt that even if Jane Doe agreed, it would affect the integrity of his treatment \nof her, that Jane Doe would worry that what she said to Dr. Grodberg would be held \nagainst her, and that it would interfere with his ability to monitor her mental health status. \n50.  On January 28, 2005, Kathryn Spann, counsel for Defendants, stated that \nthe College would readmit Ms. Doe, and she \"may move back into the dormitory the day \nafter she agrees to the following conditions:”   \nMs. [Doe] will need to provide documentation prepared by Dr. Grodberg / Susan \nFrank to Dr. Su Ping Ma, LCSW, at Hunter … reflecting her regular (at least once \nmonthly per therapist) sessions with Dr. Grodberg and Susan Frank (not the \ncontent of those sessions), such documentation to be provided within 3 days after \neach session.  \n \nMs. [Doe] will need to see Dr. Ma once every four weeks for an \nassessment by Dr. Ma of Ms. [Doe]'s potential for self-harm, all \nsuch sessions, to be .scheduled within the week following \nacceptance by Ms. [Doe] of this letter: \n \nMs. [Doe] agrees to take all medication prescribed by Dr. \nGrodberg as 'directed. \n \n  15 \n\nMs. [Doe] authorizes Dr. Ma to speak with Dr. Grodberg in the \nevent (and only in the event) that Dr. Ma concludes in her \nprofessional judgment that: there is an increased risk of self-harm. \n \nIf Ms. [Doe] misses one of these sessions with Dr. Grodberg, Ms. \nFrank or Dr. Ma, she shall make the session up within seven days. \n \nIf Dr. Ma concludes that there is an imminent risk of self-harm, she \nwill admit Ms. [Doe] to the E.R. \n \nMs. [Doe] agrees to contact Dr. Grodberg immediately if she \nexperiences any recurrence of self-harm ideation. \n \nIf Ms. [Doe] fails to meet these conditions at any time, she will be \nprovided with two weeks notice to vacate the dormitory room. \n \n51.  Doe’s readmission was conditioned upon her compliance with the \nconditions in the agreement.  These conditions are not imposed upon students that are not \ndisabled, that do not have a history of disability, or who are not perceived as disabled.   \nStudents that are not disabled or have a history of disability and students who are not \nperceived as disabled are not required to provide documentation of continued \nparticipation in mental health treatment on a monthly basis, or to allow a Hunter college \nlicensed clinical social worker conduct monthly mental health assessments.  Unlike \nstudents that do not have a disability or a record of disability, or are not regarded as \nhaving a disability, Doe is subject to eviction upon two weeks notice for failure to \ncomply with these conditions.  \n52.  Although the imposition of these conditions constitutes further \ndiscrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act \nand the Rehab Act, in order to obtain readmission to the dormitory, Plaintiff signed the \nagreement on January 28, 2005.  Plaintiff Doe was allowed to move back into the \nDormitory on January 29th, 2005.   \n  16 \n\n53.  The parties agreed that by signing the agreement, Doe did not waive any \nrights under the Fair Housing Act, the Rehabilitation Act or the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.   \n54.  Since January 29, 2005, although Ms. Doe has been in the dormitory and \nhas complied with the conditions, she continues to suffer negative effects from her \nprevious eviction.    \n55.  As a result of defendants' unlawful, intentional, and willful actions \ndescribed above, Ms. Doe has suffered, continues to suffer, and will in the future suffer, \ngreat and irreparable loss and injury, including but not limited to humiliation, \nembarrassment, emotional distress, and discrimination in participation in the services, \nprograms, and activities at Hunter College, and the deprivation of her right to equal \nhousing opportunities due to handicap or perceived handicap. In evicting Doe from the \ndormitory residence, excluding her from the residence for the summer and Fall semesters, \nand conditioning her re-admission on unlawful terms, Defendants intentionally \ndiscriminated against Doe based on her disability, her record of disability or perceived \ndisability.   Defendants’ policies and actions also have a disparate impact on persons who \nsuffer from mental illness.  Defendants’ policies do not further, in theory or practice, a \nlegitimate bona fide governmental interest and no alternative would serve the interest \nwith less discriminatory effect.  Finally, Defendants’ refusal to provide an \naccommodation in its rules, policies, practices or services constitutes a separate violation \nof Ms. Doe’s rights. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f):  \nDISCRIMINATION OR MAKE UNAVAILABLE A DWELLING \n \n  17 \n\n56.  Plaintiff repeats the allegations of all of the above paragraphs as if fully \nset forth herein. \n57.  The Defendants' actions and practices described above violate the Fair \nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. and in particular have \nviolated the Plaintiffs rights under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f) by discriminating in the rental or \notherwise making unavailable or denying a room in the dormitory to Plaintiff Doe \nbecause of her handicapped status; and by discriminating in the terms, conditions or \nprivileges of rental of a dwelling and in the provision of services or facilities in \nconnection with such dwelling because of Plaintiff Doe's handicapped status.  \nDefendants’ actions - evicting Doe from the dormitory residence, excluding her from the \nresidence for the summer and Fall semesters, and conditioning her re-admission on \nunlawful terms - constitute intentional discriminatory treatment based on Plaintiff Doe’s \ndisability.   The disparate impact of Defendants’ actions violate the Fair Housing Act in \nthat Defendants’ policies do not further, in theory or practice, a legitimate bona fide \ngovernmental interest and no alternative would serve the interest with less discriminatory \neffect.  \n58.  As a result of Defendants' violations of the Fair Housing Amendments \nAct, Plaintiff has been injured, as detailed above. \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f): FAILURE TO PROVIDE \nREASONABLE ACCOMMODATION \n \n59.  Plaintiffs repeat the allegations of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein. \n  18 \n\n60.  Plaintiff Doe's request for a reasonable accommodation with regard to \nDefendants' rules, policies, practices and services constituted a request for a reasonable \naccommodation under the Fair Housing Amendments Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B). \nPlaintiff Doe's request to return to the dormitory for the Fall 2004 semester constituted a \nrequest for a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n3604(f)(3)(B). \n61.  Defendants’ failure to consider Plaintiff’s application for readmission to \nthe dormitory for Fall 2004 and their decision to deny her readmission amount to a failure \nto accommodate Plaintiff’s disability.   \n62.  Defendants' decision to conditionally readmit Plaintiff to the dormitory for \nthe Spring 2005 Semester does not constitute an effective accommodation of Plaintiff’s \ndisability.  Rather, the conditions imposed on her constitute further discrimination on the \nbasis of disability.  Plaintiff agreed to the conditions, without prejudice to her right to \ncontest their legality, because readmission to the dormitory was an essential component \nof improving her mental health and ensuring her continued high academic standing. \n63.  The accommodations Plaintiff requested, through counsel, in July 2004 \nwere reasonable and were necessary to afford Ms. Doe equal opportunity to housing at \nHunter College. \n64.  The accommodations proposed would not have imposed an undue \nfinancial or administrative burden on the Defendants and did not require a fundamental \nalteration in the nature of their programs. \n65.  Defendants, individually, and/or through the actions of their agents, have \nviolated the Plaintiff's rights under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B) by denying Ms. Doe's \n  19 \n\nrequest for a reasonable accommodation and as a result, have excluded her based upon \nfear, speculation and stereotype about her disability.  \n66.

Every case in the Second Circuit has \nfound that states that accepted federal funds since September 2001, have waived their \nsovereign immunity with regard to cases brought under § 504.  Additionally, every \n\nCircuit Court that has considered the issue has found that suits for monetary damages are \nallowed under the Rehab Act.  Defendants cite no authority to the contrary.   Nor can \nthey.  \nPlaintiff also has standing to sue under the FHA since the statute is broadly \nconstrued and not limited to individuals who pay monthly rent or purchase property.  \nRather, the statute specifically prohibits acts which “otherwise make unavailable or deny” \nthe right to use property because of a handicap. Thus, it applies to situations such as the \ninstant case, where individuals pay no rent, or provide other types of consideration in lieu \nof rent.   \nPlaintiff has met her burden of making a prima facie case of discrimination under \nall three statutes.  Plaintiff alleges, and Defendants do not challenge that Plaintiff is a \nperson with a disability, Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder.  Whether Plaintiff is “otherwise qualified” for housing in the residence \ndormitory despite her handicap is a question of fact, and is not properly resolved in a \nmotion to dismiss, especially where Plaintiff has not had an opportunity to conduct \ndiscovery.   \nHowever, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Plaintiff is \notherwise qualified for housing in the residence hall, which is provided as a benefit to all \nstudents of the Hunter College Honors Program.  That Plaintiff be capable of \n“independent living” is not an essential requirement of eligibility for dormitory residence. \nNor can it be, as any requirement that a resident be capable of “independent living” is \ninherently discriminatory and illegal.  Nor is a student’s ability to withstand the supposed \nstressors of dormitory life an essential requirement. The only essential requirement of \n  2\n\neligibility for dormitory residence, is gaining admission to and remaining a member of, \nthe Hunter College Honors Program.   \nDefendants do not allege that they excluded Plaintiff from the residence hall as a \n“threat to others,” as there exists no evidence that Plaintiff is such a threat. Any alleged \nthreat to others would have to be real and imminent, based upon an individualized \nassessment of the precise nature and likelihood of the risk posed by the plaintiff, and \nsupported by a reasonable medical judgment.  Nor can Defendants exclude Plaintiff from \nthe residence hall based upon her alleged suicide attempt and threat to herself, as harm to \nself is not a valid consideration under Title II, the FHA or the Rehab Act.   \nDefendants’ blanket policy which evicts residents of the residence hall for acts of \nself harm and requires that persons who attempt suicide must be evaluated by a \npsychologist before returning to the residence hall is intentionally discriminatory. The \nlaw does not distinguish between discrimination on the basis of disability and disability-\nbased conduct.  Thus, Defendants’ exclusion of Plaintiff because of her behavior, is \ntantamount to exclusion because of her disability.  Further, because self-harm and \nsuicidal ideation is generally the result of mental disability, the policy has a disparate \nimpact on persons who suffer from mental illness.  \nFacts \nPlaintiff relies on the facts as more fully set forth in her Amended Complaint. \nArgument  \nStandard of review  \nIn considering a motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n§12(b)(6) the court takes all the plaintiff's factual allegations as true and should dismiss \n  3\n\nthe action only where no set of facts could support plaintiff's claim. International \nAudiotext Network v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 62 F.3d 69, 71-72 (2d Cir., 1995).  The \ncomplaint is deemed to include any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any \nstatements or documents incorporated in it by reference. Id.  Similarly on a motion to \ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. § 12(b)(1) the court must accept as \ntrue all material factual allegations in the complaint, but it will not draw inferences from \nthe complaint favorable to plaintiffs. It may consider affidavits and other materials \nbeyond the pleadings to resolve the jurisdictional issue, but it may not rely on conclusory \nor hearsay statements contained in the affidavits.  J.S. v. Attica Cent. Schs., 386 F.3d 107 \n(2d Cir. 2004).  \nStatutory Scheme \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides, in relevant part, that \"no otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her \nor his disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial \nassistance.\" 29 U.S.C. § 794. \nTitle II of the ADA extends the prohibition of discrimination to all actions, \nservices, programs or activities of state and local governments regardless of the receipt of \nfederal financial assistance.  42 U.S.C. §12132.  Thus, the prohibitions of Title II and § \n504, have been considered co-extensive.   \nTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, known as the Fair Housing Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (\"FHA\") provides that \"it shall be unlawful to refuse to sell or rent \n... or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of ... \n  4\n\ndisability.\" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). The FHA also prohibits discrimination \"in the terms, \nconditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or \nfacilities in connection therewith, because of ... disability.\" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). \nSection 3604(f) of the FHA prohibits discrimination \"against any person in the terms, \nconditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or \nfacilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap of that person.\" 42 \nU.S.C. § 3604(f). \nThe 1988 amendments to the FHA were modeled on the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973. The legislative history of the 1988 amendments provides that the act \"uses the \nsame definitions and concepts from [the Rehabilitation Act of 1973].  In the 1988 Fair \nHousing bill, Congress also included protections for individuals with handicaps.\"  \nH.R.Rep. No. 711, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 18, reprinted in 1988 U.S. Code Cong. & \nAdmin. News, 2178. \nThe Fair Housing Amendments Act, like § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, as amended, is a clear pronouncement of a national commitment \nto end the unnecessary exclusion of persons with handicaps from the \nAmerican mainstream. It repudiates the use of stereotypes and ignorance, \nand mandates that persons with handicaps be considered as individuals. \nGeneralized perceptions about disabilities and unfounded speculations \nabout threats to safety are specifically rejected as grounds to justify \nexclusion. \nId. at 2179. \nPoint I \nThe Acceptance of Federal Funds By Hunter College After September \n25, 2001 Constitutes a Waiver of Eleventh Amendment Immunity for \nProceedings Brought under § 504 of The Rehabilitation Act \n \nDefendants suggest that Plaintiff seeks damages under the ADA, the Rehab Act \nand FHA.  Defendants have misapprehended Plaintiff’s claims.  Plaintiff is only seeking \ndamages under the Rehab Act.  While Plaintiff does not concede that damages are \n  5\n\nunavailable under Title II of the ADA and the FHA, Plaintiff’s damage claim is \npredicated on the Rehab Act.  Thus, Plaintiffs have not responded to Defendants' \narguments in their Points I.A. and I.C.  In addition, Plaintiff is entitled to continue her \nclaims for injunctive relief under the FHA, the ADA and the Rehab Act.  \n  As interpreted by the Supreme Court, the Eleventh Amendment restricts the right \nof citizens of the United States to sue states for damages in federal courts.  See e.g. Board \nof Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001).  However these \nrestrictions are not absolute. \n  Congress has the right to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity of the states if \nit does so clearly and explicitly, and acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional \nauthority.  Congress can do this pursuant to the power it is granted under § 5 of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Tennessee v. Lane, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2004) \n(Title II of the ADA constitutes a valid exercise of Congress’ authority under § 5 of the \nFourteenth Amendment, in the context of access to the courts). \n  Pursuant to its power under the Spending Clause of Article I, Congress can also \ncondition the receipt of federal funds by a state on a waiver by that state of its Eleventh \nAmendment immunity.  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987).  In order for \nsuch a waiver to be valid the waiver by the state must be a “knowing” waiver.  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 187 (2002). \nCongress has specifically stated that states which accept federal funds shall not be \nimmune under the Eleventh Amendment from suit in federal court for a violation of §504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7.  Other courts of appeals have held \n  6\n\nthe same with respect to the other statutes identified in § 2000d-7.1 Eight Circuit Courts \nhave held that by accepting federal funds, states have knowingly and voluntarily waived \nsovereign immunity under § 504.2  \n  Defendants argue that “because § 504 of the Rehab Act and Title II of the ADA \noffer essentially the same protections, the Second Circuit has held that the statutes are \nsubject to the same Eleventh Amendment analysis.” Defendants' Memorandum in \nSupport of Motion to Dismiss (hereafter Defendants' Memorandum) at 11.  In other \nwords Defendants argue that the Second Circuit has held that the Eleventh Amendment \nanalysis of a statute such as Title II of the ADA, which abrogates Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity of the states pursuant to the § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is the same as \nthe Eleventh Amendment analysis of a statute such as § 504, which pursuant to the \nSpending Power of Article One requires states to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity \nas a condition of receiving federal funds.  Defendants are incorrect. \nThe case that Defendants rely upon, but misconstrue, is Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health \nSciences Center, 280 F.3d 98 (2nd Cir. 2001).  Seven District Courts in the Second \nCircuit have interpreted Garcia to hold that as of September 25, 2001, states are on notice \nthat acceptance of federal funds after that date constitutes a \"knowing waiver\" of \nEleventh Amendment immunity from litigation under §504.  In Garcia the Second \n                                                           \n1 See, e.g., Cherry v. University of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, 265 F.3d 541, 553-555 (7th Cir. 2001) (Title \nIX); Sandoval v. Hagan, 197 F.3d 484 (11th Cir. 1999) (Title VI), rev’d in part on other grounds, 532 U.S. \n275 (2001); Litman v.

Washington Metro \nArea Transit Authority 374 F. 3d 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2004);  Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1051-1052 \n(9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 871 (2003); Koslow v.

Arkansas Dep’t of Educ., 235 F.3d 1079, 1081 (8th Cir. 2000) \n(en banc), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 949 (2001); Stanley v. Litscher, 213 F.3d 340, 344 (7th Cir. 2000).  \n  7\n\nCircuit discussed the congressionally mandated waiver of Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity from suits brought under § 504 by states that receive federal funds in the \ncontext of the constitutional requirement that any waiver of Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity must be “knowing.”  The Second Circuit held that from September 1993 until \nAugust 1995 the State of New York did not make a knowing waiver of its Eleventh \nAmendment immunity under § 504, even though it accepted federal funds during that \ntime period, because at that time it believed that the ADA abrogated the state’s sovereign \nimmunity by congressional mandate.  Garcia, 280 F.3d at 114.  The Second Circuit held \nthat since the proscriptions of the ADA and Section 504 are virtually identical, the state’s \nreliance on its belief that there was a congressionally mandated waiver of immunity \nunder the ADA meant that it had no cause to consider when it accepted federal funds that \nit was waiving Eleventh Amendment immunity to litigation brought under § 504.  \nTherefore at the time it accepted these federal funds it did not make a knowing waiver of \nimmunity to litigation brought under Section 504 .  Garcia, 280 F.3d at 114.3  \n  However, after August 1995 a number of cases were decided by the United States \nSupreme Court which brought into question the constitutionality of the congressionally \nimposed abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity in the ADA.  See e.g. Seminole \nTribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 72-73 (1996); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. \n507, 527-529 (1997); and Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, \n531 U.S. 356 (2001).  Garrett was particularly significant in this respect.  It held that the \n                                                           \n3 It should be noted that no other circuit that has considered that issue has agreed with the Garcia Court that \na belief that the ADA abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity meant that any waiver of immunity under \n§ 504 was not knowing.  Barbour v. Washington Metro Area Transit Authority 374 F. 3d 1161 (D.C. Cir., \n2004); Doe v. Nebraska 345 F. 3d 593, 601-602 (8th Cir. 2003); Garrett v. University of Alabama at \nBirmingham Board of Transfer (11th Cir 2003); M.A. v. State Operated School District 344 F. 3d 335, 349-\n351 (3rd Cir. 2003).  Cases in the Fifth Circuit have followed Garcia but the decisions have been vacated \nand are being heard en banc Pace v. Bogalusa City School Board 339 F. 3d 348 (5th Cir. 2003). \n  8\n\nabrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity in Title I of the ADA (employment cases) \nwas unconstitutional and left open the possibility that the abrogation of Eleventh \nAmendment immunity in Title II was also unconstitutional.  These cases are particularly \nrelevant because the Second Circuit in Garcia stated the following in a footnote. \nWe recognize that an argument could be made that if there \nis a colorable basis for the state to suspect that an express \ncongressional abrogation is invalid, that the acceptance of \nfunds conditioned on the waiver might properly reveal a \nknowing relinquishment of sovereign immunity.  This is \nbecause a state deciding to accept funds would not be \nignorant of the fact that it was waiving its possible claim to \nsovereign immunity.   \n280 F.3d at 114 n.4. \n \nThis footnote is significant because the Second Circuit indicated that at the point \nin time where states had a “colorable basis” to “suspect” that congressional abrogation of \nEleventh Amendment immunity in the ADA was unconstitutional, the acceptance of \nfederal funds might constitute a knowing waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity for \nthe purpose of litigation brought under § 504.  Since the decision of the Second Circuit in \nGarcia seven District Court cases in the Second Circuit have explored the meaning of \nthis footnote.  All of these cases agree that no later than September 25, 2001, the date \nGarcia was decided, states had a “colorable basis” to “suspect” that the congressional \nabrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity under the ADA was invalid.  All of these \ncases therefore conclude that states which accept federal funds after September 25, 2001, \nhave made a knowing waiver of their sovereign immunity with regard to cases brought \nunder § 504 because of events which occurred after that date.  In some of the cases \nDistrict Courts in the Second Circuit determined that the waiver of Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity from suit under § 504 occurred if a state accepted federal funds after \n  9\n\nSeptember 25, 2001, the date that Garcia was decided.4  Other cases conclude that there \nis a waiver of sovereign immunity if a state accepted federal funds after February 21, \n2001, which is the date that the United States Supreme Court decided Garrett.5 \n  The Amended Complaint alleges that Hunter College accepted federal funds \nduring the period of time when the events alleged in the complaint occurred.  Since all of \nthe events alleged in the complaint occurred after September 25, 2001, the complaint \nproperly alleges that Hunter College has no Eleventh Amendment immunity for damage \nclaims brought under § 504.  \nPoint II \nPlaintiff Has Standing Under the Fair Housing Amendments Act \n \nPlaintiff has alleged \"The Defendants' actions and practices … violate the Fair \nHousing Amendments Act … by discriminating in the rental or otherwise making \nunavailable or denying a room in the dormitory to Plaintiff [Doe] because of her \nhandicapped status; and by discriminating in the terms, conditions or privileges of rental \nof a dwelling and in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such \ndwelling because of Plaintiff [Doe]'s handicapped status.\"  Amended Complaint at ¶ 23.  \nDefendants in their motion to dismiss claim that the FHA applies only to a sale or rental \nfor consideration and since Plaintiff Doe does not \"rent\" her dormitory room, Plaintiff \nlacks standing under the FHA.  Defendants' Memorandum at 13.  Defendants rely on \nextrinsic evidence in Plaintiff's Affidavits on the Preliminary Injunction to argue that \n                                                           \n4 Denmeade v. King, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17324 (W.D.N.Y. 2002); Harris v. New York State \nDepartment of Health, 202 F.Supp.2d 143 (S.D.N.Y. 2002); and Johnson v. Southern Connecticut \nUniversity, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21084 (D.C. Ct. 2004).   \n5 Cardew v. New York State Department of Correctional Services, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7670 (S.D.N.Y. \n2004); Kilcullen v. New York State Department of Labor, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3826 (N.D.N.Y. 2003); \nSacca v. Buffalo State College, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9134 (W.D.N.Y. 2004) (Magistrate decision). \n  10\n\ndormitory housing is free of charge and thus she is not a \"buyer or renter\" within the \nmeaning of the FHA.  \nAs demonstrated below, Plaintiff clearly satisfies the FHA definition of the term \n\"to rent\" in 42 U.S.C. §3602(e) because she has extended consideration for the right to \noccupy her dormitory room.  In addition to barring discrimination in the sale or rental of \ndwellings, the statute specifically and repeatedly makes it unlawful to \"otherwise make \nunavailable or deny\" the right to use property because of a handicap.  42 U.S.C. § 3604 \n(f)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (f)(1)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (f)(2)(B).  The Court in Woods v. \nFoster, 884 F. Supp. 1169, 1174-1175 (D. Ill., 1995), in dealing with a free homeless \nshelter states, \"there is no reason to conclude that the scope of the FHA should be limited \nto those who pay for their own housing, rather than extended to all victims of the types of \ndiscrimination prohibited by the Act.\" Woods, 884 F. Supp at 1175.6  The Woods Court \nstates that the argument that \"otherwise make unavailable or deny\" is limited to \"sale or \nrental\" is \"precluded by the plain language of the FHA….\"  Id. at 1175. \nClearly this well reasoned approach applies here.  That Plaintiff didn't pay rent in \nconventional terms does not foreclose a claim that Hunter College has made housing \nunavailable.7 \nIn addition the definition in the statute of the term \"to rent\" includes transactions \n\"for consideration\" but does not exclusively mean transactions for consideration.  42 \n                                                           \n6 Contrary to Defendants' allegation that Woods can be distinguished because of a third party grant of \nfunding, the court in Woods treats as a separate argument whether the \"rent\" definition requires that the \nconsideration be paid by the occupant. Woods, 884 F. Supp at 1175. \n7 In other contexts, courts have found that \"otherwise make unavailable\" has reach beyond the sale or rental \nfor consideration. See e.g. N.A.A.C.P. v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co., 978 F.2d 287, 297-301 \n(7th Cir. 1992) (dealing with the provision of insurance), cert. denied, 124 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 2335 \n(1993). \n  11\n\nU.S.C. 3602(e).8  See United States v. Hughes Memorial Home, 396 F. Supp. 544, 549 \n(D. Va., 1975)(finding that the FHA applies to a home for dependent, neglected or needy \nchildren that does not engage in commercial sale or rental of residential facilities; “the \nAct also reaches noncommercial activities, and that the [children’s] Home is prohibited \nfrom discrimination even with respect to residents for whom no payment is made”); \nVillegas v. Sandy Farms, Inc., 929 F. Supp. 1324, 1328-1329 (D. Or. 1996)(the FHA \napplies to denial of cabins to migrant farm worker families who work for Defendant; \n“Thus, a dwelling need not be rented to fall under the purview of the FHA.”).9   \nFurthermore, Defendants err when they argue that Plaintiff has not provided \nconsideration, both within the meaning of New York law and 42 U.S.C. § 3604(e).  If the \nCourt agrees with Defendants and looks beyond the allegation in the Complaint to \ndetermine if Plaintiff was a renter, then it must look to the other allegations of Plaintiff's \nDeclaration as to her consideration for her dormitory room.10  There is no question that \nPlaintiff had a choice between a $1,000 annual stipend or a dormitory room.  She chose \nthe latter.  Her legal detriment – the consideration – was the $1,000 per year cost to her of \nelecting dormitory housing. \nIt is black letter New York law that parties to a transaction are permitted to make \ntheir bargain, even if the consideration in question exchanged is grossly unequal or of \n                                                           \n8 42 U.S.C. § 3602(e) states \"'To rent' includes to lease, to sublease, to let and otherwise to grant for a \nconsideration the right to occupy premises not owned by the occupant.\" (emphasis added). It should be \nnoted that some of the definitions in the statute use the term \"means\" [42 U.S.C. § 3602 (a), (b), (f), (g), (h), \n(j), (k), (l), (m) and (o)] while other definitions use the non-exclusive term \"includes\" [42 U.S.C. § 3602 \n(c), (d), (e) and (i)]. \n9 See also Turning Point v. City of Caldwell, 74 F.3d 941, 1996 WL 29263 (9th Cir. 1996) (homeless \nshelters covered by the act); City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., 514 U.S. 725 (1995) (group homes for \nrecovering alcoholics and drug addicts); Baxter v. Belleville, 720 F. Supp. 720, 735 (D. Ill. 1989)(a hospice \nfor those suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). \n10 Defendants argue that for purposes of standing the Court may consider extrinsic material. See \nDefendants' Memorandum at 13 fn. 9. \n  12\n\ndubious value.  Apfel v. Prudential Bache Securities Inc., 81 N.Y. 2d 470; 616 N.E. 2d \n1095; 600 N.Y.S.2d 433 (1993); Weiner v. McGraw-Hill Inc., 57 N.Y. 2d 458, 443 \nN.E.2d 441, 457 N.Y. S. 2d 193 (1982); Spaulding v. Benenati, 57 N.Y. 2d 1244; 442 \nN.E.2d 1244; 456 N.Y.S.2d 733 (1982).   Absent fraud or unconscionability, the \nadequacy of the consideration is not the proper subject of review under New York law.  \nAll that is required is that something of “real value in the eye of the law” be exchanged.  \nApfel, supra; Weiner; supra. \nA seller does not even have to possess a property right in what is sold for an \nagreement to be supported by consideration.  For example, relinquishment of a disputed \nclaim provides consideration even if the claim was actually invalid.  Wahl v. Barnum, \n116 N.Y. 87; 22 N.E. 280 (1899).   In other words, Plaintiff’s expectancy of receiving a \nstipend rather than dormitory housing, even though she arguably had no property right in \nthe stipend absent the offer of same by Defendant, does not affect the adequacy of the \nconsideration.   \nPlaintiff’s sacrifice of her stipend alone was sufficient consideration under New \nYork law, and, therefore, under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(e).  However, in addition, Defendants \ninduced Plaintiff to forego other educational options in favor of attending Hunter \nCollege.  Defendant benefited by these exchange of promises by obtaining as one of its \nstudents the Plaintiff, who Defendants coveted sufficiently for her academic \nachievements to offer her a package of benefits, including the stipend or free dormitory \nhousing. \nAs is evidenced by Plaintiff Doe’s declaration of September 23, 2004, Plaintiff \nwas a highly sought-after student who turned down her admission to a number of \n  13\n\nprestigious institutions of higher learning, because of the overall package of inducements \nthat she was offered as part of the Hunter College Honors Program.  Plaintiff’s \nmatriculation into Defendant institution in exchange for its promises, including dormitory \nhousing, is a very real and substantial form of consideration. \nPlaintiff’s having foregone educational opportunities elsewhere in reliance on \nDefendant’s offer of dormitory housing alone constitutes consideration under 42 U.S.C. § \n3604(e). \nFinally, the written terms of the contract that Plaintiff executed with Defendants \nalso constitutes consideration.  Among the promises that Plaintiff made to Defendant are \nfor her to be enrolled in no fewer than 12 credits per semester while residing in dormitory \nhousing (Section VII H. of the contract), to use the dormitory as her primary residence \nwhile classes are in session (Section V of the Contract), and to attend and sign in at \nmonthly floor meetings (Section V of the Contract).  By making these promises, Plaintiff \nloses her freedom regarding whether or not she maintains full-time student status, what \nshe uses as her primary residence, and her ability to forego floor meetings.  In turn, \nDefendants obtain what they desired from Plaintiff – namely her attendance as a full-time \nstudent at Hunter College, and her agreement to use the dormitory as her primary \nresidence.  This is a classic exchange of mutual promises and mutual legal detriment \nincurred by both promissor and promissee.  In other words, these exchanged promises \nconstitute further consideration for Defendant to provide dormitory housing to Plaintiff. \nIn short, Defendants' obligation to provide dormitory housing to Plaintiff is \nsupported by legal consideration and subject to the protection of the Fair Housing \nAmendments Act. \n  14\n\nPlaintiff has alleged that Hunter College and its programs and activities receive \nfederal financial assistance.  Amended Complaint at ¶ 6.  The receipt by Defendants of \nfederal funds constitutes \"consideration for Plaintiff's housing\" under the FHAA.11   \nPlaintiff has standing to sue under the FHA in that Plaintiff's contract with Hunter \nCollege is subject to the protection of the FHA. \nPoint III \nPlaintiff States a Claim Under § 504 of the Rehab Act, Title II of the \nADA and The Fair Housing Act \n \nA. Plaintiff is “Otherwise Qualified” for Residence in the Hunter College Dormitory \n \n  Defendants correctly state the controlling standards for a prima facie case under \n§504 and the ADA.  Defendants' Memorandum at 14-15.   For purposes of their motion, \nhowever, they have waived reliance on claims that Plaintiff does not have a disability, \nthat Hunter College is not a recipient of federal funds for purposes of §504, and that \nHunter College is not a “public entity” for purposes of the ADA.   \n  Defendants rely on the circular argument that Plaintiff is not “otherwise qualified” \nfor residence in the dormitory under § 504 because the rules and policies established for \nthe Hunter College dormitory program bar people whose depression may result in a \nsuicide attempt.  Further, Defendants suggest that the very conditions that qualify \nPlaintiff as a person with a disability disqualify her for readmission to the dormitory.  \nDefendants' Memorandum at 18.   \nUnder § 504, Plaintiff must demonstrate that she is “otherwise qualified [to \nparticipate in a] program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. \n§794.  Under the ADA, she must show that she is a “qualified individual with a \n                                                           \n11 Defendants correctly state that the Court in Anonymous v. Goddard Riverside Community Center, Inc., \n1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9724, assumed (but did not decide) for the purpose of the motion before it that this \n  15\n\ndisability.” 42 U.S.C. §12131(2).  The Second Circuit has held that “Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act and the ADA impose identical requirements….”  Rodriguez v. City of \nNew York, 197 F.3d 611, 618 (2nd Cir. 1999).  Therefore, this court should apply the same \nanalysis to Plaintiff’s claims under each statute.12 \nAfter Plaintiff makes out a prima facie case that she is “otherwise qualified,” the \n“burden shifts to the institution…to rebut the inference that the handicap was improperly \ntaken into account by going forward with evidence that the handicap is relevant to [The \nexclusions from the program].”  Doe v. New York University, 666 F. 2d 761, 776 (2d Cir. \n1981)  There are clearly issues of fact with regard to the “otherwise qualified” status of \nPlaintiff, making it inappropriate to dismiss her claims as a matter of law.  She has \nalleged sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case, and this case should be permitted \nto proceed through discovery to test those allegations.  For purposes of the motion to \ndismiss, Plaintiff “will have [her] allegations taken as true, and will receive the benefit of \nthe doubt when [her] assertions conflict with those of the movant.\" Samuels v. Mockry, \n77 F.3d 34, 36 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  Plaintiff brings this action under § 504, the ADA and the FHA, all three of which \nuse identical definitions of disability. Compare 29 U.S.C. §705(20)(§ 504) with 42 \nU.S.C. §12102(2)(ADA) and 42 U.S.C. §3602(h) (FHA).  The amended complaint \nalleges that Plaintiff has a disability, that she has a record of having a disability, and that \n                                                                                                                                                                             \nconstituted consideration for Plaintiff's housing. Id. at n4.  \n12 \"The term 'qualified individual with a disability' means an individual with a disability who, with or \nwithout reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices … meets the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\" 42 USCS § 12131  \n  16\n\nDefendants regard her as having a disability.  Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 5, 8, 10, 21.13  \nThese are the three alternate grounds to establish disability under all three statutes. \n  Defendants suggest Plaintiff is not “otherwise qualified” because, they allege, she \nis incapable of performing “functions [that] are plainly integral to the independent living \nrequired in a dormitory.”   Defendants' Memorandum at 18.  But, surely, the question of \nwhich “functions” are essential to qualification for dormitory living is one of fact that \ncannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.   \nDefendants rely on an “independent living” criteria which, itself, discriminates on \nthe basis of disability.   Federal courts have routinely held that such “independent living”  \nrequirements are illegal under the Fair Housing Act, whose definition of disability and \nwhose proscription of discrimination on the basis of disability are virtually identical to \n§504 and the ADA.14   \nBeginning in 1990 with Cason v. Rochester Housing Authority, 748 F. Supp. 1002 \n(W.D.N.Y. 1990) a series of cases has interpreted the FHA’s ban on handicap \ndiscrimination to prohibit housing providers from imposing a requirement that their \ntenants be capable of “independent living.”  In rejecting the defendant’s argument that its \n“ability to live independently” requirement should be upheld because the Authority had \nonly relied on it to turn down a small fraction of handicapped applicants (17 out of 276), \nthe Cason opinion pointed out that this requirement still had a substantial discriminatory \neffect on handicapped persons because “no non-handicapped persons”  were denied \nhousing on this basis.  Id. at 1007.  See also Niederhauser v. Independence Square \n                                                           \n13   The amended complaint alleges that Plaintiff is substantially limited in the major life activities of \nsleeping, eating and interacting with others.  The complaint does not allege, as Defendants suggest, that \nPlaintiff is actually limited in the ability to provide self-care.  Rather, she alleges that Defendants regard her \nas being incapable in that area. \n  17\n\nHousing, 4 Fair Hous.BFair Lending (Aspen L. & Bus.) & 16,305, at 16,305.2, 16,305.6 \n(N.D. Cal. 1998), (strcking down an apartment complex=s practice of requiring that \ntenants “be capable of tending to their needs independently” and “have a successful \nhistory of living independently”) and Jainniney v. Maximum Independent Living, No. \n00CV0879 (N.D. Ohio Feb. 9, 2001) (slip op), at http://www.bazelon.org/issues/housing/ \ncases/janniney_v_maxindliv.pdf (a landlord=s rejection of a disabled applicant on the \nground that he was “not ready to live independently” violated FHA). \n  Plaintiff in the case at bar is “otherwise qualified” to live in the dormitory because \nshe has met all the essential requirements of doing so.  The primary qualification for \ndormitory residence is being in the CUNY Honors Program.  The Honors Program \noperates to attract the best and the brightest students to the college by providing certain \nfringe benefits, including dormitory housing, which is not available to the vast majority \nof Hunter College students.  In fact, as Plaintiff articulated in her Declaration of \nSeptember 23, 2004, that she elected to attend Hunter precisely because of the dormitory \nbenefit.  Despite being displaced from her dormitory since June 2004, Plaintiff has \ncontinued to perform well academically, thereby making her “qualified” to live in the \ndormitory.   \nDefendants’ argument that Plaintiff is not “otherwise qualified” for purposes of § \n504 is premised almost exclusively on the holding of Doe v. New York University, 666 \nF.2d 761,  775 (2d Cir. 1981)(hereafter, “NYU”), but such reliance is misplaced because \nthat case is distinguishable on its facts from the case at bar.  NYU involved a young \nwoman whose psychiatric history was directly relevant to her present and future ability to \n                                                                                                                                                                             \n14   Compare 29 U.S.C. §705(20)(Section 504) with 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(ADA) and 42 U.S.C. §3602(h) \n(Fair Housing Act). \n  18\n\ninteract with patients and others in her role as a doctor; the Plaintiff in this case is an \nundergraduate with a humanities concentration.  In NYU, the plaintiff lied about her \npsychiatric history in order to gain admission to medical school; Plaintiff in this case did \nnot hide her psychiatric history and was still sought after by Hunter because of her \nacademic credentials.  The plaintiff in NYU had a long and uncontroverted history of \nbehavior harmful to others and to self that resulted in her request for a voluntary leave of \nabsence from the university.  Here, Plaintiff was not asked to leave Hunter, and remains \nan honors student with superior academic performance.  She did not voluntarily \nrelinquish rights to her dormitory room; she returned to find that the locks had been \nchanged and she had been denied access.   \nMost importantly, the NYU plaintiff had a history of assaultive behavior.  As \nDefendants point out, given her conduct, the court was concerned for the safety of others.  \nHere, there is no history of harm to others.  Defendants do not even allege that she will \nharm others.   \nIn short, the NYU court found that the plaintiff in that case was not “otherwise \nqualified” because her deceit underlying her original admission to medical school and her \nsubsequent, highly disruptive behavior “rendered her less qualified than others for the \nlimited number of places available.”  Id. at 777.  It is not a matter of Plaintiff being less \nqualified than others; it is a matter of whether or not she remains qualified for dormitory \nhousing.   She has a right to live there by virtue of being and remaining an Honors \nStudent.    \nIn its reliance on NYU, Defendants assert that Plaintiff is not otherwise qualified \nunder § 504 and the ADA because her conduct violates the housing contract, and \n  19\n\nobliquely suggest that her conduct makes her a “direct threat” to the health and safety of \nothers.  Defendants' Memorandum at 17-20.  When questions of safety are involved in \ndetermining whether an individual is \"qualified\" for purposes of the ADA, a person may \nbe excluded from a program or activity or from housing only if he or she poses a “direct \nthreat” to the health or safety of others.  A “direct threat” is defined as “a significant risk \nto the health or safety of others . . . .” 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A, § 35.104 (definition of \n\"qualified individual with a disability\"); 24 C.F.R. §100.202(d).  Direct threat to self is an \ninvalid consideration under the FHA, Title II of the ADA, or §504.  The ADA and the \nFair Housing Act place the burden of proof on Defendants to demonstrate that Jane Doe \nposes a direct threat.  Hargrave v. Vermont, 340 F. 3d 27, 35 (ADA); Roe v. Housing \nAuthority of Boulder, 909 F.Supp. 814 (D.Colo. 1995)(FHA).  \nThe allegations properly before the court do not support any claim that Plaintiff is \na threat to any other person.  Defendants miss the point of the “direct threat” provision of \n§ 504 and the ADA.  In Hargrave the Second Circuit said: “It is unclear whether the \n‘direct threat’ defense applies outside of the employment context.”  340 F. 3d at 36.  The \nCourt went on to reject the argument that a danger to self is a direct threat which makes a \nperson not “otherwise qualified” within the meaning of the ADA and § 504. \nFinally, Defendants believe that its one semester ban from dormitory housing is \nan essential qualification because “dormitory residence poses inherent stressors, which a \nstudent must be emotionally able to withstand.”   Defendants' Memorandum at 20.  These \nare allegations outside the four corners of the Amended Complaint and are not \nappropriate for consideration by the Court.  In any case, there is no uncontested evidence \nbefore the Court on this issue and it is at best a question of fact. \n  20\n\nPlaintiff has raised a triable issue of material fact with respect to whether she is \notherwise qualified to live in the dormitory by showing that, with the aid of reasonable \naccommodations she is able to meet the requirements of doing so.  For that reason, the \nmotion to dismiss should be denied. \nB.  Defendants Have Engaged in Discrimination on the Basis of Disability \n \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff’s claim of discrimination fails because Plaintiff \nwas evicted for a suicide attempt (her conduct) and not because of discrimination based \non her disability.  Defendants' Memorandum at III. B.  In essence Defendants' claim is \nthat their policy is neutral.  The sole case cited by Defendants for this proposition is \nAtkins v. County of Orange, 251 F. Supp. 2d 1225 (D.N.Y., 2003) where the complaint \nfailed to \"allege that violent and self-destructive inmates who are disabled due to mental \nillness are treated any differently than violent, self-destructive inmates who are not \ndisabled due to mental illness.\"  Id at 1232.   Atkins further states that, \"[w]ith no \nallegation of disparate treatment, no claim for discrimination under the ADA or \nRehabilitation Act lies.\" Id.  \nIn Tsombanidis v. W. Haven Fire Dep't, 352 F.3d 565 (2d Cir. 2003), the Second \nCircuit stated, “[T]o establish discrimination under either the FHAA or the ADA, \nPlaintiff has three available theories: (1) intentional discrimination (disparate treatment); \n(2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make a reasonable accommodation.” Id at 573. \nThe Amended Complaint establishes a cause of action on each of these three grounds. \nPlaintiff's Amended Complaint here alleges that Defendants actions constitute \nintentional discrimination  (i.e. that their policy is not neutral) and in the alternative that \n  21\n\ntheir policy has a disparate impact on people with disabilities.15  Plaintiff  specifically \nalleges that \"Defendants’ actions constitute intentional discriminatory treatment based on \nPlaintiff [Doe]’s disability.  Defendants’ actions also have a disparate impact on persons \nwho suffer from mental illness.\" Amended Complaint at ¶ 23. \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants’ housing policy of evicting \npeople who attempt suicide has discriminatory intent; that Defendants’ policy is not \nneutral; and that it in fact does take into account the mental handicap behind the suicide \nattempt.  Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 23, 30, 33.The policy is not neutral because it \nrequires that a person who attempts suicide be evaluated by a school psychologist or his \nor her designated counselor prior to returning to the Residence Hall.16  Amended \nComplaint ¶ 13.  This is clear evidence that Defendants discriminate against people with \nmental illnesses, or people they regard as having mental illnesses.  In any case, the issue \nof Defendants' intent is a question of fact and not properly resolved by a motion to \ndismiss.  \nThe ADA prohibits discrimination “by reason of” disability.  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \nDiscrimination by reason of disability includes not only discrimination based on an \nimpairment itself but also discrimination based on the effects of an impairment, whether \nthose include the effects on the person himself or the effects on others.  School Bd. of \nNassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 282 & n.7 (1987) (interpreting the ADA’s \npredecessor, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act).  In Arline, the Court noted that the \ndisability at issue, tuberculosis, “gave rise” not only to an impairment but also to \n                                                           \n15 Defendants did not raise reasonable accommodation in their Motion to Dismiss.  Therefore, Plaintiff does \nnot address it here.  However, Plaintiff reserves argument that Defendants failed to accommodate her.  \n16 Defendants hypothesize that suicidal behavior is an action which could have other origins (alcoholism, \nromantic relationships). Defendants' Memorandum at p. 20. However, Defendants' policy does not require \n  22\n\ncontagious effects, and § 504 prohibited discrimination based on the contagious effects of \nthe disability.  Id. at 282 n.7.    \n  Defendants contend that they evicted Plaintiff because of her suicide attempt, not \nher disability, major depression.  However, this is exactly the type of discrimination \nbased on disability-caused conduct that is prohibited.  See Teahan v. Metro-North C. R. \nCo., 951 F.2d 511, 517 (2d Cir. 1991)( “an employer \"relies\" on a handicap when it \njustifies termination based on conduct caused by the handicap.”)  See also Humphrey v. \nMemorial Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1140 (9th Cir. 2001)(”For purposes of the ADA, \nwith a few exceptions, conduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the \ndisability, rather than a separate basis for termination.”); Laporta v. Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 163 F. Supp. 2d 758, 768-769 (D. Mich. 2001)(rejecting the conduct/disability \ndichotomy and the argument that Plaintiff was fired for her refusal to appear for work on \nNovember 10, not on account of a disability). \nIn Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 143 (2d Cir. 1995), the \nSecond Circuit found that a teacher's discharge because of performance inadequacies was \nin fact discharge based on disability when the performance inadequacies resulted from \nthe disability.  See also, McKenzie v. Dovala, 242 F.3d 967, 974 (10th Cir. 2001)(the \ndenial of employment based on the Plaintiff’s conduct, including cutting her wrists, was \nimproper because Plaintiff was protected by the ADA from adverse employment action \nbased on conduct related to her illness as long as she did not pose a direct threat); \n                                                                                                                                                                             \nthat students be screened for any other possible reasons that a person might engage in self-destructive \nbehavior (i.e. political beliefs, religious beliefs, etc.). \n  23\n\nHumphrey, 239 F.3d at 1140 (a jury could reasonably find a causal link between \nabsenteeism and OCD disability).17  \nEven if this Court were to find that Defendants’ policy on suicide attempts is \nneutral, as they contend, and does not reflect the intent to discriminate against students \nwith the handicap of depression, the policy still has a disparate impact on people with \ndepression.  The disparate impact analysis focuses on facially neutral policies or practices \nthat may have a discriminatory effect.  Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 574.  To show that a \nseemingly neutral policy has a discriminatory effect, the Plaintiff must prove the practice \n\"actually or predictably results in ... discrimination.\" Hack v. President & Fellows of Yale \nColl., 237 F.3d 81, 90 (2d Cir. 2000). \nPlaintiff has alleged that Defendants' policy has a disparate impact on people with \nmental illnesses.  This Court can take judicial notice that suicidal ideation and behavior \nare classic symptoms of depression and overwhelmingly occurs because of mental \ndisability.  \"Congress has recognized that youth suicide is a public health tragedy linked \nto underlying mental health problems….\" Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act of 2004, Pub. \nL. No. 108-355, 118 Stat. 1404, §2 Findings, (8).  See also articles cited in the Garrett \nLee Smith Memorial Act of 2004 at §2 (9).18  \nDefendants argue that their actions are permissible because the law permits them \nto discriminate based on the severity of a disability.  Defendants' Memorandum at 21 \nciting Flight v. Gloeckler, 68 F.3d 61 (2d Cir. 1995).  Flight is completely inapposite.  It \n                                                           \n17 Even disability-caused \"misconduct\" is protected. Nielsen v. Moroni Feed Co., 162 F.3d 604, 608 (10th \nCir. 1998) (the ADA’s general anti-discrimination provision protects both disability and disability-caused \nmisconduct rather than contemplating a “stark dichotomy” between them, except where the disability is \nrelated to alcoholism or illegal drug use).  \n18 When determining the sufficiency of plaintiff's claim on a motion to dismiss, the court may consider, \ninter alia, matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Brass v. American Film Technologies, Inc., 987 \nF.2d 142, 150 (2d Cir., 1993).  \n  24\n\nstands for the proposition that the Rehabilitation Act generally does not prohibit \ngovernment funded agencies from discriminating among handicapped people with regard \nto services specifically designed for people with disabilities.  Likewise the cases cited in \nFlight, -- P.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033  (2d Cir. 1990) (regarding handicapped \npersons in special education programs) and Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611 \n(2d Cir. 1999) cert. denied 531 U.S. 864 (2000)  (regarding Medicaid home care services \nfor the disabled) -- both deal with services specifically designed for people with \ndisabilities.  These cases stand for the proposition that in providing services specifically \nfor such a population, “[t]he Act does not require all handicapped persons to be provided \nwith identical benefits.” P.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033, 1041  (2d Cir. 1990).  These \ncases are of no relevance to facilities such as a dormitory room that are not specifically \ndesigned solely for the handicapped. \n  The Amended Complaint therefore states a cause of action that Defendants \nhad engaged in intentional discrimination and that their policies have a disparate impact \non students with mental illnesses. \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint \nshould be denied. \nDate:    New York, NY \nNovember 15, 2004          Respectfully submitted \n  __S/____________________ \nMichael Allen  David Goldfarb (DG 8861) \nKaren Bower  Ira Salzman (IS 1308) \nBazelon Center for   Goldfarb Abrandt Salzman & Kutzin \nMental Health Law   LLP \n1101 15th Street, N.W., Ste 1212   350 Fifth Ave. Suite 1100 \nWashington, D.C. 20005-5002   New York, NY 10118 \n202/467-5730   212-387-8400 \nAttorneys for Plaintiff \n  25",

R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(1) and (6). \nPreliminary Statement\nThe amended complaint purports to state causes of action under the Fair Housing\nAmendments Act of 1988 (“FHA”), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the “Rehab Act”).  However, plaintiff’s claims are\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment, except insofar as plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief\nagainst the individual defendants.  Plaintiff’s claims under the FHA are also barred by her lack of\nstanding under that statute, since the College’s provision of free housing to plaintiff is not a sale\nor rental within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act, which applies only to transactions for\n“consideration.”\n\nThe Amended Complaint also fails to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted.   Plaintiff is not “otherwise qualified” under the Rehab Act or Title II of the ADA, for\nresidence within the Hunter College dormitory, because she engaged in conduct that violates the\nschool’s housing contract and demonstrates a lack of capacity for independent living. Moreover,\nthe decision to remove plaintiff from College housing does not rest on her disability, which her\ndoctor diagnoses as Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  \nRather, plaintiff’s removal from housing was pursuant to the Hunter College Housing Contract,\nwhich was triggered by her attempted suicide.  The policy applies equally to disabled and to\nnondisabled students who engage in such conduct.  A suicide attempt may occur in an array of\ncircumstances, such as intoxication or a romantic breakup, which have nothing to do with a\nmental disability.  To the extent that plaintiff’s claim rests on an allegation of discrimination on\nthe basis of the severity of her disability, the courts have recognized that there is no cause of\naction for discrimination based on the severity of a disability.  Finally, the ADA and the Rehab\nAct does not provide a right of action for punitive damages; accordingly, plaintiff’s claim for\npunitive damages must be dismissed.\nStatement of Facts\nDefendant Hunter College is a senior college within the City University of New\nYork (“CUNY”).  Defendant Jennifer Raab is the President of Hunter College.  Am. Compl. ¶ 7.\nDefendant Eija Ayravainen is the Acting Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students\nfor Hunter College.  Am. Compl. ¶ 7. \nPlaintiff is a full-time student in her sophomore year at Hunter College.  Am.\nCompl. ¶ 5.  During the 2003-2004 academic year, plaintiff was a resident of the Brookdale\n2\n\nResidence Hall, a Hunter College dormitory.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6, 9.  Plaintiff has, since the\ncommencement of her studies at Hunter College, been a student within the CUNY Honors\nProgram.  See Affidavit of plaintiff dated August 19, 2004 (“Plaintiff Aff.”) at ¶ 2.1  By virtue of\nher participation in the Honors Program, plaintiff receives free dormitory housing at the\nBrookdale Residence Hall.  Plaintiff Aff. ¶ 4.\nPlaintiff has been diagnosed as suffering from Major Depressive Disorder and\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Am. Compl. ¶ 8. These disorders result in insomnia,\ndecreased appetite and perceptual disturbances; they also interfere with her ability to socially\ninteract with her peers, and cause suicidal ideation.  Id.  Plaintiff alleges that she is substantially\nlimited in the activities of sleeping, eating, and interacting with others, and in taking care of\nherself.  Am. Compl. ¶ 8.  Plaintiff has suffered from these symptoms since at least the junior\nyear of high school; she was on medical leave during the majority of her junior year of high\nschool. Id.  She was, prior to her matriculation at Hunter College, hospitalized for depression and\nself-harm treatment.  Id. and Spann Decl. Ex. 1 (letter from plaintiff to Pamela Burthwright dated\nJune 14, 2004); see Am. Compl. ¶ 12 (referencing letter).\nOn June 5, 2004, plaintiff attempted suicide in her dormitory room, by taking\napproximately 20 Tylenol PM capsules.  Am. Compl. ¶ 10.  Earlier in the year, in January 2004,\n1 When reviewing a motion to dismiss, a court may consider documents attached to\nthe pleadings, as well as documents outside the pleadings \"that are integral or relied upon by the\nplaintiff in preparing the pleadings.\" See Goldin-Feldman Co., Inc. v. Blum & Fink, Inc., 2000\nWL 1182798, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.18, 2000) (citing Int'l Audiotext Network, Inc. v. American\nTel. and Tel. Co., 62 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir.1995)).  The Court may thus rely on the letters\nreferenced in plaintiff’s Amended Complaint.  The Court may also take judicial notice of the\naffidavits filed simultaneously with plaintiff’s complaint, and in support of her application for a\ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  \n3\n\nshe had been taken by ambulance from the dormitory to Cabrini Hospital, after taking an\noverdose of pain medication.  Plaintiff Aff. ¶ 7.  \nFollowing her June 2004 suicide attempt, Hunter College notified plaintiff that\nshe would not be permitted to return to the dormitory for the fall 2004 semester, pursuant to the\nHunter College Housing Contract, which provides that\nA student who attempts suicide or in any way attempts to harm him or herself will\nbe asked to take a leave of absence for at least one semester from the Residence\nHall and will be evaluated by the school psychologist or his/her designated\ncounselor prior to returning to the Residence Hall.  Additionally, students with\npsychological issues may be mandated by the Office of Residence Life to receive\ncounseling.\nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 10, 13.  The school informed plaintiff that “the [June 5, 2004] incident raises\ncompelling concerns about your safety and well-being in a dormitory setting.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 2\n(June 21, 2004 letter from Eija Ayravainen to plaintiff); see Am. Compl. ¶ 13, referencing letter.  \nVice President Ayravainen continued, “We believe this decision is in your best interests and the\nbest interests of the Residence Hall community.  Our goal is to enable you to receive intensive\nmental health counseling in a setting with reduced pressures and distractions, which will in turn\nhelp you return to the Residence Hall better able to handle the challenges of academic and\nresidence life.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 2.  Vice President Ayravainen indicated that plaintiff would be\nrequired to “make an appointment to see Assistant Dean Madlyn Stokely in the Office of Student\nServices,” who would “arrange for you to see a Student Services counselor on a regular basis\nthroughout your hiatus from the Residence Hall,” and that the counselor “will coordinate with\nother mental health professionals who may be assisting you, as appropriate.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 2. \nIn response to a later letter from plaintiff’s counsel, the College’s attorney wrote that “in light of\n4\n\nthe possible harm Ms. [Doe] may cause herself and others in the residence Hall, it is not possible\nto permit her to reside in the room of the Residence Hall.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 3 (July 14, 2004\nletter from Linda Chin to David Goldfarb); see also Am. Compl. ¶ 17 (referencing letter).  Ms.\nChin continued: “We urge Ms. [Doe] to receive or to continue to receive intensive mental health\ncounseling.  She may request to return to college housing starting with the Spring, 2005 semester.\n[She] must also submit medical documentation regarding her emotional well-being[.]” Id.   \nOn October 7, 2004, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, alleging the following\ncauses of action: (1) intentional discrimination and disparate impact under the Fair Housing Act;\n(2) failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act; (3) intentional\ndiscrimination and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under Title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act; and (4) intentional discrimination under § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act.  \nARGUMENT\nPoint  I\nThe Eleventh Amendment Bars Plaintiff’s Claims Alleged Pursuant to Title II of the ADA,\n§ 504 of the Rehab Act, and the FHA Against CUNY, and\nHer Claims Under These Statutes for Monetary Relief Against the Individual Defendants\nThe Eleventh Amendment bars all federal suits for any kind of relief against the\nState of New York, its agencies and entities, in the absence of the State's consent.  Will v.\nMichigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 (1989); Pennhurst State School & Hospital v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 97-100 (1984).   CUNY2 and its senior colleges, including Hunter\n2 Although Hunter College is named as a defendant, CUNY is the sole correct\n(continued...)\n5\n\nCollege, are state entities entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, Clissuras v. City University\nof New York, 359 F.3d 79, 82 (2004), and have not consented to suit under the ADA, the Rehab\nAct or the FHA.\nWhile “Congress may abrogate the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity when\nit both unequivocally intends to do so and ‘acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional\nauthority,’” Board of Trustees of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363 (2001) (citations\nomitted), those circumstances are not present here, as detailed below in Points I.A through I.C.  \nWith respect to the defendant State officials, the Eleventh Amendment also\ndeprives the federal courts of jurisdiction over an action against a state official acting in his\nofficial capacity.3  Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139\n(1993); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101, 105-06 (1984).\nDefendants Raab and Ayravainen are immune for actions in their official capacities, except\nwhere plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief against them for an alleged violation of federal\nlaw.  Id.; see Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).  However, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks\nsuch relief, she lacks standing to bring a FHA claim (see Point II below), and her complaint fails\nto state a claim under the ADA and Rehab Act (see Point III below).  Therefore, she is not\n2(...continued)\ninstitutional defendant.  See Educ. Law § 6203.  Hunter College is a “senior college” within the\nCUNY system.  See Educ. Law § 6203(5) and Weinbaum v. Cuomo, 219 A.D.2d 554, n.1 (1st\nDept. 1995), appeal dismissed, 87 N.Y.2d 917 (1996) (Hunter College is a “senior college”).\n3 The complaint raises no action, implicitly or explicitly, against the individual\ndefendants other than their official capacities.  In any event, neither Title II of the ADA nor § 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act provides for individual capacity suits against state officials.  See Lane\nv. Maryhaven Ctr. of Hope, 944 F. Supp. 158, 160-62 and 164-65 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (citing, inter\nalia, Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295 (2d Cir. 1995)).  \n6\n\nentitled to relief against the State officers named here as defendants.\nA. Title II of the ADA Did Not Effectively Abrogate\nthe States’ Eleventh Amendment Immunity to Suit \nFor Discrimination Based On Disability in the Provision of Dormitory Housing\nTitle II of the ADA contains a provision which purports to abrogate the States’\nEleventh Amendment immunity.  42 U.S.C. § 12202.  However, the Supreme Court’s recent\ndecision in Tennessee v. Lane, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. 1978 (2004), compels the conclusion\nthat this provision, as applied to the facts of this case, was not a valid exercise of Congress’\nabrogation power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.4\nThe Supreme Court has concluded that § 5 authorizes Congress to “remedy and\ndeter violation of rights guaranteed [by the Fourteenth Amendment] by prohibiting a somewhat\nbroader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment’s text.” \nKimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 81 (2000).  However, such remedial and\npreventive measures “may not work a ‘substantive change in the governing law.”  Lane, ___ U.S.\n___, 124 S. Ct. at 1986.  In determining whether Congress has acted within the scope of its § 5\nauthority to abrogate States’ sovereign immunity, the Court has set out a three-part “congruence\nand proportionality” test.  See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997).  A court must\n(1) identify with some precision the scope of any fundamental constitutional right at issue, (2)\ndetermine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional conduct by the\nStates, and (3) if so, analyze whether the statute is an appropriate, congruent and proportional\nresponse to that history and pattern of unconstitutional treatment.  See Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of\n4 The Fourteenth Amendment provides the only basis for Congress to abrogate the\nState’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Congress may not effect abrogation under its Article I\ncommerce power.  Board of Trustees of Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 364 (2001).  \n7\n\nAlabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365 and 374 (2001), Boerne, 521 U.S. at 520.  \nIn Garrett, the Court concluded that Title I of the ADA, prohibiting disability\ndiscrimination in public employment, was not a valid exercise of Congress’ § 5 abrogation\npower, because Title I was unsupported by a relevant history and pattern of constitutional\nviolations by the State.  Garrett, 531 U.S. at 368.  As the Court noted, neither the ADA’s\nlegislative findings nor its legislative history reflected a concern that the States had been\nengaging in a pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination; rather, the focus was\ndiscrimination in employment in the private sector, while no mention was made of public\nemployment.  Garrett, 531 U.S. at 371-72.  \nIn Lane, the Court observed that Title II sought, inter alia, to enforce a variety of\nbasic constitutional guarantees, infringements of which are subject to more searching judicial\nreview than is employment discrimination. ___ U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. at 1988.  At issue in Lane\nwas the fundamental right of access to the courts, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  Following the Boerne\nanalysis, the Court then considered the question of whether there was a history of violations by\nthe States of these specific constitutional guarantees, as reflected in the legislative history of the\nADA.  The Court noted numerous references in that legislative history regarding barriers to the\naccess of the courts by disabled individuals.  Lane, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. at 1990-91.\nThe Court then turned to the third part of the Boerne test, the congruence and\nproportionality aspect.  After observing that Title II “reaches a wide array of official conduct in\nan effort to enforce an equally wide array of constitutional guarantees,” the Court declined to\nconsider Title II as an “undifferentiated whole.”  Lane, 124 S. Ct. at 1992.  Rather, the Court\n8\n\nconcluded that the relevant enquiry was whether Congress had the power under § 5 to enforce a\nspecific constitutional guarantee at issue in the case at hand – there, the right of access to the\ncourts.  124 S. Ct. at 1993.  Because the remedy imposed by Title II – a duty to provide\nreasonable accommodations – was consonant with remedies imposed in other contexts to ensure\na right of access to the courts, the Supreme Court found Title II to be congruent and proportional\nas it applied to ensure a right of access to the courts.  124 S. Ct. at 1994.  See also Miller v. King,\n2004 WL 2035197 (11th Cir. Sept. 14, 2004) (discussing and applying Lane analysis).\nThe Boerne/Lane analysis,5 applied to the facts of this case, compels the\nconclusion that Title II of the ADA, in the context of dormitory housing, does not effectively\nabrogate the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity.  As a threshold matter, dormitory housing\nis not a constitutionally protected fundamental right.  In Lane, the Court provided exemplars of\nfundamental rights, such as voting, marrying, property interests implicated by zoning decisions,\ninvoluntary commitment, and jury service. ___ U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. at 1989-1990 (listing cases). \nThe Supreme Court has held that there is no fundamental right to housing.  See Lindsey v.\nNormet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972).6  In addition, and more specifically, the Second Circuit has held that\n5 The Supreme Court’s decision in Lane appears to require the abandonment of the\nanalysis announced in Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Center of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 109-111 (2d\nCir. 2001).  The Garcia court held that Title II in its entirety is neither congruent nor proportional\nwith the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus limited abrogation to those cases\nin which a plaintiff establishes that the violation at issue was motivated by discriminatory animus\nor ill will based on his or her disability.  Under the analysis in Lane, discriminatory animus is\nirrelevant where no fundamental right is implicated.  See Roe v. Johnson, 2004 WL 1944460 at\n*5 n.9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2004).\n6 See also Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 216 (1976) (Burger, C.J., dissenting)\n(“[E]ven interests of such import in our society as public education and housing do not qualify as\n‘fundamental rights’ for equal protection purposes.”).\n9\n\ndormitory housing is not a fundamental right.  See Bynes v. Toll, 512 F.2d 252, 255 (2d Cir.\n1975) (considering challenge to SUNY dormitory policy barring children of dormitory residents\nfrom living in the dormitory; “it is well established that the right to housing is not a fundamental\ninterest which would require the more stringent ‘compelling state interest’ test”) (citing Lindsey\nv. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 73-74 (1972)).   Indeed, dormitory housing is not available for the vast\nmajority of CUNY students.  \nEven if there were a fundamental right to dormitory housing, there can be no\neffective abrogation unless the legislative history reflects Congressional findings of a pattern of\nState discrimination in the provision of dormitory housing.  In the absence of such Congressional\nfindings, there can be no effective abrogation.  See, e.g., Roe v. Johnson, 2004 WL 1944460 at\n*6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2004) (no abrogation found where “[t]he legislative record for the ADA\n[did] not include any findings documenting a pattern of state discrimination in the admission of\nattorneys to the bar, or more generally in the granting of licenses to professionals.”).   The\nlegislative history of the ADA does not include any findings documenting a pattern of State\ndiscrimination in the provision of dormitory housing.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12101; S. Rep. No. 101-\n116 (1989); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485 parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n267 (part 2 at page 311 contains a lone reference to physical accessibility of a dormitory, in\nwhich no State involvement is indicated); H.R. Conf. Rep. 101-558 (1990); H.R. Conf. Rep. No.\n101-596 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 565.  In fact, to the extent that the legislative\nhistory touches on the broader issue of housing (which it does in the context of Title III, the\n“public accommodations” provision which only governs private entities), see H.R. REP.\n101-485(IV) at 55,  1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 512, 544, it explicitly relies on Congress’ Article I\n10\n\ncommerce clause power, which cannot serve as a basis for abrogation. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at\n364 (“Congress may not, of course, base its abrogation of the States’ Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity upon the powers enumerated in Article I.”).\nBecause the application of Title II of the ADA to dormitory residents, like ADA\nTitle I’s general prohibition of employment discrimination, does not enforce a basic\nconstitutional guarantee secured by § 5  whose violation would trigger a higher standard of\nreview, and because there is no legislative history indicating Congressional findings sufficient to\nsupport abrogation, the congruence and proportionality enquiries are not implicated.  Title II of\nthe ADA did not effect a valid waiver of the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity in the\ncontext of dormitory housing.   .\nB. Section 504 of the Rehab Act Did Not Effectively Abrogate\nthe States’ Eleventh Amendment Immunity to Suit \nFor Discrimination Based On Disability in the Provision of Dormitory Housing\nThe Rehab Act also contains a provision which purports to abrogate the States’\nEleventh Amendment immunity.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(1).  Because § 504 of the Rehab Act\nand Title II of the ADA offer essentially the same protections, the Second Circuit has held that\nthese statutes are subject to the same Eleventh Amendment analysis. See Garcia v. S.U.N.Y.\nHealth Center of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 113 (2d Cir. 2001) (superseded in other respects by\nTennessee v. Lane, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. 1978 (2004)).  \nAs set forth in Point I.A. supra, dormitory housing is not a fundamental right. \nEven if it were, the legislative history of the Rehab Act is devoid of reference to dormitory\nhousing, or even the broader category of housing.  Still less does it reference any pattern of State\ndiscrimination in that arena.  \n11\n\nBecause the application of the Rehab Act to dormitory residents, like ADA Title\nI’s general prohibition of employment discrimination, does not enforce a basic constitutional\nguarantee secured by § 5  whose violation would trigger a higher standard of review, and because\nthere is no legislative history indicating Congressional findings sufficient to support abrogation,\nthe congruence and proportionality enquiries are not implicated.  The Rehab Act did not effect a\nvalid waiver of the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity in the context of dormitory housing.\nC. The FHA Contains No Abrogation of the States’ Eleventh Amendment Immunity\nThe Fair Housing Act contains no provision unequivocally abrogating the States’\nEleventh Amendment immunity.7  Accordingly, the Eleventh Amendment bars plaintiff’s FHA\nclaim.  See Welch v. Century 21 Chimes Real Estate Inc., 1999 WL 29950 at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Feb.\n27, 1991) (noting absence of abrogation provision); see also De Jesus-Keolamphu v. Village of\nPelham Manor, 999 F. Supp. 556, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (based on Eleventh Amendment,\ngranting motion to dismiss claims against State defendants for monetary damages under, inter\nalia, Fair Housing Act).  \nBecause Congress did not abrogate the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity for\nthe claims set forth in the Amended Complaint, each of plaintiff’s claims must be dismissed in\n7 In any event, the Fair Housing Amendments Act was passed pursuant to the\nCommerce Clause.  See Groome Resources Ltd. v. Parish of Jefferson, 234 F.3d 192, 195 (5th\nCir. 2000).  The Congress does not, however, have the power to abrogate unilaterally the States’\nimmunity under Article I; rather, it may only do so when its acts under § 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.  Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 59-73 (1996).\n12\n\ntheir entirety as against CUNY/Hunter College, and plaintiff’s claims for damages8 against the\nindividual defendants require dismissal.\nPoint II\nPlaintiff Lacks Standing to Sue Under the Fair Housing Act\nThe Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., prohibits discrimination “in the\nsale or rental” to a “buyer or renter” because of a handicap.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1).  The Act\ndefines “to rent” as “to lease, to sublease, to let or otherwise to grant for a consideration the right\nto occupy premises not owned by the occupant.”  42 U.S.C. § 3602(e) (emphasis added).  The\ncomplaint is devoid of allegations to establish that Plaintiff is a “buyer or renter” within the\nmeaning of the Fair Housing Act.  Indeed, Plaintiff does not “rent” dormitory housing from\nHunter College within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act, because Hunter College provides\ndormitory housing to Honors College participants such as Plaintiff free of charge.  Plaintiff Aff. ¶\n4.9  \n8 Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that punitive damages may not be awarded\nin private suits brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (Title II of the ADA) or 29 U.S.C. §\n794(a) (§ 504 of the Rehab Act).  Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 189 (2002).  Plaintiff’s\nclaims for punitive damages under these statutes must be dismissed.\n9 A court considering whether standing exists under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) may\nconsider extrinsic material.  United States v. Vasquez, 145 F.3d 74, 80 (2d Cir. 1998); Kamen v.\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph Co., 791 F.2d 1006, 1011 (2d Cir. 1986).   A court\nconsidering a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) may consider the following materials:  (1) facts alleged\nin the complaint and documents attached to it or incorporated in it by reference, (2) documents\n\"integral\" to the complaint and relied upon in it, even if not attached or incorporated by\nreference, (3) documents or information contained in defendant's motion papers if plaintiff has\nknowledge or possession of the material and relied on it in framing the complaint, and (4) facts\nof which judicial notice may properly be taken under Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. \nIn re Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 273 F. Supp. 2d 351, 356-57 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (footnotes\nomitted).\n13\n\nPlaintiff has argued that “in addition to barring discrimination in the sale or rental\nof dwellings, the statute specifically and repeatedly makes it unlawful to ‘otherwise make\nunavailable or deny’ the right to use property because of a handicap.”  Pl. Reply Mem. on TRO at\n2, citing 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1) et al.  This construction ignores the plain language of the very\nstatute plaintiff cites, which bars discrimination “in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make\nunavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap . . . .”  42 U.S.C. §\n3604(f)(1) (emphasis added).10  If one is not a “buyer” or “renter” as defined in the Act, the\n“otherwise make unavailable” language is inapplicable.  Plaintiff’s Fair Housing Act claim must\nbe dismissed due to her lack of standing.\nPoint III\nPlaintiff Fails to State a Claim Under § 504 of the Rehab Act,\nTitle II of the ADA, or the Fair Housing Act\nA. Plaintiff Is Not “Otherwise Qualified” for Residence in the Hunter College\nDormitory, Within the Meaning of Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehab Act\nTo state a claim for violation of § 504 of the Rehab Act, a plaintiff must show (1)\nthat she is a “handicapped” or “disabled” person within the meaning of the statutes; (2) that she\nis “otherwise qualified” for the program at issue; (3) that she is being excluded from the program\n10 The case cited by plaintiff for this proposition, Woods v. Foster, 884 F. Supp.\n1169 (D. Ill. 1995), is from another jurisdiction and its reasoning does not appear to have been\nadopted elsewhere in the ten years since its issuance.  In any event, Woods is distinguishable as\nthe defendant program in essence received the “rental” sum from a third party pursuant to a\ncontract for the housing of these residents (as opposed to a grant for funding general operations). \nPlaintiff’s citation to Anonymous v. Goddard Riverside Community Ctr., Inc., 1997 WL 475165\n(S.D.N.Y. July 18, 1997) is misplaced.  Judge Scheindlin in fact dismissed that plaintiff’s FHA\nclaim, and only “assume[d]” “for purposes of this motion” that plaintiff’s receipt of federal funds\nconstituted consideration for plaintiff’s housing.  Id. at n.4.\n14\n\nsolely by reason of her disability; and (4) that the program exists as part of a program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.  Doe v. New York University, 666 F.2d 761, 774 (2d Cir.\n1981) (reversing mandatory preliminary injunction which had ordered NYU medical school to\nreadmit medical student who was told to move out of her dormitory room and stop attending\nclasses, based on her history of self-harm, suicide attempts, and threatening behavior to others). \nTo establish a violation of Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must show that (1) she is a qualified\nindividual with a disability; (2) she is being excluded from participation in, or being denied the\nbenefits of some service, program or activity by reason of her disability; and (3) the entity which\nprovides the service, program or activity is a public entity.  Atkins v. County of Orange, 251 F.\nSupp. 2d 1225, 1231 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).\nPlaintiff bears the burden of establishing that she is “otherwise qualified” for\nresidence in the Hunter College dormitory.  Doe v. NYU, 666 F.2d at 777. This requirement\n“refers to a person who is qualified in spite of her handicap[;] an institution is not required to\ndisregard the disabilities of a handicapped applicant, provided the handicap is relevant to\nreasonable qualifications for acceptance, or to make substantial modifications in its reasonable\nstandards or program to accommodate handicapped individuals but may take an applicant’s\nhandicap into consideration, along with all other relevant factors, in determining whether she is\nqualified[.]” 666 F.2d at 775.  Plaintiff does not plead, nor can she establish, that she is otherwise\nqualified for residence within the Hunter College dormitory, under the analysis set forth by the\nSecond Circuit. \nIn Doe v. NYU, the Second Circuit considered at length the meaning of\n“otherwise qualified,” in a strikingly parallel factual situation.  The plaintiff in that case was\n15\n\naccepted to NYU’s medical school after falsely representing in her application that she did not\nhave any chronic or recurrent illnesses or emotional problems.  Despite her academic gifts, she\n“had suffered for many years from serious psychiatric and mental disorders, which evidenced\nthemselves in the form of numerous self-destructive acts and attacks upon others, followed by\nperiodic treatments by psychologists and psychiatrists and admissions to various psychiatric\nhospitals for care and therapy.”  666 F.2d at 766.  She attempted suicide by a variety of methods,\nincluding ingesting sleeping pills and other substances, and she cut herself.  She intermittently\nattended and then terminated therapy.  Plaintiff started attending the NYU medical school in\nSeptember 1975.  666 F.2d at 767.  That fall, the school discovered her history of self-harm and\nsuicide attempts.  However, the school agreed to permit her to remain at the school on the\ncondition that she undertake therapy and monitoring by the school, conditions to which she\nagreed.  However, she did not continue this therapy, and bled herself.  The school directed that\nshe stop attending classes and vacate her dormitory room.  She reapplied, and the school declined\nto admit her after concluding that she did not meet its policy, which required that a student\nseeking readmission “demonstrate that the problems that precipitated the leave are resolved, that\nthe applicant must be able to handle all of the academic and emotional stress of attending\nmedical school, and that the school must be satisfied that the applicant will be able to function\nproperly after graduation as a physician,” and specifically that “she does not pose a significant\nrisk of reexhibiting her prior disorder.”  666 F.2d at 767-69.\nThe plaintiff in that action filed suit under the Rehabilitation Act, seeking\nreadmission to medical school; she also applied for a mandatory preliminary injunction requiring\n16\n\nthe school to readmit her.11    The Second Circuit, considering an appeal of the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction, concluded that she was not “otherwise qualified” for readmission, in light\nof her handicap.  The Court noted that the mere fact of her initial admission to the program did\nnot establish that she was “otherwise qualified,” as she falsely represented that she did not suffer\nfrom any recurrent illnesses or emotional disorders.  666 F.2d at 777.  The Court held, however,\nthat \nNYU . . . was entitled, in determining whether she was qualified, to be advised of\nand to take into account her mental impairment, since it is directly relevant to her\nqualifications and bears upon her ability to function as a student and doctor, to get\nalong with other persons, and to withstand stress of the type encountered in\nmedical training and practice.  NYU is of necessity concerned with the safety of\nother students, faculty and patients to whom Doe would be exposed, since this\ncould adversely affect them as well as the success and reputation of its Medical\nSchool activities.  Any harm done by her as a medical student to others, moreover,\nmight expose it to legal liability for knowingly permitting such exposure.\n666 F.2d at 777.  The Court continued, \nIn our view she would not be qualified for readmission if there is a significant risk\nof such recurrence.  It would be unreasonable to infer that Congress intended to\nforce institutions to accept or readmit persons who pose a significant risk of harm\nto themselves or others, even if the chances of harm were less than 50%.  Indeed,\neven if she presents any appreciable risk of such harm, this factor could properly\nbe taken into account in deciding whether, among qualified applicants, it rendered\nher less qualified than others for the limited number of places available.  In view\nof the seriousness of the harm inflicted in prior episodes, NYU is not required to\n11  The district court granted the plaintiff’s application for a preliminary injunction,\nfinding that an additional year’s delay in her medical studies would irreparably harm her, while\nhe concluded that NYU would suffer no hardships.   The Second Circuit reversed the grant of a\npreliminary injunction, finding inter alia that the plaintiff had not in fact demonstrated\nirreparable injury.  “[T]he evidence indicates that there is a significant risk of recurrence of her\nself-destructive and harmful conduct, which NYU should not be required to bear pending trial\nand . . . a substantial basis exists for upholding NYU’s decision to deny her readmission. \nAgainst this . . . plaintiff can only show the hardship of delay of another year in admission to\nmedical school, which as indicated above, she has voluntarily chosen to do in the past.  Thus, the\nbalance of hardships tips in NYU’s favor, not in Doe’s.”  666 F.2d at 778.\n17\n\ngive preference to her over other qualified applicants who do not pose any such\nappreciable risk at all.\nId.   The Court further noted that “her history indicates that although there were no\nmanifestations of disorder for seven years after the earlier episodes in 1963-64, they recurred\nduring the period 1972-1977, indicating that despite a period of dormancy they may recur again.” \n666 F.2d at 778. \nPlaintiff here cannot meet the standard that requires her to be “otherwise\nqualified” for readmission to the dormitory.  By her allegations, she is substantially limited in the\nactivities of sleeping, eating, and interacting with others, and in taking care of herself.  Am.\nCompl. ¶ 8.  These functions are plainly integral to the independent living required in a\ndormitory.  Plaintiff was on medical leave during the majority of her junior year of high school. \nId.  She has previously been hospitalized for depression and self-harm treatment.  Id. and Spann\nDecl. Ex. 1 (letter from Plaintiff to Pamela Burthwright dated June 14, 2004); see Am. Compl. ¶\n12 (referencing letter).  On June 5, 2004, she attempted suicide in her dormitory room, by taking\napproximately 20 Tylenol PM capsules.  Am. Compl. ¶ 10.  Earlier in the year, in January 2004,\nshe was taken by ambulance from the dormitory to Cabrini Hospital, after taking an overdose of\npain medication, which she maintains was accidental.  Plaintiff Aff. ¶ 7.  \nPlaintiff’s June 5, 2004 suicide attempt directly contravened the housing contract\nthat she signed, which provides that\nA student who attempts suicide or in any way attempts to harm him or herself will\nbe asked to take a leave of absence for at least one semester from the Residence\nHall and will be evaluated by the school psychologist or his/her designated\ncounselor prior to returning to the Residence Hall.  Additionally, students with\npsychological issues may be mandated by the Office of Residence Life to receive\ncounseling.\n18\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 13.  The school declined to permit her to return to the dormitory, and notified her\nthat “the [June 5, 2004] incident raises compelling concerns about your safety and well-being in a\ndormitory setting.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 2 (June 21, 2004 letter from Eija Ayravainen to Plaintiff);\nsee Am. Compl. ¶ 13, referencing letter.   Vice President Ayravainen continued, “We believe this\ndecision is in your best interests and the best interests of the Residence Hall community.  Our\ngoal is to enable you to receive intensive mental health counseling in a setting with reduced\npressures and distractions, which will in turn help you return to the Residence Hall better able to\nhandle the challenges of academic and residence life.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 2.  Vice President\nAyravainen indicated that plaintiff would be required to “make an appointment to see Assistant\nDean Madlyn Stokely in the Office of Student Services,” who would “arrange for you to see a\nStudent Services counselor on a regular basis throughout your hiatus from the Residence Hall,”\nand that the counselor “will coordinate with other mental health professionals who may be\nassisting you, as appropriate.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 2.  In response to a later letter from plaintiff’s\ncounsel, the College’s attorney wrote that “in light of the possible harm Ms. [Doe] may cause\nherself and others in the residence Hall, it is not possible to permit her to reside in the room of\nthe Residence Hall.”  Spann Decl. Ex. 3 (July 14, 2004 letter from Linda Chin to David\nGoldfarb); see also Am. Compl. ¶ 17 (referencing letter).  Ms. Chin continued: “We urge Ms.\n[Doe] to receive or to continue to receive intensive mental health counseling.  She may request to\nreturn to college housing starting with the Spring, 2004 semester. [She] must also submit medical\ndocumentation regarding her emotional well-being[.]”  Id.  \nThe pleadings and papers referenced therein demonstrate that Ms. Doe is not\n“otherwise qualified” for dormitory residence, in light of her history of recurrent self-harm and\n19\n\nsuicide attempts.  The College’s maintenance of this qualification rests on reasons which parallel\nthose in Doe v. NYU: a concern that dormitory residence poses inherent stressors, which a\nstudent must be emotionally able to withstand.12  If a student is not able to withstand those\nstressors, the result can be self-harm or even death, with potential attendant negative effects on\nother students.  Plaintiff has attempted suicide in the Hunter College dormitory at least once, and\npossibly twice, indicating difficulty in adjusting to those stressors.  She is not “otherwise\nqualified” for dormitory residence.\nB. The Suicide Provision of the Hunter College Housing Contract \nDoes Not Discriminate on the Basis of Disability\nPlaintiff relies upon the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities\nAct, arguing that she has been discriminated against on the basis of a disability, based on the\ndefendants’ “blanket rule that anyone who attempts suicide must vacate a dormitory room for a\nsemester.”  Pl. Mem. at 8.  By its terms, the Housing Contract suicide provision does not\ndiscriminate against individuals on the basis of disability; the provision rests not on a diagnosis\nof mental illness, but on an action, regardless of the origin or cause of that act (as, for example, a\nsuicide attempt by a student under the influence of alcohol, or in response to the end of a\nromantic relationship).  A suicide attempt is not a disability; indeed, plaintiff does not claim that\n12 Further, CUNY is entitled to be proactive and protect itself from a future lawsuit\nwhich could result from any further attempts by plaintiff to harm herself.  A search reveals\nnumerous examples of wrongful death lawsuits arising out of student suicides, particularly in the\ndormitory setting.  See, e.g., Jain v. State, 617 N.W.2d 293 (Iowa 2000) (father of university\nstudent who committed suicide in his dorm room brought wrongful death action against\nuniversity, claiming that university owed duty to inform student’s parents of previous suicide\nattempt); Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. 361, 429 S.E.2d 190 (1993) (parents of college\nstudent who committed suicide in his dormitory room brought wrongful death action against\ncollege and its physician).\n20\n\nit is her disability.  Rather, as plaintiff notes, her disability is Major Depressive Disorder and\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Plaintiff was originally permitted to reside in the\ndormitory without regard to her disability (which, as plaintiff alleges, antedates her time at\nHunter College, Am. Compl. ¶ 8), as is any other student with mental disorders. \nIndeed, the policy pursuant to which plaintiff was suspended from the dormitory\napplies not only to her suicidal behavior, but to suicidal behavior by non-disabled individuals. \nAtkins v. County of Orange, 251 F. Supp. 2d 1225 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (granting motion to dismiss\nclaims by mentally ill county jail inmates under, inter alia, Title II and § 504; plaintiffs do not\nallege “that violent and self-destructive inmates who are disabled due to mental illness are treated\nany differently than violent, self-destructive inmates who are not disabled due to mental illness”).\nAt best, plaintiff’s argument is an assertion that she has been discriminated\nagainst based upon the severity of her disability, i.e., that mentally ill students who are not so ill\nas to attempt suicide are treated preferentially to her, by being permitted to remain in the\ndormitory.  Neither the ADA nor the Rehab Act provides a right of action for alleged\ndiscrimination vis-a-vis other handicapped individuals.  See Flight v. Gloeckler, 878 F. Supp.\n424, 426 (N.D.N.Y) (“section 504 was not intended to be used to advance claims of\ndiscriminatory distribution of services to handicapped persons under the Rehabilitation Act”),\naff’d, 68 F.3d 61, 63-64 (2d Cir. 1995) (the Rehab Act \"does not clearly establish an obligation to\nmeet [a disabled person's] particular needs vis-a-vis the needs of other handicapped individuals,\nbut mandates only that services provided nonhandicapped individuals not be denied [to a\ndisabled person] because he is handicapped.\") (quoting P.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033, 1041\n(2d Cir. 1990)); Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611, 618 (2d Cir. 1999) (reversing\n21\n\ninjunction requiring City to provide safety monitoring services to Medicaid recipients who\nsuffered from mental disabilities that caused them to require assistance with daily living tasks;\n“services that New York provides to the mentally disabled are no different from those provided\nto the physically disabled”), cert. denied 531 U.S. 864 (2000).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s amended complaint requires dismissal.\nDate: New York, New York\nOctober 27, 2004\nRespectfully submitted,\nELIOT SPITZER\nAttorney General of the State of New York\nAttorney for Defendants \nBy:\n                       /s/                                \nKATHRYN C.
