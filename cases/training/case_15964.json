    "summary": "<p>On June 26th, 2000, several housing tenants filed a lawsuit, known as King v. Blakely, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. Plaintiffs sued the Blakely Housing Authority (“BHA”) under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. §3601), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs, represented by a combination of public interest and private attorneys, sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the Blakely Housing Authority to change its racially discriminatory housing policies. Plaintiffs also sought money damages as applicable. </p><p>Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the BHA racially-segregated its housing projects, with African-American residents being placed in certain projects and white residents being placed in others. Plaintiffs further alleged that one project was reserved almost exclusively for whites since it was built, while other four projects operated by BHA are currently over 90% occupied by African Americans, with few or no white residents. Additionally, plaintiffs alleged multiple instances of misconduct by the Executive Director of BHA, including that he made statements indicating his intention to maintain racial segregation in BHA housing and that he retaliated against plaintiffs by refusing to grant them housing when they participated in a demonstration against the segregated housing at Blakely.</p><p>Immediately after filing their initial complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class. Before the motion was decided, on June 10th, 2002, the federal government filed a case against Blakely Housing Authority in United States v. Blakely. This action alleged the same misconduct that King v. Blakely alleged. After this case was filed, the court granted the motion to certify the class on September 18th, 2003. The class was certified as: “all past, present, and future African-American tenants and applicants of BHA, who were, are, or will be subjected to racial discrimination”</p><p>Eventually, the parties entered a consent decree, which was approved by the court on March 21st, 2005. The terms of the consent decree required the BHA to “create and submit for approval to the United States and HUD written Uniform and Nondiscriminatory Procedures for: (1) receiving, handling, processing, rejecting, and approving rental inquiries and applications made in-person, by telephone, or by other means; (2) assigning prospective tenants to new units; and (3) transferring existing tenants to different units.” Furthermore, the consent decree required BHA to send a certified check for $190,000 to the attorneys for private plaintiffs and another check for attorneys fees for plaintiff.</p><p>Finally, the terms of the consent decree were set for four years. The consent decree was terminated after the period elapsed in 2009. Then the case closed.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiffs Queen King, Sharon Johnson, and Evelyn Reed, on behalf of themselves and a \nclass of past, present, and future African-American tenants and applicants of the Blakely Housing \nAuthority who were, are, or will be subjected to racial discrimination, along with plaintiffs Bonita \nMays, individually, and the Concerned Citizens Committee of Blakely and Early County, Georgia \n(collectively “Private Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint on June 26, 2000 against the City of Blakely \nHousing Authority (BHA) and its executive director Dan Cooper.  In their complaint, Private \nPlaintiffs allege that the BHA and Dan Cooper: (1) established, maintained, and perpetuated a \nracially-segregated and unequal system of low-income public housing; (2) subjected African-\nAmerican tenants of the BHA to more onerous terms and conditions in the rental of housing \nbecause of their race and/or color; and (3) retaliated against Private Plaintiffs for organizing and \nprotesting against the allegedly discriminatory conduct.  Specifically, Private Plaintiffs claim that \nsuch conduct violates the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as \namended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq. (specifically \n42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), (b), (c); 3608; and 3617); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d, and its implementing regulations, 24 C.F.R. §§ 1.1-1.10; the Georgia Fair \nHousing Law, Ga. Code Ann. §§ 8-3-200, et seq. (2002), and its implementing regulations, Ga. \nComp. R. & Regs. 186-2-.02(1) and (2) (2001); the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution; Article I, § 1, Part V of the Constitution of the State of Georgia; \nand 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983.  The BHA and Dan Cooper deny all of the Private Plaintiffs’ \nallegations and contend that they have taken effective steps to address and prevent any racial \ndiscrimination at the BHA.  \n- 2 - \n \n\n \n  By order dated September 17, 2003, the Court certified a class, under Rule 23(b)(2), Fed. \nR. Civ. P., consisting of all past, present, and future African-American tenants and applicants of \nthe Blakely Housing Authority who were, are, or will be subjected to racial discrimination, in \nviolation of the constitutional provisions, laws, rules and regulations set forth in the preceding \nparagraph (the “Class”).  Plaintiffs Queen King, Sharon Johnson and Evelyn Reed are the “Class \nRepresentatives.” \n  The United States filed its complaint on June 10, 2002, to enforce the provisions of the \nFair Housing Act (“FHA”), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair \nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.  The United States’ complaint \nalleges that Defendants the Blakely Housing Authority and Dan Cooper: (1) refused to rent, \nrefused to negotiate for the rental of, or otherwise made unavailable dwellings because of the race \nor color of renters, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) and (b); (2) made statements with respect \nto the rental of dwellings that indicate a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race or \ncolor, or an intention to make such preference, limitation, or discrimination, in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 3604(c); and (3) coerced, intimidated, threatened or interfered with persons in the \nexercise or enjoyment of, or on account of their having exercised or enjoyed, their rights under \nthe FHA, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3617.  The BHA and Dan Cooper also deny all of the United \nStates’ allegations and contend that they have taken effective steps to address and prevent any \nracial discrimination at the BHA. \nII.  THE PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS \n  At all times relevant to this case, the BHA operated multifamily residential rental \nproperties totaling approximately 159 dwelling units in five apartment complexes in Blakely, \n- 3 - \n \n\n \nGeorgia: Cedar Hills Apartments; Willis Cain Apartments; Cedar Hills II Apartments; Willis Cain \nII Apartments; and Baptist Branch Apartments (\"BHA apartment complexes\"). \n  First, the Private Plaintiffs allege that since at least 1994 the BHA and Dan Cooper have \nengaged in improper steering based on race at its apartment complexes.  Specifically, Defendants \nhave established, maintained and perpetuated racially segregated housing by selecting housing \napplicants to fill apartment vacancies based on race, rather than in compliance with the BHA’s \nwritten policy establishing specific, non-race-based methods for filling vacancies.  For example, \nthe BHA, through its executive director Dan Cooper, repeatedly violated its own written policies \nby allowing White applicants to skip over Black applicants with higher positions on the BHA \nwaiting lists so that the White applicants could be placed in Cedar Hills II, which the BHA \nreserved for White tenants. \nSecond, Private Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have imposed more onerous terms and \nconditions of rental on African-American tenants than White tenants.  For example, Dan Cooper \nconducted armed patrols of the predominately African-American areas of the apartment \ncomplexes, and harassed and detained African-American tenants and their guests, without \nprovocation, while not engaging in such conduct in the predominately White areas of the \ncomplexes. \nLastly, Private Plaintiffs allege that Defendants retaliated against them for forming a \ntenants’ association to address the discriminatory conduct, as well as for engaging in public \nprotests about such conduct.  Such retaliation included attempted evictions, attempted transfers of \ntenants to different apartments, increased rents and the imposition of late fees.  The BHA and Dan \nCooper deny all of the Private Plaintiffs’ allegations and contend that they have taken effective \nsteps to address and prevent any racial discrimination at the BHA. \n- 4 - \n \n\n \nIII.  THE UNITED STATES’ ALLEGATIONS \n  From 1994 until at least 1998, the BHA, under the direction of executive director Dan \nCooper, deliberately reserved the Cedar Hills II complex for White residents and steered African-\nAmerican tenants to BHA’s other complexes, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.  Defendants \naccomplished this result, the United States alleges, by violating the BHA’s own policies and \nprocedures that were designed to ensure the color-blind assignment of apartments.  In addition, \nthe United States alleges that the BHA, through Dan Cooper, made repeated statements \nexpressing a preference to exclude African-Americans from living at Cedar Hills II.  Finally, the \nUnited States claims that the Defendants harassed and intimidated African-American tenants who \nobjected to the discriminatory practices.  The BHA and Dan Cooper deny all of the United States’ \nallegations and contend that they have taken effective steps to address and prevent any racial \ndiscrimination at the BHA. \nIV.  AGREEMENT \n  The Private Plaintiffs, the United States, Dan Cooper, and the BHA desire to avoid costly \nand protracted litigation and agree that the claims against the Defendants should be settled \nwithout further litigation or an evidentiary hearing.  Therefore, the Private Plaintiffs, the United \nStates, Dan Cooper, and the BHA have agreed to the entry of this Consent Order.  \nTHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \nJURISDICTION AND SCOPE \n1.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims in the civil action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, 1345, and 1367(a); and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3613 and 3614(a). \n- 5 - \n \n\n \n2.  The provisions of this Consent Order apply to Dan Cooper, the City of Blakely Housing \nAuthority, its employees, officials, officers, and agents, as well as any entity, company, or \nperson who purchases, manages, or operates any of the BHA apartment complexes. \n3.  All provisions contained herein have been reviewed and approved by the U.S. Department \nof Housing and Urban Development (HUD). \n4.  This Consent Order is a settlement of disputed claims.  The Consent Order is entered into \nwithout any admission by the BHA or Dan Cooper of having engaged in any \ndiscriminatory practices proscribed by the FHA or any other federal or state statute.  The \nPrivate Plaintiffs and the United States shall have the right to present evidence of the \nBHA’s non-compliance in any context or situation.  The BHA and Dan Cooper shall have \nthe right to present evidence of compliance in any context or situation.    \nGENERAL NONDISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS \n5.  The BHA, its employees, agents, and all those acting in concert or participation with them, \nas well as any entity, company, or person who manages or operates any of the BHA \napartment complexes, are hereby enjoined from: \na.  Refusing to rent a dwelling, refusing or failing to provide or offer information \nabout a dwelling, or otherwise making unavailable or denying a dwelling to \npersons because of race or color; \nb.  Discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental \nor sale of a dwelling or in the provision of services or facilities in connection \ntherewith, including engaging in any harassment or intimidation, because of race or \ncolor; \n- 6 - \n \n\n \nc.

Within fourteen (14) days of the United States’ and HUD’s approval of \n- 7 - \n \n\n \nthe Uniform and Nondiscriminatory Procedures, the BHA shall implement such written \nUniform and Nondiscriminatory Procedures. \n8.  Availability Lists: As of the date of entry of this Order, the BHA shall maintain current, \naccurate lists of all dwellings available or expected to be available for rental within the \nnext thirty (30) days (\"Availability Lists\"), which include for each dwelling: \na.

The BHA shall note \non the Visitor Log the dwelling units the person was shown, whether the person was given \nan application, and the name of the BHA employee who attended to the visitor.  The \nVisitor Log shall contain a space in which the visitor may voluntarily note his or her race \nand national origin.  Should a visitor not fill in this space, the BHA shall fill it in based on \nthe good faith observations of an employee or agent.  The top portion of the Visitor Log \nshall contain the following disclaimer: \"The following information is requested to assist the \nBlakely Housing Authority in complying with the federal Fair Housing Act and will be \n- 8 - \n \n\n \nkept confidential.  Providing your race is voluntary and this information is not required in \norder to rent an apartment.\" \n10.  Preference Indicator: Within one-hundred twenty (120) days of the entry of this Order, the \nBHA shall create and submit for approval to the United States and HUD a form that \ncarefully and fully explains to each applicant each of the “preferences” that are available \nunder the BHA’s Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy (ACOP), and that \nprovides a space where each applicant can indicate which preference(s) he or she believes \nhe or she is entitled to and why he or she holds that belief.  In addition, the BHA shall \nrequire applicants to sign the Preference Indicator forms stating that they understand the \nvarious preferences and have had an opportunity to apply for each one that they believe \nthey are entitled to.  The BHA shall indicate on that form whether each preference was \ngranted, the date of that decision, and the name of the BHA employee who assisted the \napplicant.  Also, the BHA shall indicate on that form which document(s) (or lack thereof) \njustify the decision to grant (or deny) each preference and attach such supporting \ndocuments.  Except with respect to the “substandard housing” preference, if written \nrecords are not available to justify a particular preference, the applicant shall not be \neligible for that preference.  If an applicant claims a substandard housing preference, and \nno documentation thereof is available, a BHA employee shall visit the dwelling claimed to \nbe substandard to make visual observations of the physical condition of the dwelling, and \nshall complete and sign an affidavit documenting the visit, the location, a description of the \nproperty and the observations he or she makes concerning the physical condition of the \ndwelling.

If the BHA employee visiting such \ndwelling does not make such determination, the BHA employee who does so shall make \nthe determination based on the contents of such affidavit and shall ensure that the \nrequirements of this Paragraph concerning the contents of the Preference Indicator forms \nare satisfied.   The Preference Indicator shall be updated for each applicant when that \napplicant becomes one of the top five members of the waiting list.  Within fourteen (14) \ndays of the United States’ and HUD’s approval of the Preference Indicator, the BHA shall \nimplement the Preference Indicator. \n11.  Wait Lists: As of the date of entry of this Order, the BHA shall maintain waiting lists for \neach size unit that contains each applicant’s name and race (based on the information filled \nout by the applicant on the Visitor Log or if that information is not provided on the \nemployee's or agent's good faith observation), current address, daytime and evening \ntelephone number, the number of intended occupants, and a description of the dwelling for \nwhich each applicant is eligible (e.g. number of bedrooms).  The BHA shall also indicate, \nfor each applicant, the time and date he or she was placed on the list and the name of the \nBHA employee who received the applicant’s application.  The rank of each applicant on \nthe waiting list shall be determined in accordance with the BHA’s ACOP.

If the \nhighest-ranking applicant is not offered a unit or is not offered the first unit that has \nbecome ready for rental, the BHA shall fully explain why on the Placement Log, attaching \nany supporting documentation.  \n13.  Rental Applications: The BHA shall write legibly on each rental application filled out by a \nprospective tenant the month, day, year, and time that the BHA received the application.  \nThe BHA shall process the applications in the order in which they are received.

Subsequent fees for bills that remain unpaid for longer periods \nshall not  exceed 10 percent of the unpaid balance.  For example, a tenant who has \na rent of $50 a month and is late paying that rent shall be charged $10 for the first \nmonth and $5 for any subsequent months that that particular month’s rent remains \nunpaid.  Under no circumstances shall these late fees be cumulative. \nh.

AL. \nDefendants, \nORDER \nPresently pending before this Court is the parties' proposed settlement agreement and \nconsent order (\"Settlement agreement\") and stipulation thereto (Tabs 184, 185) ofwhich the \nCourt had previously granted the Plaintiffs' request for preliminary approval. (Tab 186). \nBefore the Court is the decision for final approval of the parties' proposed settlement of all \nAfrican-American persons residing in public housing owned and maintained by Defendant City \nof Blakely Housing Authority who were discriminated against concerning housing \naccommodations, based on their race from 1994 until at least 1998.  Having conducted a \nfairness hearing and heard from the parties and objectors, the Court approves the proposed \nConsent Decree and certifies the settlement-only class for the reasons discussed below. \n1 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 2 of 11(cid:10)\nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis case originally was filed on June 26, 2000,  as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) class action \nagainst Defendants City of Blakely Housing Authority (\"BHA\") and its executive director Dan \nCooper.  Plaintiffs' alleged that Defendants: (1) established, maintained, and perpetuated a \nracially-segregated and unequal system of low-income housing; (2) subjected African \nAmerican tenants of BHA to more onerous terms and conditions in the rental of housing \nbecause of their race; and, (3) retaliated against individual Plaintiffs for organizing and \nprotesting the alleged discriminatory conduct.  Plaintiffs' filed suit pursuant to the Fair Housing \nAct, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Act of 1988, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, et. seq.; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. § 2000d; the \nGeorgia Fair Housing Law, O.C.G.A. §§ 8-3-200, et. seq.; the Thirteenth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution; Article I,§ 1, Part V ofthe Georgia \nConstitution; and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983. \nOn September 17, 2003, the Court certified the class pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.Pro. \n23(b )(2) consisting of all past, present, and future African-American tenants and applicants of \nBHA, who were, are, or will be subjected to racial discrimination.  Plaintiffs Queen King, \nSharon Johnson and Evelyn Reed are the class representatives. \nOn June 10, 2002, the United States filed it complaint against Defendants to enforce the \nprovisions of the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"), and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act. \nSpecifically, the United States alleged that Defendants: (1) refused to rent, refused to negotiate \nfor the rental of, or otherwise make available apartments because ofthe race of the individuals; \nmade statements with respect to the rental of apartments that indicated a preference for the race \nof the renter; and, (3) coerced, intimidated, threatened or interfered with renters in violation of \ntheir rights under the FHA. \nUpon consolidation of the two cases for discovery and for trial, extensive discovery and \nresolution of certain dispositive motions the case was scheduled for a bench trial for the May \n2 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 3 of 11(cid:10)\n2004 Albany Trial Term.  On May 6, 2004, the parties requested a continuance in order to \npursue settlement of the case.  (Tab 176).  The case was continued from the May Term, and \nsubsequent terms for the terms of the settlement to be reached and approved by the various \nparties.  (Tab 176, 177, 180, 182).  On September 17,2004, the parties filed amotion for \npreliminary approval of the settlement agreement and a stipulation relating thereto. (Tabs 184, \n185).  The motion for preliminary approval also contained the actual settlement agreement. \n(Tab 184). \nThe Court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement agreement on \nSeptember 30, 2004.  In its order, the Court scheduled a \"fairness hearing\" and ordered parties \nto disseminate, according to the terms ofthe consent agreement, two forms of notice to the \nClass informing members of the proposed settlement agreement, the fairness hearing, and the \nprivate attorneys request for fees and costs incurred in litigating this action and obtaining the \nsettlement agreement. None of the class members filed objections to the settlement or the \nrequest for fees and costs. \nOn January 26, 2005,  a fairness hearing was held to afford parties, objectors and non \nclass members the opportunity to present evidence and be heard.  At the hearing, no one \nappeared to object to the settlement.  Further, the parties submitted evidence that the notices \nwere properly disseminated to the class members and the public. \nII.  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TERMS \nThe proposed settlement agreement includes the following non-monetary relief, \nmonetary relief and a sunset provision to the named Plaintiffs and perspective class members. \nA.  Non-Monetary Relief \nWith respect to non-monetary relief, BHA will implement certain policies, practices and \nprocedures in a nondiscriminatory manner.  First, BHA will be enjoined from refusing to rent a \ndwelling, or provide information related thereto, to persons based on their race.  Second, BHA \nwill be enjoined from discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions, privileges in \n3 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 4 of 11(cid:10)\nthe rental or sale of a dwelling or in the provision of services related thereto, including \nharassment or intimidation, because of race.  Third, BHA shall be enjoined from placing any \nnotice, statement or advertisement with respect to rental or sale of a dwelling that discriminates \non the basis of race.  Fourth, BHA will be enjoined from threatening, coercing or intimidating \nindividuals exercising any rights protected by the FHA. \nIn addition, the agreement calls on BHA to perform certain other affirmative acts.  BHA \nshall comply with Paragraphs 6 through 14 with respect to renting dwellings to ensure \ncompliance with the non-discrimination provisions of the FHA.  Within one hundred and \ntwenty (120) days of the entry of this order, BHA shall create and submit for approval to the \nUnited States and HUD written Uniform and Nondiscriminatory Procedures for renting \napartments, handling inquiries, assigning units and transferring individuals to different units. \nWithin fourteen (14) days of approval of the procedures by the United States and HUD, BHA \nshall implement the procedures.  As further set out in detail in the settlement agreement, BHA \nshall maintain current and accurate lists of available apartments, a visitor's log, preference \nindicator, waiting list for each size apartment, a placement log, rental applications, and shall \nprovide certain information to prospective applicants.  BHA shall implement a training \nprogram, as set out in further detail in the agreement, for its employees.  BHA shall provide \nemployees and board members with  copies of rules and procedures and a copy of this order \nand agreement.  BHA shall also provide tenants with the same, along with certain other notices \nand other documentation.  BHA shall also post in a conspicuous place certain HUD posters and \nforms within 30 days ofthis order.  The settlement agreement also provides for additional \ntesting, reporting requirements, inspections and other matters. \nAs a condition of settlement, Dan Cooper, BRA's Executive Director, shall resign \nwithin thirty (30) days of this order and have no contact with the operation of BHA.  Within \nseven (7) days of Cooper's resignation, Plaintiffs shall, at their own costs,  publish a notice in \nthe Early County News informing the public of his resignation and the terms of the settlement \n4 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 5 of 11(cid:10)\nagreement between the parties. \nB.  Monetary Relief \nBHA will pay to attorneys for Private Plaintiffs a sum of $190,000.00 within fourteen \n(14) days ofthis order or upon disbursement ofthe 2004 Capital Fund Program, whichever is \nlater. (Para. 30).1 This fund, along with the $12,500.00 received from Defendant Dan Cooper, \nwill be dispersed to the individual plaintiffs and class members as set forth in Paragraph 30 of \nthe settlement agreement.2  All payments are contingent upon class representatives, individually \nand in their representative capacities, as set out in Paragraph 30(e) of the settlement agreement, \nsigning a release of claims attached to the settlement agreement as Attachment C.  Pursuant to \nthe settlement between the Plaintiffs and Dan Cooper, Cooper shall pay, within ten (10) \nworking days of this order, $12,500.00 to Private Plaintiffs' attorneys.  The amount shall be \nadded to the amount paid by BHA. \nC.  Agreement Between Private Plaintiffs And BHA \nThere is also a separate provision of terms between the Private Plaintiffs and BHA \nSpecifically, the agreement sets up a procedure BHA shall follow in selecting and hiring a new \nexecutive director for BHA Further, the agreement provides that BHA shall conduct at least \nthree seminars for tenants to explain their rights under the FHA In addition, BHA shall \nforgive past due balances of former tenants who want to move back into BHA and, to the \nextent allowed by law, BHA shall expunge any negative information that might otherwise \nprevent the former tenants from being denied an apartment at BHA.  The agreement provides \nthe terms for BHA to handle late fees, application fees, maintenance fees, maintenance of the \n1 Though not discussed in Paragraph 30 ofthe agreement, BHA will pay Private Plaintiffs \n• \nattorneys $50,000.00 as attorneys fees from the same Capital Fund Program as attorneys fees. (See, \nPara. 34(m).  The total amount paid by Defendants to Private Plaintiffs and their attorneys is \n$252,500.00. \n2 Essentially, the $252,000 settlement amount will be dispersed as follows: $197,500 to be \n• \ndispersed to the various Plaintiffs as damage compensation; $5,000 to be paid as reimbursement \nfor late fees; and $50,000.00 as attorneys fees. \n5 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 6 of 11(cid:10)\nfacilities, security and tenant representation and meetings with the BHA Board of \nCommissioners.  Lastly, the agreement provides for a sum of $50,000, in addition to the \n$190,000, to be paid by BHA to Private Plaintiffs' attorneys.3 \nD.  Sunset Provision \nThe proposed settlement also has a sunset provision.  The Court will retain jurisdiction \nfor four years from the date of final approval to monitor parties' compliance with the \nsettlement.  At the end of the four years, the Court's jurisdiction will then automatically \nterminate without further proceedings. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD FOR APPROVAL OF A CONSENT DECREE \nRule 23( e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires judicial approval of consent \ndecrees/settlement orders.  The court must approve any settlement of the claims and issues of a \ncertified class and it must further give reasonable notice to all class members who would be \nbound by the consent decree.  Fed. R. Civ.P. 23{e){l){A),(B).  However, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23{e) \ndoes not set forth standards for determining fairness of the settlement.  Rather, the Court is \nguided by the established principle in this Circuit that voluntary settlement is the preferred \nmeans of resolving class-action discrimination actions.  See Holmes v. Continental Can Co., \n706 F.2d 1144, 1147 (11th Cir. 1983).  In order to approve the proposed settlement agreement \nthe Court has an independent duty to insure that the decree is \"fair, adequate and reasonable.\" \nBennett v. Behring Corp., 737 F.2d 982, 986 (11th Cir. 1984)(citing Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d \n1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977)).4  As part of determining fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness, \nthe Court must also insure that the proposed settlement agreement is not the product of \ncollusion between the parties.  Id. at 986 (citing Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d at 1330). \na.  The Settlement Agreement Is Fair, Adequate and Reasonable \n3 See, footnote 2, supra. \n• \n4 In Bonner v. City of Prichard. 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en bane), this \n• \ncourt adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior \nto October 1, 1981. \n6 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 7 of 11(cid:10)\nThis Court in deciding whether the settlement agreement is  fair, adequate and \nreasonable will consider certain factors.  Those factors are as follows: (1)  the likelihood of \nsuccess at trial and range of potential recovery; (2) the complexity, expense and duration of \nlitigation; (3) the views of named Plaintiffs and class members; (4) the views of counsel for the \nparties;  (5)  the substance and amount of opposition to the consent decree; and (6) the stage of \nthe proceedings at which the consent decree was achieved.  Meyer v. Citizens and Southern \nNat'l Bank, 677 F.Supp. 1196, 1201 (M.D. Ga. 1988). \ni.  The Likelihood ofS uccess at Trial and Range ofP  otential Recovery \nThe benefit of the settlement agreement to the named Plaintiffs and class members \nshould be compared with the likelihood of success at trial and potential recovery.  At this stage \nof litigation, it can be fairly said, based on the evidence before the Court, that Plaintiffs had a \nvery good likelihood of success on the merits.  While the named Plaintiffs and class members \nfaced many risks affecting the likelihood of a substantial monetary recover, the hurdles facing \ninjunctive relief were less formidable.  Even so, this settlement provides Plaintiffs with a \nsubstantial monetary settlement and nearly all of their requested injunctive relief. With respect \nto the recovery under the settlement agreement, named Plaintiffs and class members obtained a \nmajority of the requests for relief specified in their complaint. \nii.  The Complexity, Expense and Duration ofL itigation \nThe class action itself would have taken substantially more time and money to litigate \nbecause of the complexity of the claims as alleged, statistical evidence and confrontational \nexpert reports provided by both sides.  A trial on the merits and any subsequent hearing as to \nrecovery would involve contested evaluation of the evidence ultimately determined by the \nfactfinder.  The Court therefore concludes that a settlement is in the best interests of named \nPlaintiffs and class members since further litigation would be protracted, burdensome and \ncostly, without the certainty of recovery. \niii.  The Views ofN  amed Plaintiffs and Class Members \n7 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 8 of 11(cid:10)\nIn determining whether a settlement agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable, the \nCourt must listen to and consider the views of the named Plaintiffs and class members.  The \nsilence of named Plaintiffs and class members may be, but is not always, indicative of class \nwide support.  Reynolds v. King, 790 F.Supp. 1101, 1109 (M.D. Ala. 1990).  A court can \nproperly interpret the absence of objections as support where most of the class is easily \nidentifiable and has consistently expressed interest in the litigation.  !d.  The Court has not \nreceived any objections from the named Plaintiffs or class members.  Moreover, the Court has \nno reason to believe that the proposed settlement agreement treats any named Plaintiff or class \nmember unfairly and there appears to be no overt conflict between any named Plaintiff or class \nmember.  The great weight accorded majority opinion in this instance favors approving the \nsettlement agreement. \niv.  The Views of Counsel for the Parties \nIn class actions, Courts accord great weight to the recommendations of experienced \ncounsel. Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d at 1330.  The Court \"absent fraud, collusion, or the like, \nshould hesitate to substitute its own judgment for that of counseL\" !d.  In the instant action, \ncounsel for both parties recommend that the Court approve the propose settlement agreement. \nCounsel for both parties include exceptional attorneys experienced in class actions, \ndiscrimination cases and complex litigation.  In deciding whether this proposed settlement \nagreement should be approved, the Court has given due consideration to the representations of \ncounsel for both parties that the proposed settlement agreement is fair, adequate and \nreasonable. \nv.  The Substance and Amount of Opposition to the Consent Decree \nIn reviewing the fairness, adequacy and reasonableness of the consent decree, \"the \nnumber of objectors is a factor to be considered but is not controlling.\" Cotton v. Hinton, 559 \nF.2d at 1331.  None of the named Plaintiffs, class members or the public made objections at the \nfairness hearing.  This factor does not militate against settlement. \n8 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 9 of 11(cid:10)\nvi.  The Stage ofP  roceedings at Which the Settlement Was Achieved \nThe proposed settlement agreement was not achieved until both parties had engaged in \ncomprehensive discovery, pursued dispositive motions and been scheduled for trial. All \nnecessary parties were deposed and discovery was completed. The cases had been consolidated \nand the class certified. The Court therefore concludes that there has been a sufficient exchange \nof information between the parties to grant final approval of the proposed settlement \nagreement. \nb.  The Settlement Agreement Is Not A Product of Collusion \nThe Court must consider whether there is any evidence the proposed settlement \nagreement was the product of collusion to determine whether it was the result of arms-length \nbargaining between the parties.  From the onset, this case has been highly adversarial and \ncounsel for both parties have zealously advanced the interests of their respective parties.  The \nparties engaged in genuine and extensive discovery.  The settlement negotiations necessitated \nmultiple extensions before all parties finally, and unanimously, agreed upon the terms of the \nproposed settlement agreement.  At the fairness hearing, there were no objections to the \nsettlement agreement.  The Court finds that there is no evidence that there has been anything \nbut good faith bargaining by all involved and concludes that the proposed settlement agreement \nwas achieved as the result of intense, arms' length negotiation and without collusion. \nIV.  ATTORNEYS FEES, EXPENSES AND COSTS \nUnder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e), the Court must insure that the ultimate distribution of the \nattorneys' fees to Private Plaintiffs attorneys is reasonable to all named Plaintiffs and class \nmembers irrespective of the lack of opposition to the attorneys fee award.  Typically, federal \ncourts follow a practice of requiring a \"prevailing party\" to assume attorneys fees, expenses and \ncosts in civil actions.  Buckhannon Board and Care Home. Inc. v. W.Va. Dept. of Health and \nHuman Res., 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001).  However, in civil rights cases, the Court may \nordinarily award the \"prevailing party'' of a settlement reasonable attorneys fees as part of the \n9 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 10 of 11(cid:10)\ncosts and expenses of the action.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 428 (1983). \nIn order to establish whether one is a \"prevailing party\" as required for an attorneys fees \naward under the civil rights statutes, the Court has to determine: ( 1) whether there is a change \nin the legal relationship between the parties; and (2) whether the actual relief in the settlement \nis material to legally merit an award of attorneys fees.  See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 1840; \nNat'l Coalition for Students with Disabilities v. Bush, 173 F.Supp.2d 1272, 1279 (N.D. Fla. \n2001). \nIn the Eleventh Circuit, the first prong is satisfied where the Court either incorporates \nthe terms of the parties' settlement into the final approval or expressly retains jurisdiction to \nenforce the settlement.  American Disability Ass'n v. Chmielarz, 289 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th \nCir. 2002)(emphasis in original).  Here, the parties' legal relationship has changed, for purposes \nof establishing the first prong of attaining \"prevailing party\" status, since the Defendant has \nvoluntarily agreed to the terms of the settlement and the Court will retain oversight of \ncompliance with the settlement after final approval.  American Disability Ass'n v. Chmielarz, \n289 F.3d at 1320-21; Nat'l Coalition for Students with Disabilities v. Bush, 173 F.Supp.2d at \n1279. \nThe second prong is satisfied when \"actual relief on the merits ... materially alters the \nlegal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that \ndirectly benefits the plaintiff.\" Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1992).  \"'[T]he most \ncritical factor' in determining the reasonableness of a fee award 'is the degree of success \nobtained.\"' I d. at 114 (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. at 436).  The degree of success \nobtained in a settlement can be ascertained by comparing the relief awarded to the relief sought. \nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. at 114.  In the instant action, the terms of the settlement between the \nparties grant virtually every request for relief short of Defendants' admission ofliability. \nSpecifically, named Plaintiffs and class members receive significant monetary relief as well as \nprogrammatic relief.  Further litigation may not have provided the class with the successful \n10 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-00109-WLS     Document 190-1     Filed 03/21/2005     Page 11 of 11(cid:10)\noutcome Plaintiffs' were able to negotiate in the monetary and injunctive relief.  Therefore, the \nCourt is satisfied that the actual relief awarded the class materially alters the legal relationship \nbetween the parties to merit an award of attorneys fees. \nConsequently, the Court concludes that the named Plaintiffs and class members are \n\"prevailing parties.\" Private Plaintiffs attorneys are therefore entitled to attorneys fees as part \nof expenses and costs and the uncontested award of $50,000.00  is reasonable for the relief \nobtained. \nVII.  CONCLUSION \nIn sum, the Court finds that the settlement agreement which provides an aggregate total \nof compensation to Plaintiffs in the amount of$252,000.00 to be disbursed according to the \nterms of the agreement to be fair, equitable and in compliance with the relevant precedent. \nFurther, the Court finds the injunctive and other equitable relief to be appropriate under the \ncircumstances. \nFor the reasons stated above and pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, arguments of counsel, the record and the evidence presented at the fairness hearing \non January 26,2005, the Court hereby ORDERS, ADJUDGES and DECREES that the terms \nof the proposed settlement agreement, is fair, reasonable and adequate and is therefore finally \nand unconditionally APPROVED and ADOPTED.  The proposed settlement order (Tab 184) \nby reference herein is adopted and made a part of this order.  The Court RETAINS jurisdiction \nto enforce the terms of the proposed settlement agreement as herein approved and made final. \nw.~~~   \nSO ORDERED, this J,/J'day \nW.

This complaint is brought as a class action against the City of Blakely Housing \nAuthority (\"BHA\"), City of Blakely, and Dan Cooper, both individually and in his \nofficial capacity, under the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §3601, et seq.; Title \nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and its implementing regulations, \n24 C.F.R. § 1, et seq.; the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983; the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code \nAnn. § 8-3-200, et seq., and its implementing regulations, Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. 186-2-\n.02 (1) and (2) (1998); and Article I, § 1, Part V of the Constitution of the State of \nGeorgia.  \n2. Specifically, Defendants have acted to establish, maintain, and perpetuate a racially-\nsegregated unequal system of low-income public housing and have failed to disestablish \nthat system of public housing. Defendants have also subjected tenants of the Blakely \nHousing Authority to different terms and conditions in the rental of housing on the basis \nof race and/or color and have engaged in retaliatory conduct because of the attempts by \ncertain class members to exercise their rights under the amended Fair Housing Act and \n\nthe free speech provisions of the Constitution of the State of Georgia to challenge \nDefendants’ discriminatory conduct.  \n3. Queen King, Sharon Johnson, and Evelyn Reed (\"class representatives\") bring this \naction as a class action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and for monetary damages incidental thereto. Queen \nKing and Sharon Johnson, along with Bonita Mays and the Concerned Citizens \nCommittee of Blakely and Early County, GA (\"Concerned Citizens Committee\" or \"the \nCommittee\"), also bring this action individually for damages (collectively, along with the \nclass representatives, referred to as \"Plaintiffs\").  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4. Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., in that this \naction involves violations of the amended Fair Housing Act; 42 U.S.C. § 1331, in that \nthis is an action arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States; and \n28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), because this complaint alleges deprivation of Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights under color of law.  \n5. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state law claims pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  \n6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), in that Defendant City \nof Blakely, Georgia (\"City\") is a municipality located in this jurisdiction, Defendant \nBlakely Housing Authority (\"BHA\") is an instrumentality of Defendant City of Blakely, \nGeorgia, located in this jurisdiction, and Defendant Dan Cooper (\"Cooper\") is a resident \nof this jurisdiction. Moreover, all of the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in \nthis jurisdiction and the property that is at issue is located in this jurisdiction.  \nPARTIES \n7. Queen King, Sharon Johnson, Evelyn Reed, and Bonita Mays (collectively referred to \nas \"individual plaintiffs\") are adult African-American women who are either former or \ncurrent tenants of the Blakely Housing Authority who were subjected to Defendants’ \ndiscriminatory housing practices and policies.  \n8. The Concerned Citizens Committee is an organization located in Blakely, Georgia, that \nadvocates for the civil rights, including fair housing rights, of others in and around the \nCity of Blakely, Georgia. The Committee engages in activities to counteract and \neliminate discrimination and protect the rights of its members and constituents to enjoy \nthe benefits of living and working in a non-discriminatory environment. As a result of \nDefendants’ discriminatory conduct, the Committee’s resources have been diverted and \nits efforts have been frustrated. Furthermore, the Committee is a membership \norganization, whose members include all of the class representatives and individual \nplaintiffs, who each have standing to bring this lawsuit in their own right.  \n\n9. The City is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of the State of Georgia. \nThe City established the BHA to manage its public housing. The City appoints the Board \nof Directors and funds the activities of the BHA and acts in concert with it in carrying out \nits housing and redevelopment programs. The City is a recipient of federal financial \nassistance within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  \n10. BHA is a municipal housing authority organized under the laws of the State of \nGeorgia by the City of Blakely. BHA operates and administers a system of low-income \npublic housing in and for the City, including conventional public housing, pursuant to the \nU.S. Housing Act of 1937. BHA owns and operates five public housing projects in and \naround the City of Blakely, with a total of approximately 160 units of rental housing. \nBHA is governed by a Board of Directors and managed by an Executive Director. BHA \nis a recipient of federal financial assistance within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  \n11. Defendant Cooper is the Executive Director of BHA, a position he has held since \n1994. Defendant Cooper’s appointment as Executive Director of BHA was endorsed by \nthe Board of Directors of the BHA and he answers directly to that Board. Defendant \nCooper is responsible for the management of BHA and the enforcement of its rules and \nregulations. As such, he is responsible for establishing final policy with respect to \nDefendant BHA and public housing in Defendant City of Blakely.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n12. The class representatives bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on their own behalf and on behalf of a class \nconsisting of all former, current, and future African-American tenants and applicants of \nBHA who were, are, or will be subjected to the continuing racial segregation and \ndiscrimination and the conditions and effects thereof as alleged herein in contravention of \nthe Constitution and federal and state statutes (\"the Class\").  \n13. The members of the Class are so numerous that the joinder of all members is \nimpractical. See F.R.C.P. 23(a)(1). While the exact number of the class members is \nunknown at this time and can only be ascertained through appropriate discovery, \nPlaintiffs believe that there are at least 315 individuals who were or continue to be \nsubject to the discriminatory practices alleged herein. Moreover, the number of future \nclass members cannot be discerned with any precision.  \n14. There are questions of law and fact common to the Class, as required by Rule \n23(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The common questions include whether \nthe Defendants’ practices and policies alleged herein violated the Class’ rights under (a) \nthe Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, et seq.; (b) Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and its implementing regulations, 24 C.F.R. § 1, \net seq.; (c) the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nand 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983; (d) the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code Ann. § 8-\n3-200, et seq., and its implementing regulations, Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. 186-2-.02 (1) and \n(2) (1998); and (e) Article I, § 1, Part V of the Constitution of the State of Georgia. \n\nCommon questions also include whether Defendants have established a policy or practice \nof racial segregation of housing at BHA and whether Defendants subjected the Class to \ndifferent terms and conditions in the rental of BHA housing.  \n15. The claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the other members \nof the Class and all members of the Class sustained injuries arising out of Defendants’ \nwrongful conduct complained of herein. See F.R.C.P. 23(a)(3).  \n16. The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nmembers of the Class, as required by Rule 23(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, and are represented by counsel who are qualified, experienced, and able \nvigorously to prosecute this action.  \n17. This class action is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure because Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class by establishing and perpetuating racially segregative policies and \npractices and by treating the Class less favorably than non-minority BHA residents, \nthereby making appropriate final injunctive relief and corresponding declaratory relief \nwith respect to the class as a whole.  \nBACKGROUND AND FACTS  \nEstablishment, Maintenance, and Perpetuation of Racially-Segregated Housing \n18. BHA owns and operates the following five public housing projects: (a) Cedar Hill \nHomes; (b) Willis Cain Homes; (c) Cedar Hill Homes II; (d) Willis Cain Homes II; and \n(e) Baptist Branch Homes.  \n19. Since its establishment, Defendant BHA has racially-segregated its housing projects, \nwith African-American residents concentrated in certain projects and white residents \nconcentrated in others.  \n20. The Board of Directors of Defendant BHA and Defendant Cooper have maintained \nand perpetuated that segregation up to the present and have failed to take appropriate \nmeasures to disestablish that segregation.  \n21. With the exception of Cedar Hill Homes II, which has been reserved almost \nexclusively for whites since it was built, the other four projects operated by BHA are \ncurrently over 90% occupied by African Americans, with few or no white residents.  \n22. BHA has a written policy for admission into its low-income housing that sets forth \nadmission preferences. BHA maintains a waiting list for admission based on the size of \nthe unit and the applicant’s number of preferences. These preferences include, in order of \npriority, whether the applicant is (a) elderly or handicapped, (b) a working family, (c) \nliving in substandard housing, or (d) a resident of Early County for the past twenty-four \nmonths.  \n\n23. During Defendant Cooper’s tenure as Executive Director of BHA, he has placed at \nleast four tenants in Cedar Hill Homes II, all of whom were white.  \n24. In placing at least two of those tenants in Cedar Hill Homes II, Defendant Cooper \nselected white applicants over African-American applicants who were higher on the \nwaiting list and had more preferences.  \n25. Defendants’ segregative practices and polices have continued through the present.  \n26. Defendant City of Blakely is a recipient of federal housing and community \ndevelopment funding and, as such, is required to administer all programs and activities \nrelated to housing and community development in a manner to affirmatively further fair \nhousing, pursuant to § 808 of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3608, and \n24 C.F.R. § 570.601.  \n27. Upon information and belief, Defendant City of Blakely has certified to the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development that it has and will affirmatively further \nfair housing in order to receive federal housing and community development funding.  \n28. During his tenure as Executive Director of BHA, Defendant Cooper has made \nstatements indicating his intention to maintain racial segregation in BHA housing.  \nDifferent Terms and Conditions of Rental Because of Race \n29. Defendants BHA and Cooper implemented a written policy relating to guest \nvisitation. That policy prohibits any activity or conduct that poses a safety or health risk \nand states that non-residents who violate the policy shall be barred from BHA property.  \n30. Defendant Cooper has repeatedly and continually enforced that policy, many times \nimproperly, against the African-American residents of BHA, while not enforcing that \npolicy against white residents.  \n31. Defendant Cooper also had a practice of driving through the areas of the BHA where \nthe residents were predominantly African American and detaining and harassing those \ntenants and their guests, generally without provocation. Defendant Cooper did not engage \nin that same conduct in Cedar Hill Homes II, where the residents are predominantly \nwhite.  \n32. Defendant Cooper routinely threatened African-American residents with eviction, \nboth properly and improperly, and pursued such evictions aggressively. Defendant \nCooper did not, however, treat white tenants similarly.  \n33. Defendant Cooper routinely verbally harassed African-American tenants by directing \nracial epithets and other derogatory terms at them, while not treating white tenants in a \nsimilar manner.  \n\n34. Defendants also cut down all the trees in Cedar Hill Homes, which is predominantly \nAfrican American, while leaving the trees standing in nearby Cedar Hill Homes II, which \nis exclusively white. This had the effect of making Cedar Hill Homes a less desirable \nplace to reside.  \n35. Defendants have also installed outside surveillance video cameras in Cedar Hill \nHomes, which is predominantly African American, while not installing such cameras in \nnearby Cedar Hill Homes II, which is exclusively white. As a result, African-American \ntenants in Cedar Hill feel threatened and intimidated.  \nRetaliatory Conduct \n36. Because of Defendant Cooper’s conduct in harassing African-American tenants and \ntheir guests, by early 1996, the individual plaintiffs had begun forming a tenants’ \nassociation consisting of BHA public housing residents.  \n37. Plaintiff King, with the assistance of the Concerned Citizens Committee, led the \neffort to form the tenants’ association, whose primary purpose was to contest the \ndiscriminatory conduct of Defendant BHA in general and Defendant Cooper in particular.  \n38. On or about May 30, 1996, Plaintiff King attended a meeting of the BHA Board of \nDirectors to request a hearing to introduce the tenants’ association. After this meeting, \nDefendants engaged in numerous acts of retaliation and harassment against members of \nthe tenants’ association, including the individual plaintiffs.  \n39. This retaliatory conduct included sending Plaintiff King an eviction notice the day \nafter she attended the BHA Board of Directors meeting to request a hearing to introduce \nthe tenants’ association.  \n40. Although the eviction proceeding was ultimately settled, Defendant Cooper continued \nhis campaign of harassment against Plaintiff King by, among other things, attempting to \ntransfer Plaintiff King and her three daughters from a four bedroom apartment to a two \nbedroom apartment and increasing her rent more than six fold.  \n41. In late 1997, Plaintiffs King, Mays, and other members of the Class participated in a \npublic demonstration denouncing BHA’s discriminatory practices. Defendant Cooper \nretaliated against Plaintiffs King and Mays for their participation in the demonstration by \nsubjecting them to acts of harassment, which included refusing to accept tendered rent \npayments and instituting eviction proceedings.  \n42. Upon information and belief, Defendants’ retaliatory conduct has continued through \nthe present.  \n \n \n\nFair Housing Investigation \n43. In and around February of 1998, Plaintiffs and other class members filed complaints \nalleging housing discrimination with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq.  \n44. HUD subsequently referred those complaints to the Georgia Commission on Equal \nOpportunity (\"the Commission\"), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3610(f).  \n45. The Commission investigated those complaints and, on June 28, 1998, issued a \nCharge of Discrimination and Summary of Findings. Based on its investigation, the \nCommission found reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice had \noccurred.  \nINJURIES SUFFERED \n46. The discriminatory actions of Defendants described above were intentional, willful, \nand taken in disregard for the rights of the Class.  \n47. As a result of Defendants’ racially discriminatory conduct, class members suffered \ndiscrimination, segregation, separate and unequal living conditions, and humiliation and \nemotional injury incident thereto.  \n48. Moreover, the unlawful conduct of Defendants caused the Concerned Citizens \nCommittee to suffer damages in the form of economic loss, through the expenditure of \nresources to identify and counteract Defendants’ racially discriminatory conduct and \nfrustration of purpose of its mission of promoting non-discrimination.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n49. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-48.  \nTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Federal Fair Housing Act) \n50. As a result of Defendants’ conduct as described herein, Plaintiffs are aggrieved \npersons within the meaning of § 802(i) of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § \n3602(i), and have suffered damages.  \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) \n51. By selecting white applicants over African-American applicants, who were in higher \npositions on the waiting list and who had more preferences in accordance with BHA’s \nown policies, Defendants violated § 804(a) of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3604(a), in that they refused to rent, otherwise made unavailable, or denied \ndwellings on the basis of race.  \n\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(b) \n52. By establishing and maintaining racially-segregated public housing, Defendants have \nviolated § 804(b) of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b), in that they \ndiscriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental of dwellings based on race.  \n53. Defendants have also discriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental of \ndwellings based on race, as well as in the provision of facilities in connection therewith, \nin violation of §804(b) of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (b), by \ntreating African-American tenants less favorably than white tenants. For example, \nDefendants harassed, interrogated, and threatened African-American tenants and their \nguests while not treating white tenants in a similar manner. Defendants also lessened the \nenjoyment of the homes of the tenants in Cedar Hill Homes, which is predominantly \nAfrican American, by cutting down the trees and installing video surveillance cameras, \nwhile not cutting down the trees or installing video surveillance cameras in nearby Cedar \nHill Homes II, which is exclusively white.  \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(c) \n54. By making statements indicating an intent to maintain segregated public housing, \nDefendants violated § 804(c) of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(c), \nin that they made statements indicating a preference, limitation, or discrimination based \non race.  \n42 U.S.C. § 3617 \n55. By engaging in harassing and retaliatory conduct in response to the attempt by certain \nclass members to form a tenants’ association and otherwise to protest the discriminatory \nconduct of Defendants, Defendants violated § 818 of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, \n42 U.S.C. § 3617, in that they intimidated, threatened, or interfered with certain class \nmembers in the exercise or enjoyment of, on account of certain class members having \nexercised or enjoyed, or on account of certain class members aiding or encouraging \nothers in the exercise or enjoyment of, rights granted or protected by § 804 of the \namended Fair Housing Act.  \n42 U.S.C. § 3608 \n56. By establishing, maintaining, and failing to disestablish their segregated public \nhousing, as well as engaging in racially discriminatory housing practices, Defendants \nCity of Blakely and BHA have failed affirmatively to further fair housing, in violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 3608 and 24 C.F.R. § 1, et seq.  \n \n \n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n57. As a recipient of federal financial assistance and by engaging in discriminatory \nconduct against the Class, Defendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq., and its implementing regulations at 24 C.F.R. § 1, et seq.  \nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the  \nUnited States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983 \n58. By engaging in discriminatory conduct, including under color of state law, against the \nClass and individual plaintiffs, Defendants violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983.  \nGa. Code Ann. §§ 8-3-202(a) and 8-3-222 (Georgia Fair Housing Law) \n59. As a result of Defendants’ conduct as described herein, Plaintiffs are aggrieved \npersons within the meaning of the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code Ann. § 8-3-\n201(2), and have suffered damages.  \nGa. Code Ann. § 8-3-202(a)(1) \n60. By selecting white applicants over African-American applicants, who were in higher \npositions on the waiting list and who had more preferences in accordance with BHA’s \nown policies, Defendants violated the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code Ann. § 8-3-\n202(a)(1), in that they refused to rent, otherwise made unavailable, or denied dwellings \non the basis of race.  \nGa. Code Ann. § 8-3-202(a)(2) \n61. By establishing and maintaining racially-segregated public housing, Defendants have \nviolated the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code Ann. § 8-3-202(a)(2), in that they \ndiscriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental of dwellings based on race.  \n62. Defendants have also discriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental of \ndwellings based on race, as well as in the provision of facilities in connection therewith, \nin violation of the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code Ann. § 8-3-202(a)(2), by treating \nAfrican-American tenants less favorably than white tenants. For example, Defendants \nharassed, interrogated, and threatened African-American tenants and their guests while \nnot treating white tenants in a similar manner. Defendants also lessened the enjoyment of \nthe homes of the tenants in Cedar Hill Homes, which is predominantly African American, \nby cutting down the trees and installing video surveillance cameras, while not cutting \ndown the trees or installing video surveillance cameras in nearby Cedar Hill Homes II, \nwhich is exclusively white.  \n \n\nGa. Code Ann. § 8-3-202(a)(3) \n63. By making statements indicating an intent to maintain segregated public housing, \nDefendants violated the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code Ann. § 8-3-202(a)(3), in \nthat they made statements indicating a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on \nrace.  \nGa. Code Ann. § 8-3-222 \n64. By engaging in harassing and retaliatory conduct in response to the attempt by certain \nclass members to form a tenants’ association and otherwise to protest the discriminatory \nconduct of Defendants, Defendants violated the Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga. Code \nAnn. § 8-3-222, in that they intimidated, threatened, or interfered with the individual \nplaintiffs in the exercise or enjoyment of, on account of certain class members having \nexercised or enjoyed, or on account of certain class members aiding or encouraging \nothers in the exercise or enjoyment of, rights granted or protected by the George Fair \nHousing Law, Ga. Code Ann. § 8-3-202(a).  \nArt. 1, §1, Part V of the Constitution of the State of Georgia \n65. By threatening and attempting to evict certain members of the Class, including the \nindividual plaintiffs, assessing fines against them, refusing the tender of rent by them, and \nengaging in other harassing behavior against them, all under color of state law and in \nretaliation for their participation in and efforts to organize a tenants’ association and \notherwise protest Defendants’ discriminatory housing policies and practices, Defendants \nhave violated Art. 1, § 1, Part V of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, in that \nDefendants’ acts were motivated by and in retaliation for and as punishment for the \nindividual plaintiffs’ exercise of rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the \nState of Georgia.  \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court grant the following relief:  \n1. Declare that the discriminatory housing practices and discriminatory retaliatory acts of \nthe Defendants, as set forth above, violate the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 3601, et seq.; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and its \nimplementing regulations at 24 C.F.R. § 1, et seq.; the Thirteenth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983; \nthe Georgia Fair Housing Law, Ga.

This  action  is  brought  by  the  United  States  to  enforce \nthe  Fair  Housing  Act,  Title  VIII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1968, \nas  amended  by  the  Fair  Housing  Amendments  Act  of  1988,  42  U.S.C. \n§§  3601-3619. \n2.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  matter  pursuant  to \n28  U.S.C.  §  1345  and  42  U.S.C.  §  3614. \n3.  Defendants,  the  City  of  Blakely  Housing  Authority \n(\"BHA\"),  the  City  of  Blakely,  Georgia,  and  Dan  Cooper,  in  his \nindividual  and  official  capacity  as  the  Executive  Director  of  the \nBHA,  have  violated  the  rights  of  numerous  African-Americans  and \nengaged  in  a  pattern  or  practice  of  racial  discrimination  by: \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 2 of 11\nrefusing  to  rent  apartments  to African-American  tenants  or \napplicants  at  Cedar  Hill  Homes  II;  subjecting African-American \ntenants  to  different  terms  and  conditions  in  the  rental  of  BHA \napartments;  tolerating and/or  failing  to  protect  African-American \ntenants  from  racial  harassment  and  discrimination;  and  coercing, \nintimidating,  threatening  and/or  interfering with African \nAmerican  tenants  in  the  exercise  or  enjoyment  of  rights  granted \nor  protected by  the  Fair Housing  Act.  The  United  States  seeks \ndeclaratory,  injunctive,  and  monetary  relief. \n4.  Defendant  City of  Blakely Housing  Authority  is  a  public \nbody  corporate  and  politic  created  to  provide  decent,  safe  and \nsanitary dwellings  to  persons  of  low  income.  Ga.  Code  §  8-3-\n3(10).  The  BHA  owns,  operates  and  manages  five  public  housing \ncomplexes,  Cedar  Hill  Homes  I,  Cedar  Hill  Homes  II,  Willis  Cain \nHomes  I,  Willis  Cain  Homes  II  and  Baptist  Branch  Homes.  These \nfive  public  housing  complexes  are  dwellings  within  the  meaning  of \n42  u.s.c.  §  3602 (b). \n5.  Defendant  Dan  Cooper  was  hired  as  Executive  director of \nthe  BHA  on  April  15,  1994,  pursuant  to  a  delegation  of  authority \nfrom  the  Commissioners  of  the  BHA.  Ga.  Code  §  8-3-51(e) \nMr.  Cooper  currently  serves  as  BHA  Executive  Director. \n6.  Defendant  City of  Blakely established  the  BHA  on  May  2, \n1950  by  resolution  of  the  City  council.  The  Mayor  of  the  city of \nBlakely  appoints  Commissioners  of  the  BHA  Ga.  Code  §  9-3-50. \n- 2  -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 3 of 11\nIn  addition,  the  Mayor  may  remove  any  BHA  Commissioner  from \noffice.  Ga.  Code  §  8-3-53.  The  five  public  housing  complexes \nowned  by  the  BHA  are  subject  to  the  planning,  zoning,  sanitary, \nand  building  laws,  ordinances  and  regulations  of  the  City  of \nBlakely.  Ga.  Code§  8-3-7. \n7.  Defendant  City  of  Blakely  has  a  long  history  of  active \ninvolvement  in  the  design,  construction  and  operation  of  BHA \nhousing.  In  1954,  Defendant  City  of  Blakely  and  Defendant  BHA \ndesigned  and  constructed  Cedar  Hill  Homes  I,  with  all  26 \napartments  officially designated  for  white  tenants;  and  Willis \nCain  Homes  I,  with  all  49  apartments  officially designated  for \n\"Negro\"  tenants.  In  1964,  the  Cedar  Hill  Homes  II  complex  was \nbuilt  adjacent  to  Cedar  Hill  Homes  I,  with  all  14  apartments \nofficially designated  for  white  tenants;  and  the  Willis  Cain \nHomes  II  complex  was  built  adjacent  to  Willis  Cain  Homes  I,  with \nall  10  units  officially designated  for  \"Negro\"  tenants. \n8.  Defendant  City  of  Blakely  and  Defendant  BHA \nintentionally  established  a  racially  segregated  dual  system  of \npublic  housing.  In  support  of  this  racially  segregated  dual \nsystem  of  public  housing,  Defendant  City  of  Blakely  and  Defendant \nBHA  located  the  Willis  Cain  Homes  adjacent  to  the  \"Negro\"  high \nschool  and  residential  area,  thereby  increasing  the  concentration \nof  minorities  and  furthering  racial  isolation  and  segregation. \n9.  In  1981,  Baptist  Branch  Homes  were  constructed,  with  50 \n- 3  -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 4 of 11\nunits  unrestricted  by  race.  In  the  early  1980s,  Defendants  began \nplacing  African-American  tenants  in  Cedar  Hill  Homes  I,  but \ncontinued  to  refuse  to  rent  apartments  in  Cedar  Hill  Homes  II  to \nAfrican-American  tenants. \n10.  After  Defendant  Cooper  was  hired  as  BHA  Executive \nDirector  in  1994,  he  continued  to  implement  Defendants' \ndiscriminatory  policies  by  refusing  to  rent  vacant  apartments  in \nCedar  Hill  Homes  II  to  eligible African-American  applicants  on \nthe  BHA  waiting  list and  by  holding  those  apartments  vacant  until \nsuitable  white  applicants  could  be  located. \n11.  Defendant  Cooper's  methods  of  implementing  Defendants' \ndiscriminatory  policies  included,  but  were  not  limited  to: \n(a)  skipping  white  applicants  over  black  applicants  - who \nhad  higher  positions  on  the  BHA  waiting  list  - so  that \nwhite  applicants  could  be  placed  in  vacant  Cedar  Hill \nHomes  II  apartments; \n(b)  placing  white  applicants  ln  Cedar  Hill  Homes  II \napartments  without  verifying  their  application \ninformation  and  refusing  to  place  African-American \napplicants  in  Cedar  Hill  Homes  II  apartments,  even  if \nthey  were  entitled to  waiting  list preferences;  and \n(c)  placing  and  maintaining  single  white  tenants  in  two \nbedroom  Cedar  Hill  Homes  II  apartments  and  thereby \nmaking  those  two-bedroom  apartments  unavailable  to \n- 4  -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 5 of 11\nAfrican-American  families  on  the  BHA  waiting  list,  in \nviolation  of  the  BHA  Admissions  and  Continued  Occupancy \nPolicy  (June  27,  1996),  which  states  that  single \ntenants  must  occupy  studio  or  one-bedroom  apartments. \n12.  Since  Defendant  Cooper  was  hired  as  BHA  Executive \nDirector,  African-American  tenants  have  been  subjected  to  racial \nharassment  and  discrimination,  including  but  not  limited  to \nDefendant  Cooper's  actions  of:  using  racial  slurs  and  derogatory \nterms  when  speaking  of  African-American  applicants  and  tenants; \nwalking  through  the  predominantly  African-American  housing \ncomplexes  wearing  fatigues  and  armed  with  a  gun;  stopping  and \nsearching  African-American  tenants  without  cause;  and,  at  various \ntimes,  requiring  African-American  tenants  to  remain  inside  their \napartments  and  out  of  BHA  common  areas  and  meeting  rooms. \n13.  Beginning  shortly  after  Mr.  Cooper  arrived,  numerous \nAfrican-American  tenants  have  complained  of  racial  harassment  and \ndiscrimination  to  Defendant  Cooper,  Defendant  BHA  and  Defendant \nCity  of  Blakely.  Defendants  have  failed  or  refused  to  take \nadequate  action  to  prevent,  stop  or  correct  the  racial  harassment \nand  discrimination  suffered by  African-American  tenants. \n14.  African-American  tenants  who  complained  of  racial \nharassment  and  discrimination  have  been  subjected  to  coercion, \nintimidation  and/or  retaliation,  including  but  not  limited  to \nDefendant  Cooper's  and  other  BHA  employees'  actions  of:  refusing \n- 5  -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 6 of 11\nto  allow  African-American  tenants  to  use  BHA  meeting  rooms  or \nrecognize  their  tenants'  council;  having  the  police  detain \nAfrican-American  tenants  or  otherwise  disrupt  their meetings; \nimproperly  increasing  African-American  tenants'  rental  rates  or \ntransferring  them  to  smaller  apartments;  and  threatening  African \nAmerican  tenants  with  eviction  and  initiating  unwarranted \neviction  actions. \n15.  Defendant  BHA  and  Defendant  City  of  Blakely  have  failed \nto  take  effective  steps  to:  alert  Defendant  Cooper  and  other  BHA \nemployees  that  racial  harassment,  discrimination  and/or \nretaliation  would  not  be  tolerated  on  BHA  property;  take \nappropriate  action  against  Defendant  Cooper  and  other  BHA \nemployees  who  engaged  in  racial  harassment,  discrimination  and/or \nretaliation;  inform  tenants  of  the  procedures  for  reporting \nracial  harassment,  discrimination  and/or  retaliation;  or  train \nDefendant  Cooper  and  other  BHA  employees  in  procedures  to \nprevent,  stop  and  correct  racial  harassment,  discrimination  and \nretaliation. \n16.  As  set  forth  above,  Defendants'  statements,  actions, \nand  failures  to  act,  including  the  maintenance  of  policies \nintended  to  discriminate  against  African-Americans,  constitute: \n(a)  A  pattern  or  practice  of  resistance  to  the  full \nenjoyment  of  rights  granted  by  the  Fair  Housing \nAct,  42  U.S.C.  §§  3601-3619;  and \n- 6  -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 7 of 11\n(b)  A  denial  to  a  group  of  persons  of  rights  granted \nby  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§  3601-3619, \nwhich  raises  an  issue  of  general  public \nimportance. \n17.  Defendants,  by  their  statements,  actions,  and  failure \nto  act,  as  set  forth  above,  have: \n(a)  Refused  to  rent,  refused  to  negotiate  for  the  rental \nof,  or  otherwise  made  unavailable,  dwellings  because  of \nrace  or  color,  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §  3604(a); \n(b)  Discriminated  in  the  terms,  conditions  or  privileges  of \nthe  rental  of  a  dwelling,  or  in  the  provision  of \nservices  or  facilities  in  connection  therewith,  because \nof  race  or  color,  ln  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §  3604(b); \n(c)  Made  statements  with  respect  to  the  rental  of  dwellings \nthat  indicate  a  preference,  limitation,  or \ndiscrimination  based  on  race  or  color,  or  an  intention \nto  make  such  preference,  limitation,  or  discrimination, \nin  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §  3604(c);  and \n(d)  Coerced,  intimidated,  threatened  or  interfered with \npersons  in  the  exercise  or  enjoyment  of,  or  on  account \nof  their  having  exercised  or  enjoyed,  their  rights \nunder  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C. \n§  3617. \n18.  Persons  who  have  been  the  victims  of  Defendants'  racial \n- 7  -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 8 of 11\nharassment,  discrimination  and/or  retaliation  are  aggrieved \npersons,  as  defined  by  42  U.S.C.  §  3602(i),  and  have  suffered \nharm  and  incurred  damages  as  a  result  of  Defendants' \ndiscriminatory  housing  practices. \n19.  Defendants'  discriminatory  actions  were  intentional, \nwillful  and/or  taken  in  disregard  for  the  rights  of  those \nAfrican-American  applicants  and  tenants  who  were  subjected  to \nDefendants'  discriminatory  housing  practices. \nWHEREFORE,  the  United  States  prays  for  an  Order  from  this \nCourt  that: \n1.  Declares  that  the  discriminatory  housing  practices  of \nDefendants,  as  set  forth  above,  violate  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  as \namended,  42  U.S.C.  §§  3601-3619; \n2.  Enjoins  Defendants,  their  agents,  employees  and \nsuccessors,  and  all  other  persons  in  active  concert  or \nparticipation  with  them  or  any  of  them,  from: \n(a)  Refusing  to  negotiate  for  the  rental  of,  or  otherwise \nmaking  unavailable  or  denying,  a  dwelling  to  any  person \nbecause  of  race  or  color; \n(b)  Discriminating  against  any  person  in  the  terms, \nconditions  or  privileges  of  rental  of  a  dwelling \nbecause  of  race  or  color; \n(c)  Making  statements  with  respect  to  the  rental  of \ndwellings  that  indicate  a  preference,  limitation,  or \n- 8  -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00087-WLS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/02   Page 9 of 11\ndiscrimination  based  on  race  or  color,  or  an  intention \nto  make  such  preference;  and \n(d)  Coercing,  intimidating,  threatening,  or  interfering \nwith  any  person,  in  the  exercise  or  enjoyment  of  any \nright  granted  or  protected  by  the  Fair  Housing  Act; \n3.
